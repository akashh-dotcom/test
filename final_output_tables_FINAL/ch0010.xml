      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>The increasing availability and capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to  improve medical diagnosis and prognosis has dramatically increased the number of MRI  procedures performed worldwide. Thus, many more first-time and repeat patients are un- dergoing these MRI examinations for an ever-widening spectrum of medical indications.  Notably, increasing proportions of these procedures are performed on patients suffering  from unstable medical and psychological illnesses. For many of the millions of patients  who undergo MRI examinations every year, the experience may cause great emotional dis- tress. The referring physicians, radiologists, and technologists are best prepared to manage  affected patients if they understand the etiology of the problem and know the appropriate  maneuver or intervention to implement for treatment of the condition (1).</para>
      <para>This chapter discusses the prevalence of claustrophobia in association with the use of  MRI, how emotional distress affects outcomes for the MRI procedure, factors contributing  to patient distress, and techniques to help minimize anxiety and distress in patients with  claustrophobia while undergoing MR imaging. Recent investigations involving emerging  MRI applications are also taken into consideration.</para>

      <title>INCIDENCE OF DISTRESS IN THE MRI ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <para>Psychological distress in the MRI environment includes all subjectively unpleasant ex- periences that are directly attributable to MRI. Distress for the patient undergoing an MRI  procedure can range from mild anxiety that can be managed simply with minimal reassur- ance to a full-blown panic attack that requires psychiatric intervention. Severe psychological</para>
      <para>distress reactions to MRI examinations, namely severe anxiety and panic attacks, are typi- cally characterized by the rapid onset of at least four of the following clinical signs: fear of  losing control or dying, nausea, paresthesias, palpitations, chest pain, faintness, dyspnea,  feeling of choking, sweating, trembling, vertigo, or depersonalization (2).</para>
      <para>Many symptoms of panic attack mimic over activity of the sympathetic nervous system  (3), prompting concern that catecholamine responses may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias  and/or ischemia in susceptible patients during the MRI examination (4). However, this has  not been reported in a clinical MRI setting or any other similar situation. Nevertheless, it is  advisable that, in a medically unstable patient, the use of physiologic monitoring be a routine  component of the MRI examination. Pre-emptive efforts to minimize patient distress are  the most important factors in preventing or containing a panic attack in susceptible patients.</para>
      <para>In the mildest form, distress is the normal amount of anxiety any reasonable person will  experience when undergoing a diagnostic procedure. Moderate distress severe enough to  be described as a dysphoric psychological reaction has been reported by as many as 65%  of the patients examined by MRI (5-8). The most severe forms of psychological distress  described by patients are claustrophobia, panic attacks, and anxiety (3, 5-12), the latter of  which occurs in moderate to severe forms in up to 37% of patients undergoing MRI (13,  14).</para>
      <para>Claustrophobia is a disorder characterized by the marked, persistent and excessive fear  of enclosed spaces (2). In such affected individuals, exposure to enclosed spaces such as  the MR system, but no other situations or stimuli, almost invariably provokes an immediate  anxiety response that in its most extreme form is indistinguishable from a panic attack as  described above.</para>
      <para>The reported incidence of distress in the MRI setting is highly variable across studies  in part reflecting differences in outcome measures used to characterize distress. Some stud- ies indicated that as many as 20% of individuals attempting to undergo MRI can’t complete  it secondary to serious distress such as claustrophobia or other similar sensation (15, 16).  In contrast, others have reported that as few as 0.7% of individuals have incomplete or failed  MRI examinations due to distress (8, 17). In a study of over 55,000 patients undergoing  MRI, claustrophobia was present in 1.8% of cases, and a review of previous literature in- dicated that 2.3% of patients experienced claustrophobia requiring sedation or termination  of the procedure (18). A reasonable estimate of the number of patients that experience dis- tress that compromises either their own well-being or the diagnostic utility MRI is 3 to 5%  of all studies. For patients with pre-existing anxiety or claustrophobia, however, the termi- nation rate can be as high as 39% (19, 20).</para>
      <para>Notably, there are no perfect predictors of distress in the MRI environment. In fact, dif- ferent studies cite opposing results such as which gender has greater difficulty tolerating  MRI (17, 18, 21). A cohort study of over 55,000 patients in an outpatient setting in Germany  reported that females (2.3%) had a significantly higher rate of claustrophobia than males  (1.3%) (18). This is in contrast to an earlier study conducted in Malaysia where the rate of  MRI termination was found to be 0.54%, and of those, 67% of the patients who terminated  their scans were male (17). Obviously, these differences may reflect cultural, socioeconomic  or other influences.</para>

      <title>THE IMPACT OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS IN THE MRI ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <para>Patient distress can contribute to adverse outcomes for the MRI procedure. These ad- verse outcomes include unintentional exacerbation of patient distress, a compromise in the  diagnostic power of the MRI examination due to poor image quality, and decreased effi- ciency of the imaging facility due to delayed, cancelled or prematurely terminated studies.  Patient compliance during MRI, such as the ability to remain in the MR system and hold  still long enough to complete the study is of paramount importance to achieving a high  quality, diagnostic examination.</para>
      <para>If a good quality study can’t be obtained, the patient may require an invasive diagnostic  examination in place of the safer, less painful and risky MRI exam. Thus, for the distressed  patient unable to undergo MRI, there are potential clinical, medico-legal, and economic re- lated considerations implications.</para>
      <para>Patient distress due to MRI may also impact regional brain activity as indicated by func- tional neuroimaging measurements.  Elevated endocrine levels have been observed in as- sociation with scanning procedures compared to baseline, particularly in stress hormones  such as cortisol (22-24). Studies have indicated that elevated salivary cortisol levels are as- sociated with MRI examinations in both adolescents and healthy adults (23, 24). In contrast,  Muehlhan, et al. (25) found changes in salivary alpha amylase but not in cortisol prior to  MRI. This evidence, while inconclusive, points towards increased activity in the hypothal- amic-pituitary-adrenal and the sympatho-adrenal-medullary axes which are, in turn, asso- ciated with regionally specific neural activation and deactivation (26, 27). Fluctuating  endocrine levels have been implicated in the modulation of regional brain activity, a sug- gestion that has broad implications for interpreting functional neuroimaging results. Func- tional MRI (fMRI) is at the forefront of neuroimaging research. Because fMRI is  increasingly introduced into clinical practice a variety of critical applications the effects of  hormone levels on brain activity related to anxiety and emotional distress could impact this  procedure.</para>
      <para>Increasing pressure to use scanner time efficiently to cover the costs of this expensive  diagnostic imaging equipment puts greater stress on both staff members and patients. The  ability of referring physicians, radiologists, and MRI technologists to detect patient distress  at the earliest possible time, to discover the source of the distress, and then provide appro- priate intervention can greatly improve patient comfort, the quality of the imaging studies,  and the efficiency of the MRI facility (1).</para>
      <para>Motion artifact disrupting image quality is frequently the result of patient distress. That  is, the distressed patient becomes agitated and finds it difficult to remain motionless during  MRI. Obviously, motion artifacts can compromise the diagnostic power of an MRI exam.  One investigation in 297 first-time outpatients undergoing MRI indicated that approximately  13% of the MRI studies showed motion artifacts (i.e., unrelated to normal body pulsations)  and about half of these impaired the diagnostic quality of the examination (8). Subsequent  studies have confirmed these estimates (20, 28). One of these investigations reported an  even higher proportion of scans with motion artifacts (18%) in a sample of patients with  pre-existing anxiety conditions and non-anxious controls (20).</para>
      <para>Excessive anxiety with accompanying tremors, trembling, jaw clenching and other re- lated body movements have been presumed to contribute to motion artifacts in MR images.  Dantendorfer, et al. (8) attempted to investigate this directly and found that, while specific  measures of anxiety do not predict motion artifacts, reported concerns about the scanner  did predict motion artifacts. Tournquist, et al. (28) designed an experiment to test whether  increased awareness about the procedure prior to initiating the scan would reduce motion  related artifacts. The investigators found nearly a three-fold reduction in the number of  scans with artifacts in the intervention group (4%) compared to the control condition  (15.4%). The patients in the intervention group received additional written information that  included details about what the procedure would entail, as well as sensory and temporal in- formation related to the procedure (28). These results support the interpretation that adequate  patient education about the MRI procedure is one of the most important aspects of mini- mizing distress and the associated adverse outcomes.</para>
      <para>The emotional distress that comes with claustrophobia and anxiety may lead to a com- promise in MR image quality due to motion artifacts related to the patient’s inability to re- main motionless. While this is undoubtedly crucial to achieving a diagnostically acceptable  examination, Klaming L, et al. (66) reported that there was little evidence to support the  assumption that anxiety increases patient motion and decreases image quality during MRI.  However, the evidence supporting the benefits of patient education prior to MRI still remains  relevant and critical to ensuring the best possible outcomes in patients with claustrophobia,  anxiety, and emotional distress.</para>

      <title>FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO DISTRESS IN THE MRI   ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <para>Many factors contribute to distress experienced by certain patients undergoing MRI.  Most commonly cited are concerns about the physical environment of the scanner. Also  well documented are the anxieties associated with the underlying medical problem neces- sitating the MRI exam Notably, certain individuals, such as those with psychiatric illnesses,  may be predisposed to suffer greater distress related to the MRI procedure.</para>
      <para>The physical environment of the scanner is clearly one important source of distress to  patients. Sensations of apprehension, tension, worry, claustrophobia, anxiety, fear, and even  panic attacks have been directly attributed to the confining dimensions of the interior of the  MR system. For example, for certain types of scanners, the patient’s face may be three to  ten inches from the inner portion of the scanner, prompting feelings of uncontrolled con- finement and detachment (3, 5-12, 15, 16, 29-34). In one study, confinement was reported  by 22.9% of patients as the most unpleasant feature of the MRI experience (34). This factor,  combined with other physical aspects of the MRI environment may contribute to the high  levels of distress observed in patients undergoing MRI.</para>
      <para>Similar distressing sensations have been attributed to the other aspects of the MRI set- ting including the prolonged duration of the MRI examination, the gradient magnetic field- induced acoustic noise, the temperature and humidity within the MR system, and the distress  related to the restriction of movement (3-12, 15, 16, 29-33, 35, 36). Other studies have re- ported stress related to the administration of an intravenous MRI contrast agent (3, 5-7, 9-</para>
      <para>12, 15, 16, 29-33, 35-37). Additionally, the scanner may produce feelings of sensory dep- rivation, restriction, and suffocation, which are also known to be precursors of severe anxiety  states (10, 38).  Investigations have indicated that phobias related to specific aspects of the  MRI environment can predict claustrophobic fears and psychological outcomes in the scan- ner (14, 34, 39, 40). Using pre-scan questionnaires, clinicians may be able to identify pa- tients who are at risk for terminating the scan due to claustrophobia (20, 34, 39, 40).</para>
      <para>One of the more overwhelming features of the MRI procedure is the acoustic noise gen- erated by the MR system. Gradient magnetic field-induced noise may be sufficiently intense  to cause transient hearing threshold shifts in as many as 43% of patients undergoing MRI  (41). Obviously, acoustic noise in and of itself can be a source of stress and, thus, particularly  troublesome to certain patients in association with MRI. In one study, noise alone was con- sidered the most unpleasant feature of MRI by 19.5% of patients (34). This information  suggests that the noise reduction achieved in the new generation of scanners may be an im- portant factor in reducing distress. The use of newer scanners demonstrated up to a 97%  reduction in acoustic noise compared to older scanners. Dewey, et al. (18) observed a three- fold reduction in reports of claustrophobia using the newer short- and wide-bore scanners  that have noise emission levels below 99-dB compared to conventional, older scanners.</para>
      <para>MR systems that have an architecture that utilizes a vertical magnetic field offer a more  open design that is presumed to reduce the frequency of distress associated with MRI. The  latest versions of these so-called “open” scanners, despite having static magnetic field  strengths of 0.35-Tesla or lower have improved technology (i.e., faster gradient fields, op- timized surface coils, etc.) that permit acceptable image quality for virtually all types of  standard, diagnostic imaging procedures. Also, the latest generation of high-field-strength  (1.5-Tesla and 3-Tesla) MR systems have shorter and wider bore configurations such that  these newer scanners tend to be more acceptable to patients with feelings of distress related  to close confinement.</para>
      <para>After the release of the first commercially available open MR systems, Datendorfer, et  al. (8) designed a study to compare an open system to a standard scanner. This report indi- cated that there was no difference between a conventional 1.5-T MR system (Siemens Mag- netom SP-65, Siemens Medical Solutions) and a more open 0.5-Tesla scanner (Philips  Gyroscan P-5, Philips Medical Systems) with regard to the incidence of adverse reactions  (i.e., pre- or post-scan anxiety, claustrophobia, motion artifacts, or aborted exams).</para>
      <para>MRI scanner design has been postulated to be a key factor that contributes to patient  distress, and it’s known that “open” configured scanners with shorter and wider bore con- figurations have increased examination success rate. However, Enders, et al. (19) reported  that there wasn’t a substantial difference in claustrophobia experienced by patients under- going MRI in an open versus a short-bore MR system. A subsequent study by Enders, et al.  (75), further examined the use of a high-field open scanner (1.0-Tesla) and a short-bore,  high field MR system (1.5-T) used for MRI of the spine. In this randomized controlled com- parison of spinal MR imaging with an open versus a short-bore scanner, short-bore MR im- aging revealed considerably higher image quality with shorter scanning times. Interestingly,  patients reported claustrophobia in both types of MR scanners.</para>
      <para>In contrast to the aforementioned investigations, two non-randomized studies of claus- trophobic patients demonstrated a decreased rate of claustrophobic events in open MR sys- tems compared to closed scanners (42, 43). Decreases of similar magnitude have been  observed in newer generations of short- and wide-bore scanners compared to conventional  MR systems (44). In one study of claustrophobic patients who previously failed completing  an MRI procedure, Hunt, et al. (44) observed an 89% success rate for patients scanned in a  short- and wide-bore 1.5-Tesla MR system compared to their previously unsuccessful pro- cedure in a conventional 1.5-Tesla scanner.</para>
      <para>In another study, Dewey, et al. (18) compared the rate of claustrophobia between short-  and wide-bore configured 1.5-Tesla MR systems (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical So- lutions) and conventional 1.0-Tesla scanners (Magnetom Impact Expert Plus, Siemens Med- ical Solutions) in an outpatient setting. Data from this study collected over the course of  eight years demonstrated significantly lower rates of claustrophobic reactions among pa- tients scanned on newer 1.5-Tesla scanners (0.7%) compared to conventional 1.0-Tesla MR  systems (2.1%) (18). Considered together, these data suggest that although the patient-cen- tered design of MR scanners has evolved in the past 20 or so years, even the most state-of- the-art systems do not prevent claustrophobia, indicating that there are other factors besides  the physical aspects of the MR system that are related to claustrophobic events.</para>
      <para>In the early 1990s, a specially-designed, low-field-strength (0.2-Tesla) MR system (Ar- toscan, Lunar Corporation/General Electric Medical Systems and Esaote) first became com- mercially available for MR imaging of extremities. The use of dedicated extremity scanners  such as these provides an accurate, reliable, and relatively inexpensive means (i.e., in com- parison to the use of a whole-body MR system) of evaluating various types of musculoskele- tal abnormalities.  Therefore, utilization of the extremity scanner to assess musculoskeletal  pathology is a viable and acceptable alternative to the use of whole-body scanners (45).   This is particularly the case since the image quality and diagnostic capabilities for the eval- uation of the knee and other extremities has been reported to be comparable to mid- or high- field strength MR systems for certain musculoskeletal applications (45).</para>
      <para>The architecture of the extremity MR system has no confining features or other aspects  that would typically create patient-related problems. This is because only the body part that  requires imaging is placed inside the magnet bore during the MR examination. One study  reported that 100% of the MRI examinations that were initiated were completed without  being interrupted or cancelled for patient-related problems (Shellock FG, Unpublished Data,  2011). The unique design of the extremity scanner likely contributed to the totally successful  completion of MRI examinations in the patients of this study. Furthermore, these findings  represent a dramatic improvement compared with the published incidence of patient distress  that tends to interrupt or prevent the completion of MRI examinations using whole-body  MR systems.</para>
      <para>Currently, there are no reports available on the topic of “upright” or “standing” MR  systems and patients with claustrophobia. Anecdotally, the ability to stand or sit for the MRI  exam and, thus, avoid having the scanner in close proximity to the face often proves helpful  for individuals who may otherwise experience claustrophobia (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 1a</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">1b</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>Adverse psychological reactions are sometimes associated with MRI simply because  the examination may be perceived by the patient as a “dramatic” medical test that has an  associated uncertainty of outcome, such that there may be a fear of the presence of disease  or other abnormality (5, 10). In fact, any type of diagnostic imaging procedure may produce  a certain amount of anxiety for the patient (30). For example, Thorp, et al. (16) found that,  with the exception of the MR system environment issue (i.e., the confined space), patients  undergoing computed tomography compared to those undergoing MRI had similar feelings  that the procedure was unpleasant. Patients finding the experience difficult tended to be  those with high initial levels of anxiety, little experience with diagnostic procedures, and  those that believed they had cancer (16). This study underscores the need for direct profes- sional interaction to prepare and educate the patient prior to any form of diagnostic imaging  examination. Improved patient compliance was reported in a study that investigated the im- pact of more detailed patient education on adverse outcomes from MR mammography, a  procedure known to have an atypically high rate of noncompliance (46). Likewise, in a  study designed to test the noncompliance rate before and after hospital radiology staff were  trained in nonpharmacological analgesia, one multi-site practice observed a significant de- crease in noncompliance rates during the period of time following the training. This partic- ular training program involved two components: advanced rapport training and self-hypnotic  relaxation, both highlighting the importance of individualized care and interpersonal inter- actions in patient care (47).</para>

      <para>Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders may be at greater risk for experiencing  distress in the MRI environment. One problem that arises more often in this population is  the refusal of the prescribed MRI exam by the patient. Frequently, the cause for refusal is  an inadequate understanding of why the procedure was ordered and what the actual proce- dure involves.</para>
      <para>For patients with pre-existing anxiety disorders who agree to undergo MRI, it is prudent  for hospital radiology staff to use augmented methods to minimize additional anxiety or  distress. Grey, et al. (48) reported the efficacy of an anxiety reduction protocol in patients  with moderate to high trait anxiety. Prior to MRI, patients in the intervention group were  given detailed information regarding scanning procedures including descriptions of the  acoustic noise, equipment and the procedure room, the timing of scans and degree of inter- action with the MRI technologist, as well as coping strategies for anxiety in the scanner  such as increasing the audio volume and paying attention to a clock on the wall. Patients in  the intervention group were significantly less anxious during the procedure and retrospec- tively when asked about the whole procedure compared to those patients in the control con- dition, indicating that the extra time and effort spent preparing the patients in the intervention  group made a positive impact on patients with pre-existing anxiety (48).</para>
      <para>In a small study of older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) the rate of un- successful MRI examinations in patients with pre-existing anxiety was assessed and com- pared to a control group. In this study, an unsuccessful scan was defined as one in which  there was excessive movement or premature termination of the scan. There was no signif- icant difference in the rate of successful MRI outcome in this group of GAD patients and  non-anxious controls (20). To date, this study is the only report of the differential frequency  of distress or adverse outcomes for MRI exams in such patients compared to non-psychi- atrically impaired patients. Although these findings fail to find a difference between cohorts,  future studies are still warranted and specific inquiry should be made to identify patients  with pre-existing anxiety disorders including claustrophobia, generalized anxiety disorder,  post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in order to increase anx- iety minimizing efforts in these patients.</para>
      <para>Patients with other psychiatric illnesses such as depression and any illness complicated  by thought disorder such as schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder may also be at  increased risk for distress in the MRI environment. Patients with psychiatric illnesses may,  under normal circumstances, be able to tolerate the MRI setting without a problem, as is  clear from the thousands who participate in clinical neuroimaging research studies each  year (49). However, the increased stress due to their medical illness or fear of medical illness  may exacerbate their psychiatric symptoms to such an extent that they may have difficulty  complying with MRI procedures. At the very least, patients with psychiatric illnesses may  require more time and patience to provide the appropriate level of preparatory information.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">TECHNIQUES TO MINIMIZE PATIENT DISTRESS IN THE MRI  </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">ENVIRONMENT </emphasis></para>
      <para>There are procedures that may be used to minimize subjective distress for patients un- dergoing MRI. Certain measures to alleviate distress should be employed for all MRI ex-</para>
      <para>aminations. A number of other measures will be required if the patient is experiencing sig- nificant distress due to factors as described above. Finally, other distress-alleviation tech- niques will only be necessary for patients with co-existing psychiatric illness or other special  problems. Coordination of these efforts among the referring physician, the radiologist, the  MRI technologist and the facility support staff is crucial. Most of these methods have been  described in the peer-reviewed literature and are summarized in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> (3-5, 7, 9, 11, 12,  21, 33, 35, 36, 46, 50-54, 67, 69, 72).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">For All Patients Undergoing MRI Procedures </emphasis></para>
      <para>Referring clinicians should take the time to explain the rationale for the MRI examina- tion and what he/she expects to learn from the results with respect to the implications for  treatment and prognosis. Importantly, the clinician should schedule time with the patient to  communicate the results of the MRI procedure.</para>
      <para>The single most important step is to educate the patient about the specific aspects of  the MRI examination that are known to be particularly difficult. This includes conveying  in terms that are understandable to the patient the internal dimensions of the MR system,  the level of gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise to expect, and the estimated time  duration of the examination.</para>
      <para>Studies have documented a decrease in the incidence of premature termination of MRI   when patients are provided with more detailed information regarding the examination (46- 48, 67, 68, 72). This may be effectively accomplished by means of providing the patient  time to view an educational videotape or written brochure supplemented by a question and</para>
      <para>(1) Prepare and educate the patient concerning specific aspects of the MRI exam (e.g., MR system dimen- sions, gradient noise, intercom system, etc.).   (2) Allow an appropriately-screened relative or friend to remain with the patient during the MRI procedure.   (3) Maintain physical or verbal contact with the patient during the MRI exam.  (4) Use MR Conditional headphones to provide music to the patient and to minimize gradient magnetic field- induced noise.  (5) Use an MR Conditional video monitor to provide a visual distraction to the patient.  (6) Place the patient in a prone position inside the scanner.   (7) Position the patient feet-first instead of head-first into the MR system.  (8) Use special mirrors or prism glasses for the patient.  (9) Use a blindfold so that the patient is not aware of the close surroundings.  (10) Use bright lights inside and at either end of the scanner.  (11) Use a fan inside of the MR system to provide adequate air movement.   (12) Use lemon or vanilla scented oil or other similar aromatherapy so that the patient can comfortably expe- rience olfactory stimulation.  (13) Use relaxation techniques such as controlled breathing or mental imagery.  (14) Use systematic desensitization.  (15) Use medical hypnosis.  (16) Use a sedative or other similar medication.  (17) Use foot massage or touch therapy.  (18) Use a virtual reality system to provide audio and visual distraction for the patient.

(72) also supports the use of information and communication as a method  for preventing and reducing anxiety in patients, encouraging the continued use of this  method by radiology technologists.</para>
      <para>Some authors have proposed adding a pre-scan “fear assessment” to help predict pa- tients who will experience psychological problems related to MRI (15, 20, 29, 30, 34, 39,  40). Such a brief questionnaire could be used to help elicit questions and concerns from pa- tients and to provide guidance to staff about which distress minimization strategies are most  likely to be effective for the patient.</para>
      <para>One study on anxiety and MRI exams conducted by Van Minde, et al. (76) specifically  looked at patients who were highly anxious before MRI. The study measured stress and  anxiety throughout the exam by monitoring the patient’s heart rate. The data showed that  patient anxiety levels were highest at the very beginning of the procedure, particularly when  the MRI table was moving into the scanner. However, anxiety and stress decreased over  the course of the examination. This information not only proves helpful to radiology pro- fessionals working with patients but may also aid in the development of more effective anx- iety-reduction strategies in the future.</para>
      <para>Upon entering the MRI facility, patients who are treated with respect and are welcomed  into a calm environment will report less distress. Many details of patient positioning in the  MR system can increase comfort and minimize distress. Taking time to ensure comfortable  positioning with adequate padding and blankets to alleviate undue discomfort or pain from  positioning is also important. Adequate hearing protection should be provided routinely to  decrease acoustic noise generated by the MR system. Demonstration of the two-way inter- com system to reassure to patients that the MRI staff members can hear them when they  speak and can speak to them during the examination can also be reassuring.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">For Mildly to Moderately Distressed Patients </emphasis></para>
      <para>If a patient that continues to experience distress after the afore-mentioned measures are  implemented, additional interventions are required. Frequently, all that is necessary to suc- cessfully complete an MRI examination is to allow an appropriately-screened relative or  friend to remain with the patient during the procedure. A familiar person in the MR system  room often helps the patient who is anxious to develop an increased sense of security (12,  35). If a supportive companion is not present, then simply having an MRI staff member  maintain verbal contact via the intercom system or physical contact by having a staff person  remain in the MR system room with the patient during the examination will frequently de- crease psychological distress (7, 12, 35).</para>
      <para>Placing the patient in a prone position inside the MR system so that the patient can vi- sualize the opening of the bore provides a sensation of being inside a device that is more  spacious and alleviates the “closed-in” feeling associated with the supine position (35, 55,  67). Prone positioning of the patient may not be a practical alternative if MRI requires the  use of certain types of radiofrequency (RF) coils or if the patient has underlying medical  conditions (e.g., shortness of breath, the presence of chest tubes, etc.) that preclude lying in</para>
      <para>this position. Another method of positioning the patient that may help is to place the indi- vidual feet-first instead of head-first into the scanner.</para>
      <para>An MR system, head-coil mounted mirror (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>) or prism glasses (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>) can  be used to permit the patient to maintain a vertical view of the outside of the scanner in  order to minimize claustrophobic responses. Using a blindfold so that the patient is not  aware of the close surroundings has also been suggested to be an effective technique for  enabling anxious patients to successfully undergo MRI (12, 35).</para>
      <para>The internal environment of the MR system may be changed to optimize the manage- ment of apprehensive patients (12). For example, the presence of higher lighting levels tends  to make most individuals feel less anxious. Therefore, the use of bright lights at either end  and inside of the MR system can produce a less imposing environment for the patient. In  addition, using a fan inside of the scanner to provide more air movement will help reduce  the sensation of confinement and lessen any tissue heating that may result when high levels  of RF power absorption are used for MRI (12). Some MRI staff members have reported  that placing a cotton pad moistened with a few drops of lemon, vanilla, cucumber oil or  other similar form of aromatherapy in the MR system for the patient to receive olfactory  stimulation can also reduce distress. Reports by Munn, et al. (67, 68) found that cognitive  behavioral strategies, MRI design features, team training, fragrance administration, infor- mation, and prone positioning all have a positive impact on outcomes in reducing fear, anx- iety, and claustrophobia. Not only do these measures increase patient comfort, but they also  reduce the need for sedation.</para>

      <para>Audio devices that transmit music and/or provide audio communication through head- phones have been developed specifically for use with MR systems (51, 52, 56, 57). These  MR Conditional music/audio systems may be acquired from commercial vendors. This  equipment can be used to provide calming music to the patient and, with the proper design,  help to minimize exposure to gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>).  Reports have indicated that the use of these devices has been successful in reducing symp- toms of anxiety in patients during MRI (52, 56, 58). Furthermore, one study suggested that  having a live musician play music that matches the rhythm of the gradient magnetic fields  improves patient perceptions of the MRI examination (58). This improved perception may  also be due in part to the perceived increase in the social interaction that the patient has  during MRI. Obviously, that particular means of helping an anxious patient to get through  a clinical MRI exam tends to be impractical.</para>
      <para>Another technique investigated for reducing anxiety during MRI exams is foot massage  or touch therapy, both of which may be beneficial due to the increase in social interaction  during the procedure. Not only was foot massage or touch therapy found acceptable and  feasible by both patients and MRI technologists, Parmar, et al. (69) reported that these in- terventions were associated with lower levels of anxiety during MRI.</para>
      <para>It is also possible to provide visual stimulation to the patient via special goggles or a  headset (57). Use of visual stimuli to distract patients may also reduce distress. Finally, a  specialized system has been developed to provide a virtual reality environment for the pa- tient that may likewise serve as an acceptable means of audio and visual distraction from  the MRI exam (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 5a</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">5b</emphasis>). A case study of two patients with claustrophobia  demonstrated that virtual reality distraction decreased subjective anxiety ratings when com- pared to no distraction (59).</para>
      <para>The use of a virtual reality tool that simulates the MRI experience may also be effective  at helping to prepare patients with claustrophobia and anxiety for MRI exams. Previous  studies have shown that desensitization therapy via the use of virtual reality (VR) offers an  effective method of treating anxiety (74, 77). A VR app has been developed that helps to  educate the patient about the MRI exam by simulating the experience (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). The app  incorporates both visual and auditory sensations normally encountered by patients during  MRI. Developers believe that this tool has potential similar to desensitization therapy, re- ducing patient anxiety prior to MRI and lowering the incidence of claustrophobia-related  issues. Importantly, when used in pediatric patients, this VR app reduces the need for the  use of sedation or anesthesia (80).</para>

      <para>ance of mental exercises, etc.) was more effective for reducing anxiety in patients compared  to providing information alone.</para>
      <para>Klonoff, et al. (11) provided a detailed example of one successful systematic desensi- tization protocol. This was conducted prior to MRI and involved having the patient lie on  the floor at home with her head in a box. The size of the box was incrementally decreased  until it approximated the internal dimensions of the MR system. Additionally, the patient  was required to gradually increase the amount of time that she could tolerate spending time  with the box over her head, until it equaled 50 to 60 minutes, to approximate the maximum  time needed for MRI. The patient also wore prism glasses that permitted her to have a direct  view in the vertical plane during MRI. After four treatment sessions, the patient was able  to successfully undergo MRI (11). Notably, because of the time involved with systematic  desensitization, this technique of preparing the distressed patient for MRI is impractical for  clinical MRI facilities.</para>
      <para>Medical hypnosis has been demonstrated to be a successful means of treating phobias  (50) and, not surprisingly, has been used as an effective intervention to enable a claustro- phobic or anxious patient to complete MRI (33, 36, 53). Successful hypnotherapy requires  a trained medical hypnotist and a willing, trance-susceptible patient. Therefore, identifying  the appropriate patient that would benefit from being hypnotized before and during MRI  and having a hypnosis therapist available for treatment are prerequisites for instituting this  technique of patient management. There is a secondary effect of using hypnosis for patients  with psychological disorders undergoing MRI insofar as patients have reported feeling a  general reduction in anxiety in their everyday lives after undergoing hypnosis (33).</para>
      <para>In the majority of MRI facilities, patients that are severely affected by claustrophobia,  anxiety, or panic attacks in response to MRI are usually pharmacologically sedated when  other attempts to counteract their distress fail. Using short-acting sedatives such as lo- razepam, diazepam, alprazolam, or intranasal midazolam or one of the other anxiolytic med- ications may be the only means of managing patients with a high degree of anxiety related  to MRI. Published reports of the rate of pharmacological sedation for patients undergoing  MRI range from 2 to 14% (8, 21).</para>
      <para>A study conducted by Avrahami (3) in patients with panic attacks who were unable to  undergo MRI reported that treatment with intravenous diazepam caused the symptoms to  disappear rapidly and permitted completion of the examination in every case. However, the  use of sedatives in patients prior to and during MRI may not be required in all instances  nor is it always practical (1).</para>
      <para>Of special note is that anxious patients with a history of substance abuse who are in re- covery programs may not be willing to take mind-altering medications because this is typ- ically contraindicated during their treatment. These patients should be referred for behavioral  therapy before MRI. In all cases, one or more of the recommended, non-medication-related  techniques indicated in<emphasis role="bold"> Table 1</emphasis> should be attempted for these patients before electing to  use a sedative.</para>
      <para>Performing sedation for the patient in the MRI environment is not a totally benign pro- cedure. Confusion and respiratory compromise as well as other untoward reactions have</para>
      <para>been reported in response to relatively modest doses of commonly employed sedatives (6,  9). If a sedative or other similar drug is used in a patient in preparation for MRI, it should  be understood that the use of this medication involves several important patient management  considerations (31). For example, the time when the patient should be administered the  medication for optimal effect prior to the examination should be considered along with the  possibility that there may be an adverse reaction to the drug (31). The use of proper physi- ologic monitoring equipment during the MRI examination is essential. Additionally, provi- sions should be available for an area to permit adequate recovery of the patient after MRI</para>

      <para>According to Rotunda (70), patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and  who may also have severe claustrophobia frequently are unable to successfully complete  MRI exams, which may greatly affect their health outcomes. Research studies comparing  the brains of patients with PTSD versus people who do not have PTSD have shown diffuse  decreases in white and gray matter in patients who developed PTSD after various traumas.  The areas in which these types of white and gray matter changes occur might provide some  insight into the anatomical and physiological reasons for PTSD symptoms (71). For health- care professionals, it is important to be aware of the potential differences in the brain of a  patient with PTSD and the effects that these differences may have on behavior. Therefore,  educated MRI technologists who can adapt to the specific needs of their patients, such as  those with PTSD, are more likely to provide the best experiences which leads to better pa- tient outcomes. This includes being proactive with respect to preparing and managing pa- tients with PTSD for MRI exams.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">For Pediatric Patients </emphasis></para>
      <para>Careful consideration of methods for reducing distress in pediatric patients is extremely  important as the implications of imaging procedures have both short- and long-term effects  in this population. In addition to the short-term effects of distress, anxiety and pain, resulting  in crying and lack of cooperation, there may be long-term psychological effects into adult- hood such as medical fears, less perceived control over health, and in some cases, post- traumatic stress responses and claustrophobic feelings (60, 61). Some of the methods for  minimizing distress and discomfort in the scanner are similar to those used in adults, how- ever, important differences should be highlighted. Similar to adults, pediatric patients can  also benefit from preparation prior to the procedure, hypnosis, music and sedation. Other  pediatric specific methods such as visual and audio distraction, positive reinforcement and  parental involvement have also been shown to be effective (60).</para>
      <para>Parental involvement can be a particularly useful technique as it engages the parents,  which in turn reduces the parents’ own anxiety and ensures that the child is in close prox- imity to them. Techniques with parental involvement include comforting and distracting  the child while holding the child in a comforting position, educating and preparing the child  for the procedure, and providing positive reinforcement. Parents must be careful in these  interactions with their children, as any anxiety or stress they express can induce anxiety  and stress in the child (60).</para>
      <para>Educational materials and procedural preparation can be helpful for both the parents  and the child. Parents and pediatric patients can watch educational videos together, practice  positioning for the procedure, and observe other children modeling various coping skills.  With the assistance of radiology staff members, parents can help their children practice  breathing techniques and engage in positive imagery (60).</para>
      <para>Some radiology teams also employ child-life specialists who are specifically trained to  teach pediatric patients and their parents various coping skills that they can employ during  MRI. These skills include visual, auditory and tactile distraction and breathing exercises</para>
      <para>(60). In addition to reducing stress and anxiety in pediatric patients, child-life specialists  have been shown to contribute to the reduction of sedation rates associated with pediatric  MRI procedures (62).</para>
      <para>Just as there are risks associated with using sedatives in adult patients, there are risks  for sedating pediatric patients. Unlike for adult patients, however, the process of inducing  sedation can be equally as traumatizing to the child as the MRI exam, itself. Under certain  circumstances, sedation is the only way to achieve the quality of scans required for diagno- sis, particularly in young children under the age of eight (63). In this case, radiology teams  should follow established sedation programs that are safe and effective (64).</para>

      <title>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</title>
      <para>With the increasing proportion of patients taking greater responsibility for their own  health, there is a rise in the number of patients using these web-based portals for information  on their own health as well as information about the procedures they will undergo. With  more than 60% of patients using web-based systems (65) such as Medline Plus, WebMD,  and other online sources to find healthcare information, it is important for hospital radiology  teams to provide their patients with specific and up-to-date information regarding their pro- cedures. An increased focus on patient-centered medicine and improved patient education  has prompted hospitals and other medical imaging facilities to provide detailed information  to patients and their families.</para>
      <para>From the referring physicians and radiologists to the technologists and support staff,  each member of the team has a specific role in providing care for their patients. Primary  care physicians and specialists who order the procedures have a responsibility to engage  their patients in the medical process and explain the rationale for the MRI procedure. The  healthcare support staff that schedule, greet, and provide the patients with pamphlets of in- formation are an extremely valuable resource for the patients as they are the most visible  members of the team.</para>
      <para>The radiology technologists who perform the diagnostic procedures have the most direct  impact on the care of the patients during potentially distressing procedures. They are highly  trained professionals who not only conduct a wide range of diagnostic tests but also provide  educational information and prepare patients for the procedures prior to conducting tests.  As always, the radiologists and physicians who interpret the results of the tests and discuss  the diagnoses with their patients have the responsibility of establishing good lines of com- munication with the patients and understanding their mental state following potentially dis- tressing procedures.</para>
