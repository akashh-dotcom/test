      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology must deliver a practical level  of protection for patients and staff by avoiding harm and balancing all risks against the ben- efits of the examination. While the technology and the potential hazards of the MRI envi- ronment are essentially common to the practice of MRI globally, there are jurisdictional  and regional differences that impact local differences in practice. These stem from variations  in regulatory structures, professional standards and education for radiologists and radiog- raphers, levels of participation in international professional and scientific communities, the  implants and devices found in the respective marketplace, legal structures, and local public  expectations regarding medical risks. This chapter describes and reviews the relevant doc- umented material underpinning the patterns of clinical MRI safety practices in Australia.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI in Australia </emphasis></para>
      <para>Australia is an island nation covering an area of land similar to that of the continental  United States (U.S.) but with a population of approximately 25.4 million people. The pop- ulation is predominately urban and residing mainly on the east coast. There are also popu- lation clusters in the middle of the southern coast (2 million), at the southern and northern  extent of the west coast (4 million), as well as a small population center on the northern  coast, and on a large island state (Tasmania). Capital cities and regional centers are well  serviced by MRI facilities that operate within a modern western healthcare system. The Or- ganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that, in 2011,  Australia had 14.1 MR systems per million people (377 scanners) performing approximately  1.2 million examinations per year (1).</para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 749-1002_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:45 PM  Page 973</para>
      <para>The exact size of the Australian MRI installed base is difficult to determine because re- porting is influenced by funding arrangements. An Australian Government 2019 report con- firmed the OECD figures by listing 356 fully and partially funded scanners (2). Industry  groups estimate that there are an additional 250 MR scanners providing medical examina- tions outside of the Australian universal health funding arrangements. By comparison, the  OECD country average is 12.5 MR systems per million people, while the U.S. is equipped  with approximately 39 scanners per million individuals (1).</para>
      <para>The majority of the installed scanners are less than 10 years old, generally operating  with high-performance gradient systems, comprehensive phased-array radiofrequency (RF)  coils, and advanced applications software. Medicare does not fund services performed on  MR systems more than 20 years old. Most MRI examinations are performed for clinical in- dications in hospitals or stand-alone radiology practices using MR systems operating at 1.5- Tesla, but about 40% of scanners operate at 3-Tesla, a substantial increase in proportion  since 2012. There are only a few lower field strength and/or vertical-field scanners, none  of which are covered by the federal funding arrangements in Australia. There are three clin- ical and one research driven custom designed MR guided linear accelerators (MR-LINAC)  operational, with more installations planned in the future by a private provider. Several clin- ical centers and research facilities operate human positron emission tomography (PET) MR  systems and several have intra-operative MR scanners.  Two research centers operate 7- Tesla, whole-body MR systems equipped with high order, parallel transmit RF systems,  neither currently provides clinical imaging services.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Funding </emphasis></para>
      <para>Australia operates a “fee for service” healthcare model supported by a universal health  insurance system called Medicare. The Australian Federal Department of Health, through  Medicare, is the major source of all medical service funding, including MRI examinations  performed in public and privately owned facilities. Under the Commonwealth Medical Ben- efits Schedule (MBS) scheme, a fixed fee is paid for a defined range of MRI procedures,  carried out by specifically licensed sites, for specified clinical indications. Virtually all of  the 345 Medicare funded sites also perform variable numbers of MRI examinations for in- dications that are not eligible for Medicare payments. Some of those examinations are billed  to the patient while others are performed at no charge, depending on local contractual and  commercial factors. Currently the MBS fees for MRI examinations are between $201.00  and $1,440.00 Australian dollars, with small additional rebates paid for the use of MR spec- troscopy, contrast media, sedation, and general anesthesia support during MRI (3). Many  private MRI facilities charge the patient more than the MBS fee and require so-called “gap”  payments from the patient. Gap payments are not covered by any private insurance systems  in Australia. At many sites, the terms of their Medicare contract prohibits gap billing. MRI  exams certain motor vehicle, workers compensation or veterans affairs funded claims fall  outside of the Medicare MBS arrangements, but there are similar administrative and legal  limitations on examination fees charged for these situations and they generally approximate  the MBS fees and typically do not involve gap payments by the patient.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Facility Ownership </emphasis></para>
      <para>Clinical MRI facilities are almost exclusively operated within radiology departments  and practices. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR)  has established accreditation of Radiologists performing MRI and operates the Quality As- surance Accreditation program. Each of these elements will be explored in detail later in  this chapter. Independent cardiologist-owned MR systems are rare in Australia, although  many sites offer time for cardiology-directed examinations on scanners owned by radiology  practices. Thus, cardiologists may be the responsible healthcare group for MRI facility and  patient safety at certain times. Radiation Therapy providers operate a growing number of  MR simulator systems external to Radiology providers. The current numbers are unknown.  A small number of commercial veterinary scanners are also operated by the private sector.  Arrangements at human research centers associated with universities fall outside clinical  arrangements. These particular scanners maybe operated by graduate or undergraduate stu- dents with limited training, in conjunction with specialist support staff, such as radiogra- phers. Universities generally follow the recomendations for operating their MRI facilities  developed by the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) (4).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Staffing and Radiographer Training </emphasis></para>
      <para>In Australia, radiographers are the most engaged healthcare professionals on matters  of MRI safety. While there is currently no Australian legal requirement for MRI services to  be provided by specifically qualified staff, the majority of clinical MRI exams are performed  by radiographers who are nationally registered as Medical Radiation Practitioners (MRP)  under a board, the Medical Radiation Practice Board of Australia (MRPBA), and the Aus- tralian Health Practitioner Registration Agency (AHPRA) authorized by the Health Practi- tioner Regulation National Law Act (2009) (5). The educational requirements for  registration are determined by an independent accreditation committee. The original 2013  MRPBA professional capabilities intentionally omitted professional capabilities for ultra- sound (US) and MRI (6). In 2019, the MPRBA acknowledged that basic registrants could  not be assumed to have the understanding to deliver safe and competent MRI services with- out the supervision of an undefined “more experienced practitioner” (7).</para>
      <para>New professional capabilities came into effect in 2020 with specific capabilities indi- cated for ultrasound and MRI (7).  Entry-level registrants will need to understand how MRI  is employed in clinical situations for diagnosis and radiation therapy planning (7), but are  not expected to deliver MRI (or ultrasound, for that matter) services. Practitioners who pro- vide MRI services must demonstrate certain additional capabilities. These include requiring  the radiographer to operate the MR system safely by applying knowledge of the principles,  equipment, and the clients that they manage during MRI exams. Safety considerations  specifically include those associated with contrast agents and other pharmaceuticals used  in procedures, site management and the integrity of safety “zones” (i.e., as specified by the  American College of Radiology), minimizing MRI-related heating as well as peripheral  nerve stimulation, and actively managing risks related to acoustic noise and implant inter- actions (7). These aforementioned topics form the minimum capabilities the public can ex- pect from any registered Medical Radiation Practitioner who is providing MRI services.</para>

      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 749-1002_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:45 PM  Page 975</para>
      <para>To date, the MRPBA Accreditation Committee, which provides the board with advice  on educational programs deemed sufficient to develop the required professional capabilities,  has not described or endorsed educational requirements for practitioners performing MRI.  In the Australian implementation, this may not occur because, unlike the arrangements in  New Zealand, providing MRI services does not require a specific class of registration. The  obligation to perform competently arises when the practitioner includes MRI in their activ- ities. A challenge to the competence of a practitioner may only occur following a complaint  to the MRPBA by a patient or other individual. Considering the lack of previous enforceable  standards in MRI capabilities and the range of practices that may have developed expedi- ently, the capabilities of individual practitioners around MRI safety may come under  scrutiny from mandatory notifications to the MRPBA or the Medical Board under the  AHPRA system. Registrants are obliged to notify the Board when they believe the public  is placed at risk where the practice is a significant departure from accepted professional  standards (i.e., section 140(d) of the National Law) (8).</para>
      <para>The degree courses for Medical Radiation Practitioner registration teach MRI principles,  safety, and clinical applications at an introductory level, which is obviously insufficient for  independently practicing MRI. Therefore, to achieve appropriate MRI competency, radi- ographers undertake site-based “on the job” training, the basic Australian Society for Med- ical Imaging &amp; Radiation Therapy (ASMIRT) Level 1 accreditation, or pursue post-graduate  education. Unlike graduate level radiography courses, the site and post-graduate training  curricula are not standardized or specified by the registration authority. The adequacy of a  practitioner’s safety skills and competency may initially be decided administratively by the  MRI practice following a complaint or incident as the practitioner and carries the respon- sibility to show competence relative to the new professional capabilities statement.</para>
      <para>At least three Australian universities offer post-graduate courses in MRI technology  and clinical practice. The courses are self-funded and students may exit with a post-graduate  diploma, up to a Master’s degree level. MRI safety is typically addressed in the first year  of study along with physics and imaging principles.</para>
      <para>The national radiographic professional body, the Australian Society for Medical Imag- ing &amp; Radiation Therapy was formerly known as the Australian Institute of Radiography  (A.I.R.). ASMIRT operates a two-level MRI certification program amongst a range of  modality specific accreditations. Currently, the certification is only open to diagnostic and  therapy radiographers at this time and does not specifically offer certification of professional  capabilities required by the new document (7).</para>
      <para>Level 1 MRI certification is achieved by passing an online exam and the completion of  three hundred MRI examinations in a twelve-month period. Certification is maintained by  performing nine hundred MRI examinations in a three-year period. ASMIRT Level 2 MRI  certification, intended for MRI supervisors, is granted on presentation of a portfolio of pro- fessional development activities and this certification is maintained with continuing evi- dence of professional activities and a larger number of clinical examinations that must be  performed. Details of the program and fees are available at the ASMIRT website and in a  recently revised MRI certification manual (9).</para>

      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 749-1002_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:45 PM  Page 976</para>
      <para>The MRI safety module of the Level 1 accreditation curriculum requires knowledge of  MRI bioeffects and the potential hazards associated with the static, time-varying, and ra- diofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields. In combination with general patient care topics,  it accounts for 15% of the examination’s content and score. However, this is not to say that  knowledge of MRI safety topics is examined in depth by the Level 1 certification process.  Issues of motion through the static magnetic field, the spatial gradient magnetic field and  interactions between medical implants and the scanner are not included. Many experienced  MRI radiographers recognize that the ASMIRT Level 1 accreditation represents a relatively  low standard of knowledge. Not surprisingly, the ASMIRT currently recommends that ra- diographers undertaking MRI should undergo further education and certification. Their cer- tification is also supported by the national radiology professional guidelines (10).</para>
      <para>As previously mentioned, Australian MRI radiographers tend to take the lead role in  understanding MRI technology, pulse sequences, and imaging principles as well as the com- prehensive issues of MRI safety. To a degree, radiographers have attempted to informally  fill the gap left by less involved radiologists. A potential pitfall to this is that staff members  may be functioning clinically above their knowledge base and beyond their delegated pro- fessional roles, resulting in possible risks to themselves and patients.</para>
      <para>There is a high level of membership in the International Society for Magnetic Resonance  in Medicine’s (ISMRM) and the Society for MR Radiographers and Technologists (SMRT)  amongst Australian radiographers performing MRI. The International and Australia &amp; New  Zealand (ANZ) chapter of the SMRT provides a continuing stream of high quality MRI  safety educational programs through annual national and international meetings, and via  online educational materials. This provides a core of several hundred highly aware radiog- raphers operating in connection with international sources, although industry mechanisms  and practice do not presently appear to value the resource these members represent. Of note  is that very few Australian clinical MRI facilities employ medical physicists. The Australian  College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM) commenced a pro- gram of lectures, practical assignments and examination in 2020 to offer professional body  certification scientists the role of an MR Safety Expert. First completions are expected in  mid to late 2021.</para>

      <para>Australia has few absolute requirements regarding MRI safety practices. The legal and  clinical responsibilities to keep public, staff, patients and other individuals free from harm  are supported by equipment and device standards, professional and regulatory body guide- lines, and publications from government departments and authorities.

      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Key MRI Safety Points From AS/NZS 3200.2.33:2005. </emphasis></emphasis>The IEC model of three-tiered  operating modes for the MR system is employed in Australian standards and in clinical  practice. The standards specify thresholds for the static magnetic field strength, RF power  deposition, and time-varying magnetic fields at each operating mode (<emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>). In the Nor- mal Operating Mode, none of the scanner outputs may cause physiological stress to patients.  In the First Level Controlled Operating Mode, one or more of the scanner outputs are at  values that may cause physiological stress to patients. Before employing the First Level  Controlled Operating Mode, a decision must be made on medical grounds to confirm that  the patient can handle the increased exposure level. Medical supervision is required to con- trol any physiological stress caused by the scanner. The standards require scanners operate  in a way that needs a deliberate action by the MR system operator before enabling the First  Level Controlled Operating Mode. A Second Level Controlled Operating Mode also exists,  where one or more of the scanner outputs reach levels that may cause significant risk for  patients. Operation of the MR system in this mode requires explicit local ethical approvals.  Notably, most clinical MR systems cannot be easily switched to the Second Level Con- trolled Operating Mode.</para>
      <para>MR system manufacturers bear the primary responsibility of implementing many re- quirements of the IEC and AS/NZS standards in these regards (13). The AS/NZS  3200.2.33:2005 has not been revised since 2005 and is now out of step with the parent stan- dard (third edition, 2013). Most notably, the Australian and New Zealand standards classify  all MRI use above 2-Tesla as the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> (i.e., requiring a  medical decision and supervision). The current European standard IEC60601-2-33:2013  3.1 (9) sets 3-Tesla as the upper limit of the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis>, with 8 Tesla as the  upper limit of the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> compared to 4 Tesla in the older  standards.</para>
      <para>The AS/NZS and IEC standards can be purchased on-line or accessed through academic  libraries. However, because of its age, it is not a useful document in practice. The current  IEC standard is a wiser investment. Libraries may offer access to the equivalent document  under the British Standards (15). Despite their technically dry language, the international  standards contain substantial appendices and discussions addressing the rationale of the se- lected patient exposure limits. They also provide insights into occupational exposure issues,  specific requirements for the documentation provided with scanners, patient screening,  acoustic noise levels, and several test methodologies that make them important reading ma- terial for advanced MRI practitioners.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Therapeutic Goods Administration </emphasis></para>
      <para>Compliance with an Australian standard is not compulsory unless enforced by law or  regulation. Compliance with AS/NZS 3200.2.33:2005 is required indirectly by the regula- tions and processes of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The TGA is empow- ered by federal law (The Therapeutic Goods Administration Act 1989) to control the import,  export, manufacture, and supply of all therapeutic goods in Australia including medical de- vices, medicines, and biological products.</para>

      <para>All MR systems must obtain registration on the TGA’s Australian Registry of Thera- peutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be imported or sold in Australia. Certified confor- mance with the IEC60601-2-33:2013 or AS/NZS 3200.2.33.2005 can be accepted as  evidence to place an MR scanner on the ARTG. The harmonization of FDA MR equipment  safety standards with the IEC in 2014 has removed the potential for the differences from  scanners built to comply with older FDA standards.</para>
      <para>The ARTG system also approves all implanted medical devices used in Australia. The  registration process assesses information provided by a device sponsor against a set of de- fined “essential principles”. The essential principles require that use of the sponsored device  does not compromise health and safety, that it has been designed and constructed to comply  with safety principles, that the device remains safe throughout its useful life, and that the  benefits of the device outweigh any undesirable effects. There are also additional “essential  principles” regarding design and construction that include specific information to be sup- plied by the manufacturer. These requirements define the content of Australian Information  for Use, (IFU) documents for implants and medical devices, requiring them to include “Any  warnings, restrictions on use, or precautions that should be taken in relation to the device.”  The TGA regulations are similar to those of the European Union (EU). The TGA will accept  conformity assessments issued by specific EU Notified Bodies or other evidence of com- pliance with Australian or international standards, as evidence of compliance with many of  the essential principles. The ARTG requirements to provide warnings, restrictions on use,  and precautions, includes exposure to MR systems, but the TGA does not prescribe a format  for information regarding MRI and device interactions in the way that the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) has done since 2005. As a result, the information concerning  interactions between implants or devices and MR systems is variable but most “Instructions  for Use” for a medical product include FDA-style statements of the MRI conditions for safe  scanning, utilizing the American Society for Testing and Materials International  (ASTM)/IEC symbols for MR Safe, MR Conditional, and MR Unsafe.</para>

      <para>The TGA relies upon the Advisory Committee on Medical Devices (ACMD) to consider  the information for an implant or device. Most of the 15 members of the advisory committee  are surgeons, with one eminent biomedical engineer, but no medical physicists or members  familiar with MRI safety. In 2017, the ACMD assumed the responsibilities of the Advisory  Committee on the Safety of Medical Devices. The ACMD is reactive, collaborating closely  with industry on problems that have been identified through complaints and incidents. No- tably, a review of the guidelines commenced in 2016 but has not been completed at the time  of writing. Several submissions regarding standardizing information for MRI-related inter- actions were received. Early reports suggest that the scope of the MRI section will be re- duced in length (16). In the initial responses to professional and industry submissions  contained some concerning signs (17, 18). The ACMD decided to disregard the International  Organization for Standardization Technical Standard (ISO TS) 10974 and to remove re- quirements for MRI-specific labeling as well as patient identification cards for implants,  although they recognized that such information would be helpful to the TGA to grant device  approval (16). New guidelines will need close review to determine if they decrease rather  than increase the information provided about devices in the MRI environment.</para>

      <title>PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS</title>
      <para>Radiologists are medical practitioners registered by the Medical Board of Australia.  Active assurance of safe practice is one of the five elements of a 2017 “Professional Per- formance Framework” designed by the Medical Board to ensure that medical practitioners  deliver services competently and ethically (19). This document requires all medical practi- tioners to actively assure safety as a central pillar of their professional activities.</para>
      <para>The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) Standards  of Practice for Clinical Radiology details the professional standards expected for participa- tion in their Medical Imaging Accreditation Program (20). Members of the RANZCR are  expected to respect the Standards of Practice. Non-observance can lead to professional con- sequences or may open a practice to censure by, or complaint to the Medical Practitioners  Board. Medicare funding is conditional on the observance of these professional standards  through the RANZCR Quality Assurance Program. For these reasons, the Standards of Prac- tice arguably define the Australian minimum acceptable position on MRI safety, although  the level of legal liability is unclear.</para>
      <para>Section 13 of the document includes several specific standards and indicators regarding  MRI safety. A practice must ensure that all sedation, anesthesia, and monitoring equipment  used in the MR system room is certified “MRI-compatible” (sic) by the manufacturer. De- spite the error in terminology, this suggests that such equipment must be used in accordance  with specific MR Conditional labeling in order to ensure safety use monitoring devices.  Safety training for staff members is not specifically addressed in this document. The re- porting radiologist must be credentialed as an “MR Radiologist”, usually by virtue of the  general registration or education processes in RANZCR since January 1995.</para>
      <para>RANZCR requires that the radiographers who conduct MRI exams have appropriate  training. In the absence of stipulations by the radiograper registration board (MRPBA), the  Level 1 ASMIRT MR accreditation is represented by RANZCR as the standard level for</para>

      <para>MRI radiographers. The RANZCR clinical standards require that Level 1 staff performing  MR scanning are supervised by a Level 2 ASMIRT MR accredited radiographer. The new  professional capabilities required for registered radiographers providing MRI services, is- sued by the Medical Radiation Practitioner Board (7) take legal superiority as of March  2020, and the RANZCR standards are likely to require revision.</para>
      <para>Specific MRI safety standards are listed in section 13.4 of the RANZCR standards. The  primary requirement is that “MRI safety practices and policies must be documented, en- forced and periodically reviewed by the supervising radiologist(s)”. The MR Radiologist is  primarily responsible for the safe operation and administration of MRI service. The use of  several titles (MR Radiologist, supervising radiologist, Liason MRI Radiologist, etc.) clouds  the identification of this healthcare professional, but could be clarified, along with delega- tions, in site-specific MR safety policies. Reviews of policies are required at least annually.  Additionally, policies must protect patients and personnel in the MRI area from potential  hazardous interactions, but the standard only focusses on ferromagnetic interactions asso- ciated with the static magnetic field of the scanner. Furthermore, the standard identifies the  document from the IEC, (IEC 60601-2-33), as the main MRI safety standard while endors- ing the American College of Radiology (ACR) guidance document as well as the Unted  Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s (MHRA) MRI safety  guidelines as recommended resources. Previous standards on the availability of an MRI ra- diologist for consultation on safety questions and the maintenance of a registry of unautho- rized objects entering the MR system room have been removed since the 2012 version.  Beyond these general points, the Standards of Practice refer to the RANZCR Guidelines  on MRI Safety.</para>
      <para>Anecdotally, these requirements are not universally observed, with reports of non-ra- diographers preparing and positioning patients and solo operation of scanners by non-ac- credited radiographers. Whether these practices remain defensible or tolerated under new  practitioner registration requirements remains to be seen. The RANZCR document is in- tended to apply in New Zealand and Australia, yet there is no mention of the specific reg- istration category and the post-graduate educational requirements required for a registered  radiographer under the New Zealand Medical Radiation Technologists Registration Board  (21).</para>

      <title>RANZCR MRI SAFETY GUIDELINES</title>
      <para>The RANZCR MRI Safety Guidelines support the RANZCR Standards of Practice by  offering a broad range of guidance material regarding MRI safety (20). Beyond the obliga- tions created by the Standards of Practice that were detailed above, there are no enforced  consequences for non-adherence with the guidelines.</para>
      <para>The 2017 RANZCR guideline is a substantial improvement over the 2007 document.  Input was sought from medical physicists, the Society for Magnetic Resonance Radiogra- phers and Technologists (SMRT), Australian MR safety experts and the ASMIRT before  completion by an RANZCR panel. The document has a strong blend of current international  opinion and practice models. It retains some similarities with the 2013 ACR Guidance doc- ument on MRI safe practice (22), but offers a less didactic text covering a wider range of</para>

      <para>physical and administrative topics. The structure appears to be modeled after the UK MHRA  guidelines (23). The College describes the guidelines as an advisory document, but given  the Standards for Clinical Practice, and the requirements for Medical Board registration, it  is a key document representing appropriate professional practice with respect to MRI safety.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Section 3: Administrative Aspects and Roles </emphasis></para>
      <para>Important administrative aspects of MRI safety open the guidelines, stressing the im- portance of planning for the delivery safe practices as a fundamental element of the MRI  examination. The three tiers of MRI safety personnel described in international consensus  is interpreted for the Australian clinical model (24). A radiologist must be explicitly desig- nated for each MRI facility making the suggested title of “Medical Director of MRI” anal- ogous to the consensus title of MR Medical Director or MRMD. An MRI Safety Officer  (MRSO) with the responsibilities for day-to-day implementation of MRI safety policies  works with the MRMD to develop a consistent approach to ensure the safety of the site,  patients, and staff members. This MRSO is described as a designated position, which implies  greater knowledge and responsibility than the operational MRI radiographers. Notably, there  is no suggestion in the document that the term “MRSO” is prescriptive of the MRSO des- ignation registered by the American Board of Magnetic Resonance Safety, or that a specific  MRI safety training curriculum or accreditation is supported by the guidelines. The  RANZCR guidelines recommend that MRI sites have access to an “expert third party” who  would be invited to offer advice on specific matters such as reviewing facility policies, pro- cedures, and planning. The MR Safety Expert (MRSE) may simply be an MRMD or an  MRSO from another site, but these individuals are expected to possess in-depth knowledge  of the technical and engineering aspects of MRI equipment and interactions of MRI-related  electromagnetic fields with human subjects. Diagnostic imaging physicists (or medical  physicists) with specific MRI training are likely to be the best fit for the role of MRSE.</para>
      <para>It is suggested that larger facilities establish MRI safety committees to manage policies  and to review and examine incidents. A site-specific MRI safety manual is specifically re- quired, along with an incident reporting system. Incidents must be reported internally within  24 hours, with a documented review and response that analyze root causes, providing rec- ommendations for improvement. An active review and monitoring process is central to ac- tive provision of safe practices. The clear documentation of annual training of staff working  within the MRI facility is another key administrative tool relied upon by the guidelines.</para>
      <para>RANZCR has opted for the terms Junior and Senior MRI personnel, instead of Level 1  and 2 MR Personnel as indicated by the ACR, but the patterns of responsibility are similar.  Junior personnel have basic training on-site security and rules involving MRI technology,  as well as emergency procedures, screening, and hearing protection. These staff members  can work within the ACR designated Zones 3 and 4 (i.e., the MR system room) in order to  perform initial patient screening. The senior staff members are additionally trained in the  physical principles of MRI safety including exposure limits, cryogen hazards, and manage- ment of patients with implants and devices. Furthermore, Senior MRI personnel are respon- sible for signing off the final MRI safety screening procedure and for supervising the other  staff members, including non-MRI trained personnel.</para>

      <para>In this section of the document, there are certain departures from the TGA position that  place the RANZCR guidelines closer to current international standards. Equipment output  limits and the MR system’s operating modes are drawn directly from the IEC 60601-2-33  2013 edition, appropriately sidelining the relevance of the AS/NZ standard. Some details  that conflict with the current IEC standard seem to have been retained from earlier versions,  including interest in room humidity (no longer a controlled element relevant to SAR limits  specified by the IEC), the identification of 7 Tesla scanners as research devices (now con- sidered First Level Controlled Operating Mode MR systems; notably, these very high field  strength scanners have been approved for clinical use in Europe and the U.S.), and the limit  on specific absorbed energy of 14.4Kj/kg (replaced by manufacturer specific risk guidelines  in the IEC standard).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Section 6: Site Design </emphasis></para>
      <para>The physical zones developed by the ACR and now adopted within IEC 60601-2-33  are dealt with in a mixed manner. The RANZCR guidance has a clear preference for ACR’s  four-zone strategy and requires all new construction of MRI facilities to implement this  means of controlling access of the MRI environment on the  basis that zones are stipulated  in the Australian Health Facility Guidelines 2016 (25). Designated areas outside the MR  system room are required for resuscitation activity, anesthetic induction and recovery, and  cryogen storage. Access to all areas with a static magnetic field above 0.5 mT must be con- trolled by MRI personnel. The guideline also contains specific requirements limiting access  to areas of the quench pipe discharge. MRI facilities are required to supply MR appropriate  fire extinguishers, room temperature and humidity monitors, patient stretchers and wheel- chairs, scanner room oxygen monitors, patients call buttons, and to have direct vision of  patients and all MR system room access doors from the control desk.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Sections 9 &amp; 10: Patient/Individual Screening and Scan Room Access </emphasis></para>
      <para>Screening patients and other individuals for implants and foreign bodies is required for  all individuals entering the MR system room. Those entering zone 3 must have basic checks  for cardiac pacemakers (interestingly, without mention of other implanted “active” devices),  plus appropriate restrictions on their access to zone 4, the scanner room. Patient screening  is expected on three occasions in addition to statements from the referrer on the MRI request  form regarding implants and the suitability for an MRI exam. The first screening by MRI  staff can be carried out remotely during scheduling, while the second and third screenings  must be conducted on-site by MRI personnel, directly. At least one screening should involve  the use of a written screening form and one should involve review of the information on  the form along with a verbal screening by Senior MRI personnel who must confirm and  identify themselves on the screening form. Section 9 of the guidelines provides a strong  discussion of how to document and to make scanning decisions.</para>
      <para>If implants are identified during the screening process, further investigation is performed  which involves a review of case notes, past imaging studies, a physical examination, an as- sessment of the implant information provided by the manufacturer (e.g., a review of the In- structions for Use), and possibly additional imaging to help determine the conditions for</para>

      <para>safe scanning. Concerns regarding safety must be resolved carefully, in consultation with  an MR safety expert, as needed. The final decision to proceed with an MRI exam is a clinical  one and, thus, is made by the radiologist. Scanning a patient with an implant using condi- tions that are outside those specified by the manufacturer must be covered by a written pol- icy from the facility and be approved by the MRI Medical Director. Furthermore, this action  requires written and verbal informed consent of the patient. These afore-mentioned require- ments obviously limit the potential for site-specific, policies for implants and devices.</para>
      <para>Scan room access during scanning operations is considered specifically by section 10.  The door to the MR system room must be kept closed unless individuals are walking through  it and, when the entryway is open, it must be visually monitored. All objects entering the  scanner room must be labeled with appropriate ASTM F2503 icons: MR Safe or MR Con- ditional). Only essential non-patients (e.g., support personnel such as nurses, respiratory  therapists, or anesthesiologists) are allowed into the MR system room during examinations.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Section 11: Patient Handling </emphasis></para>
      <para>Some points distinguishing practice in Australia from guidelines elsewhere are pre- sented in this section. All patients must be visually monitored during the procedure and pro- vided with a button to alert scanning staff or any issue or concern that occurs during the  MRI exam. A patient who cannot verbally communicate or initiate contact during MRI re- quires monitoring using pulse oximetry at a minimum, while a sedated patient must be mon- itored using pulse oximetry and blood pressure recording equipment. Under those  circumstances, the supervising medical practitioner must be present and immediately avail- able in accordance with professional anesthesia guidelines.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Section 12: Contrast Agents </emphasis></para>
      <para>The gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) section of the guidelines opens with the  clear statement that “an MRI Radiologist shall be responsible for assessing in each case  whether contrast administration is appropriate”, and for reviewing initial non-contrast views  (20). Therefore, the guidelines reinforce the responsibility of the MRI radiologist and the  need to a patient-specific, examination-specific prescription of GBCA use. This statement  is additional to the 2017 RANZCR statement on gadolinium retention, supported by the  TGA (26), in which they noted that routine use of GBCA in some patients “where there is  not a specific indication” should be reviewed by a medical professional (27).</para>
      <para>GBCA safety measures are summarized but the primary code of practice is the  RANZCR 2013 GBCA guideline (28) Gadolinium retention is also addressed in the MRI  safety document by recommending that macrocyclic contrast agents should be used unless  there is a clear clinical benefit for using a linear contrast agent. The management of the use  of a GBCA in a pregnant patient is discussed in section 15.2 of the guidelines with an uncited  opinion and the statement that no adverse effects have been convincingly demonstrated.  Notably, the RANZCR position is in conflict with a large-scale Canadian study that identi- fied GBCA as a potential significant source of health effects in the fetus, but not with respect  to exposures to MRI-related, electromagnetic fields during gestation (29), despite this in- vestigation being explicitly referred to for other conclusions.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Section 13: Noise Protection </emphasis></para>
      <para>The guidelines are explicit and prescriptive regarding the matter of hearing protection  in the MRI setting. All MR patients in Australia and New Zealand must wear hearing pro- tection unless it can be clearly documented that the sound pressure levels will stay below  85 dBA during the MRI exam. If a patient refuses to use hearing protection, the MRI radi- ographer must use pulse sequences with documented sound pressure levels that are less  than 85 dBA. Furthermore, all individuals remaining in the MR system room during the  imaging procedure must wear hearing protection.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Section 14: Thermal injury </emphasis></para>
      <para>The cause and control of thermal-induced injuries associated with is described in great  detail. Certain aspects of the material conflict with the current IEC standard, such as con- sideration of an assumed maximum relative humidity and the statement that specific ab- sorption rate (SAR) levels may not be corrected for ambient temperature in excess of 24°C.  Patients at risk and the heating of internal metal are well-described for information purposes.  The conventional measures to reduce the potential for MRI-related burns, removal of con- ductive leads, padding to the bore, not crossing the patient’s limbs, and using padding be- tween skin surfaces are included. The document relies on patient feedback related to heating.  It does not discuss possible “deep” burns from RF hotspots related to modified and parallel  transmit RF systems, or nonstandard transmit RF coil designs. Of note is that there is no  discussion of follow up care in the event that the patient experiences localized heating or  skin reddening.</para>
      <para>Note 15.1 places additional conditions on research and voluntary scans beyond those  applicable for medically requested procedures. They require human research ethics ap- proval, screening and a medical assessment, the exclusion of pregnant volunteers, informed  consent, and a limit (presumably site determined) on the number of research scans per per- son per year. The RANZCR requires that all images acquired shall be reported (by an MR  Radiologist) and appropriate clinical follow up provided.</para>

Exposure limits for the  general public or occupational exposures are often set lower than a patient limit to reflect  the lack of benefit from that exposure.</para>
      <para>In the early period of MRI use in Australia, prior to adoption of the IEC standards, the  primary Australian scientific body, the National Health and Medical Research Council  (NHMRC) commissioned production of the “Safety guidelines for magnetic resonance di- agnostic facilities” (30).

      <para>published in a radiation health series and placed the responsibility for MRI safety in the  hands of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA).  ARPANSA is the body responsible for monitoring ionizing radiation from medical exposure,  solar radiation exposure, environmental non-ionizing radiation (such as microwaves and  low frequency electromagnetic fields), the uranium mining industry, and Australian nuclear  reactors. This delegation mirrors similar decisions in the United Kingdom and Europe.</para>
      <para>The 1991 document drew its material largely from early publications and international  scientific bodies of the period. It recognized a paucity of information regarding repeated  exposure to the electromagnetic fields used by MR systems and, thus, established somewhat  conservative recommendations. After a period of public comment, it was published and  then seemed to be largely ignored or to go unnoticed by the clinical MRI community.</para>
      <para>In 2004, the document was withdrawn by ARPANSA and replaced with a “trusted in- ternational document”, the 2004 International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Pro- tection (ICNIRP) statement on medical magnetic resonance procedures (31). The creation  of the AS/NZS 3200.2.33 standard released ARPANSA from direct responsibility for setting  MRI exposure limits.</para>
      <para>The ARPANSA returned obliquely to matters that impacted MRI exposures with its  work to establish an Australian radiation protection standard establishing maximum expo- sure levels for electric and magnetic fields 0 Hz (static) to 3 Hz. This work was initially in- tended to address public concerns regarding the safety of proximity to electrical power lines  and was to replace a 1989 statement on 50/60 Hz field exposures (32). The working group  responsible for drafting the radiation protection standard was dominated by representatives  of the power generation and distribution industry. A draft was released for public comment  in late 2006 (33). The document was focused on power line field exposure, but also set out  to establish mandatory restrictions for the general public and occupational exposure over  the full range of activities that produce extremely low frequency (ELF) fields. In another  chapter in this textbook which pertains to MRI safety in Europe, Dr. Stephen Keevil illus- trates how efforts to address safety concerns public concerns over exposure to extremely  low frequency (ELF) time-varying electrical and magnetic fields (EMF) from sources such  as power transmission lines, and specific industrial exposures can impact the practice of  MRI. Scientific consideration of an extensive literature review in the draft focused on certain  information on peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS).</para>
      <para>The 2006 consultation document did not recognize any potential impact on the practice  of MRI (even though it included an occupational limit of 2 Tesla at a time when 3 Tesla  MR systems were being installed) and the committee responsible for the proposed exposure  limits failed to make any connection with the European Union (EU) debate raging at that  time. MRI professional organizations including the ISMRM, SMRT, and RANZCR (34)  were mobilized and approximately one-third of all submissions made to the ARPANSA  working group came from MRI professionals and MRI equipment suppliers concerned that  the proposed exposure limits would interfere with important diagnostic technology and  practice. By February 2008, the ARPANSA was taking note of the concerns regarding MRI  (35) and apparently considered increasing the static magnetic field limits and adopting the</para>

The ARPANSA moved to adopt the ICNIRP 2010 statement on limiting ELF  exposures (36) in line with a policy of adopting international best practices. In 2017, the  ICNIRP published a paper describing existing regulations on diagnostic devices using non- ionizing radiations, suggesting incorrectly that the 1991 document remains in use in Aus- tralia with regulatory strength. ARPANSA has confirmed that this is not the case (37).</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italics">Incident Reporting and Investigation Scheme (IRIS)</emphasis>. The TGA operates the medical de- vices Incident Reporting and Investigation Scheme (IRIS). Reports of adverse events asso- ciated with MRI can be made on-line. The reports receive a thorough risk assessment  procedure and are reviewed by a panel of scientific, engineering, and clinical experts who  may recommend further investigation. The event reports and findings recorded in the IRIS  database can be used by the TGA to initiate a range of responses such as recalls, user edu- cation, or compliance testing. The system is well described on its website (38). The IRIS  database does not facilitate public or researcher access to reports, but final details of the re- ports appear on the Database of Adverse Events Notifications (DAEN), Medical Devices  database described below. IRIS is the primary place to report MRI-related safety incidents  because it is managed by the government agency responsible for medical device registration  and safety.</para>

      <para>The TGA manages the Database of Adverse Events Notifications (DAEN) - medicines.  Initially DAEN-medicines collated adverse events surrounding the use of medications drawn  from reports to the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Scheme (ADRRS) (39).  Adverse events related to gadolinium-based contrast agents or medications administered  during MRI should be reported using this system. The DAEN system is relatively transpar- ent and provides for public searches by product name. Approximately 700 DAEN - medi- cines notifications have been made for gadolinium-based contrast agents since 1986,  including seven deaths, with one attributed to gadolinium associated systemic fibrosis, also  known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.</para>

Reporting is voluntary for healthcare professionals, but under the federal  Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 it is mandatory for manufacturers and sponsors to report seri- ous or potentially serious events associated with a medical device.

Devices in the search term  are cross-referenced to the ARTG meaning that the searches are highly specific and take  some additional work to be sensitive to a particular type of event or events with a class of  devices such as MR systems. While the report indicates there was an association between  a reported adverse event and a device, causality may not be certain. Care is needed to cross- check the report incident numbers before coming to a conclusion regarding the event.</para>

There were two cases of patients that had finger entrapment by the patient  table (i.e., when moving into or out of the scanner). Another eighteen incidents have been  reported in which the magnets used with cochlear implants were involved, confirming that  MRI-related incidents may be reported in association with an implant or device, or the scan- ner, itself, but not cross-referenced. Interestingly, several prominent MRI safety events  shared anecdotally on social media sites do not appear in the DAEN-Medical Devices  searches, reflecting a culture of incomplete or under reporting.</para>

Radiologists, radiographers, and those in- volved in medical imaging were invited to report incidents (www.raer.org). Trainee radiol- ogists were instructed in the use of the system and required to demonstrate experience with  it as a component of their training. By 2012, there were nearly 4,000 incidents reported.</para>
      <para>The information held in the reports was maintained under statutory immunity in Aus- tralia and New Zealand meaning that material cannot be used in legal proceedings in those  countries. The RaER was intended to be adjunctive and not a replacement for the obligations  to report within institutions, or to report to the TGA. Reports made to the RaER were ana- lyzed by a team of radiologists focused on quality improvement, but their activity was trans- parent. Reporting was limited to a few conference papers and one publication (41). None  of the reports to the RaER identified incidents by modality. The RaER ceased operation  sometime between 2015 and 2019. The author’s enquiries to the academic management  team about access to the records have not been answered.

      <title>AUSTRALIAN MRI SAFETY RESEARCH AND EDUCATION</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Research Regarding Australian MRI Safety Practice </emphasis></para>
      <para>There have only been two published attempts to research the practice of MRI safety in  Australia. Ferris, et al. (43) published a survey of Australian MRI safety practices following  the release of the first RANZCR MRI Safety Guidelines in 2004. A series of questions was  sent to supervising MRI radiologists at all known MRI facilities in Australia seeking to ex- amine general and difficult aspects of MRI safe practices in the field through anonymous  or attributed responses. Ninety-two of 115 sites (80%) responded after diligent follow up.  The study reported selected results including the observation that the new RANZCR and  ACR guidelines were considered equally influential (38% each) and ten sites reported using  external consultation to review their MRI safety procedures (34).</para>
      <para>Seven sites reported inadvertent scanning of eight cardiac pacemaker patients. One of  these events resulted in a death in 2000. Eight MRI facilities were willing to accept requests  to scan patients with non-MR Conditional cardiac pacemakers but did not specify their pre- cautions. Four sites had intentionally imaged cardiac pacemaker patients with undisclosed  precautions. There was a general refusal to scan patients with retained pacemaker leads (77  sites) and twenty MRI facilities refused to scan patients with any type of intracranial  aneurysm clip. Of the seventy-one MRI facilities that would scan patients with intracranial  aneurysm clips, virtually all (70/71) relied on documented evidence of the clip’s identity.  Additionally, ten sites insisted that the aneurysm clip was in its original packaging before  insertion, and four MRI facilities reported that they did their own testing on clips prior to  implantation. With regard to patients with metallic implants, the manufacturer’s product in- formation and third-party sources were used equally to justify the decision to perform an  MRI examination (34).</para>
      <para>The variations in MRI safety practices prompted discussions between the radiology and  neurosurgical professional bodies, as well as with the TGA, but there were no concrete re- sults from these interactions. The study method did not probe the site’s understanding or  use of ASTM F2503 and FDA-style statements of conditions for performing safe MRI ex- aminations in patients with implants and devices. Eighty-six percent of the sites reported  procedural delays while MRI safety issues were resolved and these situations occurred fre- quently and on a constant basis. The investigators concluded that dealing with MRI safety  questions continues to be difficult and increased vigilance including requiring the referring  physician to supply critical MRI safety information at the time of the examination request  is required to prevent the inadvertent scanning of cardiac pacemaker patients (34). Ferris,  et al. (43) also indicated there may be a role for an MRI safety advisor providing an external  audit of site policies and procedures.</para>
      <para>In 2007, Burwell and Davidson (44) offered another insight into MRI safety policy and  procedures in Australia. Their qualitative questionnaire explored who established site safety</para>

      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 749-1002_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:45 PM  Page 989</para>
      <para>policies, who was considered the local final authority, requested details pertaining to pre- scan screening, and determined how often policies were reviewed. This study also asked  about safety breaches, although many participants chose not to respond to that section. A  total of 110 surveys were sent out and 46 were returned. Considering the growth of MRI in  Australia and the similarity in the number of sites identified by these two studies, it is quite  likely that data for the Burwell and Davidson report was collected in 2005, about the time  of the survey by Ferris, et al. (43).</para>
      <para>The Burwell and Davidson survey reported that experienced MRI radiographers and  radiologists created site safety policies independently or collaboratively. In contrast to Ferris,  et al. (43), this survey indicated that the ACR white paper on MRI safety and the various  peer-reviewed and other published works by Dr. Frank G. Shellock were most commonly  used when creating a site policy. Screening, which RANZCR requires to be conducted at  four points before the examination, was typically performed only two or three times. Only  62% of the sites reported using written processes to follow up questions raised by the patient  screening questionnaire.</para>
      <para>In general, safety policies were reviewed “as required” rather than on a regular schedule.  Eighty percent of respondents claimed to maintain the required log of safety violations and  near misses, but few were prepared to respond to a question that asked if there had been an  incident during which a patient was harmed. The undisclosed number who did respond re- ported that ten contrast reactions occurred, eight MRI-related burns, two problems related  to “incompatible” or otherwise unsafe medical implants, and there was one projectile injury.  This report concluded, without clear justification, that a large number of sites did not meet  the simple RANZCR safety standards of the time.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Education for Radiologists </emphasis></para>
      <para>Australian radiologists who completed their training after January 2005 are automati- cally certified as MRI radiologists for as long as they maintained MRI-specific continuing  professional development (CPD) credits. The standards of their profession, and elements  of their registration mean that the MRI radiologist has the primary responsibility for the  safety of patients, and others at their facilities.</para>
      <para>MRI safety is addressed in the Applied Imaging Technology (AIT) syllabus of the  RANZCR radio-diagnosis curriculum (45), the training program for radiologists. Patient  and staff safety are considered “special knowledge” relevant to the radiologist’s status as  “an expert in the field”. An understanding of MRI safety issues, specifically missile effects  and heating issues relating to implants or devices are described in the highest category of  the curriculum and given the same importance as that of radiation exposure minimization  to decrease cancer risk (i.e., Category 1, Must Know). The AIT curriculum also covers MRI  hardware and imaging principles.</para>
      <para>There is no indication that radiology trainees receive structured education on MRI  safety-related clinical decision-making taught by radiologists. These matters would only be  observed in the MRI section of a trainees’ clinical work. This lack of didactic instruction  from the available body of literature and practice has resulted in a prolonged weakness in  the central professional group. MRI safety practice relies upon informed radiologists dele-</para>

      <para>gating appropriately to educated staff members, but the training of radiologists is not ad- dressing this need with any great urgency.</para>
      <para>Evidence suggests that the radiology trainee’s understanding of MRI safety is not  closely tested. Review of the twenty-eight AIT exam papers since 2004 demonstrated that  questions probing MRI safety knowledge had been used only five times and that candidates  had been tested on safety far less than on basic knowledge of image production. MRI safety  questions may appear in the multiple-choice AIT exams, but these are not publicly acces- sible. Post qualification MRI safety education available from the College is also sparse.  There are no MRI safety resources in the RANZCR public presentation archive (46), but  members may have access to a wide selection from those that are readily available (e.g.,  peer-reviewed journals, websites, etc.). Interestingly, the programs of RANZCR Annual  Scientific meetings from 2007 to 2019 have only included two presentations on MRI safety  issues - one international expert reviewing implant and MRI interactions and a local expert  providing a review of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) literature in 2007. These points  combined make it difficult to determine where and Australian radiologists obtain their  knowledge of MRI safety.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>Australia has an MRI safety system, standards, and regulatory strategy that are aligned  more closely with European models than those of the United States. A change in approach  is slowly developing with a generation of experienced clinical MRI physicists from the  United Kingdom influencing the radiology and medical physics training curricula.</para>
      <para>Australian MRI facilities make regular use of the statements of conditions for safe scan- ning of implants and devices required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Limited  research on the practice of MRI safety in Australia confirmed that the ACR guidance doc- uments on MRI safe practice and the resources published by an independent, U.S.-based  expert and his website (i.e., Frank G. Shellock, Ph.D., www.MRIsafety.com) were appar- ently more influential on MRI practitioners than the local professional guidelines. However,  specific research has not reflected the strong anecdotal experience that, at many MRI facil- ities, radiologists are only marginally involved in MRI safety decisions and that the radiog- raphers strongly influence the assimilation of evolving knowledge.</para>
      <para>Radiologists and radiographers accessing information at international conferences, in  print, and online appear to have the greatest impact on appropriate MRI safety practices.  By comparison, a local active MRI safety discussion seems absent apart from regular ses- sions at the annual meeting of the ANZ Chapter of the Society for Magnetic Resonance  Technologists (SMRT). Hopefully, the foundation of an ANZ Chapter of the ISMRM will  ultimately provide another vehicle to generate cross-disciplinary education and discussion.</para>
      <para>The imminent changes the professional capabilities of radiographers will increase the  expected level of knowledge providing the public with greater protection against underper- forming staff members. Alignment of the RANZCR guidelines and standards are needed to  recognize this new legislative backed reality. At the same time, opening MRI services to  nuclear medicine and radiation therapy radiographers and the expansion of services into</para>

      <para>rural areas will result in a growth in the number of practitioners who will need to manage  MRI safety issues effectively. New professional capability standards place a direct obliga- tion on the radiographer to provide the public with a safe and effective imaging service,  while the radiologists consider themselves experts in the field and retain the medical re- sponsibility for the examination. Mobilization and training of the medical physicists could  provide an extra dimension to the MRI safety dialogue by introducing better scientific per- spectives and a departure from the power imbalance of the employer/employee relationship  between radiologists and radiographers.</para>
      <para>The RANZCR could consider the use of MRI facility policies that produce consistent  decisions on commonly encountered implants and devices in the Australian market place.  MRI practitioners should also urgently consider delegating common MRI safety decisions  to appropriately experienced and educated MRI personnel such as advanced MRI radiog- raphers and medical physicists, working in conjunction with the clinical aims expressed by  radiologists, and working with appropriate recognition and remuneration for their skills and  responsibilities. This last initiative will require that MRI facilities develop much clearer  statements of reasoned decision-making than are currently found. The specific training  needs for radiologists, radiographers, or physicists should also be revisited, with improve- ments made at all levels.</para>
      <para>In this author’s view, the need to clarify roles, improve education and more significantly  improve daily practice has been chronic and must be openly addressed. This needs far  greater engagement from radiologists than has been observed in the field, to date.</para>
      <para>Radiographers at all MRI sites will need to improve their technical knowledge and  strategic thinking skills to help guide a structured approach to facility’s policies and deci- sions. Above all, professionals need to deliver on the existing guidelines. Folklore, hearsay,  and hero worship must be replaced by factual clear reasoning for practices to improve as  MRI moves from first-generation enthusiasts to second-generation learners . MRI safety is  a scientific and clinical endeavor that requires knowledge and literacy in both domains. Ed- ucated specialist voices need to be valued over those without qualifications or experience.  The ultimate goal of the MRI community is to reasonably maintain the extremely high  safety record of MRI while maximizing the benefit of the technology to patients.</para>
