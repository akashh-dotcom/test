      <title>Preface</title>
    <para>Since its introduction into clinical practice in the early 1980s, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has exhibited exceptional growth and created a paradigm shift in medicine. Not only has this imaging modality markedly expanded the roles of imaging in medical diagnoses, opening up vistas in neurological, musculoskeletal, oncological, cardiovascular and a variety of other diseases not accessible to prior imaging techniques, but it has also had a profound impact on our basic understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of abnormal conditions and disease processes.</para>
    <para>The continuous growth of MRI has led to an explosion in the number of patients, healthcare professionals, and other individuals exposed to the powerful static magnetic fields, rapidly changing magnetic fields, and intense radiofrequency fields used during the procedures. Numerous investigations have been performed during the past 35+ years in an effort to characterize the bioeffects and safety aspects of MRI. However, the interactions of the MRI-related electromagnetic fields with biologic tissues are still incompletely understood and safety issues persist despite best efforts to implement preventive practices. Unfortunately, this has led to many adverse consequences, including injuries to patients and healthcare workers, as well as several patient deaths.</para>
    <para>The transformative impact of MRI on medicine continues to progress and advances in technology continue unabated. Whereas the highest magnetic field used in routine clinical imaging was 1.5-Tesla during most of the 1990s, 3-Tesla is currently the standard. Presently, a 7-Tesla scanner is approved for clinical use and research is routinely performed at 9.4-Tesla, 10.5- and an 11.7-Tesla MR system recently came on line to scan human subjects. In addition to the high static magnetic fields, both the speed of magnetic field gradient switching and the levels of radiofrequency field exposures are pushing limits well beyond what was possible just a few years before. Therefore, we strongly believe that, for progress to continue in this field, appropriate safeguards must be in place to protect all human subjects exposed to MRI, which includes both patients and healthcare workers, alike. This is best accomplished by conducting careful research directed towards studying the effects of the electromagnetic fields used in clinical and research MRI settings and implementing cautionary measures based on the knowledge acquired during the last three and a half decades.</para>
    <para>Ultimately, MRI safety must begin with understanding the interactions of the electromagnetic fields used in MRI with biologic tissues. The issues concerning human safety in the MRI environment led us to enlist leading physicians and scientists around the world to collaborate on the first edition of this textbook, published in 2014, which organized and reviewed the scientific literature on the safety aspects of MRI. Since then, there have been thousands of new articles published in the scientific literature detailing MRI safety issues from every conceivable approach. Thus, the first edition of this textbook rapidly became outdated. Accordingly, we once again brought together an internationally respected group</para>
    <para>of experts who are directly involved in all areas of MRI bioeffects, safety, and patient management to update this important book. Notably, several new chapters were added to this second edition, with the intent of covering advanced or emerging topics for the MRI community. The unique collective expertise of these physicians (radiologists, cardiologists, internists, etc.), scientists, engineers, and other professionals has once again resulted in vital contributions to this resource of essential scientific knowledge that covers all of the critical topics of interest to physicians, MRI technologists and radiographers, physicists, scientists, healthcare professionals, imaging center managers, bioengineers, regulatory affairs professionals, and laypersons. The ambitious purpose of this textbook is to provide actionable information that will be used to ensure that the MRI environment is as safe as possible under all circumstances. We hope that we have accomplished this important goal and that the MRI community will benefit from the indispensable contents of this textbook.</para>

          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Most medical professionals today are well aware of the fact that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology uses systems with powerful magnets that make considerable amounts of noise and that you generally cannot bring ferromagnetic objects or patients with certain implants into the scanner room. However, these individuals may not be aware that MR systems use relatively safe radiofrequency (RF) radiation instead of ionizing radiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, etc.) to create images and they may not understand just how powerful the magnets are, why they may always be "on" and why they make so much noise. This chapter provides simple explanations for these matters by presenting information pertaining to basic MRI physics.</para>
    <para>MRI has at its root the chemical technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance or NMR (1, 2). As every chemist knows, the use of the word "nuclear" has nothing to do with radioactivity, but since the general population is not composed of mostly chemists, the medical community has dropped that emotionally laden word to become, simply, MRI. For most MRI examinations, the word "nuclear" has to do with the nucleus of the hydrogen atom, which consists of a single proton. The content of this chapter will begin by examining the magnetic properties of protons and then continue with an explanation of the MRI signal, some basic tissue properties, spin echo formation, and conclude with a brief discussion of MRI hardware issues. Much of the information in this chapter is adapted from <emphasis role="italics">All You Really Need to Know About MRI Physics</emphasis> (3). Several other textbooks also cover this introductory material (4-7).</para>

            <title>Spinning Protons Act Like Little Magnets</title>
    <para>A moving electric charge, be it positive or negative, produces a magnetic field. The faster a charge moves or the larger the charge, the larger the magnetic field it produces. Think back to when you were a child and would make a crude electromagnet by wrapping wire around a nail and connecting it to a battery. The larger the voltage of the battery, the larger the current and the stronger the magnet.</para>
    <para>Some of the basic properties of a simple proton include mass, a positive electric charge and spin. Granted, a proton does not have a very large electric charge, but it does spin very fast and, therefore, does produce a very small, yet significant, magnetic field. Water is the largest source of hydrogen protons in the body, followed by fat. Normally, the direction that these tiny magnets point in is randomly distributed (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1A</emphasis>).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> Spinning protons are little magnets which are frequently referred to as "spins".</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> Tesla (T) – A unit of magnetic field strength. 1 T = 10,000 Gauss (another unit of magnetic field). The earth's magnetic field is roughly 0.5 Gauss.</para>
    <para>Just as a compass aligns with the Earth's magnetic field, a spinning proton placed near (or within) a large external magnetic field (called <emphasis role="bold">B&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>) will align with the external field. Unfortunately, it is not quite so simple. At the atomic level, some of the protons align with the field and some align against the field, cancelling each other out. A slight excess will align with the field so that the net result is an alignment with the external field. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1B</emphasis> depicts nine protons, four of which have aligned <emphasis role="italics">against</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">B&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis> and five have aligned <emphasis role="italics">with</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">B&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis> resulting in an excess of one proton. (Note that this diagram showing the protons aligning perfectly with or against <emphasis role="bold">B&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis> is not completely accurate. This will be addressed further with <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>.)</para>

            <title>Some Quantum Physics</title>
    <para>A complete explanation of why the protons align both with and against the external magnetic field would require a study of quantum mechanics. Suffice it to say that both alignments are possible but the one <emphasis role="bold">*with</emphasis>* the field is at a lower energy state. The protons are con-</para>
    <para>tinually oscillating back and forth between the two states but at any given instant, and with a large enough sample, there will be a very slight majority aligned with the field. The larger the external static magnetic field, the greater the difference in energy levels and the larger the excess number aligned with the field. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> demonstrates this for a sample of two million protons. At 1 T there are just six extra protons. At 1.5 T, there are only nine extra protons for every two million. At 3 T there are 18 and at 7 T, the highest field strength used in the clinical setting, there are 42 excess protons for every two million. The number of excess protons is directly proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field.</para>

    <para>As will be discussed more fully later in this chapter, the MR signal comes from just these excess protons. With only nine out of two million protons (at 1.5 T) in excess, one might ask how can we even detect such a small signal? We shall answer that question by first asking a different question: how many excess protons are there in a single imaging voxel? (A voxel is a three-dimensional or volume pixel.) Without going into the math in great detail, assume a voxel dimension of 1-mm x 1-mm x 5-mm = 0.005-cm<superscript>3</superscript> or 0.005-ml. Using Avogadro's Number, we can calculate that there are a total of 3.4 x 10<superscript>20</superscript> water protons in a 0.005-ml voxel. If nine out of every two million protons are in excess, then there are a total of 1.5 x 10<superscript>15</superscript> protons in every voxel that will contribute to the MR signal (or, on the order of a million billion protons). The important lesson here is that even though a spinning proton is a very poor magnet, the number of excess protons that align with the field is so large that we can basically ignore quantum mechanics and focus on the classical mechanics description.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> The total magnetic field of the excess protons is defined as <emphasis role="bold">M&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>While it was stated above that, due to the large number of excess protons, we can pretty much ignore quantum physics, there is still one issue that is best discussed using quantum physics terminology. The relationship between the energy <emphasis role="bold">(E)</emphasis> of a photon or a unit of electromagnetic radiation and its frequency <emphasis role="bold">(ν)</emphasis> (the Greek symbol 'nu') is described by the Planck's equation:</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">*E<emphasis role="italics"> = </emphasis>h* ν</emphasis> (1)</para>

          <sect4 id="ch0001s06s01s02s03">
            <title>4 Basic MRI Physics: Implications for MRI Safety</title>
    <para>Where <emphasis role="bold">*h</emphasis>* is known as Planck's constant. In simple words, the energy of electromagnetic radiation goes up directly with the frequency of the radiation. <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> lists the approximate frequency ranges for different types of electromagnetic radiation. As will be discussed in detail shortly, MRI uses radio waves with frequencies around 10<superscript>7</superscript>-Hz (cycles per second). Most other radiology imaging techniques (e.g., X-ray, computed tomography, and nuclear medicine) use ionizing radiation with frequencies in the 10<superscript>18</superscript>- to 10<superscript>19</superscript>-Hz range or roughly 10<superscript>12</superscript> larger than those used in MRI. Accordingly, X-rays are roughly a trillion times more "energetic" (and potentially damaging) than radio waves. MRI is able to provide such great images not because of the high energy involved (like computed tomography) but because of the large number of protons found in the body, primarily in water and fat.</para>

    <para>Three spinning dreidels (i.e., a toy top traditionally used during Chanukah) are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>. Imagine the first one is spinning on the international space station. In the absence of gravity, it behaves just like a gyroscope and spins without wobbling. Imagine the second one is spinning on the moon. In the low gravity of the moon, the Dreidle will wobble rather slowly. The third dreidel is spinning on the Earth and wobbles faster than the dreidel on the moon. Imagine a fourth dreidel somewhere on Jupiter (if you could find a solid surface, that is).

    <para><emphasis role="bold">5</emphasis></para>
    <para>Previously, a spinning proton was described as being a very tiny magnet. Just as a spinning dreidel wobbles about its axis, so do spinning protons wobble, or precess, about the axis of the external <emphasis role="bold">B&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis> field. The frequency of the precession is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field and is defined by the Larmor Equation:</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Memorize this!</emphasis> ω<subscript>0</subscript> = γB<subscript>0</subscript> (2)</para>
    <para>Where, <emphasis role="bold">ω&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis> is known as either the precessional, Larmor or resonance frequency and γ (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio and is a constant unique to every atom. For a simple proton, γ = 42.56-MHz/T. As before, <emphasis role="bold">B&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis> represents the externally applied static magnetic field. At the magnetic field strengths used in clinical MR systems, 0.2 to 7 T, the resonance frequency of hydrogen ranges from 8.5-MHz to 298-MHz (8.5 x 10<superscript>6</superscript>-Hz to 2.98 x 10<superscript>8</superscript>-Hz). In <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>, it is shown that this range is in the radiofrequency (RF) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.</para>
    <para>As such, it is now apparent how <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1B</emphasis> was slightly inaccurate. The spins do align roughly with (or against) the static magnetic field but, if you could take a freeze frame snapshot of all of the protons in a voxel, you would see that each individual proton is slightly tilted. However, remember that the protons are each precessing at faster than ten million times per second, so if you take the average position of the vectors over even a very short amount of time, they will each be aligned either perfectly with, or perfectly against, the main magnetic field.</para>

            <title>APPLY AN RF EXCITATION PULSE</title>
    <para>If an electromagnetic radiofrequency (RF) pulse is applied at the resonance (Larmor, precession, wobble) frequency, then the protons can absorb that energy. At the quantum level, a single proton "jumps" to a higher energy state.

    <para>How fast a proton wobbles or precesses depends on the magnetic field that it experiences. An isolated proton, far from any other proton (or electron), is only affected by the main magnetic field, <emphasis role="bold">B&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>. As protons (or spins) move together (e.g., due to random motion), their magnetic fields begin to interact. If the field from one proton increases the field that the second proton feels, while the field from the second proton reduces the field that the first proton feels, then the second proton will precess at a slightly faster rate, while the first proton will precess slightly slower (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11A</emphasis>). If the fields from both protons add to the main field, then both protons will precess more rapidly (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11B</emphasis>). As soon as the spins move farther apart, their fields no longer interact and they both return to the original frequency but at different phases. This type of interaction is called spin-spin interaction. These temporary, random interactions cause a cumulative loss of phase across the excited spins resulting in an overall loss of signal.</para>

    <para>To summarize what has been covered so far, after the RF transmitter is turned off, the protons immediately begin to re-radiate the absorbed energy. If nothing is affecting the homogeneity of the magnetic field, all of the protons will spin at the same resonance frequency. The initial amplitude of the signal is determined by the portion of the magnetization vector (<emphasis role="bold">M&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>) that has been tipped onto the XY-plane. This, in turn, is determined by the sine of the flip angle, α. The maximum signal is obtained when the flip angle is 90°. [Note: sine (0°) = 0, sine (90°) = 1.0] The signal unaffected by any gradient is known as a Free Induction Decay (FID) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>).

    <para>In the real world, the MR signal decays faster than T<subscript>2</subscript> would predict.

[Note that some low field MR systems use permanent magnets, which in the past have been limited to fields ≤ 0.35 T (10). More recently, a few vendors have released permanent magnets of 0.4 and 0.5 T (11).] A simple four-loop design of such a magnet used in an MR system is depicted in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 18</emphasis>. The two central loops produce the majority of the field and the two outer loops help to shape it, to make it more homogeneous.

This type of magnet is called a resistive electromagnet because the wire resists the flow of electrons. This resistance to the current flow also produces heat. While larger currents can generate higher magnetic fields, they will also produce considerable heat.</para>
    <para>Similar to resistive magnets, the field from a superconducting magnet is produced by current flowing in multiple loops of wires. The wires are made out of niobium-titanium which, when cooled to 9.5°K (9.5° above absolute zero), lose all resistance to current flow.

    <para>The magnetic field lines depicted in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 18</emphasis> that extend outside of the magnet are known as the fringe field. It is this fringe field that can cause problems with ferromagnetic objects. In general, the five gauss line is the demarcation between what is considered safe or a danger for certain objects. Modern-day MR systems use what is know as "active shielding". An actively-shielded magnet has an inner or primary set of field coils that produces more than the desired field with an outer or secondary set of field coils with a lower current going in the opposite direction (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 20</emphasis>). The smaller opposite field partially cancels the field at the center of the magnet but cancels a much larger portion on the outside. For example, the primary set coils might produce a positive 2 T field while the secondary coils produce a negative 0.5 T, resulting in a net 1.5 T field at the center of the magnet but, because the secondary coils are closer to the outside, they create a greater amount of cancellation.</para>

    <para>The main magnetic field, <emphasis role="bold">B&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>, discussed above is also known as the static magnetic field, meaning that it never changes over time. In order to actually produce MR images, it is necessary to apply a magnetic field that changes over time and space in a predictable fashion. What is needed is to be able to produce a change that is linear moving away from the magnet center, with positive changes in one direction and negative changes in the other. (Note, the field at the center of the magnet never changes.) The field produced by a current in a single loop of wire reaches a peak at the center of the coil and drops off non-linearly as it move out (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22A</emphasis>). Obviously, this won't suffice for MRI.</para>
    <para>However, if a second coil with a current flowing in the opposite direction is placed one coil diameter away from the first, the fields from each coil totally cancel each other at the point midway between them (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22B</emphasis>). The fields interact in such a way that they produce an almost perfectly linear change in the area midway between them. The field change then drops off as you move outside of the coils. This linear change (also known as a gradient) is not only along the centerline between the two coils but remains linear for about half of the center volume. If properly designed, this region of reasonable linearity corresponds with the "sweet spot" or most homogeneous portion of the magnet. Note that the locations with the greatest offset from the field at the center of the magnet are located near the center of each loop. This is also the location of the greatest change in magnetic field per unit time, dB/dt, during an imaging sequence.</para>

    <para>Every gradient system is characterized by two parameters: the peak gradient amplitude, which primarily effects how small the field of view (FOV) may be, and the peak slew rate, which is how fast the gradients can be turned on and off, which affects things like minimum echo and/or repetition times. Between the two, a fast slew rate is usually better from an MR imaging consideration than a high peak amplitude, however, faster slew rates cause more safety-related issues, as will be discussed below.</para>
    <para>From the standpoint of MRI safety, these time-varying gradients raise two primary areas of concern. The first is acoustic noise that is associated with the gradient magnetic fields (13-15). An MR system can be compared to a giant speaker system. In a typical stereo speaker, there is a small permanent magnet with loops of wire wrapped around it and the magnet is attached to the center of a diaphragm. When an oscillating current is applied through the wire, it creates a time-varying gradient magnetic field that pushes and pulls on the permanent magnet, causing the supporting speaker diaphragm to vibrate.</para>
    <para>The static <emphasis role="bold">B&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis> magnet of the MR system is like the speaker's permanent magnet. The imaging gradients are like the loop of wire wrapped around the permanent magnet. The gradient tube is like the diaphragm. During the imaging process, the imaging gradient can be turned on and off in as little as 1-msec (corresponding to 1000-Hz) or as much as 20-msec (corresponding to 50-Hz). This causes the imaging gradients to push and pull against the main magnetic field, and the physical supporting structures, resulting in vibrations that occur in the typical audio range. The higher the magnetic field, <emphasis role="bold">B&lt;subscript&gt;0&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>, and the faster the imaging sequence (higher slew rates), the louder the noise is that will be produced. The resulting acoustic noise can be at levels that may cause hearing damage if hearing protection is not used in the MR system room. As shown in the pulse profile of <emphasis role="bold">Figure 24</emphasis>, imaging gradients can be turned on and off rather abruptly (i.e., the trapezoidal lobe) or more gradually (i.e., the sinusoidal lobe). There are always trade-offs when designing an imaging se-</para>
    <para>quence (see below), but using the lowest amplitude and lowest slew rates possible helps to minimize acoustic noise.</para>
    <para>One of the important properties of electromagnetism is that just as an electric current creates a magnetic field, a time-varying gradient magnetic field can produce an electric current in any nearby conductor. This brings us to the other issue that is associated with time-varying gradient magnetic fields. The human body is an electrical conductor. If a patient undergoing MRI has crossed-arms or crossed-legs, these may create a closed loop for current to flow under certain imaging conditions. The rapidly changing imaging gradients can induce current to flow across the body and peripheral nerve stimulation may occur (16). The area near the center of the coils in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 22B</emphasis> is the location of the largest dB/dt, so it is at this location where the greatest danger of induced currents exists with respect to peripheral nerve stimulation. Note that at the center of the magnet, the gradients do not produce any change in the magnetic field, so this is where the potential for nerve stimulation is the least.</para>
    <para>To summarize, the potential problems caused by time-varying gradient magnetic fields are, as follows: (1) acoustic noise and (2) peripheral nerve stimulation. The more rapidly the gradients change and the higher the amplitude, the greater the risks. Importantly, for patients with electronically-activated devices, the location of the greatest risk is not at the center of the MR system but at the outer edges of the gradient coils where the absolute changes in the magnetic fields per unit time (i.e., dB/dt) is the highest.</para>

          <title>RF Coils and RF Power Deposition</title>
    <para>As discussed above, MRI requires the use of a radio transmitter to provide the RF excitation pulses. Every scanner has a built in body RF coil (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 19</emphasis>) which is used for many of the imaging sequences. Alternatively, the RF excitation pulses can be applied by a smaller transmit RF coil, most commonly designed for imaging either the patient's head or a knee. While some of the applied RF energy that is absorbed ends up producing the MRI signal, most of it actually results in tissue heating of the patient (17). The amount of RF power absorbed by the body increases approximately with the square of the field strength. Accordingly, at higher static magnetic fields, there can be an inherent danger of over-heating the patient (17). The mass normalized rate at which RF energy is coupled to biological tissue is characterized by the specific absorption rate (SAR) and is reported in W/kg relative to the use of a particular pulse sequence and the body weight of the patient.</para>
    <para>The built in transmit body RF coil deposits RF energy over a relatively large area of the patient. Even if only a small amount of tissue is actually being imaged, a large amount of tissue will absorb much of the transmitted energy. By comparison, smaller transmit/receive RF coils have a limited volume of coverage and result in greatly reduced RF power deposition. Additionally, a class of RF coils known as quadrature (quadrature is an engineering term that has nothing to do with the number four) coils result in less power deposition than comparably-sized linear coils. Notably, this information has implications for scanning patients with certain types of biomedical implants insofar as it may be necessary to prevent substantial implant heating by limiting the MRI examination to the use of a transmit/receive head RF coil only, versus performing the MRI procedure using a transmit body RF coil and a receive-only head coil (e.g., certain neurostimulation systems used for spinal cord stimulation have these particular conditions specified in the MRI labeling).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">20</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Basic MRI Physics: Implications for MRI Safety</emphasis>### Imaging Sequences</para>
    <para>While there are many different types of imaging sequences used for MRI, most have three basic steps in common which are: (1) Exciting a slice or slab of tissue by using a slice select gradient combined with one or more RF excitation pulses. In an axial image, the Z-gradient is the slice select gradient. (2) Applying one (2D) or two (3D) spatial encoding gradients known as phase encoding pulses. The details of how this works are beyond the scope of this chapter. In an axial plane 2D image, the phase encoding direction can be in either the X-direction (i.e., left/right) or the Y-direction (i.e., anterior/posterior). For the moment, let's assume it is in the Y-direction. For a three dimensional image, there will also be a phase encode pulse in the Z or slice select direction. (3) Reading out the MRI signal while applying a third spatial encoding gradient known as the frequency encoding gradient.</para>
    <para>The pulse diagrams of two of the simplest imaging sequences, a basic gradient echo (GRE) (18), also known as a field echo (FE) and a basic spin echo (SE) are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 25</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 26</emphasis>, respectively (8). As was previously discussed (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 16</emphasis>), a SE sequence requires two RF pulses while, as shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 25</emphasis>, a GRE sequence uses a single RF pulse. The SE pulse sequence is most commonly used for T1-weighted imaging incorporating a 90°/180° pair of RF pulses. The GRE pulse sequence can use virtually any flip angle, which then impacts the type of image-weighting that results, in part, by the combination of the flip angle, echo time (TE) and repetition time (TR). Typically, flip angles from 20° to 40° are used for T<subscript>2</subscript>*-weighting and flip angles from 70° to 90° are used for T<subscript>1</subscript>-weighting. The key point here is that, with only one RF pulse, the RF power deposition, or SAR, is substantially lower with GRE sequences than with SE sequences. This is particularly important on MRI examinations using MR systems operating at 3 T or higher.</para>

This type of sequence can have an echo train length (ETL) as short as two to four for T<subscript>1</subscript>-weighted or proton density-weighting, or moderate echo train lengths of eight to 32 for T<subscript>2</subscript>-weighted imaging, or as long as 128 to 256 for MRI procedures such as single shot myelograms or cholangiograms (20, 21). The advantage of using a FSE pulse sequence is the decreased acquisition time that is due to acquiring multiple echoes or lines of data during one repetition time (TR) interval.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">22</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Basic MRI Physics: Implications for MRI Safety</emphasis>With all of the associated gradient activity, a FSE pulse sequence may suffer from the consequences of time-varying gradient magnetic fields discussed earlier. More importantly, particularly at 1.5-T and higher fields, all of the 180° RF pulses significantly increase the specific absorption rate (SAR) level. Accordingly, the MR system reported SAR may exceed the recommended FDA limits for specific absorption rate. When this happens, there are five possible options: (1) Increase the repetition time (TR) so that the average power per unit time goes down. (2) Decrease the total number of slices acquired per TR (3, 17), as half the number of slices means half the RF power. (3) Use the technique known as Half-Fourier imaging (22). This takes advantage of the symmetry in MRI raw data to reduce the number of lines of data required (and the associated acquisition time and RF power) by roughly one half. The disadvantage to this is that it reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by the square root of two. (4) Use refocusing RF pulses less than 180°. The amount of RF energy per RF pulse of a given duration is proportional to the square of the flip angle so a 180° RF pulse deposits four times as much as a 90° pulse of the same length. Reduce the flip angle of a large number of RF pulses and the total SAR will be decreased. (5) Use "low SAR" RF pulses. The amount of RF energy per RF pulse of given amplitude is proportional to the duration of the pulse. Instead of doubling the amplitude of the 90° RF pulse to obtain a 180° flip, you can double the duration. This will reduce the specific absorption rate in half but will also result in much longer time between echoes reducing the number of echoes possible per repetition time (TR) thereby increasing the total scan time.</para>
    <para>Reducing the flip angle of the refocusing pulse does reduce the SAR, but with all things in MRI, there are tradeoffs. In terms of refocusing spins that are going out of phase due to T<subscript>2</subscript>* affects (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 16</emphasis>), a 180° pulse is optimal. Reducing the refocusing flip angle from 180° to 140° for a single echo will reduce the effectiveness by about 12%. The effect on the signal-to-noise (SNR) when using multiple refocusing pulses becomes very complicated but suffice to say that the SNR is maximum with 180° pulses and goes down from there. While RF power deposition is mainly a problem at higher static magnetic field strengths,</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 28</emphasis> depicts the last imaging sequence to be discussed in this chapter, a spin echo-echo planar imaging (SE-EPI) pulse sequence (23). This type of sequence is most commonly used for diffusion-weighted imaging (DTI) or functional MRI (fMRI). The RF excitation utilizes a single 90°/180° pair so the SAR levels associated with these pulse sequences are usually not a problem. However, these sequences use the absolute fastest changing gradients so they have the greatest potential for creating the possible problems related to the time-varying gradient magnetic fields discussed above.</para>

          <title>Parallel Imaging Reconstruction</title>
    <para>The goal of most clinical MRI examinations is to achieve the best quality that is possible in the shortest acquisition time. Over the years, gradient slew rates have increased dramatically, improving the imaging speed of many techniques (such as FSE and EPI discussed above). However, there is still a physical limit as to how fast gradients can be turned on and off as well as the practical limit that exists to prevent problems such as peripheral nerve stimulation. The main purpose of the imaging gradients is to impart spatial information to the MRI signal. One might ask is there any other way of obtaining at least some of the spatial information?</para>
    <para>As discussed earlier, with the exception of transmit/received RF coils such as those used for the knee or head, most MRI procedures use the body RF coil for excitation and passive receive-only coils to detect the MRI signal. Modern-day MR systems use multi-channel phased-array (PA) RF coils that are designed for specific, limited anatomical coverage. These PA coils consist of multiple small coils (anywhere from two to 64) where each coil is sensitive to signal from only a portion of the FOV. A very simple four channel configuration typical of early torso phase-array coils is shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 29</emphasis>. In this case, four images are produced, one from the signal obtained from each coil, which are then combined to make a single composite image. Roughly speaking, the SNR of the final image obtained with a PA coil increases by the square root of the number of channels used (24).</para>

    <para>Without going into the mathematical details which are beyond the scope of this chapter, specialized techniques such as SENSE, SMASH, GRAPPA (25-27), which are all members</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">24 Basic MRI Physics: Implications for MRI Safety</emphasis>of a class of parallel imaging reconstruction methods, utilize the known or measured sensitivity profile of each individual coil to impart some spatial information. This makes it possible to reduce the number of phase encoding (PE) steps that are required for virtually any imaging technique. As the number of PE steps goes down, so does the total SAR. If the acquisition time is reduced by a factor of two, then the SAR is cut in half. If the acquisition time is reduced by a factor of four, then the SAR is cut to one-fourth. Theoretically, while it is possible to "speed up" a scan by a factor equal to the number of different coil elements, in practice the speed up factors are usually less than four. The main reason for this limitation is that while the acquisition time may be faster, the SNR of the final image is proportional to the square root of the number of actual phase encoding views used. If the scan is speeded up by a factor of four, the SNR is cut in half. Therefore, while high field strength MR systems have an initially high SNR, there is a limit as to how much SNR can be "thrown away".</para>
    <para>One final cautionary note about parallel imaging techniques: some MRI centers may decide to use "speed up" factors of two or three but then are unhappy with the SNR of the final images. Therefore, these MRI facilities use two or three signal averages for the pulse sequence. Of course, that just takes the acquisition time back to what it would have been without the use of parallel imaging. In fact, parallel imaging reconstruction can actually add artifacts to the image, particularly if the patient moves. Thus, parallel imaging should only be used with one signal average. If better SNR is desired, it is best to not use parallel imaging.</para>

            <title>IS THERE AN OPTIMAL FIELD STRENGTH?</title>
    <para>As of 2020 there are at least 16 different companies that manufacture and sell FDA approved MR systems in the United States with static magnetic field strengths ranging from 0.2 T to 7 T (11). An obvious question to ask is, is there an optimal field strength for MRI? The simple answer is, no. A better question is, what are the various tradeoffs at different field strengths? In this final section, many considerations including safety issues when selecting a magnetic field strength for a clinical MR scanner will be presented. A more thorough discussion of the physics of MRI safety is presented in another chapter in this textbook.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Cost</emphasis>As a general rule of thumb, the cost of an MR scanner is around $1M per Tesla (28). The cost will also go up with the number of RF coils and the number of channels the system can handle. Furthermore, higher field magnets are usually larger and heavier and have more expensive siting requirements. Choosing an MR system requires a careful examination of the cost-to-benefit ratio.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Signal-To-Noise</emphasis>As was illustrated in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>, the number of excess protons that align with the static magnetic field goes up linearly with field strength. It is these excess protons that are used to produce the MR image. Therefore, the signal strength goes up with the field strength. While there are many other issues that affect SNR, such as the differences of RF penetration and sources of RF noise at different field strengths, as well RF coil design, the number of</para>
    <para>channels, differences in relaxation time constants and details of the imaging sequences, in general, the SNR goes up linearly with the field strength (29-31).</para>
    <para>This extra SNR can be utilized to obtain higher resolution images in the same scan time or to keep the overall resolution constant but with shorter scans, meaning potentially higher patient throughput. Because the SNR of a scan is proportional to the square root of the scan time, to get the same SNR of a four minute scan at 1.5 T would only require a one minute scan at 3 T. (Of course what usually happens at 3 T is that a higher resolution scan is obtained at some slightly shorter scan time.) At higher static magnetic fields it is also possible to perform techniques that inherently have low SNR such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI) (32-33). However, for these techniques there are still tradeoffs. For example, scanning at 3 T may be roughly four times faster than at 1.5 T, but problems with image distortion also go up proportional to field strength.</para>
    <para>In addition to the inherent higher SNR at higher field strengths, most high and ultra-high field scanners utilize phased array coils with a high number of channels, typically between 8 and 32 channels or even as high as 64. As was stated above, the SNR increases, roughly, with the square root of the number of channels providing more opportunities for faster and/or higher resolution scans. Of course, the greater the number of channels, the higher the monetary cost.</para>

    <para>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has set guidelines for the specific absorption rate (SAR) during a clinical MRI examination (<emphasis role="bold">Table 4</emphasis>). It is important to note that these guidelines are independent of the strength of the static magnetic field. Because the RF power deposited in the body increases roughly with the square of the magnetic field (17, 31, 34-36) higher field strength scanners are more likely to bump up against these limits, (1.5 T occasionally, 3 T and up quite frequently).</para>

    <para>There are a number of approaches to reducing SAR and/or its impact on the patient but most of them have noticeable drawbacks. Just a few of the approaches presented by Allison and Yansak are, as follows (36):</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Acoustic Noise</emphasis>One of the most commonly asked questions about an MR scanner is, why is it so noisy? As was discussed above in the section on time-varying gradient magnetic fields, an MRI system is comparable to a stereo speaker. The force that causes the vibrations is known as the Lorentz force and is described for a single charged particle moving through a magnetic field as (34):</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">*F</emphasis><subscript>L</subscript>* = q (<emphasis role="italics">v</emphasis> X <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>* ) (5)</para>
    <para>Where q is the charge of a particle, <emphasis role="bold">*v</emphasis>* is the velocity of the charge and <emphasis role="bold">*F</emphasis><subscript>L</subscript>* is the Lorentz force. If we change q, the charge of a single particle, to Q, the total charge going through a wire, then the product <emphasis role="bold">Q*v</emphasis>* is effectively the current in the wire which determines the strength of the applied gradient. We see from this that the relevant forces that result in the acoustic noise go up with both the magnetic field and the amplitude of the imaging gradients. Typically, low field magnets have low amplitude gradients with low slew rates and high field magnets have higher amplitudes with higher slew rates.</para>
    <para>Price, et al. (34) reported typical acoustic noise levels of approximately 83 dB(A) on a 0.23 T low field open MR system and over 118 dB(A) on a 3 T scanner. These investigators found that pulse sequence parameters (particularly FOV and TR) had a greater effect on the acoustic noise level than did the field strength. However, it should be noted that high field systems typically utilize smaller FOVs and faster scans, inherently resulting in greater acoustic noise.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Flying Objects (Projectiles)</emphasis>It is well known that ferromagnetic objects are attracted to magnets and, thus, they should not be brought near an MR scanner lest the object become a projectile. Does the danger go up with the field strength? Not necessarily! The translational force exerted on a ferromagnetic object as it is moved near a magnet is not dependent on the strength of the</para>
    <para>magnet but, rather, it is dependent on the rate of change or spatial gradient of the magnetic field (35). At the magnet isocenter, where the field is fairly homogenous, there is almost no translational force regardless of the field strength. However, consider the case of two whole body magnets, a 1.5 T and 3 T. Typically, the 5 gauss line is somewhere just past the foot of the patient table or maybe near the scan room door. Between the 5 gauss line and the center of the magnet there is a region where the magnetic field changes fairly rapidly. If the design of the two magnets are similar, then the maximum spatial gradient of the 3 T scanner will be roughly twice that of the 1.5 T scanner. However, you could have one design where most of the change of the 1.5 T field occurs over a shorter distance, say 0.5 meter while a 3 T magnet may be designed to have most of the change occur over a 1.0 meter distance. The spatial gradient magnetic fields would be similar. That being said, the higher the static magnetic field, the greater the likelihood is that it will have a higher spatial gradient and a greater danger of projectile-related incidence objects.</para>

            <title>Artifacts</title>
    <para>Another consideration for image quality is the presence of imaging artifacts. In general, higher field strengths are more prone to motion artifacts (37). While it is easier to do fat suppression at higher fields, they can also suffer from chemical shift artifacts (38). Susceptibility artifacts also increase with magnetic field strength and may be very problematic in the presence of metallic implants (38, 39). One of the biggest sources of artifacts at high field strengths, and the last topic for this chapter, is the dielectric effect.</para>

            <title>RF Penetration and the Dielectric Effect</title>
    <para>With all imaging sequences, image contrast depends greatly on the type of RF pulse(s) used. The assumption is that all of the protons in the field of view (FOV) experience roughly the same levels of RF during the imaging sequence. In other words, we assume that the RF field (also known as the B<subscript>1</subscript> field) is fairly uniform across the FOV. With a well-designed transmit RF coil, at 1.5 T and lower, this is a reasonable assumption. However, at higher field strengths than 1.5 T, dielectric effects can cause substantial variation in the B<subscript>1</subscript> field across the FOV which, in turn, can cause significant variations in signal amplitude and/or contrast in an image (35, 40-42).</para>
    <para>The dielectric constant, ε<subscript>r</subscript>, of water (which predominates in the human body) is approximately 80 (in a vacuum it is 1.0). The wavelength of radio waves moving through a medium other than a vacuum is reduced by the square root of ε<subscript>r</subscript>, or in this case roughly a factor of 9. At 3 T, with a resonance frequency of 128 MHz, the wavelength in a vacuum is 235 cm but in the human body it is approximately 26 cm. This is on the same order as the dimensions of the human body, particularly of the torso. As a result, "standing waves" can form inside of the body resulting in peaks and troughs of different effective RF strength or flip angles. At 7 T the wavelength drops to around 11 cm and you get substantial dielectric effects in the brain, as well.</para>
    <para>When using simple gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequences to image a uniform phantom, the signal amplitude is determined by the amount of spins tipped onto the XY plane and is proportional to the sine of the flip angle (ignoring T1, T2, TR and TE). <emphasis role="bold">Figure 30</emphasis> depicts a series of images obtained on a Siemens 1.5 T Aera and a Siemens 3 T Skyra using a GRE</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">28</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Basic MRI Physics: Implications for MRI Safety</emphasis>pulse sequence with a flip angle of 720°. Since the sine of 720° = Ø (as are the sine of 0°, 180°, 360° and 540°) any spins that experience a full 720° flip angle should produce little to no signal.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 30A</emphasis> shows axial, coronal, and sagittal MR images acquired using a water filled phantom on a 1.5 T scanner. The dark ring in each image shows where in the phantom the spins were all tipped the full 720°. The brighter regions show where spins experience either a little more RF or a little less. (Remember, most MR images are magnitude images. If they had been "real" or "complex", then any spins experiencing more than 720° would have a positive signal and less than 720° would have a negative signal.) Unfortunately, with this single GRE sequence, it is not possible to tell exactly how much more or less than 720° the other spins experienced. The important thing to note about these images is that the signal distribution is rather simple, moderately uniform, and with good circular symmetry.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis> shows the same water filled phantom imaged on the 3 T MR system. These images are much more complicated, with multiple bands or regions of bright and dark signal. The dark signal occurs everywhere a spin experiences a flip angle that is close to a multiple of 180°, most likely either 540° of 720°. The brightest regions occur where the flip angle is a multiple of 180° ± 90°, most likely 630°, with the grey signal somewhere in between. The situation is actually still more complex. Not only does the RF have to penetrate the phantom and excite the spins, the signals from these spins have to make it back out to the RF coil, further complicating the interpretation of these images.</para>
    <para>At 3 T and higher, many phantoms used to perform QA testing are filled with some sort of oil (42). General Electric uses poly(dimethylsiloxane) or silicone based oils which have a dielectric constant less than 3. This translates into a wavelength of 136 cm (at 3 T), which is long enough to avoid the same problems that plague water filled phantoms. <emphasis role="bold">Figures 30C</emphasis></para>

    <para>While the images in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 30</emphasis> help to visualize the problem of the dielectric effect they lack detailed quantitative information. There are many approaches to provide better maps of the B<subscript>1</subscript> distribution (43-48) the details of which are beyond the scope of this chapter. Siemens provides in their standard service protocol library a sequence, (rf_map), where the amplitude of each pixel in the phase image is directly proportional to the effective flip angle at that pixel assuming that a nominal 90° RF pulse is applied. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 31</emphasis> shows two 3 T axial B<subscript>1</subscript> field maps obtained with this sequence. A contour map has been super-imposed on the phase images with the actual flip angles. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 31A</emphasis> was obtained using the water filled phantom and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 31B</emphasis> the oil filled phantom. Note that the contours agree with the axial images in <emphasis role="bold">Figures 30B</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">D</emphasis>. The actual flip angles in the water phantom show extensive spatial fluctuation and range from a low of 69° on the left and right 'wings' to a high of 90° at the exact center.

    <para>The final question is, how does this affect clinical MR images? This is not an easy question to answer because it depends on the type of pulse sequence being used. The greater the number of RF pulses used, the greater the effect. For this discussion, let's only consider a few simple pulse sequences. In each case, we shall call the excitation RF pulse alpha (α) and any refocusing pulse(s), <emphasis role="bold">2</emphasis>α.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Gradient Echo:</emphasis> This is the simplest sequence with only a single α RF pulse. If you have a long TR so that all of the spins have full Mz recovery, then the signal amplitude is proportional to sin(α). Since sin(90) = 1.0, the maximum signal is obtained with a 90° flip</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">30</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Basic MRI Physics: Implications for MRI Safety</emphasis>angle. The average flip angle in the water filled phantom of <emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis> was 77.1° and sin(77.1) = 0.975, so there is less than a 3% decrease in signal. Where the flip angle is 69° (the minimum value shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis>) there is a 7% loss in signal. However, because the spins are <emphasis role="italics">not</emphasis> flipped all the way down to the XY plane, they don't take as long to recover back to M<subscript>z</subscript>=Ø, so T<subscript>1</subscript> contrast can be reduced.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Spin Echo</emphasis>: This is the next level up in complexity. An ideal spin echo has a 90° excitation pulse and a 180° refocusing pulse. However, any two RF pulses will generate what is known as a Hahn Echo (8) and the signal amplitude is proportional to the product sin(α<subscript>1</subscript>)•sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α<subscript>2</subscript>/2), ignoring T<subscript>1</subscript> recovery. In our case α<subscript>2</subscript> = 2α<subscript>1</subscript> so the product becomes sin(α<subscript>1</subscript>)•sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α<subscript>1</subscript>) = sin<superscript>3</superscript>(α) If α = 90°, then the product equals 1.0. If α = 77.1, then the product equals 0.93, a loss of 7%. At α = 69°, the product equals 0.81, so a loss of 19%. If the TR is short as for a T<subscript>1</subscript>-weighted image, then things become complicated. If we assume that the TE is short relative to the T<subscript>2</subscript> decay rate, then most of the spins effectively experience an α+2α=3α flip angle. When α = 90°, then that is 270° or completely on the XY plane (M<subscript>z</subscript> = Ø). However, if α = 70° then this becomes 210° or just 30° past 180° meaning that most of the spins are much closer to the -M<subscript>z</subscript> axis than they are the XY plane and, therefore, will take longer to recover resulting in greater T<subscript>1</subscript> contrast.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Fast Spin Echo</emphasis>: One would expect that each additional non-optimal refocusing pulse would further reduce the MR signal. However, this is not the case. While the first echo in the echo train is just like the spin echo discussed above and is reduced by sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α<subscript>2</subscript>/2) (49, 50), the longer echo train drives the magnetization into a pseudo-steady state with a signal that is reduced by only sin(α<subscript>2</subscript>/2). Again, since α<subscript>2</subscript> = 2α<subscript>1</subscript> the net signal is proportional to sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α), (squared instead of cubed). If α = 90°, then the product equals 1.0. If α = 77.1, then the product equals 0.95, a loss of 5%. At α = 69°, the product equals 0.87, so a loss of 13%.</para>
    <para>The analysis of other types of imaging pulse sequences is beyond the scope of this text. Suffice to say that the non-uniformities in the B<subscript>1</subscript> field at higher static magnetic field strengths caused by dielectric effects seriously complicate image contrast. However, there has been much work done to reduce these effects such as the use of dielectric pads (51-54) or multi-channel, transmit RF coils (51-58).</para>

          <title>INTRODUCTION: MAIN SOURCES OF RISK IN MRI</title>
    <para>The Standard Model of physics requires 61 fundamental particles to describe the world we live in: 24 for matter and for antimatter, and 13 for interactions between them. Thankfully this chapter is mostly about just one, the electron. Some of the fundamental particles truly have superhero powers: Neutrinos can fly through the Earth as if it were not even there; about 65 billion solar neutrinos do so every second for every square centimeter of Earth's surface facing the Sun. The Higgs boson can give mass and inertia to objects. Quarks and anti-quarks can mix and match into hundreds of wildly different composite particles, some as mundane as neutrons and protons and others as exotic as pentaquarks or Upsilon mesons. Fortunately, this chapter is only about electrons.</para>
    <para>A magnetic resonance MR system or scanner in operation can be thought of as a dance of electrons. A torrent of them goes around and around in the coils of the main magnet, while jets of them streak back and forth in the wires that form the gradient and radiofrequency (RF) coils. Each electron generates a field around itself, to inform the Universe about how everything with electrical charge should get attracted or repelled by it. When an electron moves, it sends a new field, an updated version of the old one. These updates travel outward at the speed of light, broadcasting an electromagnetic wave. As electrons dance, they coax nuclear spins into a dance of their own and the MRI signal is created. This chapter is about this dance of electrons and how individuals may be injured when it goes wrong.</para>
    <para>As the term "magnetic" in the name announces, an MR system is very much about magnetism, and fields generated by electrons flowing in three main types of coils are involved in creating images. First there is the so-called 'main magnet', which produces the large static magnetic field. This is most often a superconducting electromagnet but it could also be a permanent magnet. Added to this are coils to generate the radiofrequency electromagnetic field, referred to as "RF coils". Lastly, the "gradient coils" are responsible for creating linearly-varying magnetic fields, for spatial encoding purposes. While these coils and the manner in which the fields they generate interact with matter can lead to useful images, they can also cause serious threats to human subjects (1-11).</para>
    <para>The main risks associated with MRI have been extensively reported and studied. For example, everyday objects may turn into projectiles, RF energy deposition can cause burns, time-varying gradient magnetic fields can induce nerve stimulation and loud noises can lead to auditory loss. These various risks are associated with the three types of coils discussed above: main magnet, RF coils, and gradient coils, and will be discussed in turn, below. A number of reviews and exposés on related topics can be recommended as supplemental reading (12-23). For those who wish to go even deeper into the physics, excellent basic textbooks exist on electromagnetism (24, 25) and the magnetic properties of materials (26). Good intuition on the interactions between electromagnetic fields and materials can be obtained through numerical simulation of Maxwell's equations (27), the fundamental equations that govern these interactions. For this we recommend an excellent textbook by Elsherbeni and Demir (28) that comes complete with well-documented Matlab code.</para>
    <para>The present chapter is focused toward providing intuition about the physical mechanisms that give rise to MRI-related risks. In the process, several equations will be presented, including the Lorentz force equation and two of Maxwell's equations that provide the mathematical basis for the physical interactions considered. All others, along with their application in several detailed sample calculations, are meant to assist the reader gain intuition about these interactions, in particular, with respect to size and degree. How strong is the magnetic force? How much will the RF field heat the tissues? How much current will be induced in a conductor? In this chapter, we intend to provide an understanding of the degree to which a particular interaction might represent a hazard, and in this sense, we hope that this information will be useful to the reader.</para>

          <title>RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAIN MAGNET</title>
    <para>The main magnet of a commercial MRI system is the most distinguishing feature of the device, and also the greatest source of risk. The field it generates, approximately 1.5 to 3.0 Tesla (T) for the most widely used high field strength scanners, is much stronger than magnetic fields casually encountered in everyday life. For example, it is roughly 30,000 to 60,000 times stronger than the earth's magnetic field at the surface and is roughly 300 to 600 times greater than the field of a common refridgerator magnet. While the universe can certainly create much stronger magnets (e.g., the field generated by some neutron stars may reach 100 billion Tesla), magnets used for MRI are among the strongest that exist on Earth. Because MRI involves field strengths much higher than the typical everyday experience, regular objects may behave in a non-intuitive manner near scanners. How objects behave in such conditions greatly depends on what they are made of, and for this reason we will</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">36 Principles of MRI Safety Physics</emphasis>begin by looking at the magnetic properties of materials. For objects most affected by magnetic fields, we will consider the translational and rotational forces acting on them. We will also look at the effect of the scanner's static magnetic field on biological processes and the effects of motion in such an environment.</para>

          <title>Susceptibility and the Magnetic Properties of Materials</title>
    <para>When a given material is placed in an external magnetic field, it becomes magnetized. Permanent magnets are always magnetized regardless of whether an external field is present or not, but permanent magnets are rare in nature and more mundane everyday objects require the coaxing of an external field to become so. The 'volume magnetic susceptibility', commonly represented by the symbol *X<subscript>v</subscript>*, or more simply <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis>, expresses how easily a given material becomes magnetized. While some material such as crystals may require <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> to take the form of a tensor, more typically <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> is just a number and it relates the degree of the induced magnetism to the strength of an externally applied field. <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> below gives the susceptibility of some common materials.

    <para>In terms of magnetic properties there are three main types of materials: those with a value for <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> that is large and positive, or small and positive, or small and negative. The first category, large and positive, represents ferromagnetic materials and is the only category causing safety concerns in the presence of *B<subscript>o</subscript>*, the MR system's large static magnetic field. At room temperature only a few elements such as iron, nickel and cobalt exhibit ferromagnetic properties. Of these, iron is most widespread, and for this reason iron-containing objects are typically the culprits for projectile incidents at MRI sites. While all materials are to some extent magnetized when subjected to a large magnetic field, ferromagnetic materials are distinguished in that the magnetic dipoles of every molecule in the material can possibly come into alignment, resulting in a very large magnetization. In such case the object is said to be 'saturated' as further increasing the external field could no longer increase the object's magnetization.</para>
    <para>Most everyday objects that do not contain iron would fit in the latter category, having small and negative magnetic susceptibility. Such materials are called diamagnetic and include common materials such as water, wood, many types of plastics, and essentially all biological tissues. The negative sign associated with their magnetic susceptibility means</para>
    <para>that such materials are (ever so slightly) repelled by a magnet. A slightly-frivolous yet most dramatic demonstration of this fact was achieved by levitating frogs (29). (Example I presents a calculation for the conditions to levitate a frog along with a rough estimate for what it would take to get a human subject off the ground!)</para>
    <para>The third type of material, with small and positive magnetic susceptibility, is referred to as paramagnetic. Although not particularly common in everyday life, paramagnetic materials such as gadolinium and manganese play an important role in the design of chemical contrast agents in MRI. Furthermore, the paramagnetism of deoxyhemoglobin is central to the endogenous blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast exploited in functional MRI. Chemical contrast agents and their safety is a topic deserving of consideration on its own, beyond the scope of the present chapter.</para>
    <para>In the following subsections, we will look at the translational and torsional forces exerted on ferromagnetic objects due to an external magnetic field. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials will not be considered any further, as forces in these materials are generally too small to be of any practical relevance to safety. Because iron is such a prevalent metal, it might be easy at times to develop the impression that all metallic objects must be ferromagnetic. However, in reality, metals such as copper and many types of stainless steel are essentially non-magnetic. Assuming they are pure enough, objects made of these non-magnetic metals do not cause any projectile risk in an MRI environment. That said, and given the prevalence of iron in everyday objects, suspicion toward all metals and testing with a hand-held magnet remains a healthy reflex.</para>
    <para>The computation of forces and torques can be very complicated because they depend on the strength of the magnetic field and of its spatial gradient, as well as the exact composition and geometry of the object submitted to it. While a more thorough discussion of this topic can be found elsewhere (18), the text below aims at providing intuition about the forces at play.</para>
          <sect4 id="ch0001s07s01s03s01">
            <title>Translational Forces Due to Interaction with a Static Magnetic Field</title>
    <para>Ferromagnetic objects are attracted to magnets, so logically, the closer one such object gets to an MR scanner the stronger the attraction should grow, should it not? Actually, no, in fact a ferromagnetic object at the center of the bore would feel no attraction at all, and maximum force would instead be felt somewhere outside the scanner. This is one example of non-intuitive behavior, further explained below.</para>
    <para>The magnetic field generated by the main magnet is referred to as <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>*<subscript>*o*</subscript>. It is a vector field meaning that *B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> has a magnitude and an orientation at every point in space. The spatial gradient of the main field is simply the change in the field's magnitude, *B*<subscript>*o*</subscript>, with respect to position or distance. In general, the spatial gradients of a given quantity are obtained by applying the 'grad' operator, denoted as '<emphasis role="bold">∇</emphasis>'. Accordingly, <emphasis role="bold">∇</emphasis>*B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> represents the spatial gradient of the main field of the MRI; at every point in space the magnitude of <emphasis role="bold">∇</emphasis>*B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> represents how steeply *B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> is changing around this point, and the orientation of <emphasis role="bold">∇</emphasis>*B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> points in the direction of steepest change. The units for <emphasis role="bold">∇</emphasis>*B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> are Tesla per meter (T/m), or alternately, Gauss per centimeter (G/cm). While the Tesla is the official unit for magnetic fields according to the International System of Units (SI) the Gauss still remains frequently used. One Tesla is</para>

    <para>equal to 10,000 G, one meter is of course equal to 100 cm, and as such 1 T/m is equal to 100 G/cm.</para>
    <para>In addition to the spatial gradient of the main field (above), another key quantity in determining the force exerted on an object is the magnetization of this object: a strongly magnetized object will interact strongly with <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>*<subscript>o</subscript> while a non-magnetized object will not. The magnetization of an object, <emphasis role="bold">*M</emphasis>*, its magnetic dipole, <emphasis role="bold">*μ</emphasis>*<subscript>m</subscript>, and its internal flux density, <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>*<subscript>m</subscript>, are closely-related concepts.

    <para>The dot product of two vectors as used in Equation (1) is a scalar with a magnitude equal to the product of the lengths (magnitudes) of the two vectors times the cosine of the angle between them. If we assume that *μ*<subscript>*m*</subscript> and <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>*<subscript>*o*</subscript> point in the same direction, then the angle between them is zero, the cosine of that angle is 1, and the middle term in Equation (1) becomes the simpler term on the right, *μ*<subscript>*m*</subscript> <emphasis role="bold">∇</emphasis>*B*<subscript>*o*</subscript>, where *μ*<subscript>*m*</subscript> represents the magnitude of *μ*<subscript>*m*</subscript>. Note that <emphasis role="bold">*F</emphasis>*<subscript>*trans*</subscript> is also a vector that points in the same direction as <emphasis role="bold">∇</emphasis>*B*<subscript>*o*</subscript>.

    <para>In terms of MRI safety, values for *F*<subscript>*trans*</subscript> are not necessarily very telling by themselves. For example, while the strength of one person's arm might be more than enough to throw a hammer in dangerous fashion, the same arm is unlikely to get a large file cabinet to budge in any real way. As a rule of thumb, whenever magnetic forces are significantly less than the gravitational pull on the object then the magnetic forces should pose no major safety concern (32, 33), as weight and friction should prevent the object from turning into a projectile. Therefore, in Equation (2) below, the magnitude of *F*<subscript>*trans*</subscript> from Equation (1) is placed in relation to the gravitational force, *F*<subscript>*g*</subscript>, on the same object:</para>
    <para>*F*<subscript>*trans*</subscript>/*F*<subscript>*g*</subscript> = *C X B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> |<emphasis role="bold">∇</emphasis>*B*<subscript>*o*</subscript>| , C = 1/(*μ*<subscript>*o*</subscript> <emphasis role="italics">g</emphasis>) <emphasis role="italics">ρ</emphasis> (2)</para>

The numerical value of the constant C, in ferromagnetic metals, is about 10 m/T<superscript>2</superscript>, a number that will be used in examples later in the text. Note that *F*<subscript>*trans*</subscript> / *F*<subscript>*g*</subscript> depends on *B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> |<emphasis role="bold">∇</emphasis>*B*<subscript>*o*</subscript>|, often referred to as the spatial gradient product (SGP). Equation (2) is independent of how much material there is; while a larger object would lead to a stronger magnetic force it would also be heavier, leaving *F*<subscript>*trans*</subscript> / *F*<subscript>*g*</subscript> unchanged. This "relative magnetic force", *F*<subscript>*trans*</subscript> / *F*<subscript>*g*</subscript>, will prove useful in estimating the degree to which a magnetic field can pull on or attract objects.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Relative Magnetic Force Acting on Ferromagnetic Objects</emphasis>Equation (2) is not always applicable, as saturation and the shape of the object also play a role, as further detailed below. While the term *X B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> in Equation (2) represents the strength of the magnetic flux as created within the object, such flux could not grow to arbitrarily large levels even if the magnitude of the applied field, *B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> were to grow arbitrarily large. Instead, it would plateau once a maximum value is reached. This maximum is the saturation flux density, *B*<subscript>*s*</subscript>. For a given ferromagnetic material, the internal magnetic flux cannot grow beyond *B*<subscript>*s*</subscript> regardless of how large *B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> might become.

For example, in nickel, <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> is around 600 and *B<subscript>s</subscript>* is 0.64 T, thus, Equation (2) is only appropriate wherever *B<subscript>o</subscript>* remains below 1.1 mT. Wherever the material is saturated, Equation (2) should therefore be modified as follows:</para>

    <para>*B<subscript>s</subscript>* in ferromagnetic objects may range from about 0.25 to 2.5 T, with nickel at about 0.64 T and iron at up to around 2.5 T.</para>
    <para>Based on Equation (3), one can estimate how strongly a scanner may attract ferromagnetic objects in its vicinity. The maximum spatial gradient (MSG) on some modern MR systems can exceed 10 T/m and accordingly, from Equation (3), with <emphasis role="italics">C</emphasis> ≈ 10 m/T<superscript>2</superscript>, magnetic forces on objects made of nickel or iron can readily reach 60 or 250 times their weight, respectively. Even for a modest one-pound iron object, one can appreciate how magnetic forces can readily become superhuman in nature, and that no amount of 'holding on tight' to an object might come close to matching them. Such a force is enough, for example, to accelerate an iron object to a speed of 200 km/hr in less than 25 milliseconds.</para>

          <title>Demagnetization Factors</title>
    <para>Magnetization in ferromagnetic objects very much depends on their shape, a fact that Equation (2) does not take into account. As the microscopic domains of ferromagnetic materials become aligned with the applied field, their strong magnetic dipole fields overlap so as to partly cancel each other, effectively reducing the magnitude of <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis>. Alternatively, one may think of the induced magnetic field of the material as having a component that opposes the applied field, referred to as the demagnetizing field (26). The demagnetizing field undermines the work of the externally applied field as it tries to magnetize the material, effectively reducing the susceptibility.</para>
    <para>Figure 1 may help to visualize the idea of the demagnetizing field. The field lines of a single dipole oriented in the <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis>-direction are shown schematically in the figure (see white lines with arrows). Locations where the <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis>-component of the dipole field is positive are highlighted in the drawing on the right. Magnetic material in the highlighted region will be encouraged to align in the same direction as the dipole, i.e., to become magnetized. In contrast, wherever the <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis>-component of the dipole field is negative, as highlighted in the drawing on the left, magnetic materials tend to align opposite the dipole, i.e., to become de-magnetized. A flat object with almost no extent in the <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis>-direction would have a large demagnetizing field, while a slender object aligned along <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis> might be associated with a negligible demagnetizing field. In general, for arbitrarily-shaped ferromagnetic objects, determining the details of this demagnetizing field can be very complex and requires the use of numerical methods.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">42 Principles of MRI Safety Physics</emphasis></para>
    <para>For some simple object geometries, a shape-dependent factor, <emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis>, can be introduced to account for the effects of the demagnetizing field. In this case, Equation (2) is modified by replacing <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> with <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> / (1+<emphasis role="italics">DX</emphasis>):</para>
    <para>*F*<subscript>*trans*</subscript> / *F*<subscript>*g*</subscript> = C <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> / (1 + <emphasis role="italics">DX</emphasis>) *B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> |∇*B*<subscript>*o*</subscript>| , (non saturated ferromagnetic objects) (4)</para>
    <para>where the demagnetization factor, <emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis>, takes on values between 0 and 1. Strictly speaking, Equation (4) assumes the object to be an ellipsoid of revolution (i.e., created by rotating an ellipse about one of its two axes), with the axis of revolution aligned along *B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> (see expression for *F*<subscript>*z*</subscript> in (18) with <emphasis role="italics">θ</emphasis>=0). For very long and slender needle-like objects, <emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis> approaches 0 and <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> / (1+<emphasis role="italics">DX</emphasis>) ≈ <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis>, meaning that Equation (4) becomes equivalent to Equation (2). However, for strongly magnetic materials where <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> &gt;&gt;1, <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> / (1+<emphasis role="italics">DX</emphasis>) ≈ 1 / <emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis>, a number much smaller than <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis>. Let's go through a few more examples involving simply-shaped, strongly-magnetic objects oriented in particular ways with respect to the direction of <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>*<subscript>*o*</subscript>: For a sphere, <emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis> equals 1/3 and therefore the effective susceptibility is just 3, irrespective of the magnitude of <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis>. With a long needle-like object oriented perpendicular to <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>*<subscript>*o*</subscript>, then <emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis> equals 1/2 and the effective susceptibility is 2. Likewise, for a thin plate or film parallel to <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>*<subscript>*o*</subscript>, <emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis> is equal to 0, but if the plate is perpendicular to <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>*<subscript>*o*</subscript>, then <emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis> is equal to 1.</para>
    <para>Overall, for ferromagnetic objects one should use Equation (4) up until the magnitude of the applied field, *B*<subscript>*o*</subscript> , reaches a value equal to *DB*<subscript>*s*</subscript> , where Equation (4) becomes the same as Equation (3). From this point onward, as *B*<subscript>*o*</subscript>, increases further, the object remains fully saturated and one should use Equation (3). When one approaches a clinical MR system,</para>

    <para>Figure 2 shows two relative force maps (*F<subscript>trans</subscript>* / *F<subscript>g</subscript>*) derived using manufacturer supplied magnetic field and spatial gradient data for a commercial 7T MR system where it is assumed that some brave (and/or foolish) soul clutches on to an iron object (*B<subscript>s</subscript>* = 2.2 T) as he or she approaches the magnet. From the map on the left, which shows one quadrant of the MRI magnet and the region just outside the bore, it can be clearly seen that maximal translational forces occur near the bore entry (which is where spatial gradients |∇*B<subscript>o</subscript>*| tend to be the greatest) and in some regions the translational forces can reach hundreds of times the object's weight. Active shielding in modern scanners allows the field to be better contained and scanners to be sited in smaller rooms, but they also tend to make |∇*B<subscript>o</subscript>*| much larger, as the field must transition from nearly zero to full strength in a shorter distance. As a result, dynamic shielding actually makes scanners more dangerous by increasing the magnetic translational forces involved. It can also be seen from the figure that inside the bore, as one gets close to isocenter, *F<subscript>trans</subscript>* approaches zero. This is because the field becomes very uniform there meaning that |∇*B<subscript>o</subscript>*| becomes very small.</para>

Note that the region roughly between the 50 and 200 Gauss lines comes across as a zone where anyone bearing a ferromagnetic object might want to do some deep thinking about the wisdom of advancing further. In (34) we introduced the 'force index', a quantity that can be used to characterize an object according to the degree of relative magnetic force that it would be subjected to if placed in a magnetic field. The force index is equal to *C B<subscript>s</subscript>* in Equation (4) so that one can determine the magnetic force at any location in the magnetic field (relative to its weight) simply by multiplying the force index by the magnitude of the spatial gradient at that location (assuming the object is already saturated as was assumed when constructing the maps in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>). <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> gives the force index as measured for several common objects along with a hypothetical strongly ferromagnetic piece of iron.</para>

            <title>Torque Due to Interaction with a Static Magnetic Field</title>
    <para>In addition to the translational force that moves ferromagnetic objects along the spatial gradient of the magnetic field, there can also be significant torque applied to objects with highly asymmetric shapes such as long cylinders or ellipsoids. Mathematically, the torque on a dipole <emphasis role="bold">*μ&lt;subscript&gt;m&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>* in a magnetic field <emphasis role="bold">*B&lt;subscript&gt;o&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>* is equal to the vector product of <emphasis role="bold">*μ&lt;subscript&gt;m&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>* and <emphasis role="bold">*B&lt;subscript&gt;o&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>* (26):</para>

    <para>where <emphasis role="bold">*T</emphasis>* is the torque. The vector product of two vectors, also known as a cross product, is also a vector: its orientation is orthogonal to the original two, and its magnitude is equal to the product of their lengths times the sine of the angle between them.</para>
    <para>Note how <emphasis role="bold">*T</emphasis>* in Equation (5) differs from *F<subscript>trans</subscript>* in Equation (1) in the sense that it depends on the strength of the *B<subscript>o</subscript>* field as opposed to its spatial gradients. For this reason, maximum torque typically occurs inside the MRI's bore where the field can be very large. For small asymmetrically shaped ferromagnetic objects implanted in the body, the torqueing force may be the dominant safety issue (rather than the translational force) (18), as discussed below.</para>
    <para>Let us define a force, *F<subscript>torque</subscript>*, as the restraining force one would have to apply to the two ends of a ferromagnetic, elongated object (e.g., an ellipsoid of revolution with the length several times the width) to prevent it from rotating and lining up with the field. To make</para>
    <para>this more intuitive, we put the force in relation with the translational force, *F<subscript>trans</subscript>*, on the same object (18). More specifically, the ratio between the maximal values of both of these forces is given below. Of course, the maximal values of these forces do not occur at the same location in/around the scanner as *F<superscript>max</superscript><subscript>torque</subscript>* occurs near the isocenter while *F<superscript>max</superscript><subscript>trans</subscript>* occurs near the entry to the bore. Even so, the ratio between the two forces can help one understand the importance of torqueing as a safety issue, particularly for small implants. We find that,</para>
    <para>*F<superscript>max</superscript><subscript>torque</subscript>* / *F<superscript>max</superscript><subscript>trans</subscript>* = (*B<subscript>o</subscript>*)<subscript>max</subscript> / <emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis> (|∇*B<subscript>o</subscript>*|)<subscript>max</subscript> , (saturated elongated object) (6)</para>
    <para>where <emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis> is the length of the object. As an example, taking typical values for a 3T shielded MRI system with a maximum spatial gradient of 10 T/m, and assuming <emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis>= 1 cm, we find from Equation (6) that the force one needs to apply to the ends of the object to prevent torqueing in the magnetic field can reach 30 times the maximum translational force. Thus, especially in the case of an elongated object implanted into the body, potential damage from torqueing can readily become a greater source of concern than translational forces.</para>
    <para>It may seem at first somewhat counterintuitive that for an object of greater length (larger L in Equation (6) the relative importance of *F<superscript>max</superscript><subscript>torque</subscript>* is reduced compared to *F<superscript>max</superscript><subscript>trans</subscript>*. As an object becomes longer/bigger the torque on it would increase, but so would the translational force and both effects cancel out in the ratio in Equation (6). The remaining 1/ <emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis> dependency in Equation (6) is a consequence of our definition of *F<subscript>torque</subscript>* as the force needed at the ends of the object to prevent rotation: a smaller force is required at the ends of a longer object to oppose rotation, for the same reason as loosening a bolt with a long-handled wrench can be much easier than with a short-handled one.</para>

    <para>For currently available clinical MR systems, magnetic translational forces and torques on diamagnetic and paramagnetic tissues have been estimated and shown to be much too small to be of any safety concern. For example, the tendency of iron-containing red blood cells to separate from plasma due to the differential translational force (Δ*F<subscript>trans</subscript>*) based on the susceptibility difference of the tissues (Δ<emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis>) can be calculated. If one assumes a relatively high but realistic SGP of 25 T<superscript>2</superscript>/m and in Equation (2) replaces <emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> with Δ<emphasis role="italics">X</emphasis> and ρ with Δρ, the difference in density between red blood cells and plasma, then Δ*F<subscript>trans</subscript>* is found to be less than 9% of the difference in gravitational pull (Δ*F<subscript>g</subscript>*) on the tissues (18). Although, for the SPG of 1400 T<superscript>2</superscript>/m that was sufficient to levitate frogs (which admittedly is not a very realistic SPG for a practical human-sized MRI), the Δ*F<subscript>trans</subscript>* would be more than 400% of Δ*F<subscript>g</subscript>*. Accordingly, assuming a suitable magnet were available to a human who was willing to share in the frog's exhilarating experience of magnetic levitation, there might also be a partial separation of their red blood cells from plasma in the process, with unknown health effects.</para>

Whether these vestibular symptoms may be caused by magnetic forces, for example, those resulting from anisotropic susceptibility or from the magnetohydrodynamic effect, or whether they may be related to induced currents associated with motion in the magnetic field, still remains unclear (20).</para>
    <para>Another potential force effect comes from current-carrying tissue structures being physically pulled one way or another by the Lorentz force. As charged particles move in a magnetic field, a force emerges that is perpendicular to both the direction of motion and the field:</para>

The magnitude of the Lorentz force on current-carrying metallic conductors can be significant as will be discussed in the section on gradients.

Such interactions fall under the general category of magnetohydrodynamics and the effects in the body have been studied extensively (36-38). Blood flowing in a direction orthogonal to a magnetic field experiences a reverse pressure impeding the flow but this is expected to result in an insignificant increase in blood pressure even in a high field MRI (36, 37). Of greater practical concern is that positive and negative ions in blood are pushed in opposite directions by the Lorentz force, causing a charge separation and an electric field that corrupts electrocardiograms and complicates the task of performing cardiac-gated MRI (39-41).</para>

            <title>Effects of Movement in a Strong Static Magnetic Field</title>
    <para>It is well known that movement in a magnetic field can induce a voltage (due to Faraday's law of induction to be discussed in more detail later) in electrically conductive materials including biological tissues, especially when the motion is through regions of space where the magnetic field changes steeply. For example, near the entry to the bore of a 3T MRI where |∇*B*<subscript>*o*</subscript>| tends to be greatest, it can be shown that current densities over 0.1 A/m<superscript>2</superscript> may be produced in conductive tissues due to the voltage induced by normal movement (42, 43). This is more than twice the 0.04 A/m<superscript>2</superscript> (low frequency) limit for exposure of workers recommended by the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) (44). While there is controversy regarding whether the ICNIRP limit might be too conservative, currents induced in tissue deserve serious attention as a potential MRI safety concern especially when new high-field MR systems are introduced. Furthermore, because the magnitude of the induced current is proportional to conductivity, significant current densities may also be generated in metals used in implants. For example, currents induced in metallic heart valves have been studied over such concerns (45).</para>

Compared to the magnitude of the main *B<subscript>o</subscript>* field, which is strong and static, the magnitude of the magnetic field component of the transmitted RF field (often referred to as *B*<subscript>1</subscript>) is weak and oscillates at the Larmor frequency, which is about 128 MHz at 3T.

    <para>here. Dividing the SAR in Equation (9) by the heat capacity of tissue, which is around 4200 J/kg/°C, one obtains the rate at which tissue is expected to heat if it had no independent way of cooling itself.

A volume of tissue subjected to this energy deposition will be heated 1°C (the FDA exposure limit) in 1000 seconds, or about 17 minutes, again assuming there is no cooling during this period.</para>
    <para>In order to meet regulatory requirements, it is necessary to measure or calculate the SAR for MRI pulse sequences. A rough estimate of the SAR at the surface of the body may be obtained using a simple loop model (13). Based on the Maxwell-Faraday equation (i.e., Equation (8)), in a surface ring of tissue of radius, <emphasis role="italics">R</emphasis>, exposed to a uniform RF field, an electric field would be generated in the loop with peak magnitude as follows:</para>
    <para>*E<subscript>P</subscript>* = π *f B<subscript>P</subscript>R* (10)</para>
    <para>where <emphasis role="italics">f</emphasis> is the Larmor frequency (in Hz) and *B<subscript>P</subscript>* is the peak amplitude of the magnetic field component of the electromagnetic field produced by the RF coil. Equation (10) predicts the behavior of the <emphasis role="bold">*E</emphasis>* field as seen in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>, in the sense that the length of the arrows in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis> increases linearly with <emphasis role="italics">R</emphasis>, the distance from the center of the phantom. More specifically, in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italics">R</emphasis> would be the size of a circle, centered with the simulated phantom, where a time-varying <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>* field generates an <emphasis role="bold">*E</emphasis>* field.

    <para>SAR = <superscript>σ</superscript>/<subscript>2ρ</subscript> (π*fB<subscript>P</subscript>R*)<superscript>2</superscript> (11)</para>
    <para>Equation (11) is the usual expression for SAR, as widely published and employed. Although simplistic in some ways detailed below, the equation is useful in the sense that it shows some important trends such as SAR increasing with the square of both <emphasis role="italics">f</emphasis> and *B<subscript>P</subscript>*.</para>
    <para>Overall, the assumption that Equation (10) gives the true value of E<subscript>P</subscript> (and thus Equation (11) gives the true SAR) is reasonably accurate for low frequency excitations (e.g., below 10 MHz). Simulations reveal, however, that even at a frequency of 42.58 MHz, the Larmor frequency at 1 T, the estimate of the magnitude of the electric field based on Equation (10) is not accurate. Why is this?</para>
    <para>Looking back at <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis> we are reminded that the oscillating <emphasis role="bold">*B</emphasis>*<subscript>1</subscript> field generated by the RF coil induces an electric field <emphasis role="bold">*E</emphasis>*<subscript>1</subscript> and, in a conducting medium, a circulating conduction current density equal to σ<emphasis role="bold">*E</emphasis>*<subscript>1</subscript>.

    <para>We examine here the potential for MRI to overheat tissue. As an example, consider a raw turkey that, because it is not living tissue, has no capacity to cool from circulating blood. We further assume that the turkey is perfectly insulated (perhaps in an 'ideal' Styrofoam block) so that there is zero heat loss from its surface. The turkey is placed in 3T MRI and subjected to irradiation from a RF train comprised of 90° RF hard pulses of duration <emphasis role="italics">T</emphasis> = 0.5 msec and peak amplitude = *B<subscript>p</subscript>* μT. Since the frequency due to the RF excitation is equal to 42.58 × *B<subscript>p</subscript>* cycles per second (with *B<subscript>p</subscript>* expressed in μT), and a 90° pulse represents 1/4 of a cycle:</para>
    <para>0.25/(42.58 × *B<subscript>p</subscript>*) = <emphasis role="italics">T</emphasis>, *B<subscript>p</subscript>* = 0.25/(42.58 × <emphasis role="italics">T</emphasis>) = 0.25/(42.58 × (0.5 × 10<superscript>-3</superscript>)) = 11.75 μT.</para>
    <para>Assuming the radius, <emphasis role="italics">R</emphasis>, of the turkey in the sagittal plane is 15 cm, from Eq.11 we obtain:</para>
    <para>SAR = 0.5/(2 × 1000)(π 127.7 × 11.75 × 0.15)<superscript>2</superscript> = 125 <superscript>W</superscript>/<subscript>kg</subscript>.</para>
    <para>This maximum SAR would occur at the surface, where <emphasis role="italics">R</emphasis> = 15 cm, and it is assumed here that the whole-turkey SAR would be only 40% of the peak SAR. Furthermore, with a duty cycle of 1/2 (i.e. one pulse every 1 msec), which reduces the SAR by a factor of 2, the rate of heating, *H<subscript>r</subscript>*, would be:</para>
    <para>*H<subscript>r</subscript>* = (0.5 × 0.4) × *SAR<emphasis role="italics">/</emphasis>s* = 0.5 × 0.4 × 125/4200 = 0.006 °C/<subscript>s</subscript> = 21.4 °C/<subscript>hour</subscript></para>
    <para>where a specific heat, <emphasis role="italics">s</emphasis>, of 4200 Joules/°C/s is used. Assuming the turkey is cold (10 °C) when entering the MRI and is cooked once it reaches 75 °C, then it would take just over 3 hours to cook, similar to the time taken to cook in an oven.</para>
    <para>In reality, it would be very difficult to prevent heat loss, and unfortunate dinner guests would likely be presented with a somewhat raw turkey.

Ampere's law applies to all currents and, as shown schematically by the drawing on the right side of <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>, this also includes those eddy currents generated through Faraday induction that were discussed above. Thus, there is a new induced <emphasis role="bold">*B&lt;subscript&gt;i&lt;/subscript&gt;</emphasis>* field that combines with the original source RF field and, because of this, the magnitude of the generated electric field no longer has a simple dependence on the transmitted field, *B<subscript>p</subscript>*.

While solutions involving these simple models may be useful in elucidating the basic behavior of electromagnetic waves in conductive tissue, they are limited when it comes to obtaining direct answers as to what SAR can be expected for a human MRI exam. For this, numerical methods, which are not constrained to solving for simple geometries in homogeneous media, are typically employed (46). A good general discussion of the use of numerical field calculations for MRI safety applications can be found in (47-49) and with respect to the RF field specifically in (50).</para>
    <para>Obtaining accurate SAR estimates <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> is especially complicated by the fact that the human body has a complex geometry and is not uniform in terms of its electrical properties (51). Conductivities, for example, can vary by as much as an order of magnitude between tissue types. Attempts have been made to develop human body models that, when used with numerical simulation techniques, may give accurate estimates of SAR (52-61). A more direct and potentially more accurate approach to estimate SAR is to use actual MR images, for example, obtaining *B*<subscript>1</subscript> maps that may then be used to estimate the <emphasis role="bold">*E</emphasis>* field and derive the SAR distribution (62-65), although it has been shown that significant changes in SAR and heating distributions are not necessarily reflected in *B*<subscript>1</subscript> changes (51). Thermo-acoustic imaging has also been investigated as a method for direct SAR mapping (66).</para>
    <para>It is important to note that, for the purposes of safety monitoring, SAR is merely used as a surrogate measure for the potential to cause tissue damage. The real problem is heating. Numerical models that use SAR, not as the endpoint, but as input to estimate resultant temperature changes in the body via, for example, the Pennes bioheat transfer equation, have been employed to this end (67-72). An even more direct means of determining the likelihood of tissue damage is to obtain <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> temperature maps through MR-based temperature mapping using the fact that the water resonant frequency is temperature dependent (73-78).</para>

          <title>RF Interaction with Metallic Objects Forming Loops</title>
    <para>As long as the MR system is functioning properly and limits regarding SAR are respected, no dangerous heating (or cooking of turkeys) should occur during routine MRI as a result of RF irradiation. It is still possible, however, to cause serious tissue damage when conductive metallic objects are present in patients. Currents generated by the RF field in these objects do not significantly affect global SAR, but they can focus energy deposition in small volumes and create localized tissue damage.</para>
    <para>Let us consider a copper loop placed perpendicular to the RF field orientation and examine Equation (11), which was used when estimating the SAR of a ring of tissue. The conductivity of copper is about 8 orders of magnitude higher than that of biological tissues, and its density is close to 10 times that of tissue.

    <para>the situation is much different for the <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis> field and the resultant SAR in the region of the ring gap. The SAR is greatly elevated over the level seen in the rest of the tissue, with potential for significant local tissue damage. The importance of avoiding loops containing metal was shown by Bennet, et al. (80), who demonstrated significant heating in a metallic radiosurgery head frame at the tips of screws that clamp the frame to the head. Loops of cables that come in contact with the body also have the potential to cause burns and should be avoided.</para>
    <para>Although a less likely scenario, there is also the potential that a loop-containing implanted device might act as a circuit in resonance (79, 81, 82), in which case large amounts of energy may be transferred, possibly resulting in destruction of the device and damage to surrounding tissues. An un-blanked receive coil would be an example (83).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Example V: Heating of a silver earring in the RF field</emphasis></para>
    <para>Consider the potential heating of an earring made from thick silver wire (diameter, *d<subscript>w</subscript>*) forming a loop (diameter, <emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis>) and oriented perpendicular to the RF field direction of a 3T MRI scanner. The figure shows the earring along with a circuit representation of the induction of EMF in the loop by the *B*<subscript>1</subscript> RF field.</para>
    <para>The EMF induced in the loop by the *B*<subscript>1</subscript> field generates a current that will itself generate a magnetic field that counters the driving field. A measure of the loop's resistance to the change of current is its inductance, <emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis>. The magnitude of this resistance (or impedance) is linearly dependent on frequency and equal to 2π<emphasis role="italics">fL</emphasis>, where <emphasis role="italics">f</emphasis> is the frequency of the *B*<subscript>1</subscript> field. An empirical relation for inductance of a single coil wire loop is as follows:</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis> = μ<subscript>o</subscript> <superscript>*D*l</superscript>/<subscript>2</subscript> [ln(8 <superscript>*D*l</superscript>/<subscript>*dw*</subscript>) − 1.75],</para>
    <para>where *D<subscript>l</subscript>* is the diameter of the loop and *d<subscript>w</subscript>* is the diameter of the wire. <emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis> for a ring with loop diameter of 25 mm and 'wire' diameter of 2.5 mm is 4.13 × 10<superscript>−8</superscript> Henry. The impedance, <emphasis role="italics">Z</emphasis>, due to this inductance is:</para>
    <para>2π<emphasis role="italics">fL</emphasis> = 2 × π × 127.7 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> × 4.13 × 10<superscript>−8</superscript> = 33.1<emphasis role="italics">i</emphasis> Ω.</para>
    <para>This should be compared to the impedance (resistance) of the silver ring (where the length around the ring's circumference = 2π<emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis> and the cross-sectional area of the ring's band = π(*d*/2)<superscript>2</superscript>):</para>
    <para>π*D*/σ<subscript>(silver)</subscript> π(*d*/2)<superscript>2</superscript> = π × 2.5 × 10<superscript>−2</superscript>/6.3 × 10<superscript>7</superscript> × π(1.25 × 10<superscript>−3</superscript>)<superscript>2</superscript> = 0.000254 Ω.</para>
    <para>Clearly, the magnitude of the impedance due to the inductance (33.1 Ω) is much greater than the electrical resistance of the silver (0.000254 Ω) and should therefore be used to determine the heating.</para>
    <para>Rate of heating in an unbroken loop of silver:</para>
    <para>*H<subscript>s</subscript>* = *EMF*<superscript>2</superscript>/2 |<emphasis role="italics">Z</emphasis>|/(ρ *V<subscript>ol</subscript> s*) = 1<superscript>2</superscript>/2(33.1)/((1.05 × 10<superscript>4</superscript>) π(1.25 × 10<superscript>−3</superscript>)<superscript>2</superscript> π(2.5 × 10<superscript>−2</superscript>)(2.4 × 10<superscript>2</superscript>)) = 0.015 <superscript>o</superscript>C/<subscript>s</subscript>,</para>
    <para>where *V<subscript>ol</subscript>* is the volume of the ring = π<emphasis role="italics">D</emphasis> × π(<superscript>d</superscript>/<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript> and the EMF is assumed to be 1 Volt (*B*<subscript>1</subscript> of 2.5μT).</para>
    <para>Though we find a relatively low rate of heating in this earring compared to what would be calculated based only on the resistance of the silver, it should be noted that the heating rate is still 15 times greater than tissue heating with a maximum allowable SAR of 4 W/kg.</para>
