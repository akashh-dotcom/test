   <para id="ch0024s0000p0064">Several conceptual issues need greater attention in future research and interventions on social support and health. As noted earlier, received support can be associated with negative influences on health if that support is not seen as responsive (Stanton et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0117">2019</link>). Interventions that seek to mobilize support from either similar peers or family and friends should be sure that support is responsive to individuals in order to provide either direct or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related beneficial links to health behaviors and related outcomes (see <link linkend="ch0024s0000a0022">Figure 10.2</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0065">Quality of relationships is another factor that can influence the responsiveness of support that has not been considered strongly in prior work. A recent study found that among US adults, high‐quality social relationships functioned as a buffer between psychosocial <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and depressive symptoms (Kaveladze et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0073">2020</link>). However, while relationships with others may be sources of warmth and love, these social relationships can also be sources of conflict and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, resulting in relationships that have a mix of both positive and negative qualities (i.e., ambivalent relationships) (Holt‐Lunstad &amp; Uchino, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0061">2019</link>). This work suggests that such ambivalent ties are related to less effective support provision and greater biological risk for disease (Holt‐Lunstad &amp; Uchino, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0061">2019</link>). Future work should consider the quality of relationships, given that it may affect health‐relevant support processes.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0066">Future research also should consider social support in the context of a changing social climate. Despite the increases in technology that would presumably foster social connections, people are reporting greater social isolation and loneliness. When surveyed during the height of the 2020 pandemic, an estimated 36% of American respondents reported experiencing serious loneliness within the past four weeks, making loneliness one of the most widespread mental health conditions in the country (Weissbourd et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0136">2021</link>). Hawkley et al. (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0058">2021</link>) found that remote social contact does not replace in‐person contact to protect mental health of older adults. Future research should explore the nuanced impact of digital technology to enhance perceived and received social support.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0067">Given the increase in the extent to which individuals rely on digital communication (in the form of online social networking, texting, telehealth, etc.), there is a need for greater attention to the health relevance of online social support. Although this is a burgeoning area of research, there are still important gaps in our understanding. For instance, research must distinguish between social support gained from exclusively online relationships (e.g., online support groups and chat groups) and support from friends and look at how in‐person and online social support can and should complement each other, especially when looking at older generations versus younger generations (Benvenuti et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0020">2020</link>; Cole et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0040">2017</link>). Moving forward, it will be important to examine what pathways may be capitalized on, and what pathways may be absent, when individuals seek or provide support using online tools.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0068">Finally, future research should consider the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐buffering effects of social support in racial/ethnic minority groups where discrimination that has acute and chronic negative health outcomes has been historically present (see also<ulink url="ch0026">Chapter 12</ulink>).</para>
