   <para id="ch0035s0000p0011">PRECEDE‐PROCEED has been a cornerstone of health promotion practice for more than fifty years and has been used for planning health promotion interventions globally with more than 1600 published works describing its use as of August 2023 (<ulink url="http://www.lgreen.net">http://www.lgreen.net</ulink>). Developed in the 1970s, PRECEDE‐PROCEED began to influence the health education field by describing an outcome‐focused approach to planning that incorporates three categories of factors that influence behavior and, ultimately health problems: predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors. Of particular importance is the model’s ecological approach to planning, which considers the relationships between individuals and their environments and incorporates multiple levels of influence on health and quality of life, including genetic, behavioral, social, and environmental factors (Bronfenbrenner, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0043">1979</link>; Marmot, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0068">2000</link>) (see <ulink url="ch0015">Chapter 3</ulink>). This model helps planners map these influences and recognize how they can influence health (Green et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0058">2022</link>).</para>

   <beginpage pagenum="242"/>
   <para id="ch0035s0000p0012">The model emphasizes involvement of community members, particularly those directly affected by health problems and those who will be most influenced by programs or policy changes. This approach recognizes that community members’ knowledge, experience, and insights concerning their health and quality of life, the behavioral and environmental conditions affecting them, and that their predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling influences, are critical to effective program planning. Community members, including potential intervention implementers and participants, help ensure that the intervention is locally relevant, and develop capacity in intervention development and evaluation.</para>
   <para id="ch0035s0000p0013">PRECEDE‐PROCEED has eight phases: four planning phases, one implementation/process evaluation phase, and three evaluation phases (Green et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0058">2022</link>). The first three phases help develop a logic model (theory) of the problem, starting with an assessment of quality of life and associated health problems that contribute to decreases in quality of life. Recognizing health, social conditions, and quality of life as closely intertwined and mutually influencing, the model leads planners through an analysis of the causes of health problems at multiple ecological levels and helps planners focus on determinants of health‐related behaviors and environments. The latter phases of the PRECEDE‐PROCEED framework are the PROCEED phases, which focus on the implementation, evaluation, and maintenance of health interventions (<anchor id="ch0035s0000a0011"/>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0015">Planners can use a variety of sources to better understand quality of life concerns.

      <anchor id="ch0035s0000a0019"/>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0020">In this phase, health planners carry out a<emphasis>behavioral and environmental assessment</emphasis> to identify what behaviors and environmental factors cause the health problem(s) and quality‐of‐life conditions. In the view of the model’s authors, behavior can be thought of as occurring at three levels: (1) proximal behaviors, the direct actions or inactions of individuals or groups of individuals that are known to influence their own health or that of others who depend on them, e.g., their infants; (2) interpersonal behaviors, actions or inactions of others who have a direct impact on the social or physical environment of individuals <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10304">at risk</ulink> and thus influence their actions or inactions, e.g., parental policies regarding teen driving, and (3) distal behaviors, policy and enforcement actions, individually or collectively, on or by people acting in an organizational or policy environment (<ulink url="ch0018">Chapter 5</ulink> in Green et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0058">2022</link>). The behavioral analysis describes what the at‐risk group does that increases risk of experiencing the health problem. In the case of secondary and tertiary prevention, the analysis investigates what individuals do that increases the risk of disability or death from a health problem they already have. For example, lack of adherence to prescribed dietary, physical activity, and medication advice is a major barrier to the effective treatment of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> and can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to the disease and increased disease burden (morbidity or mortality).</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0021">The<emphasis>behavioral assessment</emphasis> includes the following: (1) listing potential behavioral risks related to the health problem; (2) rating the importance and changeability of the behaviors; (3) choosing behavioral targets based on their dual ratings, and (4) specifying behavioral objectives. Typically, but not always, behaviors rated of greatest importance and changeability are selected as targets for action. In “d,” behavioral objectives should include who is expected to change, the desired behavior or health practice to be achieved, how much change is to be achieved, and when the desired change is expected to occur.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0022">The<emphasis>environmental assessment</emphasis> includes conditions in the social, physical, and biologic (including genetic) environments that influence the health problem directly or through its behavioral causes. In most analyses of health problems, the environment plays a significant and modifiable role in causing the problem either directly, such as exposure to <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink>‐contaminated dust in <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4879">poisoning</ulink>, or indirectly through behavior and policies, such as lack of smoking bans in the workplace. In the case of genetics, a currently nonmodifiable factor may be quite important in understanding the health problem and identifying affected groups. Steps in the environmental analysis include selection of the most important and changeable environmental factors and specification of the environmental objective(s). In cases where environmental factors are too encompassing and complex for the scope of the project, PRECEDE‐PROCEED authors recommend emphasizing additional social (organizational and economic) determinants that interact with behavior and are changeable by social action or policy change.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0023">Several theories are useful when describing behavior and environment. For example, Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) (see<ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>) focuses on the reciprocal interaction of behavior and environment. Additionally, some theories are important for specifying the details of the behavior targeted for change. For example, Self‐Regulation Theory (Vohs &amp; Baumeister, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0085">2016</link>), theories of goal setting and planning (Latham &amp; Arshoff, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0066">2015</link>), and the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (Prochaska, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0075">2013</link>) (see <ulink url="ch0020">Chapter 7</ulink>) are theories that can help understand the steps people engage in to change behavior (see <link linkend="ch0035s0000a0016">Table 19.1</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0024">This phase identifies and categorizes antecedents of behaviors and environmental conditions selected in the Phase 2 analysis as predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing. Predisposing factors refer to those factors that make individuals or communities more likely to engage in a particular health behavior or to have a particular health outcome. These factors are among the determinants that influence whether someone is inclined to adopt a certain behavior or make lifestyle choices that affect their health. Enabling factors facilitate changes in behavior and the environment—resources, social support, and skills. Reinforcing factors follow a behavior and provide the continuing reward or incentive for the action(s). (Fernandez et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0049">2019</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0025">These categories of factors all influence behavior and the environment directly or through their interactions. Once identified, selecting specific determinants to prioritize will depend not only on their importance and changeability but also on the resources and context available to address them. Additionally, the timing of the order in which these determinants are addressed can be informed by theory. For example, using the Transtheoretical Model (<ulink url="ch0020">Chapter 7</ulink>) would suggest that if the population or community does not have correct knowledge about the risk and behavior change needed or does not believe taking action will result in a positive outcome, then addressing predisposing factors should be the first priority.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0026">Key constructs that address behavioral antecedents that can apply both to the at‐risk group and to agents responsible for environmental conditions can be found in several theories/models, including: Health Belief Model (perceived severity and susceptibility, barriers and benefits, cues to action, and self‐efficacy) (<ulink url="ch0018">Chapter 5</ulink>); Theory of Planned Behavior (attitudes, subjective norms, intention, and perceived behavioral control) (<ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 6</ulink>); and Social Cognitive Theory (self‐efficacy, behavioral capability, and outcome expectations) (<ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>) (see <link linkend="ch0035s0000a0016">Table 19.1</link>).</para>

As Escoffery and Green put it: “Fundamentally, implementation challenges the notion that having a good idea or plan is enough.” It asks, “How will that idea or plan express itself as action in the real world?” (<ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink> in Green et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0058">2022</link>). Thus, researchers are explicitly encouraged to contribute to an understanding of how interventions “work” in real‐life situations.</para>

Such data can be sourced from manuals, a timeline, and a work plan that can be used for training and supervision as well as identification/development of the sources of data to monitor the program for process evaluation (Phase 5).</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0030">In the PROCEED Phases 5–8, the planner reaches back to the logic model of change, program objectives, program components, and the implementation plan to design data collection plans for evaluating the process (program monitoring), short and long‐term outcomes, and economics.<emphasis>Process evaluation</emphasis> determines how well the program was implemented according to protocol. Short‐term and intermediate evaluations assess “near‐term” effects on predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors, as well as on behavioral and environmental factors. Finally, long‐term outcome evaluation determines the effect of the program on health and quality of life indicators. Typically, the measurable objectives that are written in each phase of PRECEDE‐PROCEED serve as milestones against which accomplishments are evaluated. Economic evaluation assesses the costs and consequences of one or more programs.</para>
