      <para id="ch0025s0000p0001">Maria was an average high school student. She liked learning but did not care for the hours spent sitting inside classrooms listening to teachers drone on about things she really did not care about. It was early March 2020, and Maria was looking forward to finishing her junior year of high school. There were a lot of new things to look forward to, like junior prom, visiting potential colleges and having the freedom to visit friends after getting her driver’s license. When news started circulating about a strange and concerning new disease called COVID that she heard could be fatal to older and other vulnerable people. Maria did not think much of it and assumed it would not be a huge deal. The following week, though, her school sent everyone home, and now, they would be doing school online.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0002">Maria was depressed. Yes, she hated school, but now realized how much she missed seeing her friends every day and hanging out between classes and during lunch. She even missed seeing the people she barely knew and the random conversations that sometimes happened in the classroom. She knew she needed to keep her distance from everyone, because if she contracted COVID, she could give it to more vulnerable family members. Maria’s grandmother lived in their home, and Maria certainly did not want to accidentally expose her and get her sick.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0003">She now realized this strange paradox. Being with her friends could put her and her loved ones <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10304">at risk</ulink> for a potentially fatal disease. Yet, not seeing these friends was making her feel <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, depression, and overall bored and bummed out. Maria found herself spending all her time online: in classes via Zoom, on Instagram sending memes and random pictures to her friends, scrolling through TikTok, and simultaneously Snapchatting with her friends to stay in contact. These online connections helped relieve her boredom, but they also brought her attention to messages and videos being shared online that said COVID was a hoax and no reason for concern.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0004">Some of Maria’s friends were secretly hanging out together and said COVID was no big deal, but they did not have grandparents or older family members in their households. Maria was conflicted. Her friends insisted there was nothing to be worried about, but she wanted to protect her grandmother. When one of her friends got very sick from COVID, Maria realized it was a real threat, and she started sharing accurate information with her friends via her social media and also in group chats. She was worried that if people did not begin to take things seriously, it might be a long time before life went back to “normal.”</para>
