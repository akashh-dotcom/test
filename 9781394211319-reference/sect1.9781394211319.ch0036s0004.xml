   <para id="ch0036s0000p0042">Whereas traditional economic theories justify seemingly poor decisions as reflections of some implied but hidden rational choice, behavioral economics sees our seemingly poor decisions as errors that can be corrected or even prevented. Many people have trouble dieting, exercising, and saving money and are prone to procrastination even when the cumulative consequences are severe. While many commercial enterprises exploit these decision errors, the potential of behavioral economics lies in the growing evidence that some of the same messages, incentives, and choice structures used so effectively to lure people into situations where they may be exploited can be redirected to attract them to healthier choices that improve their long‐term well‐being. The potential for using insights from behavioral economics to improve health behavior is substantial. In fact, in the past decade, many organizations, health systems, and even governments have begun to implement and test interventions that are motivated by behavioral economics. Ongoing efforts like these have substantial potential to improve health outcomes globally. At the same time, additional pathways and opportunities to improve health are also necessary because nudges and other behavioral economics interventions may be insufficient. For example, raising taxes on cigarettes and other unhealthy goods where it is in the public interest to consume less is a powerful economic policy tool. When these types of “structural” policies and measures are implemented alongside behavioral economics interventions, major improvements in population health are possible.</para>
