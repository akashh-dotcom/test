   <para id="ch0014s0000p0048">No text can be all‐inclusive nor can it meet the needs of all potential audiences. This book is not a how‐to guide or manual for program planning and development in health education and health behavior. Other books in health behavior, nursing, medicine, psychology, and nutrition serve that purpose, and readers should seek out key sources in each discipline for more on the “nuts and bolts” of practice. This volume will be most useful when it is included as part of a problem‐oriented learning program, whether in a <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Formal">formal</ulink> professional education setting or through continuing education venues.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0049">Readers should emerge from reading this edition with a critical appraisal of theory and with the curiosity to pursue not only the theories presented in this book but other promising theories as well. This book is a starting point, not the end. Theories—and conceptual frameworks—can be and<emphasis>are</emphasis> useful because they enrich, inform, and complement the practical technologies of health promotion and education. Thus, the readers of this book should “pass with relief from the tossing sea of Cause and Theory to the firm ground of Result and Fact” (Churchill, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0046">1898</link>). As the ocean meets the shore, we hope you will find that theory, research, and practice can converge in a single landscape of improved health for all.</para>
