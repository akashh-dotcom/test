   <title>Methodology and Measurement in Research on Social Media and Health</title>
   <anchor id="ch0038s0003a0001"/>
   <anchor id="ch0038s0000a0022"/>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0022">Almost every review of the literature on the use and effects of social media on health raises methodological and measurement challenges (Kross et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0042">2021</link>; Orben, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0050">2020</link>; Valkenburg, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0062">2022</link>). Early research dating back to 2005 through 2010s mainly used self‐report and cross‐sectional methods, and studies did not examine the effects of social media on health over time (Kross et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0042">2021</link>). While there has been an increase in the number of longitudinal and experimental studies, researchers have argued that a need remains for research that allows for study of within‐person associations of social media use with health (Valkenburg, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0062">2022</link>). While most studies that examined the effects of social media use on health have used conventional methods (e.g., cross‐sectional, longitudinal, and/or experimental), some studies about use of social media platforms for public health surveillance (tracking and predicting diseases) have employed additional, innovative methods such as data mining and natural language processing (Merchant et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0048">2019</link>). Because social media‐based surveillance systems can have many limitations and challenges, including noise, demographic bias, privacy issues, etc., the best methods may be hybrid studies that supplement traditional surveillance data with data from search queries, social media posts, and crowdsourcing (Aiello et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0015">2020</link>; Gupta &amp; Katarya, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0039">2020</link>). These innovative methods have also been used to investigate social media as a tool or platform for health interventions.</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0023">Measurement approaches that can account for the complex nature of users’ social media experiences are also still needed. Research should distinguish between measuring the amount of use, type of use (e.g., active versus passive), extent of users’ engagement (e.g., emotional connection), valence of experience (positive versus negative), type of platform used, and the type of content consumed. Moreover, according to a recent systematic review, most studies (about 80%) do not use any theories (Bekalu et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0025">2023</link>). More theory‐based studies would enhance our understanding of the mechanisms and conditions that characterize the effects of social media use on health behavior and health outcomes.</para>
