   <para id="ch0028s0000p0007">The central theme of Part Four is that we must understand, predict, and know how to influence the social systems and structures that provide the context for health behaviors. We need models that help those who facilitate or <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> change efforts and/or study them to be more effective in their efforts to create healthier institutions and communities. A focus on integrating communities and the importance of their voice, values, and views is central to understanding the interplay between behavior and health. Change within and among systems, organizational processes, and communication channels are apparent across each of the chapters, as are changes in political and information environments. We emphasize implementation of EBIs, scaling up and dissemination to maximize impact while preventing/reducing health disparities and increasing health equity.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0008">Each chapter in this section of the book addresses a broad perspective, approach, or type of strategy—rather than a single theory. The chapters then describe, synthesize, and apply key theories, frameworks, and models that have been found useful for addressing the core issues of the chapter. It is notable that the theories and models focus attention on interpersonal, community/organizational, and policy/environment levels of action, as well as the individual level, as applicable.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0009">Chapters in this section bring together longstanding approaches with new concepts and strategies to understand health behaviors and facilitate positive changes. In<ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink>, Bailey discusses the differences and impact of race and racism providing a historical context noting that race is a social construct and a symbol or marker of processes of racism, an organized social system where a dominant racial group uses its power to devalue, disempower and differentially allocate societal resources and opportunities to groups they identify as inferior. The difference is important to consider as Bailey suggests that a focus on individual or interpersonal experiences of racism invalidates the broader impact of structural racism that may be captured in existing health behavior models.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0010">In<ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink>, Keaweˋaimoku Kaholokula and co‐authors refocus the ideas of models of community organization and community building under the umbrella of <emphasis>community engagement</emphasis>. These newer models emphasize community engagement as a health equity strategy that includes both community‐based and community‐driven principles and actions. The focus is on longer‐term community assets and capacity building rather than being solely problem‐driven. While this is not a new concept (Minkler, <link linkend="ch0028s0000li0006">2000</link>), it is updated in a broader context in this chapter.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0011">Keaweˋaimoku Kaholokula and co‐authors define community capacity, empowerment and critical consciousness, participation and relevance, and health equity under the umbrella of discussing what is a community, and describe how consideration of each of these principles alone or in combination are strategies to address multiple health‐related concerns.<ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink> also provides a detailed discussion of CBPR and the need to consider research and measurement issues to test CBPR. <ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink> by Ramanadhan and Shelton analyzes major concepts within implementation, dissemination and diffusion of public health innovations, and the critical importance of bridging the gap between health promotion research, policy, and practice. The chapter describes how to understand what an EBI is and the importance of blending individual, organizational, and system change. The authors examine the main types of dissemination and implementation frameworks to understand how innovations can be spread and to simultaneously promote dissemination and implementation of EBIs.</para>

   <para id="ch0028s0000p0012">In<ulink url="ch0032">Chapter 17</ulink>, Gollust and Nagler discuss both planned and unplanned approaches to communication as we conceptualize audiences and media effects. They consider both the individual‐level communication effects along with societal‐level communication effects to explore how the public information environment (framing, narratives, agenda setting, and priming) shapes the public’s attitudes, beliefs, and consequently their health‐related behaviors. These features cut across a range of considerations about mass media: its application in social action and advocacy; and communication regarding health risks, especially those risks with broad public health implications.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0013">Because each chapter in this section draws on multiple theoretical traditions that contribute to important areas of health behavior and health education, rather than presenting single or unified theories, there is much for readers to digest in each chapter. This synthesis focuses on similarities among the models, draws common themes, and critiques their usefulness for research and practice in health behavior and public health.</para>
