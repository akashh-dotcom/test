      <ulink url="ch0038">Chapter 22</ulink> by Bekalu and Viswanath is new for this edition, focusing on the burgeoning use of social media and health. The authors discuss evidence for associations between social media use, health behaviors, and health, and describe examples of interventions for smoking cessation and COVID‐19 mitigation that use social media to improve health and health behavior.</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0015">Social media is a broadly defined communication channel and process, not a specific theory or organized approach to developing interventions or messages. It straddles several theoretical frameworks presented earlier in the book, including media effects theories, social networks, and social support. Bekalu and Viswanath zero in on two issues: (1) social media use as a behavior and how it affects mental and physical health outcomes, and (2) the role and effects of social media platforms and networks as channels for health interventions.</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0016">The latter issue, use of social media to deliver health behavior interventions, is most directly tied to the other chapters’ emphasis on use of theory in research and practice. Such strategies are a type of “digital strategy,” which has become increasingly widely used, and often use theoretical foundations (Ajie &amp; Chapman‐Novakofski,<link linkend="ch0034s0000li0010">2014</link>; Swindle et al., <link linkend="ch0034s0000li0017">2022</link>). Key questions in considering social‐media‐based interventions are whether they attract the intended audience (Heckman et al., <link linkend="ch0034s0000li0015">2021</link>) and whether they are effective when disseminated beyond initial efficacy testing.</para>
