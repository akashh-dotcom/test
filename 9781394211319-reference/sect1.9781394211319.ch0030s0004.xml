   <title>Community Engagement in Practice</title>
   <anchor id="ch0030s0004a0001"/>
   <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0020"/>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0031">In addition to the core concepts and principles described thus far, TIPS exemplifies the evolving and dynamic role of community leaders, members, and organizations, and their engagement in all aspects of a public‐health research project. The researchers started by seeking input from African American church leaders before the start of the project to collaboratively involve them in needs assessment, capacity building, intervention development, implementation, testing and dissemination efforts. In this section, we show how the practice of community engagement falls on a continuum representing various levels of involvement. We also describe some of the models and frameworks that inform these different levels of engagement.</para>

      <title>Community Engagement Continua</title>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0004a0002"/>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0021"/>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0032">Russel et al. (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0065">2008</link>) developed the Active Community Engagement (ACE) Continuum to characterize community engagement along a continuum based on how deeply involved the community and experts are in working together on reproductive health and family planning programs. ACE classifies three levels of engagement: (1) <emphasis>consultative</emphasis>, (2) <emphasis>cooperative</emphasis>, and (3) <emphasis>collaborative</emphasis>. Across each level, engagement occurs for five characteristics: (1) community involvement in assessment, (2) access to information, (3) inclusion in decision‐making, (4) local capacity to advocate institutions and governing structures, and (5) accountability of institutions to the public. ACE is proposed to characterize engagement such that a given community‐engaged relationship or project can be understood as an evolving process.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0033">A similar approach to the continuum of community engagement was published in 2020 by <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10051">WHO</ulink>’s Health Promotion Department (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0080">2020</link>). This continuum articulated four levels of community engagement for universal coverage: Level 1 is <emphasis>community‐oriented</emphasis>: informing and mobilizing the community to address immediate short‐term problems with strong external support. Level 2 is <emphasis>community‐based</emphasis>: consulting with the community and engaging them to improve access to health services and/or programs by placing interventions inside the community with some external support. Level 3 is <emphasis>community‐managed</emphasis>: collaborating with community leaders to set priorities and make decisions. Level 4 is <emphasis>community‐owned</emphasis>: leveraging community assets and empowerment to develop systems for self‐governance, establish and set priorities, implement interventions, and develop sustainable mechanisms for health promotion with partners and external support groups as part of a network. This is similar to the ACE Continuum described above and reflects the growing acknowledgment that community engagement occurs with different degrees of co‐creation by experts and communities.</para>

      <title>Theories and Models that Inform Community Engagement</title>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0004a0003"/>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0022"/>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0034">Concepts of community engagement and its principles and practices are informed by various theoretical perspectives and models, some of which have foundations in individual‐level theories and others which are focused on groups and communities. Two theories that have been influential in the area of community engagement have been critical consciousness and self‐determination. As described earlier, Freire’s (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0031">2018</link>) <emphasis>critical consciousness theory</emphasis> emphasizes the notion of empowerment to help disenfranchised and oppressed groups gain control over their own lives and environment and effect change. Although not a community engagement theory per se, <emphasis>self‐determination theory</emphasis> is used to understand an individual’s motivation for community engagement. It posits that people are influenced by three basic needs—competency, autonomy, and relatedness—that influence their psychological wellness and engagement with the world by affecting their motivation and aspirations (Ryan &amp; Deci, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0066">2017</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0030s0000p0035">Rothman (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0063">2001</link>) developed a widely used typology of a community organization that consists of three models. The process‐oriented <emphasis>locality development model</emphasis> focuses on community building by engaging a wide range of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink> to create an infrastructure and build capacity for activism and action. <emphasis>Social planning/policy</emphasis> is task‐oriented and focuses on problem‐solving through rational and deliberate planning. This model involves fact‐finding and analyzing information to make logical decisions about the best ways to address a community problem. The third model, <emphasis>social action,</emphasis> assumes there is a disadvantaged or mistreated segment of the community that should organize itself and/or be organized to make demands on the larger community for fair treatment. This model centers around social justice and the redistribution of power, resources, and decision‐making to achieve equity.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0036">Rothman’s typology of community organization and community building, first conceived over 35 years ago (Rothman,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0063">2001</link>; Rothman &amp; Tropman, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0064">1987</link>), has been widely used and is a foundation for other more recent models (Minkler et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0051">2008</link>). The utility of each of the three models depends on the community situation or context and they are not mutually exclusive. They can be used sequentially to move a community from capacity‐building to data‐driven planning to action‐taking. They provide a systematic and pragmatic approach to community organization, building, and engagement.</para>
