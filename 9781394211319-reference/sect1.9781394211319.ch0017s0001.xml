   <title>Reasoned Action Approach Models</title>

   <para id="ch0017s0000p0007">RAA models focus on behaviors that involve planning or deliberation. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), the first iteration of the theories, aimed to explain health and non‐health outcomes, including organ donation and voting (<ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 6</ulink>). Later theories—the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Integrative Behavioral Model (IBM), and Reasoned Action Approach (RAA)—retained this general focus but added some new dimensions. These theories are notable for the way they built upon one another in a sequential fashion (Yzer, <link linkend="ch0017s0000li0015">2017</link>), well‐supported by data from laboratory experiments and health behavior interventions (Sheeran et al., <link linkend="ch0017s0000li0009">2016</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0008">An important feature of RAA is the centrality of behavioral intentions. Positive attitudes toward a health behavior, social norms favoring the behavior, and perceived behavioral control all strengthen behavioral intentions, which then activate health behavior. Longitudinal, observational studies have found strong intention‐behavior associations (Sheeran,<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0008">2002</link>), while experiments show small‐to‐moderate effect sizes (Webb and Sheeran, <link linkend="ch0017s0000li0013">2006</link>). Intentions can be an important step along the pathway to behavior change. However, because intentions may not translate directly into behavior changes, they are not an adequate proxy for behavior change, especially in large behavior change trials (Sheeran and Webb, <link linkend="ch0017s0000li0010">2016</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0009">People must be able to perform a health behavior for intentions to translate into action. Thus, RAA developers (Fishbein and Ajzen,<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0002">2010</link>) added the construct of actual control as moderating intention‐behavior relationships. Actual control recognizes the importance of the environment, defined broadly, and a person’s skills for performing a particular behavior.</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0010">RAA models prescribe a systematic method to identify issues most important to specific contexts and to individuals’ decisions about performing specific behaviors. These methods require detailed preliminary work, elicitation methods, to assess the populations of interest and contexts under study. While potentially time‐consuming, the methods are especially important when studying new topic areas and different cultures.</para>
