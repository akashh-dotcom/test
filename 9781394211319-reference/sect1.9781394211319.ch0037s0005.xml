   <para id="ch0037s0000p0033">In this section, we profile two health communication programs from a social marketing perspective: the TRANSFORM project in Kenya supporting communities to adopt behaviors and access products and services to improve health, livelihood, and overall wellbeing, and the Improving Contraceptive Method Mix (ICMM) project in Indonesia, which sought to expand the range of available contraceptive methods and increase the use of longer‐acting methods for couples who wanted no more children or wanted to space their next birth for longer periods of time. We describe how each program reflects the four main principles of social marketing (focusing on behavior, benefiting consumers, maintaining a market perspective, and using audience segmentation) as well as how each used theory and research to guide decision‐making.</para>

This project uses a transformative marketing approach to increase the scale and sustainability of health behavior change related to nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation by expanding and strengthening market‐based, social‐enterprise initiatives, particularly those using digital strategies, and increasing access to quality products and services in low‐and‐middle‐income countries in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia.

         <para id="ch0037s0000p0035">In Kenya, TRANSFORM involves a digitally‐based collaboration between public‐sector donors and community‐based, private‐sector businesses that sell health products, but typically do not think of themselves as health promoters or educators.<emphasis>UJoin</emphasis>, a cellphone‐friendly online platform, was designed to support small business <emphasis>(duka)</emphasis> owners—micro‐retailers—in informal settlements of Nairobi (UJoin, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0120">2020</link>). <emphasis>Duka</emphasis> owners who chose to participate in <emphasis>UJoin</emphasis> could access business and financial courses, obtain online mentoring, take advantage of networking opportunities, and access health and product information related to products they stock (Cassanitti, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0090">2020</link>). <emphasis>UJoin</emphasis> also encouraged and supported <emphasis>duka</emphasis> owners to become a new category of public health educators for their customers.</para>

            <emphasis>Duka</emphasis> owners serve marginalized, low‐income communities that often have less access to health information (see <ulink url="ch0032">Chapter 17</ulink>) and more constrained access to commercial resources than other community members. They are trusted community members and have longstanding relationships with their customers (Kimani et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0098">2012</link>). There are about 166,796 <emphasis>duka</emphasis> owners in Kenya (Mwiti, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0108">2018</link>), but 90% of them have no <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Formal">formal</ulink> training in business operations, entrepreneurship (TechnoServ, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0118">2020</link>), or sales accounting (Waweru, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0124">2018</link>). Yet, 95% of Kenya consumers patronize <emphasis>dukas</emphasis> at one time or another, often for products related to critical health issues such as nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation. Helping <emphasis>duka</emphasis> owners become health advocates and health promoters helps strengthen their own business development and relationships with their consumer base.</para>
         <para id="ch0037s0000p0037">To use<emphasis>UJoin</emphasis> digital technologies effectively, it was necessary to tailor strategies based on how <emphasis>duka</emphasis> owners vary in their attitudes and practices related to online resources. But prior to TRANSFORM, little was known about how <emphasis>duka</emphasis> owners perceived their potential role in health promotion, and how much interaction and communication they already had with customers about the health benefits of the commodities they sold. So, data were collected between 2019 and 2020 to understand the use of <emphasis>UJoin</emphasis> and its impact on <emphasis>duka</emphasis> operations and to refine the digital strategy. Although content on the <emphasis>UJoin</emphasis> platform ultimately reaches and benefits <emphasis>duka</emphasis> customers, this formative research focused primarily on <emphasis>duka</emphasis> owners themselves as an audience and as a networked community whose changes in behavior could transform the whole marketing system in Nairobi.</para>

A survey collected data from over 800 male and female <emphasis>duka</emphasis> owners and the data were subjected to latent class analysis to identify the distinct audience segments described above (Kumoji et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0105">2022</link>).

It provided new benefits to a particular class of social marketing actors—<emphasis>duka</emphasis> owners—bringing them closer to mainstream marketing resources, information, and services. It systematically studied and analyzed that population to identify important subgroups within it that had different needs for information and support and then tailored messaging to those different subgroups. And it drew inspiration from core theories of communication and behavior change to inform its research design, measured concepts, and strategies.</para>

         <para id="ch0037s0000p0044">The ICMM (<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0096">2017</link>) Project in Indonesia (2012–2016) was a transformative social marketing project aimed at improving informed choice of contraceptive methods among FP clients by altering existing health service policies and processes, budgeting and management, and improving capacity for and effectiveness of health communication and health promotion activities at regional and local levels in private and public sectors. A key priority of the project was to shift market emphasis on the use of short‐term contraceptive methods (oral pills and injectable contraceptives) to address client demand for more diverse options, especially longer‐term methods (IUDs and contraceptive implants) for clients who wanted to delay pregnancy for periods longer than one year.</para>
         <para id="ch0037s0000p0045">ICMM was funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and led by the Indonesia office of the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (CCP), the Directorate of Family Health at the Indonesian Ministry of Health (MOH), and the National Family Planning Coordination Board (BKKBN). ICMM was conducted in three districts in East Java province and three districts in West Nusa Tenggara province as demonstration sites.</para>
         <para id="ch0037s0000p0046">In a mature national family planning program like Indonesia’s, where contraceptive use is already relatively high, the emphasis tends to shift from increasing contraception in general to minimizing unintended pregnancies through consistent, effective use of contraceptives. Beginning in the early 2000s during the Asian economic crisis and a subsequent decentralization of most major government agencies and services, the mix of methods available and widely used in Indonesia changed. The overall rate of modern contraceptive use between 2012 and 2017 was about 57–58% of married women aged 15–49 (BPS &amp; ORC Macro,<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0088">2017</link>). But those women often had difficulty accessing a wide range of methods and finding the method they wanted. Although Indonesian couples are more likely to want to limit births rather than space them, most women use short‐acting methods, primarily injectable contraceptives that must be administered every one to three months, depending on the type. Long‐acting and reversible methods (LARCs) such as IUDs and hormonal implants are often not widely available. This lack of method choice often results in dissatisfaction with and discontinuation of a method or inconsistent or intermittent use of a method that increases the odds of unintended pregnancy. Meanwhile, the decentralization of government responsibility from the national to the provincial (state) level resulted in uneven institutional support for FP services especially at the district and village level because not all localities prioritized them equally.</para>
         <anchor id="ch0037s0000a0027"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="283"/>
         <para id="ch0037s0000p0047">ICMM was designed to transform the market for contraceptives by affecting upstream conditions: improving the supply chain of commodities (especially for LARCs), advocating for increased local prioritization of FP budgets and staffing, improving knowledge management in service delivery, increasing demand for longer‐term methods, and improving the effectiveness of FP communication to increase the downstream range of options couples have and to help them choose and access contraceptives that best match their fertility intentions. This required a focus not just on the primary audience of FP clients, but on secondary audiences that could improve the enabling environment and facilitate clients’ informed method choice.</para>

            <link linkend="ch0037s0000a0030">Table 21.2</link>. Specific behaviors were identified for both primary and secondary audiences, and specific benefits were identified for each of those audiences and prioritized actions that would inform motivational messaging. A marketing perspective was reflected in the use of an integrated whole‐market approach that recognized multiple levels within the existing infrastructure, and audience segments were differentiated to allow targeted resource allocation, strategic focus, and messaging.</para>
         <para id="ch0037s0000p0049">In addition to the core principles described in<link linkend="ch0037s0000a0030">Table 21.2</link>, ICMM used sophisticated theoretical frameworks and multiple complementary research and evaluation methods including: (1) behavioral modeling based on ideational (psychosocial) factors; (2) a pre‐post evaluation design with treatment and comparison districts; (3) creation and monitoring of local working group activities in 1,400 villages; (4) documentary review and interviews with district and local officials about changes in policy, regulations, planning, and budgeting processes over the course of the project; (5) documentation of changes in budget allocations for district level and local FP program activities (staffing, communication materials production, health worker training, and outreach); (6) monitoring of commodity availability and supply chain improvements; and (7) use of a representative sample survey of over 26,000 married women of reproductive age in treatment and comparison districts to assess the effects of program exposure on ideational variables, changes in availability of preferred FP methods, and contraceptive method adoption decisions.</para>
         <para id="ch0037s0000p0050">This integrated research and evaluation design produced compelling evidence of change in most of the major outcome variables and structural changes in the market associated with exposure to intervention activities and messaging (ICMM,<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0096">2017</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0037s0000p0051">Overall, the ICMM project demonstrates the power of a full‐market approach designed to address individual customer knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, as well as the enabling political, structural, and funding environment that makes positive consumer behavior more likely. It illustrates how important building coalitions and partnerships can be in mobilizing resources and empowering communities to participate in their own pursuit of new opportunities and health improvement. Finally, it illustrates, like the TRANSFORM project in Kenya, the value of drawing on theoretical frameworks to guide research planning both before and after a project, to use data to inform strategic thinking and messaging, and then to carefully measure the effects of the intervention to learn from the experience, communicate that experience to donors and project partners, and plan for the future.</para>
