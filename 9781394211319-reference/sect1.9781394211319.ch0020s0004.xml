      <title>Application 1: SBIRT for Substance Use Disorders</title>
      <anchor id="ch0020s0004a0002"/>
      <anchor id="ch0020s0000a0029"/>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0040">As described at the beginning of the chapter, there is a major gap in the identification and successful treatment of SUDs in the United States. While Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) has demonstrated some success when delivered in clinical settings, many barriers can prevent it from being applied, resulting in SBIRT only being administered to a fraction of patients, or not being delivered at all. Even when SBIRT<emphasis>is</emphasis> delivered, there is an additional concern that it is not taking into account the readiness to quit or patterns of use for each individual patient and is instead taking a “one‐size‐fits‐all” approach. As several research syntheses have found with other behaviors, the more tailored an intervention is to an individual's readiness to change, the greater its efficacy (Krebs et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0053">2010</link>; Noar et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0067">2007</link>; Norcross et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0068">2011</link>).</para>
      <anchor id="ch0020s0000a0030"/>
      <beginpage pagenum="81"/>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0041">
         <emphasis>Connect2BWell</emphasis>, a mobile device‐optimized, online SBIRT program was developed to address these concerns. This program was designed to be integrated into clinical workflow in a variety of clinical settings, removing much of the burden for SBIRT delivery from clinical staff. Leveraging this mobile‐optimized, online delivery platform allows the administration of SBIRT to be much more flexible: patients with upcoming appointments can even engage with the program before going to the clinic. This streamlines the process and allows clinic staff to focus their efforts on delivering additional intervention and referring to treatment for those patients with the riskiest patterns of substance use. The integrative program allows patients to interact over any internet‐enabled device, a clinician‐facing view of the program, and communication directly with the electronic health record (EHR). <emphasis>Connect2BWell</emphasis>’s integration into EHRs allows for the direct transmission of patient results between the program and the EHR, informing clinicians when a patient has screened positive for an SUD and providing clinicians with details of a patient’s pattern of use. Not only are these results available to view in the EHR but they also can be viewed in an interactive, clinician dashboard aimed at facilitating discussions regarding substance use between a patient and a member of their care team.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0042">In addition to these important technological innovations aimed at improving the delivery of SBIRT, another critical component of<emphasis>Connect2BWell</emphasis> is the use of the TTM to inform the development of all intervention content, communications, and referral to treatment. Approaching intervention development using this TTM‐based lens facilitates the tailoring that <emphasis>Connect2BWell</emphasis> provides. When patients first enter the program, they are screened for SUDs using the <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">Alcohol</ulink>, Smoking and Substance Involvement Test (ASSIST). The ASSIST is a widely used, validated measure for identifying substance‐specific levels of risk (low, moderate, high) and provides substance involvement scores for tobacco, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink>, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14418">cannabis</ulink>, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13355">cocaine</ulink>, stimulants, inhalants, sedatives, hallucinogens, and opioids. Based on a series of decision rules built into the program, the highest‐risk substance is determined and used as the focus for the brief intervention piece of the program. Based upon the ASSIST and other information regarding their use, a specific program track is identified for each patient. The program includes five tracks, each defined by a different target behavior: (1) quitting, (2) limiting use of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink> to low‐risk drinking guidelines, (3) quitting drinking with the guidance of a medical professional, (4) limiting use of a prescription drug to as prescribed by a health care provider, and (5) limiting medical marijuana to medically advised use. Once a track has been determined, the patient is assessed for their readiness to engage in their relevant target behavior (stage of change). From this point forward, stage of change is used to tailor their intervention experience and dictates other TTM‐based principles on which interventions are tailored. The online intervention experience is also complemented by behavior and stage‐matched text messages, which are sent to patients every one to three days when they are in‐between intervention sessions.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0043">Once a patient completes the online intervention portion of<emphasis>Connect2BWell</emphasis>, the data are shared with their care team via the EHR and the clinician dashboard. A member of the care team then reaches out to the patient to schedule a “face‐to‐face” (either in‐clinic or via a telehealth platform) intervention session. The care team member uses the program’s clinician dashboard to facilitate this discussion, reflecting on patterns of use and other information the patient provided in their online session. The clinician dashboard also provides a message field that allows the clinician to send messages directly to patients. Another key feature of the dashboard is the Action Plan, which allows clinicians to choose from a list of pre‐determined action steps that are populated based on the patient’s target behavior and stage of change. Clinicians and patients work together to determine which action steps are best suited for particular patients. Once the Action Plan is created, it is available to patients through their patient homepages. Patients can view their assigned action steps on their homepage and mark steps as “done” as they are completed. As action steps are marked as complete by the user, the clinician dashboard updates in real‐time to reflect these completions. The homepage also features a list of behavior and stage‐matched activities for each patient to complete.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0044">All aspects of<emphasis>Connect2BWell</emphasis> are built around a TTM framework. All patient communications, either from the online program or from the clinician who uses the clinical dashboard to guide their interactions, are tailored to the patient’s specific behavioral risk and stage of change. All action planning, goal setting, and referrals to treatment take into account the patient’s stage of change and make appropriate recommendations based upon their readiness. In addition, stage information is transmitted to the EHR so that all clinical staff interacting with the individual around this behavior have additional knowledge as to the patient’s behavior change journey. While the final data from a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of <emphasis>Connect2BWell</emphasis> in a large Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) are not yet available, data from a pilot of the program demonstrated high levels of acceptability with participants’ average ratings above a 4 out of 5 on all acceptability measures and clinicians also averaging above a 4 out of 5 on all but one of the acceptability questions regarding their use of the clinician dashboard (Evers, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0023">2019</link>). The clinical trial has retention rates of over 70% across nine months, indicating a high level of engagement with the program.</para>

      <title>Application 2: Advance Care Planning</title>
      <anchor id="ch0020s0004a0003"/>
      <anchor id="ch0020s0000a0032"/>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0045">The TTM can be applied in novel ways. One recent example of this is a TTM‐based intervention for engaging people in advance care planning activities (Fried et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0032">2016</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0033">2021</link>). Advance care planning activities allow individuals to prepare for potential healthcare decisions ahead of time and communicate their preferences with loved ones and healthcare providers (Advance Care Planning, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0005">n.d.</link>). While there has been an increase in advance care planning over time, only about one‐third of adults in the United States have completed an advance directive, a living document allowing an individual to record their healthcare decision preferences and update them over time as their situation changes. Some interventions have been effective in increasing advanced care plan use, but they have limitations (MacKenzie et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0059">2018</link>). Facilitator‐led interventions typically demonstrate the strongest effects, but they are resource‐intensive and may not be scalable. Self‐administered tools are more widely available, but these interventions are less efficacious than those with face‐to‐face guidance and often require access to the Internet. There is a need to bridge the gap between these two types of interventions for advanced care planning and develop a solution that is widely accessible but also offers high levels of efficacy to individuals.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0046">One program that has addressed this gap, STAMP (Sharing and Talking about my Preferences), was developed with a firm theoretical grounding in the TTM. This program was organized around readiness to participate in four key advance care planning behaviors: completion of a living will, <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Formal">formal</ulink> assignment of a healthcare proxy, identifying a trusted person and communicating with this person about views on quality versus quantity of life, and ensuring that written documents are in the medical record. Intervention feedback was tailored for each user based on three TTM constructs: (1) stages of change for these four key behaviors, (2) decisional balance, and (3) values/beliefs. For example, for those who were in the early stages of change on a given behavior, intervention feedback focused on changing attitudes and addressing barriers, while feedback for those in the later stages provided specific actions the individual(s) could perform. Those engaging with STAMP can complete their assessments either online or over the phone, assuring that those without a device or internet access are not denied support. Based on these assessment answers, STAMP generates an individual‐tailored feedback report, which is then shared with the participant.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0047">STAMP has shown efficacy in a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10343">primary care</ulink> and specialty practices (Fried et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0033">2021</link>). Randomization occurred at the practice level to avoid contamination, and sites were randomized in matched pairs based on a series of practice and patient characteristics. Patients who were age 55 or older and presented for in‐person visits at any study site were considered for inclusion. There were also many exclusion criteria, including the visit being an urgent care encounter, severe hearing or vision loss, moderate‐to‐severe cognitive impairment, inability to complete informed consent, a primary language other than English, and having already completed advance care planning. Participants in practices randomly assigned to receive STAMP received the computer‐tailored intervention, while those receiving care at control sites were engaged in usual care. All participants received assessments either online or over the phone (based on participant preference) at baseline and after two, four, and six months. The primary outcome of interest was the self‐reported completion of all four advance care planning behaviors at the six‐month follow‐up.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0048">A total of 909 participants completed baseline sessions, including 455 intervention and 454 usual care participants. At the six‐month follow‐up, 91% of intervention participants and 95% of those assigned to usual care completed their final assessments. Using intent‐to‐treat analyses, the predicted probability of completing all four advance care planning activities was greater for intervention participants (14.1%, 95% CI 11.0–17.2%) than for those in usual care (8.2%, 95% CI 4.9–11.4%). Results for the four individual behaviors mirrored these overall results, such that for all four behaviors, intervention participants had a higher predicted probability for completing the behavior than those receiving usual care (Fried et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0033">2021</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0049">Not only does the conceptualization of the STAMP program overcome known barriers to engaging individuals in advance care planning activities, but it is clear that it is also effective in practice. The creation of a computerized tailored intervention using the TTM addresses both the concern of scalability posed by facilitator‐led applications as well as the lack of individualization and efficacy of previous computerized programs (Fried et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0032">2016</link>). The application of the TTM to the development and implementation of STAMP demonstrates the flexibility of the model and should encourage us to think creatively about new ways to apply this evidence‐based model.</para>
