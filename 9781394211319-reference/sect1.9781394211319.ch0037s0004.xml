   <para id="ch0037s0000p0022">Social marketing is a strategic approach to social and behavior change that draws on behavioral theories to develop strategies and execute change.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0023">
      <emphasis>The Use of Theory</emphasis>. Many of the health behavior theories discussed throughout this book can guide the planning and evaluation of social marketing programs. Some theories operate primarily at an individual level, while others focus more on interpersonal, group, or even structural levels. Key ideas and applications of four key theories often used in social marketing research and design are summarized in <anchor id="ch0037s0000a0014"/>
      <link linkend="ch0037s0000a0016">Table 21.1</link>.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0024">Theories offer insights into determinants of behavior which can be confirmed through formative research and published literature. For example, according to Diffusion of Innovations Theory (see<ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink>), the adoption of a new behavior is more rapid if it (1) is perceived to have a <emphasis>relative advantage</emphasis> over current behavior, (2) is <emphasis>compatible</emphasis> with one’s daily routine, priorities, and values, (3) seems <emphasis>relatively easy</emphasis> to adopt or practice, (4) can be <emphasis>tried without great risk</emphasis> before committing to it, and (5) can be <emphasis>observed in action</emphasis> to see what outcomes others experience before trying it oneself (Rogers, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0114">2003</link>). By examining the perceived characteristics of a product among potential consumers, marketers can design a message strategy to reinforce positive perceptions and change negative perceptions to increase the likelihood of acceptance and adoption.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0025">Social marketers also use theories to segment audiences in meaningful ways. For example, the Extended Parallel Processing Model (EPPM) and its close relative, the Risk Perception Attitude Framework (elements of which appear in the Integrated Behavioral Model—see<ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 6</ulink>), describe the interaction between perceived threat and perceived efficacy, which influence information seeking or avoidance (Rimal &amp; Real, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0113">2003</link>), and behavioral decision‐making (Witte, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0125">1994</link>). Splitting both the threat and efficacy dimensions into low and high categories can create a 2 × 2 typology of audience segments.</para>

Research plays a role across all stages of health programs from design through implementation and evaluation (see also <ulink url="ch0035">Chapter 19</ulink> on theory‐based planning models).

Organizational research and environmental scans help identify organizations or social institutions that influence the intended audiences and might be engaged as partners to support the program and available resources. Concept testing and message pretesting are essential research steps in the design process that help planners explore and determine an optimum marketing mix and craft compelling messages.</para>

      <emphasis>Finally</emphasis>, <emphasis>during the evaluation phase</emphasis> of the program, population‐based social‐behavioral and cost‐effectiveness research helps determine how well a program met its objectives. It can explain why a program is effective (or not), including the effects of different activities or messages on different audience segments, determine the magnitude of change, and demonstrate what aspects of the program contributed to those changes. It can measure the cost of achieving specific outcomes or impacts and indicate which parts of the program should be continued or strengthened.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0031">As an example of how compelling good research can be in the practice of social marketing, consider the concept of return on investment (ROI), or what a program can expect to gain for the resources expended to promote a product or behavior. Naturally, marketers wish to gain more than they spend, or at least to break even. In commercial settings the monetary cost of producing, promoting, and distributing a product or service must be more than offset by what consumers pay in exchange for it. Social marketing campaigns often are obliged to serve all audience members in need, not just those in a position to pay for a product, so they may offer products for free or at subsidized prices to increase social benefits. The social marketing organization and its donors may tolerate a financial loss (cost of commodities and distribution) if the social benefits to society (for example, lower birth rates or fewer <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6782">HIV infections</ulink>) are judged to offset those costs. However, those social benefits are rarely quantified in monetary terms. Increasingly, members of the donor community (USAID and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example) are trying to get a better handle on how to calculate ROI.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0032">Several studies have illustrated how to do this through cost‐effectiveness analysis of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> prevention communication campaigns in South Africa. Kincaid and Parker (<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0100">2008</link>) used data from a population‐based survey that measured program exposure, preventive behaviors, and seroprevalence/<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> status to estimate that 701,495 <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6782">HIV infections</ulink> were <emphasis>prevented</emphasis> between 2000 and 2005 due to an increase in protective behaviors attributable to the campaign. Extrapolating from the average $8,000 lifetime cost of providing government subsidized anti‐retroviral therapy to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>‐positive patients, they calculated that the $2.3 million national campaign would save the South African government $5.6 billion in health care costs over 20 years. A similar analysis estimated a $1.1 billion savings resulting from 132,066 infections averted due to condom use at first sex among youth (Kincaid et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0101">2014</link>). These are powerful arguments for investment in preventive health campaigns.</para>
