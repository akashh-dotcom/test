         <para id="ch0024s0000p0033">There is substantial evidence linking low levels of social support to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1275">coronary heart disease</ulink> (CHD), the leading cause of death in most industrialized countries. Barth et al.’s (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0019">2010</link>) systematic review and meta‐analysis examined prospective studies that measured both structural and functional social support and cardiovascular outcomes. These included studies of CHD etiology, development of CHD in previously healthy individuals, and CHD prognosis, including individuals with preexisting CHD (Barth et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0019">2010</link>; Lett et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0084">2005</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0085">2007</link>). In a 13‐year longitudinal study, low functional support and depression were found to be predictive of CHD as well (Liu et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0087">2017</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0034">Across multiple studies, there is evidence for the beneficial cardiovascular effects of functional support. Higher levels of functional social support were associated with lower risk of incident <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3015">hypertension</ulink> (incident rate ratio 0.64, [95% CI 0.41–0.97]) (Harding et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0056">2022</link>). Perceived social support is associated with better psychosocial adjustment in people diagnosed with CHD (Karataş &amp; Bostanoğlu, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0072">2017</link>). By extension, lack of social support is a significant predictor of rehospitalization, and greater support predicts lower mortality in heart failure patients (Luttik et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0089">2005</link>), and it can have a direct effect on physical health when looking at quality of life for CHD patients (Lee et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0082">2012</link>; Wang et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0135">2013</link>). Another meta‐analysis also found that social support and social integration were associated with lower levels of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3144">inflammation</ulink>, pointing to one pathway by which social support may contribute to cardiovascular outcomes (Uchino et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0127">2018</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0035">Higher levels of social support are also associated with lower loneliness and social isolation (<emphasis>r</emphasis> = −0.39), according to a recent meta‐analysis (Zhang &amp; Dong, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0142">2022</link>). With that in mind, one cross‐sectional study suggested that being lonely, even with high levels of social support, poses the greatest risk for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3015">hypertension</ulink>, a major risk factor for CHD (Yazawa et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0141">2022</link>). In a secondary analysis of 11,486 community‐dwelling Australians aged 70 and above, individuals who had poor scores on measures of social health—defined as an individual’s ability to form satisfying and meaningful relationships, their ability to adapt in social situations, and their interactions and perceived support from other people, institutions and services—were 42% more likely to develop CHD and twice as likely to die from CHD, even when initially free of CHD (Freak‐Poli et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0051">2021</link>). The same study showed that social isolation and low social support, but not loneliness, were more salient risk factors when it comes to CHD. Valtorta et al. (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0130">2016</link>) conducted a meta‐analysis that found that poor social relationships were associated with a 29% increase in risk of incident CHD and a 32% increase in risk of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8963">stroke</ulink>.</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0036">Although fewer studies have been conducted in developing countries, evidence suggests the protective effects of social support may extend to less industrialized regions. For example, among Vietnamese patients with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3015">hypertension</ulink>, larger network size and the provision of informational, emotional, and instrumental illness‐related support were associated with lower odds of uncontrolled <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3015">hypertension</ulink> (Thuy et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0123">2021</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0024s0000p0037">There is now substantial evidence for the protective effect of social connections on risk for all‐cause mortality. Some of the first epidemiological evidence was highlighted in the review by House et al. (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0065">1988</link>). They summarized data from five prospective studies: the Alameda County (Berkman &amp; Syme, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0021">1979</link>), Evans County, Tecumseh, Eastern Finland, and Gothenburg studies. These studies examined large community samples of initially healthy individuals, assessed their social relationships, and then followed them over several years to determine whether the level of social integration predicted who would still be alive. Indeed, the evidence confirmed that those with lower social integration had significantly higher age‐adjusted mortality risk (Steptoe et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0118">2013</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0038">Since that time, the number of studies examining the influence of social relationships (both functional and structural) and mortality has grown exponentially. One recent study (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 388,973 from the years 1998–2014) showed that all‐cause mortality risk was 45% higher among adults 18–64 years old living alone compared to those who were living with others (Lee &amp; Singh, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0081">2021</link>). Multiple meta‐analyses have linked social support and mortality. In a meta‐analysis of 148 independent prospective studies with data from 308,849 individuals followed for an average of 7.5 years, results indicated that individuals with greater social connections (averaged across the different measures shown in <link linkend="ch0024s0000a0013">Table 10.1</link>) have a 50% greater likelihood of survival than those with fewer social connections (Holt‐Lunstad et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0062">2010</link>). The effect was consistent across gender, age, initial health status, and causes of mortality. This meta‐analysis provided evidence of the directional effect of social relationships influencing mortality. Most studies were population‐based, and, thus, examined initially healthy participants. However, even among those who were ill, greater social connectedness (that is, having large amounts of both structural and functional support) was associated with greater odds of survival. Thus, regardless of initial health status, those who were more socially connected lived longer. Most notably, the overall magnitude of the effect of social connections on risk for mortality was comparable with and, in many cases, exceeded the effect of many well‐established risk factors for mortality. For instance, lacking social connectedness carries a risk equivalent to smoking up to 15 cigarettes per day and is greater than that for <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink> abuse, physical inactivity (sedentary lifestyle), <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink>, and air pollution (see <anchor id="ch0024s0000a0033"/>

         <para id="ch0024s0000p0039">Across studies, the influence of social relationships was measured in diverse ways, including both functional and structural aspects (<link linkend="ch0024s0000a0013">Table 10.1</link>). The magnitude of risk reduction differed significantly across types of measurement approaches examined. Although both structural (OR = 1.57, 95% CI [1.46, 1.70]) and functional measures (OR = 1.46, 95% CI [1.28, 1.66]) were associated significantly with greater odds of survival, specific measurement approaches within these broader categorizations varied in their predictive utility. Within functional support measures, perceived support was a significant predictor of longevity (OR = 1.35, 95% CI [1.22, 1.49]), whereas received support was not (OR = 1.21, 95% CI [0.91, 1.63]). When examining structural measures, living alone (OR = 1.19, 95% CI [0.99, 1.44]) was the poorest predictor, and complex measures of social integration were the best predictors (OR = 1.91, 95% CI [1.63, 2.23]), with assessments that considered the multidimensional aspects of social relationships associated with 91% increased odds of survival. Taken together, these data suggest the importance of both social networks and the social support they provide.</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0040">A more recent summary of 23 meta‐analyses published between 1994 and 2021 that included 1,187 longitudinal and cross‐sectional studies (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 1.458 million people in many countries and multiple continents) was highly consistent with the above meta‐analysis, pointing to a predicted link between social support and reduced disease and mortality (Vila, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0134">2021</link>).</para>
         <anchor id="ch0024s0000a0035"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="125"/>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0041">Across all these studies and meta‐analyses, overall effects of social relationships on mortality may be a conservative estimate. Most studies adjusted for initial health and other lifestyle risk factors to establish the independent influence of social connections on risk for mortality. However, social relationships are linked inextricably with multiple pathways, behaviors, and risk factors known to be associated with mortality (Holt‐Lunstad,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0060">2021</link>; Liu &amp; Newschaffer, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0086">2011</link>; Pantell et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0101">2013</link>). For example, excessive <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink> consumption is associated with poor social support; and individuals with more positive social relationships engage in fewer risky health behaviors (Hsieh et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0067">2017</link>; Umberson &amp; Karas Montez, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0129">2010</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0042">This means they are more likely to exhibit behaviors, such as not smoking, using seatbelts, getting adequate sleep, healthy diet, regular exercise, and good dental hygiene (Brummett et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0027">2006</link>; Fuemmeler et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0053">2006</link>). Therefore, these analyses eliminate one of the pathways through which social relationships may influence risk for mortality. The overall effect may also be a conservative estimate because most studies failed to measure relationship quality. Thus, estimates likely include both high‐ and poor‐quality relationships (potential detrimental influences of poor‐quality relationships are discussed in the next section).</para>

         <para id="ch0024s0000p0043">Although social support generally is related to better health, in some circumstances, received support is unrelated or is even linked to negative health outcomes (Holt‐Lunstad et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0062">2010</link>; Uchino, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0126">2009</link>; Uchino et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0127">2018</link>). Many of the studies reviewed above that found links between social support and physical health are based upon measures of perceived support. In prior work, the concepts of perceived and received support have been used interchangeably, with the assumption that individuals high in perceived support also receive greater support (Dunkel‐Schetter &amp; Bennett, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0045">1990</link>; Uchino, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0126">2009</link>). However, measures of perceived and received support are only moderately correlated and, hence, seem to represent distinct constructs (Haber et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0055">2007</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0044">Recent research has distinguished more clearly between perceived and received support. Several recent studies have found that perceived support protects against negative outcomes, while received support often is unrelated to outcomes (Hartley &amp; Coffee,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0057">2019</link>; Kaniasty, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0070">2020</link>; Szkody et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0120">2020</link>). Consistent with this possibility, a complicated set of findings emerges throughout these studies when examining measures of received support on health outcomes. For instance, several prospective epidemiological studies examining received support (especially tangible support) found it to be associated with higher subsequent mortality rates (Forster &amp; Stoller, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0050">1992</link>; Krause, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0077">1997</link>). This is also consistent with cross‐sectional laboratory studies in which receiving support appears to cause <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> (Bolger &amp; Amarel, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0025">2007</link>). Although a simple plausible explanation, based on the concept of support mobilization, is that individuals who are more dependent on receiving support are siply more physically impaired to begin with, these studies do not appear to support this explanation because most considered the influence of initial health status prospectively. A balance between the support provided and the support received was associated with a lower risk of all‐cause mortality compared to either disproportionately receiving more support from others, or disproportionately providing more support to others than they received (Chen et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0033">2021</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0045">It has been argued that the links between received support and health might be more contextual. Hence, stressor factors (e.g., a match between stressor and support type), provider factors (e.g., relationship quality), and recipient factors (e.g., threats to independence) are important considerations (Bolger &amp; Amarel,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0025">2007</link>; Dunkel‐Schetter &amp; Skokan, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0046">1990</link>; Uchino, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0126">2009</link>). All these factors can influence whether recipients see received support as responsive, and it has been argued that this is a key factor in the efficacy of received support (Maisel &amp; Gable, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0092">2009</link>). Consistent with this possibility, the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study found that only when received support was viewed as unresponsive was it associated with higher mortality rates (Selcuk &amp; Ong, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0112">2013</link>). This is an important finding, and future interventions should consider such issues in designing effective interventions. In fact, responsiveness/unresponsiveness is the component of received tangible support that appears to be most consistently related to higher mortality (Forster &amp; Stoller, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0050">1992</link>; Kaplan et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0071">1994</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0024s0000p0046">Another important issue is relationship quality. Much of the epidemiological evidence that has established the health relevance of social support did not consider the quality of relationships and assumed that all relationships are positive. However, even though relationships may be caring, considerate, and sources of warmth and love, they can also be sources of conflict and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. Although the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐buffering model suggests that relationships can buffer the negative health effects of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, it is also possible that some relationships may be sources of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. Among the few epidemiological studies that examined relationship quality, findings indicate that negativity in social relationships predicts a greater risk for mortality (Friedman et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0052">1995</link>). For instance, a study that followed 2,264 <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=737">breast cancer</ulink> patients for an average of 10.8 years found that, while network support is associated with better prognosis, poor quality and burden in family relations were associated with higher risk of all‐cause mortality (Kroenke et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0078">2012</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0047">Relationship distress may be particularly salient in the context of marriage, given its importance. Indeed, a growing body of research among couples shows that despite the health advantage of marital status, distressed marriages are associated with greater morbidity and risk for mortality (Robles et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0109">2014</link>; Whisman et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0137">2018</link>). Relationship distress also has been associated with deleterious health‐relevant processes, including immune dysregulation and delayed wound healing (Kiecolt‐Glaser, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0074">2005</link>), high ambulatory <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> pressure, and metabolic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5801">syndrome</ulink> (Birmingham et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0023">2019</link>; Troxel et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0124">2005</link>). There is also evidence that unsupportive behavior and partner distress are associated with poorer quality of life among women with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=737">breast cancer</ulink> (Manne et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0094">2005</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0048">Likewise, interpersonal <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> may be more impactful than other sources of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. For instance, the Stockholm Female Coronary Risk Study found that after controlling for standard risk factors, marital distress was associated with nearly a threefold increase in risk of recurrent coronary events, whereas work <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> was unrelated (Orth‐Gomer et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0100">2000</link>).

         <para id="ch0024s0000p0049">Within the last decade, advancements in technology have led to dramatic shifts in the way social support is communicated (Antonucci et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0017">2017</link>; Canale et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0028">2021</link>; Hunter et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0068">2022</link>; Zhou &amp; Cheng, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0143">2022</link>). Use of the Internet and smartphones is widespread in most developed nations and is now the primary form of communication. Research is now exploring equivalencies between technology‐mediated and face‐to‐face communication and the potential, unique benefits of each modality for social support. There is some evidence to support both potential advantages and disadvantages of online compared to face‐to‐face support.</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0050">Beyond merely connecting individuals at a distance, technology‐mediated social support may have potential advantages. For example, those with stigmatized conditions can seek Internet‐mediated support that allows them to remain anonymous (Malik &amp; Coulson,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0093">2008</link>); users of online forums can search previous posts for informational and emotional support, thereby reducing the burden for both provider and recipient (Wright &amp; Bell, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0093">2008</link>); individuals who are able to connect across geographic distances can create support networks around their specific support needs (Rainie &amp; Wellman, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0106">2012</link>); and older adults who experience regular depression as a result of social isolation may mitigate symptoms using social media (Wu &amp; Chiou, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0139">2020</link>). Overall, these data point to the general utility of communicating informational and emotional support online (Dare &amp; Green, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0043">2011</link>). Evidence also has emerged that participation in social support groups contributes to experiencing a sense of belonging (Smit et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0115">2021</link>). Likewise, there is some evidence to suggest that individuals participate in online support groups to help others (Rimer et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0107">2005</link>), thereby increasing provision of support.</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0051">Some forms of technology‐communicated social support may be less effective than other forms of support or even have deleterious effects under some circumstances. For instance, there is evidence that text messages, despite having similar effects psychologically to talking with someone about a stressful event, do not have similar physiological effects (Seltzer et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0113">2012</link>). Similarly, research examining use of the Internet for support after a traumatic event found that despite perceptions of benefit, there was no evidence of an effect on psychological well‐being (Vicary &amp; Fraley, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0132">2010</link>). The same technology that can facilitate support from others across geographic distances can also interfere with face‐to‐face support. For instance, the presence of a mobile phone in social settings may reduce closeness and quality of interactions, interfering with social support and relationships (Przybylski &amp; <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Weinstein">Weinstein</ulink>, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0105">2012</link>). A recent study examining remote contact as a replacement for in‐person contact to protect mental health among a nationally representative sample of older adults found that in‐person contact cannot be replaced by remote means of contact for maintaining mental health. The participants in the study experienced depression, reductions in happiness, and loneliness despite increases in remote contact (Hawkley et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0058">2021</link>). Future research that directly examines the links between perceived and received Internet‐mediated support and physical health outcomes will be needed to make this final link, and it may operate differently in various situations.</para>

         <para id="ch0024s0000p0052">Taken together, this evidence has important implications for social support interventions. First, we should consider several contextual factors: <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related factors that may influence efficacy of support, support provider factors and characteristics, and support recipient factors and support desires. Second, the data on relationship quality show that researchers and practitioners must assess both positivity and negativity in the context of social support. Interventions aimed at increasing social support may have unintended detrimental effects if they fail to account for negativity in relationships and the responsivity of the support provided. Likewise, by reducing negativity and increasing responsiveness, interventions may have larger effects than previously estimated. Finally, when designing interventions using online tools, it should not be assumed that online support will be equivalent to face‐to‐face support.</para>

         <para id="ch0024s0000p0053">The COVID‐19 pandemic has had far‐reaching impacts on public health beyond the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9711">virus</ulink> itself, contributing to secondary impacts on physical and mental health. Social distancing and other restrictions made accessing both informal and <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Formal">formal</ulink> social support difficult. This was particularly true for older adults and those in residential housing where such restrictions were often strictly enforced. Meta‐analytic data gathered from 32 longitudinal studies confirmed increases in both the severity and prevalence of loneliness during the pandemic (Ernst et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0048">2022</link>). A review of 35 years of studies examining factors influencing susceptibility to upper respiratory infectious illness via viral challenges found that, among other factors, social integration and social support decreased risk of upper respiratory illness after exposure to the viruses (Cohen, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0037">2020</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0024s0000p0054">Nonetheless, many studies examined whether social support buffered pandemic‐related stressors. Results from hundreds of surveys have been published to understand who was most resilient and what factors were associated with greater risk during various phases of the global pandemic. Multiple reviews and meta‐analyses have found that better social support was associated with better outcomes and poorer social support was associated with worse outcomes among healthcare workers (Muller et al.<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0095">2020</link>; Serrano‐Ripoll et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0114">2020</link>; Spoorthy <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0116">2020</link>). While many studies show that poor social support has been associated with worse mental health, well‐being, and poorer health‐related behaviors, understanding some of the longer‐term health effects may require longer follow‐up. Future research carefully and systematically documenting social factors, following individuals and populations for decades, will be needed to understand the full scope and ramifications of the COVID‐19 pandemic on social support and health.</para>
