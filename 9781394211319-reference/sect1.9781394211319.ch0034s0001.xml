   <para id="ch0034s0000p0007">In<ulink url="ch0036">Chapter 20</ulink>, Jessica Cohen and Harsha Thirumurthy provide the rationale for key constructs of, and applications of, behavioral economics to health improvement programs. The foundations of behavioral economics lie in classical economics and expected utility theory, blended with a grounding in theories and evidence from psychology and sociology. While not a theory, behavioral economics provides important tools and constructs to understand human behavior. Behavioral economics has received growing attention in recent years, with applications in several fields in which anticipated costs and benefits play a central role: labor markets, wage policies, savings and retirement, and organizational behavior (National Academies of Science, Engineering &amp; Medicine, <link linkend="ch0034s0000li0016">2023</link>). Its application to health behavior, health policy, and health care use is emerging rapidly, as described in <ulink url="ch0036">Chapter 20</ulink>.</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0008">Behavioral economics aims to increase the explanatory power of economics by grounding it in psychological and social foundations. It uses insights from cognitive psychology, sociology, and decision analysis. Behavioral economics recognizes that people make decision errors in weighing the costs and benefits of their actions, and that message framing can influence how people react to persuasive communications. Key implications from behavioral economics for health behavior change suggest that incentives can improve health behaviors, and the way incentives are delivered can matter more than the amount of incentives. This idea, also consistent with Applied Behavior Analysis and Social Cognitive Theory (<ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>), has been used in health behavior intervention research by the authors and others with substantial success.</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0009">In<ulink url="ch0036">Chapter 20</ulink>, Cohen and Thirumurthy report on successful studies that increased uptake of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> testing and reduced inappropriate opioid prescribing. Both applications illustrate how concepts from behavioral economics can be effective when they are incorporated into patient‐facing and provider‐facing health care structures. These approaches can be sustained over time and have been shown to be cost‐effective and to save lives by reducing fatal <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6756">overdoses</ulink>.</para>
