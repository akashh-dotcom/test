   <para id="ch0007s0000p0001">The role of behavior in achieving healthy individuals, communities, and populations around the world is becoming ever clearer, and the need to understand behavior and how to enable change ever more urgent. This decade has seen a global pandemic that brought many governments and non‐governmental organizations to recognize the vital importance of people’s behavior in preventing infection and ameliorating its harms. Key behaviors included social distancing, ensuring <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10125">ventilation</ulink> and wearing facemasks in social situations to reduce transmission, being vaccinated to reduce harm, and communicating in ways that engage diverse communities.</para>
   <para id="ch0007s0000p0002">Other global existential threats to health include the environmental and biodiversity crises, the dangers of antimicrobial resistance and concerns around cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. These issues and the related behaviors add to the large number that have influenced our health for centuries—for example, tobacco, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink>, and other drug use; eating and physical activity; adherence to medication and other health interventions; delivery of healthcare; and implementation of evidence‐based practice more generally.</para>
   <para id="ch0007s0000p0003">In all these global threats, human behavior is at the center of creating and exacerbating them—but also at the heart of reducing or eliminating them.</para>
   <para id="ch0007s0000p0004">The harm caused by some behaviors affects not only the well‐being of people, their families, and communities, but also people’s contribution to society and therefore societal and economic strength. Harms are distributed unequally within and across societies, with those with fewest resources suffering the greatest harm. In recognition of this, in 2023 the World Health Assembly for the first time agreed to a resolution on Behavioral Sciences for Health.</para>
   <para id="ch0007s0000p0005">It is in this context that I welcome the 6th edition of<emphasis>Health Behavior: Theory, Research, and Practice</emphasis>. The accessible knowledge packed within its pages is foundational for understanding the huge range of behaviors related to health across diverse contexts. This volume also enables the reader to learn about how to apply that understanding to research, public health and clinical practice and policy, communications, education, and training. Each chapter begins with a “vignette” to engage readers’ attention, introducing a contemporary problem that can be addressed with relevant theory or evidence.</para>
   <para id="ch0007s0000p0006">It reflects advances in the last decade, updating applications and evidence, and two new chapters: Ch 14 on race, health, and health equity; and Ch 22 on social media and health.</para>
   <para>The strengths of this outstanding book are many. Here are five that make this a comprehensive and compelling companion for anyone interested in health behavior.</para>

   <para>Why is theory so important? First, good theories summarize what we know about a field at any point in time, bringing together research findings across diverse domains, populations, and settings. This is essential for accumulating knowledge and advancing the study and application of health behaviors. Second, they outline processes of change, that is how any intervention, policy, or program has an effect on desired outcomes. This enables those designing interventions to target mechanisms that are most likely to bring about change in the behavior of interest. Third, a good theory will also explain variation of effects across contexts, e.g. across populations, settings, and points in time. This is incredibly important as practitioners and policymakers want to be able to ascertain the relevance of research findings conducted in particular contexts for the setting and population they are concerned about. Thus, theories are essential for informing the development of interventions to change behaviors, both because this is likely to <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to more effective interventions, but also because whatever the findings, new knowledge will be generated that can be built on in the future.</para>

   </orderedlist>
   <para>Just as applying theoretical understanding leads to better policy and practice, feedback from applying theory in practice strengthens understanding. Research is the activity that connects theory and practice. By collecting data in an organized way, research studies can systematically test theoretical propositions and provide evidence to strengthen policy and practice. Well‐designed studies can do both of these simultaneously.</para>

   <para id="ch0007s0000p0007">Major public health problems can only be successfully addressed by taking into account both local and global contexts, as outlined in<ulink url="ch0015">Chapter 3</ulink> on ecological models. These represent examples of systems thinking and methods which are being increasingly used in considering health behaviors. Systems approaches, including ecological models, can combine population, community, and individual levels in research. They are strengthened by linking the general with the specific in terms of specifying intervention content and mechanisms of action.</para>
   <para>The majority of research is conducted in the global North and among relatively advantaged populations, but the majority of health need is in the global South and among disadvantaged communities. This poses the challenge of knowing what evidence can be generalized from research populations to the culturally, socially, and racially diverse populations that health behavior interventions and policies seek to benefit. This edition addresses important issues in the areas of race, health, and health equity in<ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink>, and of community engagement in <ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink>.</para>

   <para>Over the decade since the 5<superscript>th</superscript> edition of <emphasis>Health Behavior: Theory, Research, and Practice,</emphasis> there have been significant advances in study designs and methods of data collection. Behavioral interventions can be specified in terms of their component techniques, enabling the evaluation of the effectiveness of particular techniques, along with their links with theoretical processes. The last decade has also seen a digital revolution. Behavior can now be measured directly in real‐time, ecologically valid settings, for example via wearables, smartphones, physiological monitors, and environmental sensors. This provides a wealth of data about how behavior changes in response to environmental, physiological, and reported psychological processes. This has huge potential to advance our theories and models about how health behaviors can be changed. Complex data sets require complex analyses; harnessing the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence open up new horizons for the field.</para>

   <para id="ch0007s0000p0008">The many groups that this book will interest and inform include health, education, and communication practitioners; intervention developers and policy planners; and researchers seeking to generate the best possible evidence and theoretical understanding. Chapters draw the reader in by beginning with a contemporary problem that can be addressed with the theory or model, followed by critiques and evaluation of evidence. This includes the all‐important issue as to how theoretical constructs are conceived in practice and measured. New topics that were not a “thing” 10 years ago are included, for example, social media and health in<ulink url="ch0038">Chapter 22</ulink>.</para>
   <para id="ch0007s0000p0009">This book will be an invaluable resource for all those wanting an accessible and authoritative source to guide all aspects of the research process from conceptualizing problems in behavioural terms to writing protocols or research reports to synthesize evidence to consult with those wishing to use research findings in their work. The combination of rigorous thinking and methods with practical applications and case studies make this book shine out in an already sunny landscape.</para>
