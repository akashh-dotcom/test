   <title>What is Health Behavior?</title>

   <para id="ch0013s0000p0005">In the broadest sense,<emphasis>health behavior</emphasis> refers to the actions of individuals, groups, and organizations and the determinants, correlates, and consequences of actions, including social change, policy development and implementation, improved coping skills, and enhanced quality of life (Parkerson et al., <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0047">1993</link>). This is aligned with the working definition of <emphasis>health behavior</emphasis> that Gochman proposed, although <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> definition emphasized individuals: it includes not only observable, overt actions but also the mental events and feeling states that can be reported and measured. Gochman defined health behavior as “those personal attributes such as beliefs, expectations, motives, values, perceptions, and other cognitive elements; personality characteristics, including affective and emotional states and traits; and overt behavior patterns, actions, and habits that relate to health maintenance, to health restoration, and to health improvement” (Gochman, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0038">1982</link>, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0039">1997</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0013s0000p0006">Gochman’s definition is consistent with and embraces the definitions of specific categories of overt health behavior proposed by Kasl and Cobb in their seminal articles. Kasl and Cobb defined three categories of health behavior along a continuum of health and illness: preventive health behavior (primary prevention), illness behavior (disease detection and care‐seeking); and sick‐role behavior (medical treatment, adherence, and self‐care) (Kasl &amp; Cobb,<link linkend="ch0013s0000li0042">1966a</link>, b).</para>
