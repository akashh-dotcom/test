      <title>The Changing Scope of Health Behavior</title>

      <para id="ch0013s0000p0009">Since the first edition of this book in 1990, the interconnectedness of the world has become accepted as a fact. If there were doubts, the pandemic cemented this realization. Rapid changes in communication technologies have contributed to making the world a much smaller place and accelerated the pace of sharing information and ideas, with both positive and negative consequences (Galea et al.,<link linkend="ch0013s0000li0037">2023</link>; Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0056">2021</link>). As was observed during the pandemic, mis‐ and disinformation pose major threats to health. We discuss some of these issues later in the book. To the extent that public health is global health, and global health is local, we are committed in this volume to exploring the use of health behavior theories globally and to discussing the potential relevance of what is learned in one setting to other settings. We also recognize that old ideas about global health must change. It is widely recognized that those who seek to change people’s health behaviors must work collaboratively with communities to understand the culture and more of those whose behaviors they aim to alter. Lessons may move from the developing to developed world and back in reciprocal ways. As a result, the ways public health graduates will work globally have changed dramatically—from directing those in LMICs to partnering with them, co‐learning about the problems, and co‐developing solutions. Understanding theory is an important asset in the toolboxes of health professionals.</para>
      <para id="ch0013s0000p0010">The science and art of health behavior and health behavior change are eclectic, rapidly evolving, and reflect an amalgamation of approaches, methods, and strategies from social and health sciences. They draw on the theoretical perspectives, research, and practice tools of such diverse disciplines as psychology, sociology, data science, anthropology, communications, nursing, economics, and marketing. Health behavior research and practice also depend on epidemiology, statistics, and medicine. Big data are now a tool for health behavior and other fields. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are emerging as powerful forces and will play even larger roles in intervention development. We should engage with them thoughtfully.</para>
      <para id="ch0013s0000p0011">There is also increasing emphasis on an interdisciplinary or even a transdisciplinary focus and the use of team science to solve big, complex problems, such as health inequities, climate threats, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink>, and mental health. Many kinds of health, social service, and social science professionals contribute to and conduct health behavior research and practice. Ultimately, their work is strengthened by collaboration among professionals of different disciplines, each concerned with the behavioral and social intervention process, and contributing unique perspectives.</para>

      <para id="ch0013s0000p0012">The evidence base for health behavior change has grown dramatically over the past three decades. Today, there are many tools and strategies accessible from journals, books, and web‐based repositories to understand the role that health behavior theories can play in producing effective, sustained behavior changes. Evidence‐based groups like the Cochrane Collaboration (Cochrane,<link linkend="ch0013s0000li0035">2023</link>) and the CDC’s Guide to Community <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10502">Preventive Services</ulink> (U.S. DHHS, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0052">2023a</link>, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0053">b</link>) offer regular syntheses of behavioral interventions, some of which include theoretical constructs as variables in analyses of effectiveness.</para>
      <para id="ch0013s0000p0013">The topics on which health professionals and health behavior experts focus have evolved as health problems have changed around the world. Professionals may counsel people <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10304">at risk</ulink> for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=66">AIDS</ulink> about safe sex and medication to prevent <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6782">HIV infections</ulink>; help children avoid tobacco, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink>, and drugs; assist adults to stop smoking; encourage physicians to avoid opioid overprescribing; teach patients to manage and cope with their <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">chronic illnesses</ulink>; and organize communities and advocate policy changes aimed at fostering health improvement and reducing environmental injustice. Health systems, physicians, and other clinicians increasingly see a role for themselves and their teams to intervene in patients’ social determinants (Vanjani et al.,<link linkend="ch0013s0000li0055">2023</link>). Health professionals also may address environmental concerns, such as safe, accessible <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> and unhealthy air. Exposure to unhealthy particulates due to climate‐related wildfires, and extreme heat, are also medical issues. Where effective strategies to promote healthful behaviors and prevent diseases are available, they should be widely adopted and consistently implemented. A central premise of this book is that public health and medicine are not in opposition. As Kaney (<link linkend="ch0013s0000li0041">2023</link>) has written, it should not be either/or, it should be both/and.</para>

      <para id="ch0013s0000p0014">Positive, informed changes in health behaviors are typically the ultimate aims of health behavior change programs. If behaviors change but health is not improved, it is possible that the theory connecting the behavior to health is wrong or inadequate, or the way behavior was measured is flawed. Efforts to improve environments, policies, and other outcomes should be evaluated for their effects on health behaviors and health. If a policy changes, but does not <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to measurable changes in behavior, it may be either too weak, too shortlived, ineffectively implemented, or only a limited determinant of behavior.</para>
