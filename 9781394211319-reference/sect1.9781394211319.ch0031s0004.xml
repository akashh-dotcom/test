It grew out of a system‐level effort to improve the quality of healthcare for veterans through implementation efforts. A synthesis of the dissemination and implementation science literature informed the selection of domains and constructs in the CFIR framework, including constructs from Diffusion of Innovations theory (Rogers, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0092">2003</link>) and a review of the spread and maintenance of innovations in health service delivery and organizations (Greenhalgh et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0057">2004</link>). As the name suggests, this “consolidated” framework was developed by combining well‐studied and relevant constructs.</para>

      <para id="ch0031s0000p0031">The CFIR can support development and evaluation of implementation efforts for research and practice. For example, CFIR domains and constructs can inform contextual assessments and formative planning for implementation, which involves assessing multilevel ecological barriers and facilitators to EBI implementation among <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink>. CFIR constructs also can be used to map the development of implementation strategies that address identified barriers and facilitate EBI delivery. For example, low levels of practitioner knowledge about the EBI may indicate the need for education/training as an implementation strategy (Waltz et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0103">2019</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0031s0000p0032">Given the large number of constructs, it is common for studies guided by CFIR to examine a subset of constructs or domains aligned with the focus of the study (Damschroder et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0039">2011</link>). It can be useful to examine differences in CFIR constructs across sites with varying levels of implementation success to determine which constructs or factors have a larger impact on implementation. For example, Damschroder and Lowery (<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0037">2013</link>) used CFIR to guide qualitative data collection and analysis to evaluate the MOVE! weight management program in VA Medical Centers and compared ratings of CFIR constructs that distinguished between facilities with low versus high program implementation effectiveness. Of the 31 constructs assessed, 10 were significant predictors of implementation. These were mainly inner‐setting constructs, reflecting networks and communication or leadership engagement. The study offers empirical support for the impact of organizational context on implementation and illustrates how CFIR may be applied to enhance understanding of which of the core domains and constructs are strongly associated with successful implementation.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0031s0000a0039"/>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0033">A rapidly growing literature has applied CFIR to various aspects of implementation science studies across various settings and units of analysis, as detailed by a recent review of 26 articles published by January 2015 that meaningfully applied CFIR as a central part of their study design, data collection, and/or analysis (Kirk et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0063">2016</link>). They found that as of 2015, much of the research conducted with CFIR was qualitative or mixed‐methods work, often focused on organizing study results according to relevant framework domains but without assessment across multiple implementation phases or examination of outcomes.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0034">The evidence base is still developing in terms of which constructs within each of the five domains are most important, though some studies have identified factors from the inner setting as critical (e.g., leadership engagement in the implementing organization) (Damschroder &amp; Lowery,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0037">2013</link>). The clearer linkage of CFIR constructs with each other and with implementation outcomes is a priority for future work (Damschroder et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0041">2022a</link>). Given that CFIR is a largely descriptive framework, it can be useful to apply CFIR in combination with other evaluation frameworks to understand the mechanisms linking determinants with implementation or effectiveness outcomes.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0035">A comprehensive set of validated quantitative measures representing all CFIR constructs is not currently available, but measure development is still underway in several areas. Several refinements have been proposed to address existing limitations to CFIR, including applications to promote practice‐focused applications or to focus more on health equity. For example, Safaeinili et al. (<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0093">2020</link>) described a stakeholder‐informed pragmatic adaptation of CFIR to evaluate a patient‐centered care transformation in a learning <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10332">health system</ulink>. Means et al. (<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0071">2020</link>) evaluated CFIR for use in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC) and proposed a “characteristics of systems” domain and novel constructs to increase compatibility with LMICs (e.g., strategic policy alignment, resource continuity, external funding agent priorities, perceived scalability, community characteristics). Allen et al. (<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0019">2021</link>) have proposed a racism‐conscious adaptation of CFIR that considers how race and racism operate throughout the domains and constructs.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0036">An updated version of the framework (CFIR 2.0) was recently published, informed by empirical evaluation among researchers who have used the original CFIR in their work. The updated version still includes the five core domains and clarifies or expands on constructs that were not well‐defined or were missing. For example, “critical incidents” was added in the outer setting to help account for salient, large‐scale, often unanticipated events (e.g. floods, pandemic, company buyouts) (Damschroder et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0042">2022b</link>).</para>

Initial research showing that the program was effective was first published in 2002 (<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">Diabetes</ulink> Prevention Program Research Group,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0046">2002</link>). In the short term, participants showed a 58% reduction in the rate of developing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink>. Over 15 years, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> incidence in the original DPP trial participants was 27% lower among those who had participated in the lifestyle intervention and 18% lower among those taking medication, compared to the placebo group (<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">Diabetes</ulink> Prevention Program Research Group, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0047">2015</link>). Though the sustained effects were not as large as the original findings, the DPP showed substantial long‐term durability.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0038">Since completion of the original trial, the DPP has been implemented widely in YMCAs, churches, and other settings (Ackermann et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0018">2008</link>; Aziz et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0021">2015</link>). The DPP is a year‐long program delivered in person, using web‐based tools, or in a hybrid format. The core program includes 16 sessions over the first six months and 6 sessions in the next six months. Trained lifestyle coaches deliver a standardized curriculum. The program goals are to support <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6651">weight loss</ulink> through healthier eating and regular physical activity, thereby reducing the risk of developing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink>. Although it was not originally designed for scale‐up in nonclinical settings, the broad translation has increased the reach of the program to diverse populations.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0039">The VA created an in‐house version, called the VA‐DPP, a 12‐month program that, like the original DPP, includes 22 sessions delivered by a CDC‐certified coach (Damschroder et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0040">2017</link>). For the VA‐DPP, a clinical champion gained leadership commitment, the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">Diabetes</ulink> Prevention Support Center trained coaches and team members, and sites adapted an implementation protocol. A coordinating center offered support for a uniform approach across five sites. Researchers conducted an implementation assessment and used CFIR to examine implementation barriers and facilitators, the fidelity of delivery, satisfaction among participants, and implementation costs. They also used the RE‐AIM planning and evaluation framework (Glasgow et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0054">2019</link>) to guide evaluation of the implementation outcomes.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0040">The team conducted semi‐structured interviews with VA‐DPP team members and other staff members at the sites during early implementation (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 15) and post‐enrollment (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 23). The study drew on all five domains of the CFIR (intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, individual characteristics, and implementation process) and the five domains of RE‐AIM. The data sources for analysis included participant questionnaires and transcripts, site visit notes, meeting minutes, and communications. VA‐DPP staff used a checklist to measure fidelity or the extent to which the program was delivered as intended. Participant satisfaction was measured and implementation costs were also examined, focusing on recruitment/implementation of VA‐DPP and conducting sessions. The study identified several contextual barriers and facilitators to implementing the program.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0041">Fidelity for VA‐DPP at the site level was high, as was participant satisfaction. The costs of various phases of program delivery were: assessing eligibility ($68 per person), scheduling and supporting continued participation ($328 per person), and delivering the program ($101 per group session or $ 2,220 for the planned 22 sessions). The cost for completed sessions averaged $46 per participant. Overall, the study highlighted a need for multipronged strategies to support successful implementation of VA‐DPP and the substantial investment required to engage participants and implement the DPP on a large scale. The study also illustrates how context, assessed in terms of CFIR constructs, links with implementation strategies such as training and using champions to support EBI implementation.</para>
