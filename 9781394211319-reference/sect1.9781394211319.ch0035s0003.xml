   <para id="ch0035s0000p0041">The IM framework for planning multilevel health promotion programs (Bartholomew et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0041">2016</link>; Fernandez et al., 2019) was built on the foundation of PRECEDE‐PROCEED. IM adds detail to the processes of intervention development, implementation, and evaluation. IM defines determinants of behavioral and environmental change, identifies theory‐based change methods to influence those determinants, and designs practical applications of those change methods that fit with the population and setting. IM has guided the development of health promotion programs for many different health problems (Millet et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0070">2022</link>; Ravicz et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0076">2022</link>) and has helped guide community‐based participatory research (CBPR) in planning efforts (Guzman‐Tordecilla et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0060">2022</link>).</para>

   <para id="ch0035s0000p0042">Each step of IM comprises several tasks, and the completion of all steps creates a blueprint or “map” for designing, implementing, and evaluating an intervention. The process is intended to be iterative using several “core processes” across steps including brainstorming, conducting a literature review, applying theory, and gathering information and/or new data. (Bartholomew et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0041">2016</link>; Ruiter &amp; Crutzen, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0079">2020</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0043">This step consists of four tasks: (1) establish a planning group; (2) conduct a needs and assets assessment; (3) describe the context for the intervention (including the community, population, and setting); and (4) state the intervention goals. A product of Step 1 is the logic model<emphasis>of the problem</emphasis> (Bartholomew et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0041">2016</link>). The developers of IM use a modified version of PRECEDE‐PROCEED in this step, combining predisposing and reinforcing factors into one category of “personal” determinants: those cognitive and emotional factors that <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to either behavior of the risk group or the behaviors of persons in the environment. Enabling factors, or the environmental conditions that make the behavior of the risk group either easier or more difficult, are included in the “environment” box of the logic model. Following a description of the health and quality of life problem, the behavioral and environmental factors influencing the problem, and the determinants causing the risk behaviors and detrimental environmental conditions, planners articulate program goals that would result in improvements in health and quality of life.</para>

      <title>Step 2: Intervention Outcomes and Objectives</title>
      <anchor id="ch0035s0003a0003"/>
      <anchor id="ch0035s0000a0036"/>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0044">The guiding question for planners (in Step 2) is: “What needs to change to decrease or eliminate the health problem and the behavioral and environmental risks?” To create the Logic Model of Change, planners utilize theory and evidence to describe the targets of change for the intervention. This step includes four tasks: (1) state the desired behavioral and environmental outcomes; (2) specify the performance objectives for behavioral and environmental outcomes; (3) select determinants for behavioral and environmental outcomes; and (4) construct matrices of change objectives.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0045">The IM Logic Model of Change depicts hypothesized causal pathways of how the intervention (its methods and practical applications of those methods) influences determinants and behavior of both the at‐risk group and the environmental change agents, and, ultimately, how these changes <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to health and quality of life outcomes. In this step, planners decide what behavioral and environmental factors are associated most strongly with improvement in health outcomes (relevance), and which are most changeable.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0046">Some theories help consider what behaviors should be the target(s) for change. For example, Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) emphasizes the interaction between a person and their social and physical environments and is congruent with the emphasis of this IM step on the importance of change in both the at‐risk group and the environment (see<ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>). Other theories specify the detail of the behavior targeted for change. For example, Self‐Regulation Theory (Vohs &amp; Baumeister, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0085">2016</link>) and theories of goal setting and planning (Latham &amp; Arshoff, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0066">2015</link>) guide planners to break behavior change into the processes of self‐monitoring, goal setting, planning, performing, and evaluating strategies. When thinking about change in organizations, political entities, or communities, theories at a higher ecological level can be helpful. These include theories of social support (<ulink url="ch0024">Chapter 10</ulink>), social networks (<ulink url="ch0025">Chapter 11</ulink>), organizational change (Hussain et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0063">2018</link>) and community organization (Wallerstein et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0086">2020</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0047">The next task in this step is to use theory, evidence, and new data to understand the hypothesized determinants of the behavioral changes for the at‐risk group and environmental agents. These determinants answer the question of<emphasis>why</emphasis> the person at‐risk, or the environmental agent, would contribute to a change in behavior or the environment condition respectively.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0048">A central activity of IM is to create a matrix of the<emphasis>change objectives</emphasis> that specify <emphasis>who and what</emphasis> should change. Change objectives are the intersection of the performance objectives and the determinants guided by the question, “What must change in the determinant to bring about the performance objective?” The answers to this question form the cells of the matrix and become the targets for change in an intervention. In the middle school example described in the next section, the planning team asked, “What must the intervention change in knowledge, skills, and self‐efficacy for students to avoid peers and potential dating partners that engage in unhealthy relationship behaviors?” The matrices guide decisions about what theory‐based change methods will likely influence change in determinants.</para>

      <title>Step 3: Methods and Practical Applications</title>

      <anchor id="ch0035s0000a0038"/>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0049">Step 3 consists of three tasks: (1) generate intervention ideas with the planning group; (2) choose theory and evidence‐based change methods; and (3) select or design practical applications to deliver change methods. In this step, planners make decisions about theory‐based change methods and how best to apply them, generating possible program themes and major program components. A theory‐based change method is a defined process for how interventions can influence change in the determinants of behavior of individuals, groups, or social structures. Different methods influence different determinants. Some theories used to understand or predict a behavior may offer little or no guidance on how to change determinants related to the behavior; thus, other theories may be needed for this purpose. For example, the Health Belief Model (HBM) suggests the importance of perceived susceptibility in predicting action but offers little guidance about how to change this belief (see<ulink url="ch0018">Chapter 5</ulink>). SCT, on the other hand, offers specific methods for affecting change in determinants (see <ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>).</para>

         <emphasis>Parameters</emphasis> of methods describe the way they should be translated into a practical application such that the application preserves the conditions for effectiveness (“instructions” for effective use of a method). For example, “modeling” (a method) is effective only <emphasis>if</emphasis> it is (1) reinforced; and (2) when observers pay attention, have adequate self‐efficacy and skills, identify with the model, and observe a coping model rather than a mastery model (Bartholomew et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0041">2016</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0051">Step 4 consists of four tasks: (1) define the intervention’s structure and reach; (2) plan intervention‐related messages, materials, and activities; (3) produce intervention materials, activities, and protocols; and (4) pretest, refine, and finalize materials and activities. As planners produce the program’s materials and protocols, they must recognize that theory‐based methods (from Step 3) are likely to be a major foundation of an intervention’s “active ingredients” or expected mechanism of action of the intervention. As planners determine messages, content, and delivery of the program, they must keep in mind the determinants, methods, parameters, and potential delivery. In this step, theory‐derived change methods are operationalized and included in practical delivery strategies that are woven into a coherent program with a defined scope and sequence. The final delivered interventions will often comprise a multicomponent and multilevel program targeting change in both at‐risk groups and environmental agents, with each part of the program requiring materials and messages.</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0052">In this step, planners focus on designing strategies to ensure program adoption, implementation, and sustainment. Step 5 includes five tasks: (1) conduct a needs and assets assessment and identify program implementers; (2) identify implementation performance objectives and determinants to create matrices of change objectives; (3) choose change methods and implementation strategies; (4) produce implementation protocols and materials; and (5) evaluate implementation outcomes. An implementation plan, including designated strategies to accelerate and improve program use, is essential to ensure that the program is delivered as planned (with fidelity) and that it reaches the populations of interest.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0053">While this step has been integral to the process since IM was first described, it recently gained considerable attention within the implementation science community as “Implementation Mapping” because of its utility in providing a systematic approach to the design of implementation strategies (Fernandez et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0049">2019</link>). IM can be used both as part of the initial planning of an intervention (as Step 5 in the six‐step planning process) or independently to plan strategies for improving adoption, implementation and/or maintenance of existing evidence‐based interventions (Kang &amp; Foster, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0064">2022</link>; Pérez Jolles et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0073">2022</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0054">In Step 5, planners use similar processes of considering needs and assets as described in Step 1, and develop performance objectives, and identify determinants (Step 2). The subjects performing the tasks in this step, however, are the program adopters, implementers, and maintainers. Working with potential adopters and implementers as core members of the planning group at the onset of a project can form the foundation for developing program components that directly affect implementation.</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0055">In Step 6 planners propose process and outcome evaluation methods. This step consists of six tasks: (1) Write effect and process evaluation questions; (2) Find indicators and measures for assessment; (3) Specify the evaluation design; (4) Complete the evaluation plan; (5) Pilot test the intervention and finalize the evaluation plan; and (6) Interpret/act on evaluation findings. The foundation for evaluating an IM‐designed intervention is the products of earlier steps. The logic model of change and matrices for the intervention and its implementation suggest the constructs that could be measured, ranging from the ultimate effect on quality of life or health problems to near term effects to further right on the logic model (e.g., change in determinants). This will depend on the quality of the evidence already available. For example, since the effect of low <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=620">birth weight</ulink> on infant health and the contribution of maternal tobacco smoking to low <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=620">birth weight</ulink> is already known, the evaluator should focus on maternal smoking.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0056">Process evaluation should always be conducted to confirm the extent to which the program was implemented with fidelity and reached the intended beneficiaries and environmental change agents, was received and acceptable. Ongoing or intermittent monitoring allows for learning about problems or gaps that allows for adjustment.</para>
