   <title>Basic Principles of Social Marketing</title>
   <anchor id="ch0037s0002a0001"/>
   <anchor id="ch0037s0000a0009"/>
   <para>In this section, we describe four principles that have made social marketing popular and effective as a health promotion strategy: (1) focus on behavioral outcomes, (2) prioritize consumers’ rather than marketers’ benefits, (3) use audience segmentation, and (4) draw on a marketing perspective.</para>

         <para>
            <emphasis>Focusing on behavior</emphasis>: In the past, “products” were defined broadly to include ideas (such as FP, protecting the environment), attitudes (such as preference for small family size, approval of recycling), availability of services (such as FP clinics, recycling centers) and behaviors (such as using hormonal contraceptives, recycling glass bottles). But Andreasen (<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0080">1994</link>, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0081">2006</link>) and others argue that the proper objective of social marketing is to influence behavior. It is not enough to promote the purchase of products or services; people must obtain <emphasis>and</emphasis> use them because usually it is use, rather than possession <emphasis>per se</emphasis>, that confers benefit. A condom marketing campaign would have to be judged unsuccessful if condoms were not used effectively and consistently as they were meant to be—to prevent disease and pregnancy. In other words, the focus on behavior is inextricably linked to the second principle, consumer benefit.</para>

      <listitem id="ch0037s0000li0006">
         <para>
            <emphasis>Prioritizing consumer benefits</emphasis>: A general dimension of communication campaigns—<emphasis>locus of benefit</emphasis> (Rogers &amp; Storey, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0115">1987</link>)—refers to whether successful achievement of program objectives primarily benefits the program designers or the program audience. Compared to commercial marketing campaigns, social marketing campaigns primarily benefit members of the audience or society at large in the form of such outcomes as better health or a cleaner and more stable environment, although some have suggested that co‐creation of value by marketers and consumers with common goals means benefits (and costs) are mutually shared (Lefebvre, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0106">2012</link>). Nevertheless, consumer or societal benefit is paramount.</para>

      <listitem id="ch0037s0000li0007">
         <para>
            <emphasis>Using audience segmentation</emphasis>: The principle of audience segmentation refers to the identification of relatively homogeneous subgroups and the development of marketing strategies customized to the characteristics of each subgroup. Different subgroups require different strategies because they value different benefits associated with a product, prioritize cost considerations differently, seek and obtain product information or social support for behavior change through different channels, and respond differently to some message formats or appeals than others. Segmentation strategies typically consider socioeconomic, cultural, geographical, psychographic, and age characteristics of an audience as well as patterns of use (such as high or low, frequent or infrequent, experienced or inexperienced) to identify clusters that respond or relate in similar ways to a product (see Warner, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0123">2019</link>; Wonneberger et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0126">2020</link>; Noar &amp; Harrington, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0109">2016</link> for examples of segmentation and cultural tailoring approaches).</para>

   <para id="ch0037s0000p0012">Consider an adolescent reproductive health campaign focused on reducing teenage pregnancy. Within the age range of 14–18 years, some individuals are sexually active, and some are not. An audience segmentation strategy for teenage pregnancy prevention based on sexual activity status might focus on condom use for teens who are sexually active and abstinence or delay of sexual debut for teens who are not sexually active. Each product/behavior would have its own bundle of benefits, product and message placement, description of costs and benefits, and promotional strategy (perhaps using different types of role models) appropriate for each audience segment.</para>

         <para>
            <emphasis>Maintaining a market perspective</emphasis>: Another principle of social marketing that sets it apart from other forms of persuasive communication is the concept of the market itself. First, a market perspective requires adoption of a <emphasis>consumer orientation</emphasis>; that is, markets revolve around consumer needs and desires and the ways in which decisions are made to satisfy those needs.</para>

   </itemizedlist>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0013">Second, the functioning of markets depends on the<emphasis>circulation of information</emphasis> about products that are available, what they cost, how they can be used, what benefits they provide, and where to obtain them. Third, promoted products always face <emphasis>competition</emphasis> for the consumer’s attention and resources in a dynamic marketplace of ideas, priorities, and choices.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0014">Some social marketing approaches refer to strategies addressing an<emphasis>upstream</emphasis> focus on infrastructural change (such as policy or regulatory requirements) or a <emphasis>downstream</emphasis> focus on individual change (such as knowledge, attitudes, or practices) (Andreasen, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0081">2006</link>). Often, upstream and downstream strategies need to be coordinated to change upstream structural conditions that pose downstream barriers to individual change.</para>
