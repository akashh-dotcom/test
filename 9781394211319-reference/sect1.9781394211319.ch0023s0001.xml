   <para id="ch0023s0000p0009">SCT proposes that behavior is the product of a dynamic, multidirectional interaction between (1) personal cognitive influences, (2) social/environmental influences, and (3) supporting behavioral factors. The three domains of behavioral influences have a shared, mediating relationship defined as<emphasis>reciprocal determinism</emphasis> (<anchor id="ch0023s0000a0008"/>
      <link linkend="ch0023s0000a0010">Figure 9.1</link>). <emphasis>Reciprocal determinism</emphasis> assumes that each determinant of behavior is changing (or changeable) while also influencing (and being influenced by) the remaining determinants. Reciprocal determinism is a foundational concept of SCT and provides a framework for understanding influences on behavior and behavior change. The concepts of SCT are translated into several major constructs to observe and target determinants of behavior.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0023s0000a0014"/>
      <para id="ch0023s0000p0011">Personal cognitive influences on behavior include four constructs: (1) self‐efficacy, (2) collective efficacy, (3) outcome expectations, and (4) knowledge. These constructs are rooted in the concept that individuals play an active role (they have<emphasis>agency</emphasis>) in their environments and behaviors (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0007">2001</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0014">2018</link>). Individuals exercise <emphasis>agency</emphasis> when they set goals and establish plans to reach their expected outcomes (<emphasis>forethought</emphasis>), shift their goals, objectives, and outcome expectations (<emphasis>self‐regulation</emphasis>), and, most importantly, reflect on their self, capacities, and actions (<emphasis>self‐reflection</emphasis>) (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0009">2005</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0014">2018</link>).</para>

         <anchor id="ch0023s0000a0015"/>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0012">Self‐efficacy is a cognitive process defined as one’s<emphasis>confidence</emphasis> in the ability to exercise agency to achieve an outcome. Self‐efficacy is the seminal construct of SCT (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0005">1977</link>; Bandura &amp; Walters, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0017">1977</link>) and is related directly to setting a behavioral goal, the level of effort needed to master new skills, and the sustainability of this effort in the face of personal setbacks and environmental barriers. Like all SCT constructs, self‐efficacy varies from behavior to behavior and environment to environment. Someone may be experienced and justifiably confident in their ability to prepare a meal (self‐efficacy for cooking) but have little experience and confidence in preparing meals that adhere to the dietary restrictions needed to manage chronic health conditions like <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3296">kidney disease</ulink>. To sustain behavior change, interventions must target <emphasis>situational</emphasis> self‐efficacy, such as self‐efficacy to incorporate dietary restriction into an existing repertoire of meal preparation skills.</para>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0013">Self‐efficacy is developed through: (1) previous mastery experiences, (2) vicarious experience, (3) social persuasion, and (4) emotional arousal. Through experience, a person develops behavior‐related skills and becomes familiar with the expected outcomes of engaging in the behavior. Active learning strategies can increase self‐efficacy by coaching a person through the incremental steps needed to develop behavioral mastery. Active learning strategies include using nutrition labels to create healthy meals, demonstrating proper condom use for safer sex practices, and practicing refusal skills to resist peer pressure for substance use.</para>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0014">Self‐efficacy is also impacted by observing the experiences of others, or<emphasis>vicarious learning experiences</emphasis>. Individuals watch the behaviors and corresponding outcomes of other people and incorporate these vicarious experiences into their confidence and agency toward engaging in those behaviors. An individual is likely to gain (or lose) confidence in their ability to undertake a behavior upon observing a behavior modeled by someone with a shared degree of agency and behavioral capacity. Similarly, observing people of similar (or aspirational) social status more strongly influences the impact of the modeled behavior. Thus, behavioral modeling efforts must be relevant to the target audience's demographics, culture, economics, and environment.</para>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0015">Social persuasion speaks to the perceived cultural norms and beliefs, social support, and reinforcement of a behavior. Direct encouragement or discouragement is a common form of social persuasion. Influential experts and social role models impact self‐efficacy by persuading others to recognize the benefits of a behavior, support the expected and realized outcomes, and reinforce the benefits of behavioral change. School teachers can be influential experts who increase their students’ self‐efficacy to remain tobacco‐free by normalizing the perceptions that most youths do not use tobacco (normative beliefs toward peers), and that using tobacco results in short‐ and long‐term social consequences and physical addiction (reinforcement of use).</para>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0016">The impact of social persuasion on self‐efficacy is influenced heavily by the status, influence, and proximity of the source. For example, the same school‐based interventions that incorporate teachers as influential experts also rely on credible classroom same‐age role models to transmit social information via small‐group discussions and role play. Role models can be particularly effective at increasing self‐efficacy for certain health behaviors when they demonstrate behavioral change and navigate similar cultural norms and beliefs, social support, barriers/opportunities, and reinforcement as the individual who wants to change behavior (Brown et al.,<link linkend="ch0023s0000li0023">2016</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0024">2019</link>; Huang &amp; Shen, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0041">2016</link>; Koniak‐Griffin et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0044">2015</link>; O’Brien et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0056">2010</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0017">Self‐efficacy is influenced by the emotional arousal of direct and vicarious experiences. Strong emotional arousal in response to specific behavioral cues elicits cognitions of anticipated failure or success, affecting an individual’s confidence and agency (self‐efficacy) to engage in behavior. Interventions that target emotional arousal must be relevant to their target population with an authentic approach to health education. For example, messages designed to increase emotional arousal toward the negative health consequences of substance use (addiction; incarceration) are unlikely to effectively impact behavior without also addressing the<emphasis>situational</emphasis> self‐efficacy needed to avoid substance use (for example, self‐efficacy to resist peer pressure).</para>
         <anchor id="ch0023s0000a0016"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="102"/>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0018">These four sources of self‐efficacy, previous mastery experiences, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and emotional arousal help explain behavioral motivation, and can be incorporated into health behavior change strategies designed to improve confidence, agency, and self‐efficacy. The impact of these four sources of self‐efficacy varies from person to person, environment to environment, and behavior to behavior, although mastery experience is considered the most influential source of self‐efficacy: one must know how to engage in a behavior to exhibit that behavior (Bandura et al.,<link linkend="ch0023s0000li0015">1999</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0023s0000p0019">Collective efficacy, like self‐efficacy, is fundamental to understanding cognition and behavior because many goals and objectives are achievable only through group action (Bandura,<link linkend="ch0023s0000li0014">2018</link>). Collective efficacy describes how individuals perceive the capacity of a group or organization to act toward achieving a shared agenda (Hipp, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0040">2016</link>), including withstanding opposition and discouraging setbacks (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0006">2000</link>). Collective efficacy is developed through the same cognitive processes as self‐efficacy—mastery experiences; vicarious experience; social persuasion; and emotional arousal—but at a group collective level. Groups and communities have used collective action to address social determinants of health through improved working conditions, increased economic opportunities, and equitable regulatory policies (Hagedorn et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0037">2016</link>; Malinowski et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0046">2015</link>). Interventions can improve collective efficacy through activities on the individual level (direct education and training), group level (self‐help groups; family‐to‐family engagement), and community level (media campaigns), often led by community coalitions comprised of local leaders and interested parties (Butel &amp; Braun, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0027">2019</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0023s0000p0020">In SCT, knowledge includes an understanding of the significance (health risk/benefits) and components (scope/sequence) of a behavior. Most important is instrumental knowledge, or the “how‐to” information, as distinct from etiologic information. Individuals gain knowledge by learning the significance and step‐by‐step processes of engaging in a behavior through direct education and vicarious experiences. To change behavior, knowledge is necessary but not sufficient—it is a cognitive prerequisite, but knowledge alone does not explain or change behavior (Bandura,<link linkend="ch0023s0000li0008">2004</link>). Instead, knowledge of a behavior’s outcome and processes must be combined with the <emphasis>skills</emphasis> to engage in that behavior in order to develop the <emphasis>capacity</emphasis> to conduct and sustain the behavior (<link linkend="ch0023s0000a0013">Table 9.1</link>).

Behavior is an evolving process resulting from comparing outcome expectation with internal and external standards (self‐evaluative outcome expectations). Behaviors can be reinforced by feelings of satisfaction, pride, joy, and belonging. Conversely, behaviors can be punished through an individual’s negative cognitions: emotional feelings of disillusionment, shame, sadness, disgust, or rejection.

         <para id="ch0023s0000p0024">SCT is rooted in the concept that individuals can learn behavior vicariously by observing others. Understanding the origins, and underlying mechanisms, through which social and environmental influences determine cognition and capacity is essential to understanding and changing behavior (Bandura,<link linkend="ch0023s0000li0011">2009</link>). Individuals do not merely mimic what is observed (Bushman &amp; Whitaker, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0026">2012</link>) but apply cognitive processes to observed behavior and its paired response (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0010">2008</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0012">2011</link>). Simply observing someone engaged in a behavior can increase knowledge and self‐efficacy of that behavior, but it may not result in adopting a behavior (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0010">2008</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0013">2013</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0014">2018</link>). Observing that same behavior paired with a relevant reward or consequence can influence an individual’s outcome expectations toward a behavior and make undertaking the behavior more likely (Stacey et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0071">2015</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0025">The transition from observation to behavior occurs through four cognitive processes: (1) attention; (2) memory; (3) production; and (4) motivation (Bandura,<link linkend="ch0023s0000li0010">2008</link>). When viewing a behavior, a person’s level of attention depends on the internal functional value of the observed behavior. People are less likely to attend to consequences they do not value. Cognitive retention can depend on a person’s intellectual capacity (such as ability to read or readiness to learn), stage of physical growth and maturity, state of inebriation, or psychological impairment. People are not likely to be influenced by observed events if they do not remember them. An important source of self‐efficacy from observational learning also comes from remembering past outcomes from behavior and having the ability to reconstruct past events. Production is the level of knowledge, skills, and self‐efficacy already possessed (or the level of willingness to learn them) for performing the modeled behavior. The richer the knowledge and repertoire of needed subskills, the easier it is to integrate them into new forms of behavior. Motivation is determined by the expected costs and benefits of the observed behavior.</para>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0026">Individuals are selective in what they choose to observe, retain, consider, and act upon. Thus, interventions must gain their attention, recall, and forethought in order to increase motivation to engage in and sustain a behavior. The impact of observational learning on motivation is impacted by the cost and benefit of a behavior weighed against the individual’s personal standards (self‐regulation) and actions (self‐evaluation) (Bandura,<link linkend="ch0023s0000li0013">2013</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0014">2018</link>).</para>

In SCT, normative beliefs are developed through direct and observed experiences, and exposure to media. Norms begin with the perceived prevalence of a behavior within a population and/or setting (binge drinking among college students, for example). Individuals consider these norms through <emphasis>self‐evaluation</emphasis> and <emphasis>social evaluation</emphasis>. Per SCT, people adopt standards of behavior and regulate their actions through their idealized self‐concept (self‐evaluation) while balancing the perceived social pressures toward a behavior and the motivation to comply with those pressures (<emphasis>social evaluation</emphasis>) (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0008">2004</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0023s0000p0028">SCT‐guided interventions can apply normative change strategies focused on correcting misperceptions of the prevalence of a behavior. School‐based tobacco prevention programs address student misperceptions about adolescent tobacco use by providing local or national data about tobacco use for the corresponding age and grade‐level (Kelder et al.,<link linkend="ch0023s0000li0043">2021</link>; Thomas et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0075">2015</link>). People connect new information related to a behavior to their own social‐ and self‐evaluation of a behavior. A social evaluation may include perceived loss or gain of peer groups due to drinking <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink>. Self‐evaluation describes how an individual believes that engaging in a behavior (and the corresponding social evaluations) aligns with their self‐image and identity.</para>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0029">Behaviors are reinforced by perceptions of the prevailing, normative beliefs. Behaviors that violate norms can bring social consequences, leading individuals to balance normative influences with their own behavioral standards (self‐regulation; self‐evaluation). The more one believes that behavior is (dis)encouraged or (dis)approved by significant role models, the more social pressure they feel to adopt community norms. However, individuals also develop a self‐concept and identity through considering, establishing, and regulating their behavioral standards, or exercising their agency. Individuals evaluate themselves in relation to those in their social environment, with the most accurate and impactful comparison being those perceived to be most similar to themselves (Schunk &amp; Greene,<link linkend="ch0023s0000li0065">2017</link>; Usher &amp; Schunk, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0076">2017</link>). To impact normative beliefs, interventions must target the cognitive processes of social and self‐evaluations through health messages delivered by highly regarded social agents. However, no person has mono‐cultural normative beliefs, meaning interventions must aim for authenticity in their message content and delivery. Health messages delivered with the requisite social influence to impact how an individual perceives a behavior that aligns with their evaluation of self and social environment should be more successful.</para>

Creating and sustaining social support is essential for maintaining a behavior. Social support during behavioral acquisition aids in adhering to the desired behavior, allowing individuals to develop self‐efficacy, which supports their targeted behavior.

Cognitive barriers to behavior might include low self‐efficacy to cook healthy meals or harmful perceived social norms toward preventive health care (COVID‐19 masking or immunizations). Barriers are not solely cognitive; the probability (and possibility) of behavioral change is determined in part by attributes of the social and physical environment. Because social and environmental influences are often social and economic in nature (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0008">2004</link>), multilevel interventions that address individual and social/environmental determinants of health are optimal (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0008">2004</link>). For example, cooking instruction is an effective learning activity to increase self‐efficacy and behavior capacity or skills to cook healthy meals. However, cooking requires resources (time and money); thus, to adopt the behavior over time, individuals must be able to purchase the foods and prepare the recipes as directed by the instructions or lessons.</para>

Behavioral intentions are an indication of an individual’s readiness to perform a given behavior and are assumed to be an antecedent to behavior. Intentions are shaped by forethought (planning the future) and are established through internal standards for behavior (self‐evaluation). When developing intentions to engage in a behavior, individuals set behavioral goals to increase their agency, self‐efficacy, and behavioral capacity upon achievement or completion of their goals. In SCT, goals and intentions are influenced by a person’s motivations to engage in a behavior. Interventions that target the underlying motivations for behavior change are more likely to influence behavioral intentions and encourage goal setting. SCT‐guided interventions focus beyond short‐term behavioral change and, instead, are designed so that participants gain the motivations, goals, and intentions toward sustained behavioral change after the conclusion of an intervention (i.e., self‐management).

Reinforcers are the stimuli that strengthen (positive reinforcer) or weaken (negative reinforcer) the association between behaviors and stimuli. Positive reinforcement occurs when a rewarding stimulus is given after the performance of a specific behavior, so that the behavior increases. For example, offering extra recess time as a reward for eating a specific number of fruits and vegetables on a given day can reinforce healthful eating. Conversely, negative reinforcement occurs when an aversive stimulus is removed as a result of a specific behavior, also in an effort to increase the behavior.</para>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0038">Per SCT, individuals develop outcome expectations for a specific behavior not only through pairing reinforcers with behaviors but also through the lens of cognitive and environmental influences on behavior. In other words, individuals have their own cognitions about the pairing of behavior and reinforcer. SCT notes that the degree to which a reinforcer incentivizes behavior will vary by person and situational context. By incorporating cognition into our understanding of the stimulus‐response process, SCT provides a more detailed explanation for the origins of outcome expectations as well as a complete roadmap to assist in adding and maintaining new behaviors.</para>
