   <para id="ch0023s0000p0066">SCT provides a framework for understanding the complexities of human behavior. According to SCT, prevention programs that rely too heavily on didactic, knowledge‐based strategies and place too little emphasis on developing<emphasis>behavioral capacity</emphasis> are unlikely to generate meaningful or sustainable results. It is a straightforward task to deliver health knowledge, but far more difficult to change perceptions of self‐efficacy, outcome expectations, social support, and barriers/opportunities toward a target behavior. Further, SCT‐guided interventions often focus primarily on individual behavior change, overlooking or not adequately considering the environmental influences of behavior during intervention design. SCT constructs are <emphasis>situational</emphasis> and must be considered with careful delineation, tailoring, measurement, and application to the target population, setting, and behavior. Thus, it is essential to consider the multiple levels of the social and physical environment as well as individual‐level determinants of behavior described by SCT (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0010">2008</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0013">2013</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0014">2018</link>). The breadth of the socioeconomic model provides a framework for exploring SCT constructs within various domains (e.g., family, community, school). Laws and their corresponding administration (i.e., public policy) are significant determinants of behavior. As one example, CDC <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10324">Best Practices</ulink> for Comprehensive Tobacco Control recommends several policy changes to reduce tobacco use, particularly among youth, such as increased excise taxes and enhanced enforcement of tobacco sales (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0030">2014</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0023s0000p0067">Technological advances have and will continue to heavily influence the application, evaluation, and evolution of SCT. Digital and online technologies (e.g., wearable technology; digital surveys) and measurement methods (e.g., ecological momentary assessments) expand the contextual information and setting through which we can measure SCT constructs. Such innovative applications of SCT can improve the development of effective, theory‐driven health interventions. However, the profound impact of technological advances on SCT extends beyond methods of data collection. SCT is rooted in the concept that human thoughts and behaviors are heavily influenced by observing the actions and consequences of others (vicarious experience). SCT was developed in the 1960s when television was becoming a popular method of communication (Bandura et al.,<link linkend="ch0023s0000li0016">1961</link>). Originally, television content was largely standardized across homes, with few channels and sporadic programming. Now, users can select from a myriad of content for which to observe—and engage—through a single, handheld device. SCT emerged during the technological revolution of the mid‐20<superscript>th</superscript> century and must continue to evolve through the 21<superscript>st</superscript> century and beyond.</para>
