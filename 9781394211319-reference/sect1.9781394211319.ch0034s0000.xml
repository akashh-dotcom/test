   <para id="ch0034s0000p0003">In<ulink url="ch0035">Chapter 19</ulink>, María Fernández and co‐authors describe two well‐developed planning models, PRECEDE‐PROCEED and Intervention Mapping (IM), that can be used to integrate and apply diverse theoretical frameworks. Both models take comprehensive approaches that begin with assessing the problem and population and continue to evaluate, based on a theoretically informed logic model. They illustrate the ways behavior change theories can be applied and incorporated into a systematic planning process and note the challenges of applying the models. Similar to some theories discussed in earlier chapters, using these planning models can be demanding and laborious for practitioners and community groups. But when mastered, they can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to effective, appropriate health behavior change programs.</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0004">While health behavior theories are critical tools, they do not substitute for adequate planning and research. However, theories help in interpreting problem situations and in planning feasible, promising interventions and appropriate program evaluations. Theories aid in articulating assumptions behind intervention strategies and can be useful in pinpointing intermediate steps that should be assessed in evaluations.</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0005">The PRECEDE/PROCEED Model centers on the systematic application of theory and previous research to assess local needs, priorities, circumstances, and resources (Green &amp; Kreuter,<link linkend="ch0034s0000li0013">1991</link>). Concepts of priority, changeability, and community preferences should be considered, along with analytical and empirical findings about health behavior determinants. For example, health experts concerned with effecting distribution of safe drinking <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> must understand how people in communities think about <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> sources and what beliefs might be amenable to change. These ideas are also consistent with concepts presented in earlier chapters on community engagement, implementation, and dissemination.</para>

   <para id="ch0034s0000p0006">Fernández and colleagues also review IM, a framework for developing theory‐ and evidence‐based multilevel health behavior/education programs, and illustrate how IM has been applied. IM can help guide program planners toward explicit specification of how to use both theory and empirical findings to develop effective health behavior interventions.</para>
