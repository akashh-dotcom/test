   <para id="ch0024s0000p0014">The study of social relationships and physical health has a long research tradition. One early influence was the renowned French sociologist Émile Durkheim. In <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> classic analysis of suicide rates across social classes, cultures, religious affiliations, and genders, he argued that suicide rates were tied closely to the social environment (Durkheim et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0047">1951</link>). For instance, he argued that egoistic suicide—suicide committed by individuals who were social outcasts and saw themselves as being alone or outsiders—resulted from excessive individualism and lack of integration of the individual into society or family life. These individuals were left to face life’s challenges on their own. Durkheim’s analysis was compelling and led to a subsequent focus on more specific aspects of social relationships related to health outcomes.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0015">In 1976, two influential reviews were published that emphasized the health relevance of the qualitative aspects of social networks. They gave rise to an emphasis in health psychology on the functional support that social networks may provide. Cobb (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0036">1976</link>) defined social support as information from others that one is cared for, loved, esteemed, and part of a mutually supportive network. Cobb reviewed evidence suggesting that these social support resources were important in dealing with stressful life events, such as pregnancy, hospitalization, and bereavement. Cassell (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0030">1976</link>) focused more on the biological processes linking support to health. He argued that social support might be seen as a protective factor, and he reviewed studies suggesting that such a relationship factor might modify bodily processes (e.g., <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> pressure or endocrine activity) in health‐relevant ways. These two reviews highlighted the important role that functional social support might play in physical health outcomes.</para>

   <para id="ch0024s0000p0016">A few years after these groundbreaking reviews, one of the first population‐based longitudinal research studies linking social relationships to mortality was published. Lisa Berkman and Leonard Syme (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0021">1979</link>) examined survey responses of nearly 7,000 residents of Alameda County, California. More specifically, they linked answers to questions about the extent of people's social connections to overall mortality and found that people with fewer social ties had higher mortality rates. This classic paper was groundbreaking because it ruled out possible alternative explanations (e.g., results due to poorer initial health status) and provided highly compelling evidence for the link between social relationships and mortality.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0017">While Berkman and Syme (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0021">1979</link>) focused on the structure of social relationships, one of the first community‐based epidemiological studies linking functional support to health was conducted by Dan Blazer (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0024">1982</link>) in a community sample of older adults in Durham County, North Carolina. Even when adjusting for standard control variables, such as physical health status and smoking, <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> analyses showed that perceptions of greater functional support predicted lower mortality rates. These results also held when accounting for structural measures of social integration, such as those used by Berkman and Syme (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0021">1979</link>), thereby showing an association between perceptions of support and physical health regardless of the size of one’s network.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0018">Finally, in 1988, James House and <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> colleagues published a paper titled “Social Relationships and Health” in the journal<emphasis>Science</emphasis> (House et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0065">1988</link>). After examining evidence from the available, prospective studies, the authors concluded that being socially integrated had an independent protective effect on mortality. These effects were of similar magnitude to those found for <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> pressure, smoking, and physical activity. This review’s careful analysis of well‐designed prospective studies stimulated further research on the links between more specific aspects of support and health outcomes.</para>
