   <para id="ch0030s0000p0037">Robust measurement and evaluation of community engagement concepts and their application are important to determine their value for improving behaviors and health. From the scientific perspective, valid and precise measurement is needed to test theory‐informed strategies and theoretical models. From a practice perspective, measurement enables partnerships to reflect on their community engagement and identify strengths and areas for improvement. Measurement for science and practice is most useful when guided by a clearly defined framework that drives the choice of measures and measurement strategies. Research designs circumscribe what can be learned from an empirical evaluation of a program. This section explores major measurement, evaluation, and research design issues associated with community engagement in research and practice, with an emphasis on CBPR strategies.</para>

      <para id="ch0030s0000p0038">As originally conceived, CBPR was defined as a research approach on the highly collaborative end of the “engagement” continuum (Israel et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0038">1998</link>). TIPS exemplifies this original approach as a CBPR project that engaged church leaders at every stage of research—problem identification and program conception, development, testing, and dissemination—to address <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>/<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=66">AIDS</ulink> inequity among African Americans. Various models and frameworks of CBPR have emerged to fit other unique communities. For example, the tribal participatory research model (Richmond et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0060">2008</link>) and the <emphasis>He Pikinga Waiora</emphasis> (Enhancing Wellbeing) Implementation Framework (Oetzel et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0054">2017</link>) translated the principles of CBPR centered on self‐determination for American Indian and Alaska Native and Māori and Pacific Islander communities, respectively.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0039">CBPR has evolved from a general research approach to a multidimensional research strategy. Research by leading CBPR scholars has identified and examined the dimensions and concepts of CBPR to describe a CPBR conceptual model (Wallerstein et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0075">2018</link>). They developed a visual framework to illustrate important concepts for measurement and practice. It has been applied in a variety of CBPR projects and has a robust evidence base for measurement. Recent research has also advanced the understanding of theoretical mechanisms in the model (Oetzel et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0053">2022</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0040">The CBPR conceptual model depicted in<anchor id="ch0030s0000a0026"/>
         <link linkend="ch0030s0000a0028">Figure 15.1</link> illustrates relationships among the key constructs of CBPR within four domains: context, partnership dynamics, research/intervention, and outcomes. Context involves community capacity and structural governance factors that shape the CBPR partnership and partnership dynamics. These factors include commitment to collective empowerment (e.g., collective reflection and shared influence) and relational dynamics (e.g., participatory decision‐making). Partnership dynamics influence the actions of research projects, including the integration of community knowledge into the research design, research processes that empower partners, and community engagement in research actions. These processes produce research outputs that are culturally centered and synergistic of community and academic/scientific expectations. The research processes and outputs then produce intermediate (e.g., power‐sharing and capacity building) and distal outcomes (e.g., community transformation and health improvement) for the CBPR partners, partnership, and the targeted community.</para>

      <para id="ch0030s0000p0041">This CBPR conceptual model has been developed and revised based on over a decade of research. A two‐phased, NIH‐funded research project examined how different elements of the CBPR conceptual model were applied in nearly 400 CBPR or community‐engaged partnerships in the US and found support for many dimensions of the model (Wallerstein et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0075">2018</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0077">2020</link>). A recent study surveyed 453 community and academic partners from 163 CBPR projects regarding their perceptions of context, collective reflection, relational dynamics, research processes (e.g., synergy and community engagement), intermediate outcomes, and projected long‐term outcomes). The survey data were analyzed using structural equation modeling with fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis, an approach that identifies whether a set of attributes—individually or in some configuration—explain a condition of interest (Lee, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0043">2014</link>). The structural equation model this analysis produced provided support for the relationships identified in the conceptual model. Specifically, it unpacked the structural model by examining which combination of four concepts—context, structural governance, relationships, and collective empowerment—were associated with synergy and community engagement in research actions since these are key mediators of the context/process to health outcomes. The results indicated that <emphasis>structural governance</emphasis> was the key mechanism for community engagement in research actions and <emphasis>collective empowerment</emphasis> was the key mechanism for synergy; thus, the key reported mechanisms by which CPBR context and processes produced health‐ and health‐related outcomes (Oetzel et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0053">2022</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0042">As shown in<link linkend="ch0030s0000a0028">Figure 15.1</link>, community capacity influences collective empowerment, which in turn, influences both relationships (i.e., relational dynamics) and community engagement in research actions. Structural governance also influences community engagement in research actions. Relationships affect partnerships and partner transformation (i.e., intermediate outcomes) and projected outcomes (distal outcomes) through partnership synergy. Community engagement in research actions directly impacts these outcomes.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0043">Structural governance is how decisions are made and resources are shared for the benefit of the community (Sanchez‐Youngman et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0067">2021</link>). Collective empowerment is the commitment to CBPR principles and participatory processes to leverage community resilience in health programs and health research. Beyond the fit of the model and identifying these key mechanisms, Oetzel et al.’s (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0053">2022</link>) study also illustrates a robust set of measurement tools for researchers and practitioners to consider for evaluation and continual improvement.</para>

      <title>Measurement and Evaluation Issues</title>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0005a0003"/>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0030"/>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0044">Despite the robust measurement tools and advances in applying novel analytic methods to CBPR discussed above, reviews of measures of community engagement practices and concepts have identified several important issues in measurement and evaluation that need to be considered (Sandoval et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0068">2012</link>; Tigges et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0071">2019</link>). One issue is the considerable variation in how particular constructs are conceptualized and measured in research on different community‐engaged projects (Luger et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0045">2020</link>). There is a need for conceptual clarity about what is being measured, particularly in terms of measuring the goals of a community‐engaged project and the goals that are most valued by a community and/or partner (Wallerstein et al., in press). One way to achieve this, as with research based on any model, is by systematically using the chosen model to guide conceptualization and measurement, and ensuring that the measures fit with the needs and values of the community. Key questions to ask are whether they are pragmatic, low‐burden, and actionable.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0045">There is debate about the need for standardized measures with psychometric evidence versus a need to have locally derived measures that fit the needs and context of the community (Luger et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0045">2020</link>; Tigges et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0071">2019</link>). Systematic reviews have revealed limited data about psychometric reliability and validity in community engagement measures (Sandoval et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0068">2012</link>; Tigges et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0071">2019</link>). For example, Luger et al. (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0045">2020</link>) identified 69 measures of context, process, or outcomes in community‐engaged research projects, and yet fewer than half had been tested for reliability or validity. Having scientifically validated approaches is important for credibility in the evaluation and to build a robust body of evidence. However, meeting local needs continues to be vital in community‐engaged research and practice.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0046">The need to bridge scientific rigor with community needs can be challenging but should also be feasible. Luger et al. (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0045">2020</link>) suggest a hybrid approach of using both validated and locally derived measures. This may involve the adaptation of validated measures to fit the local context. It is important to integrate qualitative approaches to measure what communities value and do so in ways that are culturally appropriate and valued (Wallerstein et al., in press). Specific measures and qualitative tools of the CBPR conceptual model can be found in several sources (Boursaw et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0020">2021</link>; Wallerstein et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0075">2018</link>), which can be adapted to fit local needs and have good psychometric evidence.</para>

      <para id="ch0030s0000p0047">There is no one definitive way to test CBPR or other forms of community‐engaged research. CBPR processes can be studied through nonintervention or descriptive research (e.g., Oetzel et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0053">2022</link>). Interventions developed through CBPR, and community‐engaged research processes can be studied through pre‐experimental (pre‐post), quasi‐experimental, or experimental designs. With quasi‐experimental and experimental designs, the comparative interventions might be done without community engagement or other types of treatment and controls. This section examines some of the key issues around experimental designs of interventions created with CBPR.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0048">Although randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs are the scientific <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14640">gold</ulink> standards to establish the efficacy of an intervention, some researchers argue that RCT designs are counter to the values and goals of CBPR because of the degree of control over real‐world conditions needed for rigorous testing of interventions (Trickett,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0072">2011</link>). Proponents of CBPR argue that community engagement can improve external or ecological validity because it better reflects real‐world applications or conditions (Collins et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0025">2018</link>), but it may make replication more challenging.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0049">CBPR and RCT designs can be blended, depending on the goals of the project and the needs of the community. There are many published examples of this. The TIPS partnership successfully conducted an RCT using a CBPR approach (Berkley‐Patton et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0019">2019</link>). They randomized four comparable churches: two churches to the intervention condition (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 235 participants/respondents) and two to a control condition (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 308 participants). They found that participants at churches in the intervention condition were significantly more likely to get an <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> test in the next 6 months and 12 months than those in the control condition (47% versus 28% and 59% versus 42%, respectively). Other examples of community‐academic partnerships that used an RCT to test the efficacy of an intervention in the context of CBPR include a cultural dance program (Kaholokula et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0039">2021</link>) and a community‐health‐worker initiative (Rosenthal et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0061">2014</link>).</para>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0032"/>
      <beginpage pagenum="193"/>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0050">Goodkind et al. (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0035">2017</link>) provide recommendations to address some of the perceived tension between the methods of RCTs and the values and goals of CBPR. They suggest using mixed‐method designs to explore the processes, contexts, and power dynamics of intervention implementation to address external validity issues; the consideration of the different forms of evidence valued by researchers and community partners; mutual decision‐making to implement an RCT; and conducting group orientations to explain study design before enrollment and public randomization process.</para>
