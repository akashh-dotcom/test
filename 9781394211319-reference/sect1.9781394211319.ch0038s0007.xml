   <para id="ch0038s0000p0038">In a relatively short time, social media have become ubiquitous and have transformed the way people interact. This rapid change has led to concerns about their effects on health, especially the health of youth and adolescents. A close look at the literature reveals a large, though scattered, body of research that has examined the effects of social media use on a range of health‐related outcomes over the past decade. However, the evidence is mixed and inconclusive, and low‐quality research methods reduce the strength of any conclusions from these studies.</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0039">There are helpful, harmful, and benign ways of interacting with social media technologies; accordingly, there are positive, negative, and neutral effects of social media on health. Preoccupation with negative effects may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to societal “moral panics” as was the case with mass media, in general, and television, in particular, several decades ago (Walsh,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0072">2020</link>). A limited understanding of both the negative and positive effects of these platforms on population health may misplace research agenda and public policies. We must understand not only how social media use could become addictive and harmful but also the ways and conditions in which these ubiquitous platforms can be leveraged to redress the lack of in‐person social interactions and thereby improve population health.</para>

   <para id="ch0038s0000p0040">Future research should consider individual and social factors that moderate and mediate the effects of social media use on health outcomes. Moreover, there is a need to go beyond time‐based predictors (investigating the effects of time spent on social media) to content‐based predictors (type of content, including its valence, consumed on social media) (Valkenburg,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0062">2022</link>). Most studies on the effects of social media use on health lump a range of different types of social media platforms or search for aggregate effects (Bekalu et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0022">2022</link>; Kross et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0042">2021</link>). Because different social media platforms have different features and affordances (properties or environments that permit social action), a more precise picture of the associations between social media platforms and health might be obtained from studying individual platforms.</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0041">Researchers have called for a “causal effect heterogeneity” approach to the study of social media use and health (Valkenburg,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0062">2022</link>). Instead of relying on average associations derived from heterogeneous populations of social media users who differ in how they select and respond to social media, we need causal effect models that enable us to better understand why and how individuals differ in their responses to social media use.</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0042">Given the usefulness of theory to guide researchers in their search to understand why and how social media use influences health and well‐being, the limited presence of theory in the social media literature is a concern as well. Theories can be useful to inform research design, develop measures, and interpret findings. Atheoretical studies sometimes fail to give attention to the underlying processes and mechanisms that might explain why social media use may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to harmful or beneficial outcomes.</para>
