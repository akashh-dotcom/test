      <para id="ch0020s0000p0006">The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) conceptualizes the process of intentional behavior change and provides a framework for behavior change communications and interventions. The TTM includes and integrates key constructs from other theories into a comprehensive theory of change that provides a framework for matching interventions to an individual’s readiness along a continuum of change. TTM can be applied to a variety of behaviors, populations, and settings—hence, the name Transtheoretical. While often referred to as the “stages of change model,” this term can be misleading as the stages of change are only one aspect of the complete model.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0007">Since it was first introduced in the late 1970s (Prochaska &amp; Norcross,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0080">1979</link>), researchers across the world have expanded, validated, applied, and challenged core constructs of TTM (Imeri et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0045">2022</link>; Mastellos et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0061">2014</link>; Prochaska et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0089">2008</link>; Sussman et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0107">2022</link>). Originally developed to address smoking cessation, the TTM has been tested and applied to a broad range of health and social behaviors, including <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink> and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8412">substance abuse</ulink>, COVID‐19 vaccinations, financial well‐being, resilience, anxiety disorders, bullying, delinquency, depression, overall well‐being, weight management, high‐fat diets, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>/<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=66">AIDS</ulink> prevention, mammography and other <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> screening, medication compliance, domestic violence, unplanned pregnancy prevention, sedentary lifestyles, sun exposure, and physicians practicing preventive medicine (Hall &amp; Rossi, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0036">2008</link>; Hashemzadeh et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0038">2019</link>). However, to conceptualize the importance of using a theoretical model when approaching change management, it is helpful to use a specific public health concern for context.</para>

      <title>Background</title>

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0008">Historically, behavior change was viewed as a specific moment in time, either all or nothing. Someone either adopts a new behavior, or they do not. They stop harmful behaviors, or they do not. After an intervention, individuals who took actions leading to positive outcomes were considered successes, while those who did not were considered to have failed. When the majority of individuals in programs “fail,” as they often do, it can be demoralizing for researchers, clinicians, public health providers, and patients (Hartmann‐Boyce et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0037">2021</link>; Wewers et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0111">2003</link>). However, this is based upon the belief that change only happens at one particular moment. This is where TTM comes into play.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0009">The TTM emerged from a comparative analysis of 25 leading theories of psychotherapy in an effort to integrate a field that had fragmented into more than 300 theories (Prochaska &amp; Norcross,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0080">1979</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0082">2018</link>). Those theories had much more to say about <emphasis>why</emphasis> people change than about <emphasis>how</emphasis> they change. They were really theories of behavior, such as theories of personality and psychopathology, rather than theories of behavior <emphasis>change</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0010">Early research identified 10 processes of change that described the key ways in which people changed their behaviors. These included consciousness raising from the Freudian tradition (Freud,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0030">1959</link>), contingency management from B. F. Skinner (Skinner, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0104">1966</link>), and forming helping relationships from Carl Rogers’ work (Rogers, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0096">1951</link>). Further research included an analysis of self‐changers compared to those in professional treatment. An integrative model of change should reflect <emphasis>how</emphasis> people change on their own and with professional guidance. A study by DiClemente and Prochaska (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0018">1982</link>) assessed the frequency of use of each of the 10 processes of change previously identified (DiClemente &amp; Prochaska, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0018">1982</link>) and found that participants used different processes of change at different times in their smoking cessation journeys. Upon further investigation, it was determined that their behavior change processes unfolded through a series of stages with different change processes used at different stages (Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0079">1983</link>). This was the first exploration and definition of the TTM of Behavior Change.</para>
