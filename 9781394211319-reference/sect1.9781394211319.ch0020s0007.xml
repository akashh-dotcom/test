   <para id="ch0020s0000p0062">This chapter described the core constructs of TTM and how these constructs can be integrated across the stages of change. Empirical support for basic constructs of TTM and for applied research was presented, along with conceptual and empirical challenges from critics. Applications of TTM‐tailored interventions with diverse populations and behaviors were explored with an example of programs developed for SBIRT within <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10343">primary care</ulink> practices for individuals with SUDs and for advanced care planning. These examples illustrate the range of behaviors and populations to which the TTM has been successfully applied, and how programs can be successfully designed using a TTM approach. A major theme is that programmatically building and applying core constructs of TTM at the individual level can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to high‐impact programs for enhancing health at the population level.</para>
