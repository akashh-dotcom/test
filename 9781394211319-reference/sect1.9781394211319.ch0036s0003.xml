   <para id="ch0036s0000p0036">The field of behavioral economics has had an important impact on the study of health behavior and on the design of health policies and programs. “Nudge units” and “behavioral insights teams,” designed to incorporate insights from behavioral economics into the design of public policies, have been formed within the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many other countries. A recent study estimated that nearly 200 such units have been formed globally (DellaVigna &amp; Linos,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0026">2022</link>). The UK Behavioral Insights team has developed the “Mindspace” (Messenger, Incentives, Norms, Defaults, Salience, Priming, Affect, Commitments, Ego) framework to help policymakers choose and apply nudge strategies to influence behavior (Matjasko et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0054">2016</link>). Nudge units have designed policies and strategies to tackle a wide range of health behaviors among both patients and providers, including antibiotic prescribing, smoking, and vaccination. The World Health Organization and United Nations also have formed behavioral insights teams, opening up the possibility for behavioral economics to contribute to global health policy and practice (Ghebreyesus, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0032">2021</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0036s0000p0037">Insights from behavioral economics increasingly are influencing the design of products and services in the private sector as well. For example, many employers offer incentive‐based wellness programs to their employees that incorporate behavioral economic insights regarding the design of optimal incentives (e.g., cash payments for exercising or for quitting smoking) (Loewenstein et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0051">2013</link>). CVS Caremark has used behavioral economic findings to improve medication adherence (Girdish et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0033">2017</link>; Matlin et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0055">2015</link>). Finally, behavioral economic concepts such as pre‐commitment, status quo bias, and salience all play an important role in the design of health‐related digital applications such as StickK, Noom, and Beeminder.</para>
   <para id="ch0036s0000p0038">Systematic reviews of research testing the effectiveness of behavioral economic nudges in health care generally point toward meaningful, yet often modest, impacts. Several reviews have found that clinician‐directed nudges can increase compliance with clinical guidelines and motivate targeted behavior change (Last et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0046">2021</link>; Nwafor et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0065">2021</link>; Yoong et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0093">2020</link>). Although these studies generally have found that nudges can effectively guide desirable clinician behavior, important gaps in this research remain. First, certain types of nudge strategies for directing clinician behavior have been tested much more extensively than others. For example, interventions that use information framing (often in the form of peer comparison) and choice guiding (e.g., through assignment of default options) make up most nudge strategies (Last et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0046">2021</link>). Second, most of these studies take place in the United States and other high‐income settings. Generating more evidence regarding the impact of behavioral economic strategies to improve healthcare‐provider quality of care in low‐ and middle‐income countries is an important priority. Third, many clinician‐directed nudges have been tested over a short time frame and within a single setting (Last et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0046">2021</link>). While more evidence on the long‐term effectiveness of incentives and behavioral nudges is needed, existing studies indicate that the effects of interventions typically decline after interventions are stopped (Harkins et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0039">2017</link>; Volpp et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0087">2009</link>). One study found that interventions designed by government nudge units and implemented “at scale” (impacting millions of people) have had a positive, significant impact on targeted behavior change, but that the effects are substantially smaller in magnitude than those found in academic studies often conducted at a smaller scale (DellaVigna &amp; Linos, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0026">2022</link>).</para>

   <para id="ch0036s0000p0039">Some critics of behavioral economics argue that its application to health policy can be paternalistic and potentially coercive. Using peoples’ known cognitive biases and judgment errors to influence their choices may be seen as deceptive and restrictive of personal freedom. For example, we have already described how powerful the selection of a default option can be, with most people tending to use the default across a wide range of choices. But who gets to decide what the default should be, and how do we know it is “best”? Behavioral nudges have been tested in a number of highly consequential choice settings, including advance directives for end‐of‐life care (Halpern et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0036">2013</link>) and organ donation (Johnson &amp; Goldstein, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0040">2003</link>). However, behavioral economists argue that nudges do not remove autonomy or restrict people’s freedom of choice in any way and, in that sense, are “libertarian paternalism” (Thaler &amp; Sunstein, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0080">2009</link>). They also argue that all choices are made in some kind of choice architecture—someone is setting a default or choosing how information is conveyed—so why not then choose the choice architecture that is likely to <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to the most desired outcome? Finally, they argue that behavioral economics is not attempting to change people’s preferences but, rather, helping them overcome obstacles to achieving the behaviors they actually want to adopt.</para>
   <para id="ch0036s0000p0040">Another criticism of behavioral economics is that behavioral nudges have often not translated into large impacts at scale (DellaVigna &amp; Linos,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0026">2022</link>). One potential reason for this modest impact is because of the tendency for behavioral‐economic‐inspired interventions to be focused on individual‐level choices (“i‐frame” interventions) instead of changes to the overall system (“s‐frame” interventions) in which individuals make these choices (Chater &amp; Loewenstein, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0018">2022</link>). For example, a range of i‐frame interventions have been tested to combat <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink>—one of the most pressing public health concerns in the United States and elsewhere—including healthy eating (Arno &amp; Thomas, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0008">2016</link>), weight‐loss incentives (Li et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0049">2021</link>) and nudges to increase gym attendance (Milkman et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0058">2021</link>), with notable but varying effects that may fade over time (Chater &amp; Loewenstein, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0018">2022</link>). While behavioral nudges that help people accomplish their desired diet and exercise habits may be an important part of addressing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4357">obesity</ulink>, a focus on individual‐level behavior change may be detracting from needed system‐level changes, including regulation, taxation, increasing activity‐friendly environments, and promoting smaller serving sizes. It is likely that public health problems will need to be addressed through a combination of i‐frame and s‐frame approaches, as research in one area informs the other.</para>
   <para id="ch0036s0000p0041">The field of behavioral economics now has global influence, informing the design of policies, programs, and products in government, health systems, and the private sector. A major priority for behavioral economics is to strengthen the evidence base within low‐ and middle‐income countries. Much research is needed to uncover how behavioral economics could help inform strategies to combat major illnesses like <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3716">malaria</ulink> in these settings, and to strengthen quality of healthcare in resource‐strained health systems. Another critical priority for behavioral economics is research and evaluation focused on health equity. While behavioral economics has offered critical insights into improvements in healthcare utilization and quality, the implications of behavioral economic nudges for health equity rarely have been explored.</para>
