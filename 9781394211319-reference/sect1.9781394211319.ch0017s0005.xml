   <para id="ch0017s0000p0024">Theories of health behavior that focus on individuals are widely used and valuable tools for public health practitioners, researchers, and policymakers. They offer generally agreed upon descriptions of how people think and feel, and how those thoughts and feelings influence health behavior. While theories that are good predictors and intervention foundations in some health behavior contexts may fall short in others (Brewer et al.,<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0001">2019</link>), the theories in this section provide an important starting point for understanding health behaviors.</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0025">It is critical to consider the larger context of health behavior, including environment, broadly defined, in efforts to improve population health (Hagger and Weed,<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0004">2019</link>). That means going beyond some variables in individual‐level theories of health behavior. Additional constructs, such as implementation intentions, may be important in directing a focus on performance of desired behaviors (Gollwitzer and Sheeran, <link linkend="ch0017s0000li0003">2006</link>). Implementation intentions involve making plans that are specific to external events or contexts, for example, how to avoid smoking while socializing with friends who smoke.</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0026">More attention also should be given to understanding what kinds of behaviors different theories are best suited to address. Theories of the individual should give more consideration to race and racism and to biologic and regulatory systems that may affect the gap between what people want to do and are able to do (Rejeski and Fanning,<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0005">2019</link>). Later sections of this book provide more detail on strategies, such as incentives, race, and racism, and structured approaches for developing theory‐based interventions.</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0027">Part 2 of this book includes individual‐level theories that are well‐established and have benefited from recent refinements. Development of health behavior theories is an evolutionary process. We urge careful attention to research design and measurement in studies that aim to explain how variables in the theories contribute to explaining behaviors and other outcomes.</para>
