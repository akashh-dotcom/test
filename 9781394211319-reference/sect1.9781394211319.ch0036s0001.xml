      <anchor id="ch0036s0001a0002"/>
      <anchor id="ch0036s0000a0009"/>
      <para id="ch0036s0000p0009">To understand human behavior and identify promising behavior change interventions, the discipline of economics has commonly relied on a model grounded in the assumption that individuals are rational, self‐interested decision‐makers who seek to maximize their “utility,” or well‐being. The model posits that three important factors influence our choices: (1) “preferences” that characterize our tastes and values, (2) relative prices associated with the various choices available, and (3) the constraints on available resources such as time or money. Preferences describe individuals’ likes and dislikes, the extent to which they value the present relative to the future, and the degree of risk or uncertainty they are willing to tolerate—all of which can influence one’s propensity to engage in certain health behaviors. Prices reflect the costs of purchasing health products and services. And finally, resource constraints usually refer to the amount of income available for procuring health products and services and time constraints that can influence health behaviors. We discuss each of these factors before explaining how behavioral economics theories represent a departure from this standard approach to understanding human behavior.</para>
      <para id="ch0036s0000p0010">For many health behaviors, it is easy to see why individual preferences might be important. There may be substantial variation across individuals, e.g., in their liking for certain types of foods or for certain forms of exercise. Some individuals may place greater emphasis on the future costs or benefits stemming from their behaviors. As a result, they may be less likely to smoke cigarettes or more likely to take medications as prescribed. These temporal preferences are associated with both health behaviors and outcomes in several studies (Bradford et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0014">2017</link>; Thirumurthy et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0081">2015</link>). Preferences toward risk are other relevant decision‐making factors. Heterogeneity in risk preferences and the association between risk preferences and risky health behaviors have been documented in many studies (Anderson &amp; Mellor, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0007">2008</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0036s0000p0011">The propensity to use health services or engage in healthy behaviors can also be influenced through the provision of health information to people. This insight has motivated many public health campaigns that aim to raise awareness about the importance of healthy behaviors or the harms of unhealthy behaviors. Empirical evidence on the effects of information provision is mixed. Some studies have documented large impacts of one‐time information provision. For example, a study in Kenya found that simply informing teenage girls about the risk of unsafe sex with older men who have a higher likelihood of being <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>‐positive led to sexual behavior change and reduced pregnancy risk for the girls (Dupas,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0029">2011</link>). Larger‐scale testing and applications of this approach to other types of behavior and in other countries have shown more muted effects, however. In the United States, researchers and policymakers have sought to influence food choices by providing caloric and other nutrition information on food items. Again, there is some evidence that this type of information can alter people’s preferences and behavior (Shangguan et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0075">2019</link>; Wisdom et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0092">2010</link>), but nutrition labeling is not consistently effective across settings such as restaurants (Fernandes et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0030">2016</link>). These examples underscore the idea that, when designing public health interventions to promote healthy behavior, the provision of information alone may be insufficient.</para>
      <para id="ch0036s0000p0012">Prices are the second fundamental determinant of health behavior in traditional economic models. Prices are highly relevant to understand health behavior and continue to shape health policy in important ways. A large literature has shown that prices of health products and services influence demand. The RAND health insurance experiment showed long ago that healthcare utilization is driven by the prices people face (Manning et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0053">1987</link>). In low‐income countries, randomized trials have demonstrated that people’s demands for life‐saving health products and services are highly sensitive to prices even when prices are extremely low. One study from Kenya showed that demand for insecticide‐treated mosquito nets to prevent <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3716">malaria</ulink> was extremely sensitive to small increases in price above zero (Cohen &amp; Dupas, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0021">2010</link>), and another study from Zambia showed high price sensitivity for <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink>‐purification products (Ashraf et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0009">2010</link>). Similarly, a recent study in Zimbabwe found a 25% decline in demand for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> self‐tests among people offered self‐tests for $0.50 instead of being offered them for free (Chang et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0017">2019</link>). A key lesson that emerges from these studies in low‐income countries is that there is a compelling rationale for fully subsidizing healthcare products and services instead of charging user fees for them (Cohen, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0020">2019</link>). This is especially the case for health products and services associated with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1210">infectious diseases</ulink>, where usage by one individual can influence health outcomes of other individuals.</para>
      <para id="ch0036s0000p0013">In addition to public subsidies, two other policy measures also follow directly from the recognition that prices influence people’s decisions. One is use of taxes to raise prices faced by individuals and thereby curb certain unhealthy behaviors. Another is use of financial incentives to increase benefits associated with certain health behavior and thereby promote those healthier behaviors. Taxes are a widely used policy measure not only for raising government revenue but also for changing human behavior (Chaloupka et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0015">2011</link>). Cigarette taxes are perhaps the most prominent example of taxes as a lever for behavior change in global health. Multiple studies have shown that taxes are an effective way to reduce smoking rates, particularly in combination with other measures such as information campaigns and reduced access to and restrictions on advertising (Davis <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0024">2008</link>). More recently, in response to growing concern about rising <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink>, some governments have begun to impose taxes on sugar‐sweetened beverages. Studies from Mexico and individual cities in the United States have suggested that this is one way to reduce sugar‐sweetened beverage consumption (Colchero et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0023">2016</link>; <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15012">Silver</ulink> et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0077">2017</link>; Roberto et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0073">2019</link>). Financial incentives (which we discuss in the next section in the context of present bias) have a clear and compelling rationale even in the standard model of decision‐making. Just as subsidies lower the prices faced by consumers and thereby boost demand, incentives can offset various opportunity costs associated with seeking health services and bring down the full price faced by consumers.</para>

      <beginpage pagenum="261"/>
      <para id="ch0036s0000p0014">Resources available to individuals are the third and final determinant of health behavior in standard economic models of decision‐making. A core prediction of economic theory is that when all else is equal, individuals facing financial barriers or time constraints will be less able to access healthcare than those without such issues. This provides further motivation for interventions such as price subsidies or health insurance with limited cost‐sharing (i.e., small <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10307">deductible</ulink>, copayments, or coinsurance); in recent years, there have been a number of efforts in low‐ or middle‐income countries to expand access to health insurance. Another policy response to curb the effects of poverty on health has been the provision of unconditional cash transfers. Many countries have expanded unconditional cash transfer programs with the goal of both alleviating poverty and improving health outcomes (Pega et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0070">2022</link>). Later, in this chapter, we discuss additional ways in which poverty can influence health outcomes by summarizing recent research on the psychological consequences of poverty.</para>

      <title>Historical Development of Behavioral Economics Theories</title>
      <anchor id="ch0036s0001a0003"/>
      <anchor id="ch0036s0000a0011"/>
      <para id="ch0036s0000p0015">Behavioral economics has received increasing attention because of its conceptual appeal in describing and influencing human behavior. In addition, it has considerable potential to offer relatively low‐cost and unobtrusive solutions to some of the most serious health problems around the world. Behavioral economics theories address some of the important limitations of standard economic theories of health behavior. For example, it is often not the case that people make fully rational decisions, that they are driven primarily by self‐interest, or that they have stable preferences. Standard economic theories also ignore the fact that individuals’ preferences and behaviors are strongly influenced by factors such as what those in one’s social network are doing.</para>
      <para id="ch0036s0000p0016">Over the past several decades, leaders in behavioral economics have described how people’s decisions differ from standard economic models (see<anchor id="ch0036s0000a0012"/>
         <link linkend="ch0036s0000a0014">Table 20.1</link>). While economists such as Herb Simon mapped out concepts of “bounded rationality” in the 1950s (Simon, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0078">1955</link>), and Maurice Allais in 1953 laid out the Allais Paradox (to a group of leading economists) (Allais, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0005">1953</link>) as a contradiction to standard expected utility maximization, the publication of Prospect Theory by Kahneman and Tversky (<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0042">1979</link>) is widely credited with being seminal in the development of behavioral economics. Prospect Theory provided an overarching conceptual framework to describe what Kahneman and Tversky and others had observed in a number of studies about human behaviors that could not be explained by expected utility theory. In essence, Prospect Theory has several important components that include: (1) how people feel about a set of possible outcomes depends on their starting point. This is the notion of reference‐dependence in which decisionmakers evaluate outcomes as gains or losses depending on their starting point; (2) there is diminished sensitivity to both gains and losses, depending on the starting point; and (3) people exhibit <emphasis>loss aversion</emphasis> (the reduction in one’s welfare due to a monetary loss is much stronger than the gain in welfare due to an equivalent gain) (Kahneman, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0041">2011</link>; Kahneman &amp; Tversky, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0042">1979</link>). Another important implication of this theory is that people <emphasis>over‐</emphasis>weight small probabilities (nonlinear probability weighting).</para>

      <para id="ch0036s0000p0017">The importance of reference points is illustrated nicely by an example Kahneman gives in <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> book<emphasis>Thinking Fast and Slow</emphasis> (Kahneman, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0041">2011</link>). Consider two people who today each have $4 million. Standard models would consider them to have roughly equivalent utility of wealth. However, imagine that as of yesterday, one of the two had $1 million and the other had $7 million. Clearly, the person who had $1 million yesterday should be ecstatic today and the one who had $7 million yesterday would be despondent. Diminishing sensitivity to changes in wealth (or utility more broadly) is illustrated by this example: consider the utility of getting an extra $500 when your wealth is $1 million as opposed to if you have no money. The utility of this extra $500 is much greater if you have no (or very little) money than if you already have a lot.</para>
      <para id="ch0036s0000p0018">A number of studies have shown that people have what Kahneman calls a “loss aversion ratio” in a range of 1.5–2.5; that is, people dislike losing more than they like winning (Novemsky &amp; Kahneman,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0064">2005</link>). For example, when given a 50/50 chance of winning $150 or losing $100, most people would not voluntarily choose this gamble because the potential <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> of losing $100 is greater than the joy of winning $150. Under standard expected utility maximization, it would be a “no‐brainer” to take this gamble since the expected utility is 0.5(−$100) + 0.5 ($150) or $25.</para>

      <para id="ch0036s0000p0019">The potential of behavioral economics for population health is that many of the same messages, incentives, and choice structures used so effectively to lure people into situations where they may be exploited or encouraged toward unhealthy behaviors can be redirected to attract them to healthier choices that can improve their long‐term well‐being (<anchor id="ch0036s0000a0016"/>
         <link linkend="ch0036s0000a0019">Table 20.2</link> provides an overview of several key concepts).

In this section, we describe some of the key concepts from behavioral economics, including examples of decision errors and how they can be used to enhance the effectiveness of programs aimed at improving health behaviors.</para>

         <para id="ch0036s0000p0020">Many health‐related behaviors require us to make tradeoffs between present and future costs and benefits. Seeking preventive care, for example, requires incurring immediate time costs and potential <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10510">economic costs</ulink> in exchange for achieving better health in the future. For such behaviors, the<emphasis>immediacy</emphasis> of costs and benefits often influences decisions to a much greater extent than would be expected from the rational tendency to discount the future. When individuals engage in such <emphasis>present‐biased</emphasis> decision‐making, they may be less likely to engage in health behaviors that have large benefits—behaviors like quitting smoking, exercising, or using <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10502">preventive services</ulink>. Such decision‐making also implies, however, that we may be able to guide individuals toward forward‐looking, healthy behaviors by offering them immediate, salient rewards or lowering the immediate costs associated with engaging in those behaviors.</para>
         <para id="ch0036s0000p0021">Present bias in decision‐making motivates the widespread use of financial and nonfinancial incentives for healthy behaviors in many parts of the world. A study in rural India found that providing caregivers nonfinancial incentives worth approximately $1 per immunization (along with reliable services) led to significantly higher immunization rates (Banerjee et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0011">2010</link>). Another study in Malawi found that small financial incentives ranging from $0.20 to $3 led to higher <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>‐testing uptake among adults (Thornton, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0084">2008</link>). Incentives to promote healthier behaviors have not always succeeded, however, and there are a number of lessons to be learned from these examples as well (Thirumurthy et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0082">2019a</link>). For example, incentives have generally been less effective in promoting repeated health behaviors like medication adherence (Thirumurthy et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0083">2019b</link>; Volpp et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0088">2017</link>), which often requires frequent, nearly daily pill‐taking and therefore makes it harder to motivate with frequent incentives. For incentive interventions to succeed, it is important that payments be delivered as close in time as possible to the behaviors of interest. With new technologies that make it possible to monitor behaviors like medication adherence or physical activity, however, the potential for devising more effective incentive‐based interventions is likely to grow. Alternative designs of incentives that leverage the power of lotteries or loss aversion can also help. For example, financial incentives framed as a loss were effective for achieving physical activity goals in one study conducted in the United States (Patel et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0068">2016a</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0036s0000p0022">In many realms of decision‐making, people choose the option placed in front of them—the default option—instead of investing cognitive effort to choose a different option. This preference for the default option is typically referred to as<emphasis>status quo bias</emphasis>, and it explains many behaviors, such as loyalty to specific brands or meal choices at restaurants. Status quo bias can, however, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to suboptimal health behaviors. For example, at a fast‐food restaurant, many consumers may accept the standard side dishes that automatically come with a fast‐food meal. The widespread preference for default options has several explanations. First, choosing an option other than the default requires cognitive effort, as one must spend time and decision‐making “bandwidth” to survey other options and choose an alternative. Second, defaults may convey an implicit level of endorsement from person or organization who is offering the choices—those who are designing the choice environment. Finally, loss aversion may come into play if choosing options other than the default is seen as less desirable.</para>

         <para id="ch0036s0000p0023">In many cases, the power of defaults can be used to steer people toward healthy behaviors. Opt‐out screening programs for various diseases rely on status quo bias, as any given individual will be automatically screened or tested unless they proactively decline (Montoy et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0059">2016</link>). Physician prescribing behaviors also can be influenced by default settings. In one prominent study at a US <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10332">health system</ulink>, there was a 23% point increase in generic medication prescribing rates after an opt‐out checkbox labeled “dispense as written” was added to the prescription screen in the electronic health record (if the checkbox was left unchecked, the generic‐equivalent medication was prescribed) (Patel et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0069">2016b</link>). In several studies, default settings in the electronic health record (e.g., setting the default to 10 tablets instead of no default) either reduced the quantity of opioids prescribed by healthcare professionals or increased compliance with the default quantity of opioid medications (Delgado et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0025">2018</link>; Montoy et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0060">2020</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0036s0000p0024">Another central insight from behavioral economics is that the human mind has limited capacity to attend to all the potentially relevant information and considerations in our lives. In making decisions, our cognitive bandwidth is limited. Most decisions involve some degree of uncertainty, e.g., uncertainty about the chances that a behavior will result in an outcome, uncertainty about all potential outcomes, and uncertainty about how we will feel about that outcome. The human mind is simply not designed to attend to all that information and find an optimal decision the way a computer is. Relatedly, we all have many competing priorities for our time and attention—multiple projects at work or school; families and friends to attend to; our health, nutrition, and wellbeing—and our attention is not always focused on the most important of those competing priorities. Rather, our limited attention is often focused on the priority that is most salient, most recent, or, in some other way, most likely to be at top of mind. Examples of limited attention in public health include medication nonadherence, insufficient take‐up of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3145">influenza</ulink> and COVID vaccinations, and inadequate handwashing and infection control among healthcare workers. Common interventions aimed at increasing the salience of targeted health behaviors in the context of limited attention are SMS reminders (Wagstaff et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0090">2019</link>), healthcare provider checklists (Boyd et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0013">2017</link>), and active choice frameworks (Keller et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0044">2011</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0036s0000p0025">When we must make repeated cognitively effortful decisions, studies show that our mental capacity and the quality of our decision‐making deteriorate. For example, healthcare providers see many patients back‐to‐back over the course of a day, with many visits involving the processing of extensive patient information, a diagnostic decision that must be made, and the creation of a course of action. Behavioral economics research has shown that provider decision making changes over the course of the day, with providers increasingly likely to act in ways that require less effort over time. For example, for providers to decline a prescription request for antibiotics or opioids from patients, providers must take time to counsel patients about why these medications may not be needed or may cause more harm than benefit. Research has shown that prescriptions for antibiotics and opioids increase over the course of a provider’s shift during the day (Linder et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0050">2014</link>; Neprash &amp; Barnett, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0063">2019</link>), as does the decision to refer a patient for physical therapy rather than surgery (Persson et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0071">2019</link>). Promising interventions to combat decision <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2103">fatigue</ulink> include clinical decision support systems and nudge reminders, or small changes that are easy and usually inexpensive to implement.</para>

         <para id="ch0036s0000p0026">A large literature in behavioral economics, marketing, and psychology has demonstrated the significant role of the framing of information and choices in decision‐making (Levin et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0048">1998</link>). In standard economic theory, only the actual content of the information that is presented to people should make a difference in decision‐making, but behavioral economics studies have repeatedly shown that the way in which the information is presented (wording that is used, presentational style, etc.) can matter as well. One prominent example is “loss‐framed” versus “gain‐framed” messages, where the former highlight the consequences of <emphasis>not</emphasis> choosing a particular behavior, and the latter highlight the benefits of choosing that behavior (Rothman &amp; Salovey, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0074">1997</link>). Evidence suggests that gain‐framed messages—such as the benefits of quitting smoking or getting vaccinated—are more likely to encourage preventive health behaviors than loss‐framed messages—such as the consequences of continuing to smoke or not getting vaccinated (Gallagher &amp; Updegraff, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0031">2012</link>). One can also change the framing using different time horizons (e.g., the daily vs. annual cost of a subscription), different denominators (e.g., per population vs. per population‐at‐risk) and different wording (e.g.,“95% fat‐free” versus “5% fat”).</para>

         <para id="ch0036s0000p0027">Many people look to the actions of others to guide their own decisions and behaviors. In a wide range of domains in which we make choices, social norms—the standards for behavior within a particular community or social group—strongly influence behavior. This goes against some predictions from standard economic theory, which suggests that our decisions are driven mainly by private costs and benefits. Social norms theory makes an important distinction between<emphasis>descriptive norms</emphasis> (what we observe other people do) and <emphasis>injunctive norms</emphasis> (what others believe we <emphasis>ought</emphasis> to do) (Reid et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0072">2010</link>). (Also see <ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 6</ulink> on Reasoned Action Approaches.) The power of social norms can be deployed strategically by governments and organizations that seek to encourage people to engage in certain behaviors. One prominent example comes from the United States, where social comparisons have been used to encourage households to conserve energy in their homes. When households received monthly “home energy reports” that featured personalized energy use feedback, comparisons of the household’s recent energy use to that of 100 neighbors with similar house characteristics, as well as energy conservation tips, there were immediate declines in energy consumption (Allcott &amp; Rogers, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0006">2014</link>). Even though there was some decline in consumers’ energy conservation efforts as they became habituated to the monthly reports, long‐term reductions in energy use due to the reports continued. Social comparisons have also been used to influence the behavior of healthcare providers. For example, in one study conducted in the United States, peer comparisons were found to be effective in reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections (Meeker et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0057">2016</link>). Another study found that peer comparison feedback significantly reduced opioid prescription quantities at <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> departments and urgent care sites in the United States (Navathe et al., <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0062">2022</link>).</para>
