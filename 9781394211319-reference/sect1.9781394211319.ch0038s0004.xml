   <title>Health Behavior Interventions that Use Social Media</title>

   <para id="ch0038s0000p0024">A growing body of research is investigating the use of social media as a channel for health promotion and/or disease prevention interventions. Social media can be harnessed for health behavior change interventions in many ways, including the provision of information, support networks, and skills that reinforce positive behaviors. Unlike conventional mass media, too, social media can be used to target and engage specific population groups and individuals. Social media technologies can provide platforms for interactivity whereby each audience member can react to the message source. Social media communications can also be either synchronous or asynchronous, providing audiences with the opportunity to interact with the message anytime and anywhere. Beyond disseminating health information, moreover, social media can provide interventionists with virtual social networks to support health behavior change (<ulink url="ch0025">Chapter 11</ulink>). Virtual social networks can be naturally occurring or created as part of an intervention.</para>

   <para id="ch0038s0000p0025">Overall, reviews of the literature offer sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of social media interventions aiming at changing a range of health behaviors related to both infectious and non‐infectious (non‐communicable) diseases, including numerous published trials and several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses on the effectiveness of social media interventions to change health behaviors and promote well‐being. A recent Cochrane review that combined data for a variety of outcomes, for example, concluded that social media interventions may increase physical activity and improve well‐being (Petkovic et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0053">2021</link>). Also, in a systematic review on theory‐based social media interventions to address vaccine hesitancy, Li and colleagues found that the Health Belief Model (<ulink url="ch0018">Chapter 5</ulink>) was the most frequently deployed theory, and that most interventions used tools such as educational posts, dialogue‐based groups, interactive websites, and personal reminders (Li et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0045">2022</link>). The review also found evidence that theory‐based interventions triggered positive behavior changes more than atheoretical interventions, supporting the efficacy of theory‐based interventions delivered through social media.</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0026">The causal mechanisms through which social media interventions <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to changes in health behaviors, such as increased physical activity, could be related to cognitive effects of exposure to targeted health messages and/or the social influence, social norms, and social support from a virtual social network. A randomized controlled trial investigating whether promotional messaging or peer networks on social media can increase physical activity found that social influence from anonymous online peers was more successful than promotional messages for improving physical activity (Zhang et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0076">2015</link>). Also, a recent review examining the behavior change techniques used in social media interventions for promoting healthy behaviors in adults found that interactive techniques such as “liking,” “retweeting,” “smiling,” “congratulating,” and “badging” were common techniques used in social media interventions to encourage healthful behaviors (Simeon et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0059">2020</link>).</para>
