   <title>Selection of Theories for this Book</title>
   <anchor id="ch0014s0004a0001"/>
   <anchor id="ch0014s0000a0024"/>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0036">Selection of theories and models for inclusion in the sixth edition of<emphasis>Health Behavior: Theory, Research and Practice</emphasis> was based on the published information summarized above, including an updated synthesis of reviews of theory use in the health behavior literature. Each of the most often cited theories and models is the focus of chapters in this volume. They were selected to provide readers with a range of theories representing different units of intervention (for example, individuals, groups, and communities). They also were chosen because they represent, as in the case of SCT, the Transtheoretical Model, and Health Belief Model, dominant theories of health behavior and health behavior change. Others, like social marketing, Intervention Mapping and the PRECEDE/PROCEED Model, and community organization, were selected for their practical value in applying theoretical formulations in a way that has demonstrated usefulness to professionals concerned with health behavior change.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0037">Selection of theories also reflects some difficult editorial decisions. Three criteria helped define selection of material. First, we determined that to be included, a theory must meet basic standards of adequacy for research and practice, thus having the potential for effective use by health behavior practitioners. Second, there must be evidence that the theory is used in<emphasis>current</emphasis> health behavior research. (That is why, for example, we include Health Belief Model rather than Lewin’s Field Theory.) The third criterion is that there must be at least promising, if not substantial, empirical evidence supporting the theory’s validity in predicting or changing health behaviors. This does not preclude the possibility of mixed findings and critiques of the evidence, which we believe are important to bring to light.</para>

   <para id="ch0014s0000p0038">In later sections of the book, a purpose/theme or focus rather than theory is the identifying title for a chapter—as in the case of<ulink url="ch0026">Chapter 12</ulink> on <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, which describes different theories of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and how <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> affects health behavior and health. <ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink> on Race, Health, and Health Equity introduces racism‐related theories and constructs and illustrates how they can be integrated with other widely used health behavior models.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0039">
      <ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink> on Improving Health Through Community Engagement is named for the approach to intervention strategies rather than for the convergent theoretical bases that form the foundation for community organization work. Chapters in Part Five present Intervention Mapping and the PRECEDE‐PROCEED Model for program planning, social marketing, behavioral economics, and social media, each of which draws on multiple theories to understand health behavior and assist in development of effective intervention programs and strategies.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0040">We recognize the lack of consensus regarding the definition and classification of theories and have taken a liberal, ecumenical stance toward theory. The lowest common denominator of the theoretical models herein might be that they are all<emphasis>conceptual or theoretical frameworks</emphasis>, <emphasis>models</emphasis>, or broadly conceived perspectives used to organize ideas. Nevertheless, we have not abandoned the term <emphasis>theory</emphasis> because it accurately describes the spirit of this book and describes the goal to be attained for developing frameworks and tools for refining health education research and practice.</para>
