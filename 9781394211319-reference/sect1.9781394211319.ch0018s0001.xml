   <para id="ch0018s0000p0021">In this section, we discuss how the HBM has been applied to research related to two very different health behaviors. First, we examine how perceived risk for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> has been measured, realizing that those who do not perceive they are <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10304">at risk</ulink> will see no reason to engage in risk‐reducing behaviors. Next, we discuss how HBM constructs have been employed in studies of COVID‐19 vaccinations.</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0022">Type 2 <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> is a chronic condition characterized by high <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> sugar, occurring when the pancreas cannot effectively use the hormone <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=11569">insulin</ulink> that regulates <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> sugar levels. Resulting complications include <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3040">hypoglycemia</ulink>, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3296">kidney disease</ulink>, nerve damage, poor circulation, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2605">heart disease</ulink>, and vision problems. Globally, type 2 <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> ranks among the top ten leading causes of death. Screening individuals at high risk for developing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> (including those who are overweight/obese and/or have a family history of the disease); detecting <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> at an early stage; and connecting the newly diagnosed to treatment can reduce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink>‐related morbidity and mortality (Herman et al.,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0041">2015</link>; US <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10502">Preventive Services</ulink> Task Force, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0081">2021</link>). However, many people at high risk for developing type 2 <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink>—and even many people who already have the condition—are unaware of their status. In the United States, more than 20% of individuals with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> remain undiagnosed (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0031">2022</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0023">Multiple studies have used the HBM to examine beliefs and attitudes, such as perceived susceptibility, among undiagnosed individuals. These studies are important to determine if these perceptions influence individual decisions to participate in screening for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> and in risk‐lowering lifestyle interventions, such as diet and physical activity programs (Esquives et al.,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0037">2021</link>). For example, Dorman and colleagues sought to assess perceived susceptibility in individuals without a diagnosis of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> (Dorman et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0036">2012</link>). Researchers employed a single‐item measure: “Compared to most people your age and sex, what would you say your chances are for developing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink>?” among three groups with increasingly elevated risk: (1) no family history of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> risk factors (e.g., <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink>, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1275">coronary heart disease</ulink>, and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8963">stroke</ulink>); (2) family history of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> alone; and (3) family history of multiple risk factors. Perceived susceptibility varied among the three groups, and there was a stronger association with risk factors as they increased from none to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> alone, to multiple risk factors. However, most people within each group perceived themselves as being at or below “average risk.” Therefore, despite differences in actual risk factors, most participants with elevated risk of developing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> due to familial history still perceived themselves at a risk level that, according to the HBM, would not induce behavior change.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0024">In 2023, Serena Rodriguez and colleagues published a systematic review of studies assessing perceived susceptibility of developing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> among people without a diagnosis (Rodriguez et al.,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0066">2022</link>). They found multiple ways in which the construct had been measured in different studies: (1) multi‐item scales with composite scores; (2) multiple items with no composite score; and (3) a single item. An example of a multi‐item scale includes the Perception of Risk Factors for Type 2 <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">Diabetes</ulink> (PRF‐T2DM) scale that sums the score of six questions about personal and behavioral risk factors (e.g., “What is the effect of your exercise habits on your risk for type 2 <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink>?”) and six questions about environmental risk factors (Sousa et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0074">2010</link>). In contrast, the Risk Perception Survey for Developing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">Diabetes</ulink> (RPS‐DD) is a multi‐item measure that assesses different aspects of perceived susceptibility—internal and external control, worry, and optimistic bias—but does not create a composite score (Walker et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0084">2003</link>).</para>

      <beginpage pagenum="50"/>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0025">Even among studies using a single item to measure perceived susceptibility, Rodriguez et al. (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0066">2022</link>) found a variety of ways to operationalize it. As noted above, Dorman et al.’ (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0036">2012</link>) item asked a respondent to compare their own susceptibility to others using a Likert scale ranging from less to more likely (Ranby et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0063">2010</link>). Other researchers ask about absolute perceived susceptibility—perception of one’s own risk without comparison (Ranby et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0063">2010</link>). Response options for these items often use numerical scales such as “on a scale from 0 to 100, how likely are you to develop <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> at some point in your life?” Interpreting numerical responses to absolute perceived susceptibility questions can be challenging (Dillard et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0035">2012</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0026">Overall, variations in the operationalization of perceived susceptibility make it difficult to summarize the direction and magnitude of association across studies. Increasing use of reliable and validated scales such as the PRF‐T2DM (Rodriguez et al.,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0066">2022</link>), can help researchers synthesize findings across studies by helping to make researchers more confident in their measurement of constructs and to guide manipulations of perceived susceptibility to, in turn, influence health‐promoting behaviors such as <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> screening or treatment. Finally, high‐quality measurement of perceived susceptibility can help enable researchers to determine whether interventions, such as lifestyle interventions to increase physical activity or change diet, are effective in changing behavior because they first influence this hypothesized intermediate variable.</para>

      <title>HBM and COVID‐19 Vaccination</title>
      <anchor id="ch0018s0001a0003"/>
      <anchor id="ch0018s0000a0021"/>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0027">With the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic in 2020, the HBM would have been a useful way for researchers to examine response to vaccination. In fact, there has been a general increase in the application of HBM constructs to various health behaviors since 2000 by researchers working in international settings. A Medline search of peer‐reviewed articles from 2001 to 2021 with “Health Belief Model” as a search term identified more than 2,000 articles with over 600 published in a language other than English, an international journal, or conducted outside the United States. In addition, several studies have found significant associations between HBM constructs and vaccination for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1210">infectious diseases</ulink> that have pandemic potential, including swine flu, H1N1, SARS, and MERS (Bish et al.,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0028">2011</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0028">To better understand the application of HBM to COVID‐19 vaccination, we conducted a systematic Medline search that identified 109 articles, published in English from January 2020 to December 2021, that applied the HBM to COVID‐19 behaviors. Here, we focus on the 29 studies that measured COVID‐19 vaccination or vaccination intentions. As described below, this approach allowed us to: (1) describe quality and completeness of measuring HBM constructs; (2) summarize patterns of association between HBM constructs and a COVID‐19 vaccine outcome (either actual behavior or vaccination intention); and (3) describe whether constructs from other health behavior theories were integrated into the multivariate models examining correlations between these constructs and vaccination.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0029">Most of the studies (21 of 29) were conducted in non‐US settings during 2020 (before <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14154">vaccines</ulink> became available to the public) and measured the five main HBM constructs: susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, and cues to action. Self‐efficacy was rarely measured (<anchor id="ch0018s0000a0022"/>
         <link linkend="ch0018s0000a0025">Table 5.1</link>). Studies found strong, consistent support for perceived benefits being positively associated and perceived barriers negatively associated with vaccination intentions. For perceived susceptibility, severity, and cues to action, findings were mixed; some showed statistically significant positive associations and others found no association (<link linkend="ch0018s0000a0025">Table 5.1</link>). Measurement of cues to action varied greatly across studies. Some only defined cues as recommendations from healthcare providers, the government, and family/friends, whereas others acknowledged that reminders in one’s environment could include personal or family experiences of COVID‐19 disease and exposure to information via various media channels or public education campaigns. Such variability in operational definitions for HBM constructs continues to weaken our ability to draw conclusions of what might be driving differences in findings.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0030">A few of these recent studies employing the HBM found that susceptibility and severity may conceptually combine to denote an individual’s perceived threat, but only one study (Zampetakis &amp; Melas,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0094">2021</link>) sought to test this through a factorial survey experiment; this approach highlighted interactions between HBM constructs, associating an interaction between high perceived susceptibility and severity with positive intentions to be vaccinated. The lack of significant main effects more generally may suggest that susceptibility and severity are more distal predictors of vaccination acceptance (Brewer et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0029">2017</link>; Carpenter, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0030">2010</link>). Almost all the studies in our narrative review were cross‐sectional, which precludes discussion of how health beliefs, vaccination intentions, and vaccination behaviors evolved as information and misinformation about COVID‐19 and the <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14154">vaccines</ulink> were disseminated. Longitudinal studies and experiments are critical to better understand mechanisms of influence among the HBM constructs, intention, and actual behavior.</para>

         </link> Review of the full text from the 29 articles revealed reasons to exclude: two studies used nontraditional measures of HBM constructs (Kalam et al. <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0047">2021</link>; Mercadante &amp; Law, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0059">2021</link>), two studies did not quantitatively examine associations between HBM constructs and the target health behavior: vaccination or vaccination intention (Marquez et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0057">2021</link>; Williams et al. <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0089">2021</link>), one study analyzed qualitative interviews (Walker et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0085">2021</link>), and one study had difficult‐to‐interpret multivariate models (Cerda &amp; Garcia, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0032">2021</link>). As a result of these exclusions, the table summarizes patterns of associations for measured HBM constructs for the remaining 23 studies.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0032" role="table-footnote">Some studies included each survey item measuring the particular HBM construct in the multivariate model instead of an aggregate scale score. Thus, it was possible for a construct to have a positive, negative, and no association when looking across the set of survey items.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0033">Twelve studies integrated constructs from another theory along with the HBM, with Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB,<ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 6</ulink>) being the predominant addition. Studies that examined both HBM and TPB constructs did not address the conceptual overlap between perceived benefits and barriers and attitude towards the behavior, nor did they consider overlap of cues to action and subjective norms. More rigorous conceptualization and competitive testing of these two theories may be helpful in understanding their unique or overlapping contributions to understanding behavior. In addition, future work might include studies, not considered in our review, that examined HBM constructs, such as perceived susceptibility, but did not specify that this construct came from the HBM (Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0083">2021</link>).</para>
