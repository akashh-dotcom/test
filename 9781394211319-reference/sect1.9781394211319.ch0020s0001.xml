   <para id="ch0020s0000p0011">The TTM is, by definition, an integrative theoretical framework that encompasses many other models and theories by differentially promoting the use of a wide range of behavior change techniques and intervention strategies based on an individual participant’s readiness to change. It is built on the premise that, depending upon where an individual is in their readiness to change behavior, different communication and behavior change techniques are effective or ineffective. By helping people move through the readiness to change continuum, their chances of taking successful action are improved. Therefore, the goal of any intervention or communication is to move someone at least one stage of change forward and then adjust the technique being used appropriately. The TTM provides the “map” of what processes and principles of behavior change, including those highlighted in other theories, should be used at each point in time of the behavior change journey.</para>

      <title>Stages of Change</title>
      <anchor id="ch0020s0001a0002"/>
      <anchor id="ch0020s0000a0011"/>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0012">Stage of change is an index of a person’s readiness to act on a particular behavior that describes readiness to change as a continuum that includes five stages: (1) Precontemplation stage—not ready; (2) Contemplation—thinking about it; (3) Preparation—getting ready; (4) Action—taken recent action; and (5) Maintenance—taken action that began more than six months ago. It also offers guidelines around when a person intends to act. Because of the strong evidence base, stage of change also can be used to predict who will change successfully. For example, if we tell a smoker to quit smoking when they are not ready to quit, they are unlikely to succeed. In that case, we have ignored the person’s stage of change and only provided them with a one‐size‐fits‐all direction. The same applies to other behaviors.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0013">Stages of change are dynamic and change over time. People will progress, and they will <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5159">relapse</ulink>—it is all part of the process. However, because we can measure it, we can tailor communications and interventions to match an individual’s stage. Also, movement through the stages is not a linear process. Individuals do not always complete one stage of change before moving to the next stage. Knowing an individual’s stage of change provides the central organizing construct to apply the rest of the constructs within TTM to communications.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0014">Once we know an individual’s stage of change for a particular behavior, we can begin to shape communications and interventions accordingly and meet the person where they are. Stage of change describes where an individual is for a specific behavior. In fact, they are probably in different stages for different behaviors. For example, a person may be ready to act on eating healthy but have no intention to start exercising.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0015">Note the phrase “ready to take action” or act, rather than “ready to change.” It is another important distinction. Change happens across<emphasis>all</emphasis> stages. Taking action is when a person reaches the point when they go from engaging in the negative behavior, such as smoking, to no longer engaging in the behavior. Or, when they begin engaging in a healthy behavior at an established criterion, such as eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. The first step in determining the stage of change for a behavior is to define what the criterion is for taking action. In the example of smoking, this means the day an individual quits.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0016">
         <emphasis>Precontemplation</emphasis> is the stage in which an individual has no intention to act on the specific behavior in the future. The person may be uninformed, underinformed, unwilling, or too discouraged to take action to change that specific behavior. They underestimate the pros of changing and overestimate the cons. Although they may wish to change, they are not intending to do so in the foreseeable future. Someone in Precontemplation can be resistant to recognizing or modifying the behavior and may minimize the underlying associated negative behavior. These individuals may be demoralized and defensive concerning the behavior, especially when they are pressured to act. They are least likely to believe that they can change and expect little support for their efforts. This may be due to being unsuccessful in previous efforts to change and/or previous experience with traditional health programs not being well matched to their needs. However, by using appropriate processes and principles of change in communications and interventions, they can engage in the behavior change process. The goal is to help these individuals move at least one stage forward, and not simply to take action.</para>

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0017">An individual in the<emphasis>Contemplation</emphasis> stage for a behavior is thinking about taking action but not in the near future, typically within the next six months. They perceive almost equal pros and cons about the behavior and are ambivalent about acting. Ambivalence can keep them in this stage for years. While they are more likely to acknowledge that they should change and less resistant than when in Precontemplation, they are not ready for traditional action‐oriented programs that expect participants to take immediate action. If someone in contemplation of a behavior is pushed into such programs, they are unlikely to succeed.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0018">In the<emphasis>Preparation</emphasis> stage, an individual intends to act soon, usually measured as within the next month. Typically, they have taken some steps toward positive behavior in the past year. They have a plan of action and may have set a date for it, for example, they may have signed up for a program or made an appointment. These individuals will welcome assistance and guidance and are those for whom traditional health promotion and public health programs were designed.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0019">People in the<emphasis>Action</emphasis> stage have made specific overt modifications to their behaviors within the past six months. Taking action is when a person reaches the point when they go from engaging in the negative behavior, such as smoking or drug use, to no longer engaging in the behavior, or when they begin engaging in a behavior at an established criterion for a healthful behavior, such as eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day or meeting the national recommendations for physical activity. Individuals in action for a behavior may experience strong urges to slip back into old behavior patterns during times of distress or when they encounter obstacles to a positive behavior change. <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5159">Relapse</ulink> to an earlier stage is common, especially among those who have unrealistic goals or who were not adequately prepared.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0020">Individuals in the<emphasis>Maintenance</emphasis> stage for a behavior took action more than six months ago. These individuals experience fewer temptations to slip back into old behaviors, and they are more confident than when they were in the Action stage. However, they are still <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10304">at risk</ulink> for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5159">relapse</ulink> during times of distress. Maintenance is a dynamic. not static, stage. For many people, staying in maintenance can be a lifelong challenge, especially for addictive behaviors.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0021">While stage of change is a central organizing construct and perhaps the most well‐known part of the TTM, the full TTM includes three other key constructs which are outlined below. Stage of change is a construct, not a theory. A theory requires systematic relationships between a set of constructs, and a <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Formal">formal</ulink> theory ideally specifies these as mathematical relationships.</para>

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0022">Additional TTM constructs that are considered central to change include: (1) decisional balance—the pros and cons of changing (Janis &amp; Mann,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0046">1977</link>); (2) self‐efficacy—confidence to make and sustain the change in difficult situations (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0008">1977</link>); and (3) processes of change—10 cognitive, affective, and behavioral activities that facilitate progress through the stages (DiClemente &amp; Prochaska, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0018">1982</link>; Prochaska, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0075">1984</link>). More than 40 years of research on the TTM have identified particular principles and strategies that work best in each stage to facilitate progress towards eventual action and maintenance—for example, that the pros of changing go up, and the cons go down as people progress through the stages (Hall &amp; Rossi, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0036">2008</link>); self‐efficacy increases in the later stages (Henry et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0039">2006</link>; Hoving, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0043">2006</link>; Prochaska, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0078">2013</link>); people in the early stages rely more on cognitive and affective processes of change; and people in the later stages rely more on behavioral processes (Henry et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0039">2006</link>; Prochaska &amp; Norcross, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0081">2001</link>).</para>

         <emphasis>Decisional balance</emphasis> reflects an individual’s weighing of the pros and cons of changing. Initially, the TTM relied on the Janis and Mann (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0046">1977</link>) model of decision‐making that included four categories of pros (instrumental gains for self and others and approval from self and others) and four categories of cons (instrumental costs to self and others and disapproval from self and others). Over many studies, a simpler two‐factor structure was developed: pros and cons of changing.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0024">
         <emphasis>Self‐efficacy</emphasis> is the situation‐specific confidence to take and sustain action and to overcome the temptation to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5159">relapse</ulink>. This construct was integrated into the TTM from Bandura's (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0008">1977</link>) Social Cognitive Theory (see <ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>). As mentioned previously, the <emphasis>processes of change</emphasis> originally were derived from leading theories of psychotherapy and counseling (Prochaska &amp; Norcross, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0080">1979</link>). <anchor id="ch0020s0000a0014"/>
