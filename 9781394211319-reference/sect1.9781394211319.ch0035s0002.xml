   <para id="ch0035s0000p0031">LISTEN UP (Locally Integrated Screening and Testing Ear aNd aUral Program) is an example of applying the PRECEDE‐PROCEED model to develop and pilot test a pharmacy‐based ear health service in two remote, rural communities in Australia. Details of the development process and results from a feasibility trial are reported elsewhere (Taylor et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0082">2021</link>, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0083">2022</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0035s0000p0032">The planning group used findings from a systematic review, an exploratory or scoping review, stakeholder surveys and interviews, and consultation with governing bodies and regulatory authorities, to inform needs assessment, intervention development, and implementation planning (Taylor et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0082">2021</link>). An advisory group, including governing bodies, regulatory authorities, and community organization representatives reviewed these data and provided ongoing consultation to ensure the LISTEN UP model fit the pharmacy and community.</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0033">In Australia, one in six people experiences some form of hearing impairment, and 1.3 million people report preventable <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9377">hearing loss</ulink> (Australian Government Department of Health,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0037">2022</link>). Conductive <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9378">hearing loss</ulink> in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is a major public health problem, with rates as high as 90% in some remote communities (Macquarie University, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0067">2022</link>). In rural and remote areas, limited access to trained health professionals is a major barrier to universal ear health care. Findings from social and epidemiological assessments have shown that community pharmacists are well‐positioned to provide expanded ear health services as they are often the only permanent health professional in these settings. Rural consumers, pharmacists, and health professionals ranked hearing tests as an important component of expanded pharmacy services and one that could be improved with adequate training and resources. The planning team set primary objectives for the six‐month ear health feasibility study to improve rural consumer access to ear health care and determine pharmacists’ level of preparedness and confidence to perform ear exams and make appropriate recommendations or referrals (Taylor et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0082">2021</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0034">Key behaviors of rural consumers included attending community pharmacies for ear complaints due to lengthy delays in obtaining doctors’ appointments. Interviews with pharmacists indicated frequent provision of informal ear care services, including <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> management options and referral recommendations, in some cases using <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10104">otoscopy</ulink> to examine patients’ ears. Barriers included lack of time, space, and remuneration. Pharmacists also reported difficulty accessing health professionals, lack of permanent healthcare providers, and frequent staff turnover. Based on a literature review, survey, and interview findings, the planning group determined the following secondary objectives of the ear health strategy: (1) identify untreated ear conditions in rural communities; (2) improve collaboration between community pharmacy and general practitioner (GP) services; (3) provide targeted patient ear‐health referrals to GP practice, and (4) support engagement of telehealth through the use of video‐<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10104">otoscopy</ulink> and timely transfer of care (Taylor et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0082">2021</link>).</para>

Consumer outcome expectations when presenting to community pharmacies with an ear complaint were either a product recommendation or referral to a GP or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> department. Enabling factors included pharmacists’ willingness to develop expanded practice models and their professional skills in ear‐health care, and health providers’ expectations that expanded pharmacy practice would improve healthcare for people living in rural and remote communities. Reinforcing factors included pharmacists’ ability to retain equipment after completion of the feasibility study (Taylor et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0082">2021</link>, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0083">2022</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0036">The planning group consulted with two community pharmacists to assess the capacity of rural pharmacies to implement the intervention. Both pharmacies reported adequate personnel, time, and space for the project. The primary capital expense was purchasing equipment.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0037">The primary intervention was to train pharmacists in ear‐health care. Ear, nose, and throat specialists were consulted on the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10104">otoscopy</ulink> and tympanometry skills required for pharmacists to effectively conduct ear examinations. The planning group collaborated with a nationally credentialed training organization to develop 55 hours of online training and 16 hours of face‐to‐face workshops. Training included foundations of ear health, anatomy and physiology, theoretical and practical sessions on ear condition recognition and assessment, and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10104">otoscopy</ulink> and tympanometry skill development. An advisory panel consisting of medical experts and policy makers confirmed that the training and expanded service model were appropriate, acceptable, and well‐aligned with the current rural pharmacy landscape; and compliant with policy, regulation, and legal requirements (Taylor et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0082">2021</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0038">The planning group then developed the LISTEN UP protocol with an integrated direct referral pathway to local GP providers. Using the protocol, trained pharmacists provided <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10104">otoscopy</ulink> and tympanometry assessments on consumers presenting to the community pharmacy with ear complaints, and made recommendations including no treatment, pharmacy only products, or GP referral.</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0039">In the PROCEED segment of the model, the planning group addressed implementation, process, and outcome evaluation and conducted a six‐month feasibility trial February–July 2021. Two community pharmacies located in remote rural communities and a GP (<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10343">primary care</ulink>) practice in each community participated. Pharmacists collected data on ear complaints (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 23) for eight weeks prior to the intervention period. To assess the feasibility and potential impact of the intervention, the planning group used a pre‐intervention comparison group (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 55). During this time, 23 ear complaints were presented to the pharmacy.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0040">Extensive qualitative data were collected to assess consumer, pharmacist, and GP satisfaction. Competing priorities related to COVID‐19 vaccinations limited pharmacists’ time for ear health. Further, because the intervention was not remunerated, other competing, funded services were a higher priority. Despite implementation challenges, 90% (50/55) of consumers were highly satisfied with the service and said they would recommend it, citing convenience, improved confidence and appreciation of the knowledge gained about their ear complaint. Pharmacists were motivated to upskill and manage workflow to incorporate the service and expected both consumers and GPs to be more accepting of future expanded services as a result of LISTEN UP (Taylor et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0083">2022</link>). Overall, PRECEDE‐PROCEED provided a comprehensive model to guide the design and implementation of an acceptable and accessible ear health service for rural and remote communities in Australia. However, sustainability will require ongoing funding to provide resources including additional pharmacists, equipment, and training.</para>
