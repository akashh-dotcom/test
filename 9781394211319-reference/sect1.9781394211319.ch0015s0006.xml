   <para id="ch0015s0000p0052">Ecological models provide a framework for understanding the totality of influence of health behaviors, and how people interact with their broader contexts. Ecological models emphasize the influence that levels beyond the individual can exert on health behaviors, including the interpersonal, societal or community, policy, and planetary levels. Further, ecological models posit that factors at these levels interact with each other when influencing health behaviors. A key advantage of ecological models is their flexibility, allowing for tailoring the ecological framework to any health behavior and/or setting or population group of interest. Additionally, behavior change theories can be integrated or embedded within an ecological framework and used to design multilevel interventions. Ecological models are also useful for designing and implementing observational and evaluation studies, as they can help investigators identify which factors must be measured across multiple levels. Although there are logistical challenges for implementing multilevel behavior change interventions, this chapter included examples of successful multilevel interventions and of creative solutions for overcoming these challenges, including natural experiments. When informed by high‐quality empirical studies, complex systems models—which use sophisticated simulation‐based techniques to test the effects that major societal, policy, and environmental changes could have on human and planetary health outcomes—provide a novel approach for examining the potential impacts of multilevel interventions. Furthermore, regardless of the availability of empirical evidence demonstrating the utility of ecological models, their face validity is excellent, and their premise is simple: if we create environments that are conducive to healthy choices, entire populations, and perhaps even our planet, will benefit. Also, the effectiveness and long‐term maintenance of behavioral interventions targeting more proximal levels to individuals could be optimized.</para>
