      <title>Application 1: COVID‐19 Vaccine Uptake in the United States in 2021</title>

      <para id="ch0032s0000p0037">After all the early COVID‐related health and political communication issues in 2020, as described at the beginning of this chapter, the first coronavirus vaccine for people 16 years of age and older became available on December 11, 2020 under an <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. The vaccine was first available only to healthcare professionals and other groups deemed essential, and subsequently to groups defined by characteristics such as age and risk, following guidance from the CDC (Dooling et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0021">2021</link>). By April 19, 2021, once there was sufficient vaccine supply, all adults across all states became eligible.</para>
      <para id="ch0032s0000p0038">Survey evidence almost immediately demonstrated significant differences between different groups in COVID‐19 vaccine uptake, which can be explained by several of the communication theories described above. First, national surveys, such as the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) COVID‐19 Vaccine Monitor, continually demonstrated that Republicans expressed more concerns about the vaccine and lower intentions to get vaccinated; ultimately, far fewer Republicans (54%) than Democrats (86%) reported receiving at least one dose of the vaccine by July 2021 (Kirzinger et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0044">2021</link>). These significant nationwide political patterns were increasingly evident even at the community level as well (Kates et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0042">2022</link>). Since then, many studies have sought to understand these links between political partisanship, ideology, and coronavirus vaccination behavior—and the role of communication in producing the observed polarization in vaccine beliefs (e.g., Gadarian et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0028">2022</link>; Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0077">2021</link>). For instance, one study tested the effects of various media frames (issue frames) about COVID‐19 <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14154">vaccines</ulink> and found that a message that emphasized social norms (describing others’ willingness to get the vaccine) increased vaccine intentions, whereas a message that aimed to politicize the vaccine (emphasizing President Trump’s pressure on the FDA to approve a vaccine quickly) reduced vaccine intentions; the authors observed no moderation by partisanship (Palm et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0065">2021</link>). Another study tested the effects of explicit partisan cues versus scientific cues in messaging about <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14154">vaccines</ulink> (Golos et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0034">2022</link>); the concept of motivated reasoning would suggest that the partisan cues should produce politically polarized responses. In fact, the authors observed a wide gap in vaccine intentions by respondents’ partisanship, with the scientific cue particularly effective at increasing vaccine intentions, especially among Democrats (Golos et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0034">2022</link>). These findings illuminate the importance of information processing theories, showing that partisanship is a significant predisposition that can shape responses to health messaging.</para>

      <para id="ch0032s0000p0039">Another major difference that emerged early in vaccine‐related survey data involved concerns about <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14154">vaccines</ulink> expressed by people of color. For instance, in February 2021, 34% of Black adults said they would “wait and see” about the vaccine, compared to only 18% of White adults who expressed this hesitant perspective (Hamel et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0038">2021</link>). These differences are likely related to historical and contemporary distrust of the healthcare system and the structural racism that these systems reinforce (Momplaisir et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0056">2021</link>). Later that year, differences in reported intentions translated into racial differences in vaccine uptake. By July 2021, 70% of White adults had received at least one dose, compared to 65% of Black adults and 61% of Hispanic adults. Although the vaccine was available for free and there was abundant media attention to <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14154">vaccines</ulink>, in both news media and campaign PSAs, a communication inequality perspective helps understand in part why these disparities emerged (see, e.g., Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0080">2020</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0032s0000p0040">Communication inequalities point to the importance of group differences in the ability to act on information (such as availability of free <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14154">vaccines</ulink>), which includes the ability to take time off from work to get the vaccine or recover from side effects, as well as to access vaccine sites (by locating these close to where communities of color live and work). They also point to relevant structural factors at play, including a lack of prioritization and outreach in geographic areas with social vulnerability, and the use of age‐based allocation schemes that tended to promote earlier vaccination among older White adults (Hughes et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0041">2021</link>; Wrigley‐Field et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0084">2021</link>).</para>

      <title>Application 2: Tobacco Imagery in Popular Entertainment Media in India</title>
      <anchor id="ch0032s0002a0003"/>
      <anchor id="ch0032s0000a0032"/>
      <para id="ch0032s0000p0041">For more than two decades, researchers have studied whether exposure to portrayals of tobacco use in entertainment media, particularly movies, influences tobacco uptake among youth. This work has arguably produced one of the most robust literatures documenting the influence of media on health. In its 2008 monograph on media and tobacco use, the US National <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">Cancer</ulink> Institute drew a bold conclusion: “The total weight of the evidence from cross‐sectional, longitudinal, and experimental studies, combined with the high theoretical plausibility from the perspective of social influences [sic], indicates a causal relationship between exposure to movie smoking depictions and youth smoking initiation” (Davis et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0016">2008</link>, p. 19). This finding was later echoed by the US Surgeon General’s report (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0072">2012</link>) on preventing tobacco use among youth and young adults.</para>
      <para id="ch0032s0000p0042">Research on tobacco imagery in entertainment media has been conducted both in and outside the United States, and it has been especially important as the tobacco epidemic has shifted from developed to developing countries. One country that has confronted the challenge of such portrayals is India, with its thriving Bollywood movie industry and prevalent tobacco use (nearly 267 million <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Indian Tobacco">Indian tobacco</ulink> users aged 15+, as of 2016–2017; <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10051">WHO</ulink>,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0083">2022</link>). Early observational research showed findings similar to those observed in the United States and elsewhere. Compared with low‐exposure adolescents, adolescents with high exposure to tobacco use in popular Bollywood movies were significantly more likely to report ever using tobacco, adjusting for potential covariates (Arora et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0005">2012</link>). Given the popularity of Bollywood movie stars, the authors argued that actors’ behavior in films could influence youth. This argument is consistent with two underlying theoretical explanations offered in previous research (Davis et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0016">2008</link>): (1) positive portrayals of tobacco use, or a risk behavior shown in the absence of negative consequences, could be persuasive from a modeling perspective (as described in Social Cognitive Theory; see <ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>); and (2) frequent tobacco portrayals could <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to the perception that tobacco use is prevalent (as suggested by theories of descriptive normative influence).</para>
      <para id="ch0032s0000p0043">More recent longitudinal research among Indian youth did not find evidence of lagged, or subsequent, associations with smoking uptake (Kulkarni et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0046">2021</link>), and researchers suggested that this could be due to the presence of on‐screen health warnings. Due at least in part to communication research evidence, the 2003 <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Indian Tobacco">Indian tobacco</ulink>‐free film rules (which were updated in 2012) indicated that any film with tobacco imagery must include a 20‐second audiovisual health warning in the beginning and middle of the film, as well as visual health warnings displayed on screen while tobacco products or use appear. Unfortunately, content analytic research suggests that such warnings are not strictly enforced, and tobacco imagery remains prevalent in films in India (Kulkarni et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0047">2020</link>). Research should continue to monitor and evaluate whether any reductions in tobacco imagery contribute to decreased tobacco use among youth. Implementation challenges notwithstanding, the fact that Indian law requires strategic health messaging in the face of movie smoking portrayals provides a compelling illustration of how planned and unplanned applications of communication for health often compete for audience attention (see <link linkend="ch0032s0000a0011">Figure 17.1</link>).</para>
