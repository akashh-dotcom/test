   <title>Paradigms for Theory and Research in Health Behavior</title>

   <para id="ch0014s0000p0019">A paradigm is a basic schema that organizes our broadly based view of something (Babbie,<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0039">1989</link>). Paradigms are widely recognized scientific achievements that, for a time, provide model problem‐solving approaches to a community of practitioners and scientists. They include theory, application, and instrumentation, and comprise models that represent coherent traditions of scientific research (Kuhn, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0072">1962</link>). Paradigms gain status because they are more successful than their competitors at solving pressing problems (Kuhn, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0072">1962</link>) but they also can impede scientific progress by protecting inconsistent findings until a crisis point is reached; these crisis points <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to scientific revolutions.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0020">Paradigms create boundaries within which the search for answers occurs. They do not answer specific questions, but they direct the search for answers (Babbie,<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0039">1989</link>). Paradigms circumscribe or delimit what is important to examine in a given field of inquiry. The collective judgments of scientists define the dominant paradigm that constitutes the body of science (Wilson, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0103">1952</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0021">In the science of health behavior (and in this text), the dominant paradigm that supports the largest body of theory and research is that of<emphasis>logical positivism</emphasis> or <emphasis>logical empiricism</emphasis>. This basic view, developed in the Vienna Circle from 1924 to 1936, has two central features: (1) an emphasis on the use of induction, or sensory experience, feelings, and personal judgments as the source of knowledge; and (2) the view that deduction is the standard for verification or confirmation of theory so that theory must be tested through empirical methods and systematic observation of phenomena (Runes, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0088">1984</link>). Logical empiricism reconciles the deductive and inductive extremes; it prescribes that researchers begin inquiries with a hypothesis deduced from a theory and then test it, subjecting it to the jeopardy of disconfirmation through empirical tests (McGuire, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0075">1983</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0022">An alternative worldview that is also important in health behavior relies more heavily on induction and is often identified as a predominantly constructivist paradigm. This perspective argues that the organization and explanation of events should be revealed through a process of discovery rather than organized into prescribed conceptual categories before a study begins. In this paradigm, data collection methods, such as standardized questionnaires and predetermined response categories, have a limited place. Ethnography, phenomenology, and grounded theory are examples of approaches using a constructivist paradigm (Kendler,<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0069">2005</link>; Strauss, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0095">1987</link>). It has become increasingly common in the field for work to originate within a constructivist paradigm and shift toward a focus on answering specific research questions using methodologies from the logical positivist paradigm. The use of mixed methods that include both qualitative and quantitative measures has gained traction in health behavior, psychological research, and other social sciences (Cacioppo et al., <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0043">2004</link>; Creswell, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0047">2013</link>). However, without quantitative data, a theory is unlikely to be widely accepted because it will lack sufficient data for verification.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0023">Ultimately, those who study and practice in fields that involve health behavior generally are concerned with approaches to solving social problems, and, in many cases, addressing some of the most significant threats and problems facing the world today. They are grappling with fundamental challenges of behavior change in the health and social domains. Considerable scholarly and practitioner efforts have been devoted to developing techniques that change behavior. Although these grew out of a desire to produce a better world, techniques that “push” people to change were experienced by many as manipulative, reducing freedom of choice, and sustaining a balance of power in favor of the “change agent” (Kipnis,<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0071">1994</link>). A paradigm shift occurred, and many techniques for promoting individual behavior change (for example, social support, empowerment, personal growth) shifted focus to <emphasis>reducing obstacles to change</emphasis> and promoting informed decision making, rather than pushing people to change. This is also consistent with global efforts to empower people in low‐ or middle‐income countries (LMICs), among other areas, to change rather than direct change. Another example of this shift is the growing prominence of community engagement and community‐based participatory research in public health sciences (<ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink>).</para>

   <para id="ch0014s0000p0024">New paradigms for understanding, studying, and applying knowledge about human behavior continue to arise and may be influential in the future of health behavior research and practice. More than 20 years ago, the Institute of Medicine’s Committee on Capitalizing on Social Science and Behavioral Research to Improve the Public’s Health recommended that “interventions on social and behavioral factors should link multiple levels of influence” rather than focusing on a single or limited number of health determinants (Smedley &amp; Syme,<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0094">2000</link>, p. 7). Today, this recommendation is echoed as health educators and social scientists struggle with some of the most challenging health behavior issues, such as climate change, communicable diseases, tobacco control, and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink> prevention, at a time when ecological models begin to be more clearly articulated and studied (<ulink url="ch0015">Chapter 3</ulink>).</para>
