   <para id="ch0028s0000p0001">An understanding of the functioning of groups, organizations, large social institutions, and communities and how they interact with each other is vital to health enhancement. Designing health behavior and policy, systems and environmental (PSE) change initiatives to benefit communities and populations is at the heart of a public health orientation (Bunnell et al.,<link linkend="ch0028s0000li0001">2012</link>; Glanz &amp; Bishop, <link linkend="ch0028s0000li0002">2010</link>; US Department of Health and Human Services, <link linkend="ch0028s0000li0008">2016</link>). The collective well‐being of communities can be fostered by creating, modifying, or dismantling structures and policies that support or deter healthy lifestyles. These strategies require an understanding of how social systems operate, how change occurs within and among communities and organizations, and how ideas and information spread, including through the Internet and social media.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0002">The chapters in Part Four present theoretically informed approaches to create and support health behavior change through groups, organizations, communities, and social systems. The aims of these chapters are: (1) to demonstrate the utility and promise of a variety of theories and frameworks in health behavior and health behavior change, and (2) to identify important ways to understand and address populations using theoretically grounded models.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0003">In<ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink>, Bailey builds the case for improving the effectiveness of health behavior theories by proactively integrating concepts of social justice, racism, and health equity. She proposes that integrating racism‐related theories and constructs with health behavior models may contribute to more antiracist public health interventions.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0004">In<ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink>, Keawe Kaholokula and colleagues provide an up‐to‐date overview of principles and methods of community engagement for health improvement, including community organization and community building, coalitions and partnerships, and community‐based participatory research (CBPR). They discuss the concept of community, and the main theoretical and conceptual bases of community engagement, processes, and models for community organization and building for health. They also discuss measurement and evaluation issues and describe a case study that illustrates how community engagement was applied in the Pasifika <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4953">Prediabetes</ulink> Youth Empowerment Program (PPYEP) in New Zealand.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0005">In<ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink>, Ramanadan and Shelton address implementation, dissemination, and diffusion of public health interventions as an approach to enhancing longer‐term impact of community and group interventions. They focus on the importance of, the conceptualization of, and strategies for, implementation and dissemination of evidence‐based interventions (EBIs) to improve health. Using two widely used models as exemplars, the Diffusion of Innovations and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), the chapter provides key terminology in a rapidly evolving area of inquiry and practice—in detail. The chapter includes applications of these models and illustrates components that cut across individual, organizational, and societal levels of context, analysis, and intervention.</para>

   <para id="ch0028s0000p0006">In<ulink url="ch0032">Chapter 17</ulink>, Gollust and Nagler focus on communication and health behavior in a rapidly changing media environment. In addition to describing longstanding theories, their chapter characterizes emerging issues related to how people receive and use public information and its implications for health communication and health behavior. They illustrate these concepts and issues with two applications: Partisan views regarding COVID‐19 <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14154">vaccines</ulink>, including the news media’s potential to widen health disparities, and the use of tobacco imagery in popular entertainment in India to illustrate the competition that exists for audience attention while considering planned and unplanned approaches to communication for health.</para>
