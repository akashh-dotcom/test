   <para id="ch0017s0000p0022">The rise of theories in this section over more than 50 years, and their integration into research and practice, have advanced understanding about how to improve health behaviors. These individual‐level health behavior theories have strengths as psychological theories of what is on people’s minds that might affect their behaviors. However, no theories are panaceas for all health behavior problems or foundations for easy solutions to create behavior change. Forces external to the person, including social processes and environmental contexts, can exert powerful influences on health behavior that must also be considered (see<ulink url="ch0015">Chapter 3</ulink>). Other parts of the book address some of these forces beyond individuals.</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0023">Particular problems and contexts may require new and expanded ways of thinking that transcend individual theories. Some researchers use elements of individual‐level theories (such as risk perceptions and attitudes) and pair them with constructs from other theories (such as the experience of racism or neighborhood characteristics). Individual theories can serve as building blocks. This type of approach is encouraged through systematic planning models such as PRECEDE‐PROCEED and Intervention Mapping (<ulink url="ch0035">Chapter 19</ulink>), using multiple theories and multi‐level approaches.</para>
