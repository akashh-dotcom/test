   <para id="ch0023s0000p0054">In 2014, e‐cigarettes became the most commonly used tobacco/<ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=3261">nicotine</ulink> product among middle and high school students (~12–17 years of age) in the United States, introducing a host of known and unknown health consequences, and threatening 50 years of public health progress. In response to the rise of e‐cigarettes among youth, the CATCH research team began developing an SCT‐guided intervention, named<emphasis>CATCH My Breath</emphasis> (CMB). The CMB program has been found to significantly reduce the risk of e‐cigarette initiation from 6<superscript>th</superscript> to 7<superscript>th</superscript> grade, under a quasi‐experimental pilot testing (Kelder et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0043">2021</link>). The CMB program has been tested by others whose findings confirm that SCT constructs are relevant to e‐cigarette use during adolescence, such as outcome expectations, normative beliefs, and behavioral intentions (Bteddini et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0025">2023</link>; Moosbrugger et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0052">2023</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0023s0000p0055">The CMB program targets cognitive and social/environmental influences of behavior while building behavioral capacity and intentions to prevent the initiation and escalation of e‐cigarette use. The content and activities of CMB are designed to impact multiple SCT constructs, simultaneously. In this, the CMB program incorporates<emphasis>reciprocal determinism</emphasis>, which states that impacting one construct (knowledge, self‐efficacy) will correspond with changes to other constructs (outcome expectations. normative beliefs). An overview of these constructs, and their theorized reciprocal relationship, is provided below.</para>

         <para id="ch0023s0000p0056">CMB is comprised of four modules, each pairing educational content with active learning exercises. The modules begin with students forming small groups, followed by teachers introducing age‐appropriate information about e‐cigarettes to the groups to increase knowledge related to health and social consequences of using e‐cigarettes and other tobacco products. The four lessons of CMB aim to correct common misperceptions about e‐cigarettes reported by youth, including: (1) that e‐cigarettes do not deliver “<ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> vapor” but, instead, an aerosol consisting of several chemical (<ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14636">glycerol</ulink>, propylene <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Glycol">glycol</ulink>. flavored additives) that are combined with the addictive stimulant <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=3261">nicotine</ulink>; (2) the vast majority of kids their age (middle school) do<emphasis>not</emphasis> use e‐cigarettes or any form of tobacco; (3) the social and legal consequences of underage e‐cigarette use; and (4) the numerous ways tobacco companies market and promote e‐cigarettes to youth. The information delivered by CMB is designed to increase knowledge and health‐compromising outcomes of e‐cigarette use, which will then influence the cognitive processes that determine SCT constructs such as self‐efficacy, outcome expectations, and normative beliefs.</para>
         <para id="ch0023s0000p0057">CMB pairs the information delivered by the teacher with small group activities which provide students the opportunity to apply (thus reinforce) their knowledge of e‐cigarettes. Each group of students is given a worksheet. A volunteer peer facilitator raises questions related to e‐cigarette use, collects the groups’ thoughts and answers, and then shares them back to the larger class. The small group framework is designed to elicit culturally relevant and local language‐specific group responses. This framework also enables students to connect to the content so that lessons learned will more easily be retrieved after the program is over. In this vein, and to extend CMB program contact hours, an essential activity assignment is for students to interview their parent or caregiver with a list of questions to discuss their own experiences with smoking, negative social and physical consequences of smoking, challenges overcoming addiction, and a statement for the family rules about smoking and vaping.</para>

Consequently, CMB modules focus largely on self‐efficacy and goal setting, each a fundamental construct of SCT. Knowledge and learning exercises of CMB facilitate cognitive processes (self‐evaluation, motivation) that positively influence self‐efficacy and behavioral intentions. Students apply their knowledge of e‐cigarettes to discuss things like peer pressure (to use e‐cigarettes) as well as practice their skills to refuse peer pressure. These active learning exercises impact self‐efficacy to resist peer pressure by allowing students to gain mastery experiences of the requisite refusal skills. At the conclusion of the core CMB lessons, youth make a public commitment to abstain from using e‐cigarettes, thus clearly stating their own goals while socially reinforcing the goals of their peers, who made the same public commitment. The CMB lessons and activities are designed to provide each student with the information and skills needed to maintain their public commitment to not use e‐cigarettes or other tobacco products.</para>

This knowledge, in theory, influences the student’s perceived negative ramifications of e‐cigarette use (i.e., outcome expectations). However, the evidence does not support a unidimensional approach to addressing outcome expectations, and thus CMB modules also address and counter the perceived positive outcomes of e‐cigarette use. Students gather in small groups and discuss the possible motivations and reasons people use e‐cigarettes (such as curiosity, popularity, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=3261">nicotine</ulink> stamina boost, addiction) and then list alternatives to using e‐cigarettes.</para>

In addition, activities are designed to develop a strong intention not to experiment with or use e‐cigarettes.</para>

The students also discuss the ethics of marketing an addictive substance to children and, as a group activity, create counter‐vaping messages similar to that found in tobacco prevention media campaigns (Noar et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0055">2020</link>).</para>

The team also used Diffusion of Innovation strategies (see <ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink>) to accelerate the adoption and implementation of CMB (Kelder et al., <link linkend="ch0023s0000li0043">2021</link>).
