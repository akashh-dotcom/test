   <para id="ch0032s0000p0003">Health communication theories—and related behavioral theories—can help us make sense of, and even predict, what might result from the news coverage like that<emphasis>New York Times</emphasis> article from February 2020, described in the vignette above. This exemplar of downplaying the coronavirus by the most powerful political actor in the country demonstrated how information sources were divided about the severity of the threat (Gollust et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0033">2020</link>). Perceived susceptibility to and severity of health risk is a critical component of behavioral change theories, so this claim could signify that Republican listeners would follow Trump and view the threat as less serious, with consequences for their likelihood of taking action (see <ulink url="ch0018">Chapter 5</ulink>). It also highlights, explicitly, the way in which information about COVID‐19 had become politicized—that is, discourse about the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9711">virus</ulink> had become entangled with political cues. The election year context magnified the potential for information about COVID‐19 to become attached to partisan identities. The effects of this discourse rife with partisan cues rather than paying attention to scientific experts increased the likelihood that audiences would incorporate their own political predispositions into their understanding of the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9711">virus</ulink>. This led to dramatic differences by party affiliation in the public’s attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding risk mitigation (Gadarian et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0028">2022</link>).</para>

   <para id="ch0032s0000p0004">This early media portrayal of COVID‐19 also illuminates other features of the public information environment that shape the public’s response to health information. First, in 2020, there were a multitude of opportunities to learn about COVID‐19. No longer did audiences attune mainly to network nightly news or print news for information. By 2020, Americans could get their news from national news outlets, cable news, social media, radio, and a proliferation of other news sites and apps, often, those catering to audiences with particular worldviews (Gottfried &amp; Liedke,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0035">2021</link>). Many local newspapers had closed by 2020, and resources for reporters dedicated to health had shrunk. As a result, the public increasingly relied on health news coverage not by science or medical writers but by reporters from other “beats,” such as politics. With traditional, trusted news media no longer a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10463">gatekeeper</ulink>, people also got their COVID‐19 information from interpersonal sources (e.g., friends, family) and advertisements (such as public service announcements—PSAs—and political ads in the 2020 election), contributing to competing information about the viral threat and what to do about it.</para>
   <para id="ch0032s0000p0005">As scientists learned more about the novel coronavirus, information changed from week to week—and, accordingly, health recommendations evolved, often quite rapidly. Audiences noticed this apparent inconsistency, among politicians and medical experts, with, for instance, differing recommendations emanating from spokespeople at the White House (i.e., Anthony Fauci), the CDC, and state health departments (Nagler et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0058">2020</link>). This communication happened within a context of dynamic changes in trust in science and in media (Kennedy et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0043">2022</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0032s0000p0006">Also, evidence of racial and socioeconomic disparities in COVID‐19 incidence and mortality—as a result of differential exposure to the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9711">virus</ulink> and vulnerability to its consequences because of structural factors—emerged relatively early in the pandemic (Viswanath et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0080">2020</link>). This information, combined with renewed attention to racial justice in the summer of 2020 after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, brought more attention to health inequities in the information environment (Xu et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0085">2022</link>), although public understanding of these inequities was far from uniform (Gollust et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0032">2022</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0032s0000p0007">Finally, this combination of fragmented information outlets, a politically charged environment, and dynamic changes in trust in science and media created a communication environment where misinformation and disinformation could spread quickly (van der <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Linden">Linden</ulink>,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0076">2022</link>; Vraga &amp; Jacobsen, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0082">2020</link>). One cross‐sectional study of a nationally representative sample in 2020 found that endorsement of COVID‐19 misinformation was quite common (with 47% of the sample scoring high on misinformation) and that those who relied on conservative sources of news had a higher likelihood of reporting misinformation (Dhawan et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0018">2021</link>). The same study showed that those scoring high on misinformation were also less likely to report confidence, or self‐efficacy in their ability to perform COVID‐19 prevention strategies like social distancing, using face masks, and handwashing (Dhawan et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0018">2021</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0032s0000p0008">Each of these dimensions of the information environment at the emergence of COVID‐19 in 2020 speaks to the objective of this chapter: to describe communication theories that explain how the public information environment shapes the public’s attitudes, beliefs, and, ultimately, their health‐related behaviors. Communication theories, combined with an understanding of the trends in media environments outlined above, can offer important predictions for researchers, professional communicators, and public health practitioners on how communication can shape health behaviors, as well as how best to intervene.</para>
