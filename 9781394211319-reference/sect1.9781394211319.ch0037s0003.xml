   <title>The Role of Social Marketing Within a Strategic Communication Framework</title>
   <anchor id="ch0037s0003a0001"/>
   <anchor id="ch0037s0000a0011"/>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0015">In all societies, social marketing communication occurs within three principal domains: the social‐political environment, health‐service delivery systems, and among individuals within communities and households (Pollock &amp; Storey,<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0111">2012</link>; Storey et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0117">2005</link>; USAID, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0122">2001</link>). Communication within each of these domains combines to change audiences and institutions over time, making the environment more supportive of healthy practices, improving the performance of health services, and increasing the likelihood of preventive or protective health practices. To the extent that these changes are durable, improved health outcomes can be sustained. (For more discussion of multi‐level thinking about health education and health behavior, see <ulink url="ch0015">Chapter 3</ulink>).</para>
   <para>Within this larger framework, three approaches can be selected depending on needs and resources:<emphasis>product‐driven</emphasis> approaches, <emphasis>consumer‐ or demand‐driven</emphasis> approaches, and <emphasis>market‐driven</emphasis> approaches.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0016">
      <emphasis>Product‐driven approaches</emphasis>: Product‐driven approaches aim to increase the appeal of a product and differentiate it positively from alternatives. <emphasis>Branding</emphasis>, for example, identifies a product category and associates it with desirable attributes: <emphasis>Under Armour</emphasis> athletic gear, <emphasis>Apple</emphasis> iPhones, the <emphasis>Google</emphasis> search engine. Non‐commercial “products” have brand identities, too: the <emphasis>World Wildlife Federation</emphasis> for environmental issues, <emphasis>Amnesty International</emphasis> for social justice issues, and the <emphasis>truth FinishIt</emphasis> brand (Evans et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0092">2018</link>) for tobacco cessation are examples of popular, internationally recognized brands of social activism. Branded products are then associated with a consistent bundle of promised benefits or ideas (such as quality, creativity, societal impact, truth). Consumers come to expect those attributes and return to or support those products again and again in anticipation of predictable outcomes.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0017" role="listPara1">A classic example of social marketing is Indonesia’s highly successful national FP program, which in 1988 introduced the Blue Circle (<emphasis>Lingkaran Biru</emphasis>) as the brand image for products and services provided by urban, private sector doctors and midwives, then expanded it to cover a national range of products and services available everywhere (Mize &amp; Robey, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0107">2006</link>; Piotrow et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0110">1997</link>). Eventually, the Blue Circle logo appeared in many forms: with the letters KB (<emphasis>Keluarga Berencana</emphasis> or FP); as signs indicating hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and other facilities where contraceptives and services were available; on contraceptive product packaging; on posters, billboards, and televised PSAs promoting providers who offered value‐added Blue Circle services; on car wheel covers; and as decoration on village gates to indicate the community’s support for families choosing to practice FP. Even old automobile tires were painted blue and mounted on fence posts lining country roads. Almost non‐stop national and local campaigns over more than 20 years, many of them featuring the Blue Circle, contributed to a rapid increase in contraceptive use from 23% of married women in 1977 to 58% in 2012 and a drop in the total fertility rate (TFR) from 5.6 to 2.6 average number of births in a woman’s lifetime during the same period (BPS &amp; ICF International, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0087">2013</link>). By the late 1990s, FP and small family size had become so engrained that even the economic crisis and political instability that Indonesia and much of Asia suffered from 1998 to 2002 had little effect on contraceptive use rates, even though commodities became more expensive and harder to obtain (Frankenberg et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0094">2003</link>; Storey &amp; Schoemaker, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0116">2006</link>). It is important to note that social marketing’s role was complemented and reinforced by other societal changes.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0018">
      <emphasis>Consumer‐driven approaches</emphasis>: Consumer‐driven approaches aim at building demand for the product so that maintaining behavioral momentum shifts from the marketing organization to consumers. The Indonesian Blue Circle program illustrates this principle: during the economic crisis, markets responded to sustained demand for contraception, and people sought new sources of contraceptive supplies to continue protecting themselves from unwanted pregnancy. One strategy for achieving and sustaining consumer demand is to target social norms (Burchell et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0089">2013</link>). This approach is based on the theory that much behavior is influenced by perceptions about what is “typical” or socially acceptable and the perceived sanctions or rewards that result from deviating from or complying with those norms (Cislaghi &amp; Heise, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0091">2018</link>; Yanovitsky &amp; Rimal, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0127">2006</link>). Evoking thoughts of important reference groups or significant others (Ajzen, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0079">1991</link>), sometimes in a more general sense (“other teens your age”) and sometimes in a very personalized way through group activities within peer networks can bring norms into focus and encourage compliance with them (see <ulink url="ch0025">Chapter 11</ulink> on Social Networks).</para>
   <anchor id="ch0037s0000a0012"/>
   <beginpage pagenum="278"/>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0019">Unfortunately, the misperception of norms is common. The perceived frequency of behavior (descriptive norm) is likely to be either underestimated when behaviors are less publicly visible, sensitive, taboo, or illegal (e.g. teenage sex or drug use) or overestimated for highly publicized behaviors (e.g., binge drinking in college campuses). But social‐norms marketing can be used to inform people about the<emphasis>actual</emphasis> frequency of positive behaviors within groups they care about to create salient social pressure (injunctive norms), shift perceptions of relatively rare but dramatically visible negative behaviors, or introduce and promote new norms by spreading images of it in the mass media (Kincaid, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0099">2004</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0020">
      <emphasis>Market‐driven approaches</emphasis>. An extension of consumer (or demand) driven approaches are market‐driven ones that are positioned in relation to economic, commercial, or socio‐structural forces. For example, a market‐driven approach to responsible drinking must position its product (e.g., <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink>‐free social interaction, or observing a “dry” January) as normative or as an attractive alternative to the commercial (e.g., seasonal) competition.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0021">Sometimes, to counter unhealthy practices, a new brand can be introduced that reframes an old or customary behavior in a new way. For example, the<emphasis>Saleema</emphasis> campaign in Sudan (Evans et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0093">2019</link>; Johnson et al., <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0097">2018</link>) aimed to encourage the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10267">abandonment</ulink> of female genital mutilation (FGM), a widespread traditional practice reinforced by a variety of social and religious normative beliefs. The campaign created the character of Saleema, a young girl whose parents decided to abandon the practice of FGM because she was already “perfect, as God created her.” Saleema dressed in bright colors (red, yellow, orange, and green) and clothing using those colors were featured in campaign materials including posters, television spots, and banners. People were encouraged to wear those colors as a way of expressing their support for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10267">abandonment</ulink> and as a way of honoring God’s work.</para>
