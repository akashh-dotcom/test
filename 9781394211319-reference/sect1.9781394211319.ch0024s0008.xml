      <para id="ch0024s0000p0001">Don and Nancy had been together for 45 years. They got married in their late thirties and have enjoyed their life filled with travel, meaningful work, and advanced educational opportunities. Don quit smoking in <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> thirties when Nancy entered the picture. He still smoked a cigar occasionally on vacations, but Nancy could not stand the smell. So, it was a rare occasion. Nancy loved the arts, and Don was an avid baseball fan and loved to go to local games during baseball season. Nancy went to baseball games with Don, and Don went to the museums and plays with Nancy. They walked together daily, no matter the weather. Their relationship enjoyed a lot of harmony because of shared activities. Nancy was also very involved with the community and regularly volunteered at a local soup kitchen for homeless women where she made friends with other volunteers and with some of the homeless women.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0002">Nancy was the oldest of five sisters in her family. Her sisters who lived nearby visited her almost weekly. Don was the only child, and both <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> parents had passed away 16 years ago. He had a few friends he kept in touch with from work, but since retiring, Don and Nancy had decided to move closer to her family because they did not have children of their own. After the move, Don was hundreds of miles away from his former coworkers.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0003">One night while at a musical performance with Don, Nancy felt faint for no apparent reason. By the end of the performance, Nancy looked pale and was completely drained of energy. She could barely walk to the car without Don’s assistance. Don insisted that they go to the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> room, but Nancy said it was probably just something she ate and that she just needed to rest. They went home and Nancy went straight to bed. The next day she felt even worse, and Don realized that she could not speak correctly. He took her to the hospital where the ER doctor said that she had experienced a severe <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8963">stroke</ulink>. Over the next week, Nancy had multiple visitors at the hospital from her sisters and friends at the soup kitchen, including some of the soup kitchen’s clients. Despite Nancy’s inability to communicate verbally, she had tears of gratitude in her eyes with every visit. Nancy passed away a week after suffering the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8963">stroke</ulink>.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0004">Don was heartbroken, and the grief was the heaviest burden he had ever experienced in <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> life. After the first few weeks of Nancy being gone, Don awoke to the reality of his isolation. He was not interested in starting a new relationship in his late 70s and lived too far from the only friends he still had from work, with whom he rarely interacted since moving. Don stopped going on walks without Nancy and instead stayed home most days all day. His diet changed dramatically, and even his interest in baseball seemed lower without someone to go to the games with him. Without Nancy around, Don returned to smoking. Nancy’s sisters stopped by around the holidays but did not regularly come by because of the grief they faced being around Nancy’s old home. Don’s mobility started to decline, but he was not motivated to visit the doctor regularly. By the time Don was 78, he had developed <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3615">lung cancer</ulink> and was showing signs of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2605">heart disease</ulink>. Don died at age 79.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0005">This fictional vignette illustrates three approaches to research on social relationships and health: functional, structural, and quality. After reading more about these in this chapter, we suggest that you return to this vignette later and ask yourself how Don’s health was impacted by aspects of each of these three different approaches to social support and health.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0006">Robust evidence links social support to better mental health (Harandi et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0049">2017</link>) and reduced risk for morbidity and mortality from certain diseases and conditions (Holt‐Lunstad et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0062">2010</link>; NASEM, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0096">2020</link>; Olaya et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0099">2017</link>; Vila, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0134">2021</link>). Understanding the nature and types of social support and the pathways through which it is associated with health is essential to guide effective interventions. Although many questions remain, theories and evidence suggest that social support is a wide‐ranging concept, with multiple pathways through which social support may influence mental and physical health. In this chapter, we first provide a review of different conceptualizations of support, the evidence linking social support to health outcomes, and the major theoretical models relating social support to health. We end by focusing on the implications for intervention and describe two recent applications of social support to modify health outcomes.</para>
