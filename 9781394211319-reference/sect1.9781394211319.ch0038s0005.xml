   <title>Social Media Interventions and Health Inequities</title>

   <para id="ch0038s0000p0027">It has been argued that the goal of public health communication interventions should include bridging communication gaps in health outcomes between population subgroups (Bekalu,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0019">2014</link>). However, communication inequalities sometimes play a key role in exacerbating health disparities (Bekalu et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0021">2017</link>; Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0068">2021</link>). A systematic review that examined the effectiveness of social media interventions for health behavior change found that social media interventions had a significant, moderate‐sized, positive effect on behavior change among populations experiencing health inequities despite significant heterogeneity across studies (Vereen et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0065">2021</link>). According to this review, social media interventions may be a promising intervention approach to encourage behavior change and mitigate health inequities.</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0028">Social media may also be useful to address global inequalities in health and health‐related outcomes. Since social media use is increasing globally, in general, and in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), in particular (Poushter et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0055">2018</link>), it is important to investigate whether these technologies can be effective tools for public health interventions. A systematic review of studies that examined the effectiveness of social media‐based interventions for health behavior change in LMICs found most studies showed that social media interventions were effective. Also, several social media interventions for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>/<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=66">AIDS</ulink> prevention have been shown to be effective in promoting <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in both high‐ and middle‐income countries (Cao et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0031">2017</link>). However, some studies of the effectiveness of social media interventions did not quantify the level of social media engagement or use a theory or a conceptual model of behavior change, thus limiting the interpretation of those studies (Seiler et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0058">2022</link>).</para>
