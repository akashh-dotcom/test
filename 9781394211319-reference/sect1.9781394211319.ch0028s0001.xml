   <title>Multiple Levels of Influence and Action</title>

   <anchor id="ch0028s0000a0008"/>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0014">A central premise of this book is that improvements in health require both understanding the multilevel determinants of health behavior and a range of change strategies at the individual, interpersonal, and macro levels. The view that societal‐level changes and supportive environments are necessary to address major health problems successfully<emphasis>and</emphasis> to maintain individual‐level behavior change is now widely endorsed (Glanz &amp; Bishop, <link linkend="ch0028s0000li0002">2010</link>; Paskett et al., <link linkend="ch0028s0000li0007">2016</link>). The chapters in this section clearly exemplify a multilevel perspective, which builds on intrapersonal and interpersonal theories to explain and/or affect community change.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0015">The applications described in the four chapters in this section each illustrate how multiple levels of influence interact and require attention to improve conditions and health. In<ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink>, Bailey explains the challenging concepts of structural systems of inequity, most notably racism, and introduces readers to Ecosocial Theory, Critical Race Theory, and Public Health Critical Race Praxis. She illustrates how applications of these ideas are compatible with the Social Ecological Model and Integrative Behavioral Model, and can be blended to address social justice issues. The example of the PPYEP in <ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink> begins with academic partners engaging a Pasifika community member who helped to recruit 41 Pasifika youth to participate in the program to develop the health knowledge and skillsets of the youth to reduce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4953">prediabetes</ulink> risk in the Pasifika adult community. This empowerment program was co‐designed with the youth who subsequently implemented an eight‐week community‐based intervention.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0016">In<ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink>, the example of the Pool Cool <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5571">skin cancer</ulink> prevention dissemination trial illustrates how enhanced strategies for implementation/dissemination can simultaneously target individuals, organizations, and environments (Glanz et al., <link linkend="ch0028s0000li0003">2015</link>) and the example of the VA <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">Diabetes</ulink> Prevention Program illustrates the need for context using CFIR along with implementation strategies can support EBI implementation. In <ulink url="ch0032">Chapter 17</ulink>, authors illustrate how the role of information processing theories can shape responses to COVID‐19 vaccination messaging and how the role of modeling (positive portrayals of tobacco use) and normative influences (frequent tobacco portrayals) can shape responses to tobacco use among youth in India.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0017">An important message at the heart of these chapters is that the broader, community‐, or organization‐level models and concepts are not intended to stand alone at the expense of neglecting the individuals who comprise groups, organizations, and communities (Kegler &amp; Glanz,<link linkend="ch0028s0000li0004">2008</link>). Important concepts and issues related to health equity are integrated into <ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink> in relation to the concepts and principles of community engagement and in <ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink> with respect to innovations being “designed for dissemination,” which can accelerate successful uptake and promote health equity (Kwan et al., <link linkend="ch0028s0000li0005">2022</link>). While macro‐level theories are invaluable for understanding the complex environments in which behavior takes place, creating change in these environments still often requires identifying and targeting individual change agents, such as local <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink> that include target audiences including youth, news gatekeepers, or politicians. In other words, understanding individual behavior will remain integral, especially because proximal behavior targeted is health and requires multiple levels of influence to impact health. While it is collectives of <emphasis>individuals</emphasis> who create organizational structures, provide leadership in communities, and choose to engage—or not engage—in community efforts to make decisions about local, state, and federal priorities, it is premature to assume that policy development, social action, and environmental change are sufficient for behavior change across various health topics and populations. The history of tobacco control policies illustrates how important policies and laws can be while underscoring that clinical and individual‐level strategies operated synergistically with policies to achieve major reductions in combustible tobacco use (Warner, <link linkend="ch0028s0000li0009">2014</link>).</para>
