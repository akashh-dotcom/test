   <para id="ch0008s0000p0006">This book is written for graduate students, practitioners, and scientists who spend part or all of their time in the broad arenas of health behavior change, public health, health promotion, and health education; the text will assist them both to understand the theories and to apply them in practical settings. Practitioners, as well as students, should find this text a major reference for the development and evaluation of theory‐driven health behavior change programs and interventions. Researchers should emerge with a recognition of areas where empirical support is deficient or inconclusive, helping set the research agenda for health behavior going forward.</para>
