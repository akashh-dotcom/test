   <para id="ch0019s0000p0054">While the models described in this chapter have been used widely over several decades, critics (Amaro &amp; Raj,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0014">2000</link>; Sniehotta et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0062">2014</link>; Trafimow, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0066">2015</link>; Ogden, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0055">2003</link>) have raised issues that warrant consideration. Some of the most common critiques include that it is difficult to falsify, too parsimonious or simplified, and it inappropriately asserts theoretical sufficiency. For a review of more critiques, see Hagger (<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0037">2019</link>).</para>

      <emphasis>Falsifiability</emphasis>. Ogden (<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0055">2003</link>) argued that models are not falsifiable on the grounds that when data from a study ostensibly provide disconfirmation, the results could be explained as conceptually consistent with theoretical assumptions or as the result of methodological shortcomings. In their response to these and other critiques, proponents have countered that it is indeed plausible to disconfirm the theories, as would be the case if none of the theoretical predictors was significantly associated with behavior (Ajzen, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0008">2015</link>; Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0012">2004</link>; Ogden, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0055">2003</link>). Ajzen (<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0009">2020</link>) also points out that the models hypothesize various “mediation and moderation processes,” grounded in its sufficiency claims, that can also be disproven.</para>
   <para id="ch0019s0000p0056">
      <emphasis>Parsimony</emphasis>. Other critics argue that this reasoned action framework is too parsimonious because it oversimplifies factors shaping behavior and excludes important variables (Sniehotta et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0062">2014</link>). For example, emotions, including anticipated affect (Conner et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0025">2013</link>) and behavioral consistency with self‐identity (Armitage &amp; Conner, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0015">1999</link>) have received considerable empirical attention, leading researchers to advocate including these factors in the reasoned action framework. s As noted earlier, this framework does not preclude adding predictor variables that are not redundant with the original constructs and that consistently add additional variance across a range of behaviors (Ajzen, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0009">2020</link>). Further, the reasoned action theory predicts considerable variance in intentions and behaviors across a wide array of behavioral domains with relatively few predictors.</para>
   <para id="ch0019s0000p0057">
      <emphasis>Theoretical sufficiency</emphasis>. The sufficiency principle in a reasoned action context also has been challenged (Sniehotta et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0062">2014</link>), particularly with the inclusion of past behavior in the prediction of intention and/or behavior. According to the theories, the effect of past behavior on intention should be mediated through attitudes, norms, and intentions. There is empirical evidence, however, that demonstrates that adding past behavior to the prediction of intention as well as behavior can increase the variance explained in those outcomes (Albarracin et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0013">2001</link>; Hagger et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0039">2018</link>; Rise et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0057">2010</link>). The causal mechanism through which past behavior influences intention remains unclear.</para>
