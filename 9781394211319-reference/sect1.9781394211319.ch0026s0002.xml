   <para id="ch0026s0000p0010">Psychologists Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman integrated psychological, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors into the conceptualization of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and adaptation or coping. According to the Transactional Model of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">Stress</ulink> and Coping, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> is a subjectively perceived discrepancy between environmental demands or threats and an individual’s biological, psychological, and social resources for coping (Lazarus &amp; Folkman,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0059">1984</link>). According to this model, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> is a process. One of the most important elements is perception, or what individuals may think about the environmental demands or threats and their ability to meet these demands. This is commonly referred to as <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> <emphasis>appraisal</emphasis> (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0059">1984</link>). When an individual is confronted with or exposed to an environmental demand or threat, he or she engages in a cognitive appraisal process to assess the meaning, relevance, and potential danger of this demand (<emphasis>primary appraisal</emphasis>) and the presence of resources to manage it (<emphasis>secondary appraisal</emphasis>). The degree of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> an individual experiences depends on the dynamic relationship between the individual and their environment. An individual’s perceptions, including their worldview and perceived availability of supportive resources, influence the appraisal of events as stressful or not (Folkman et al., 1986) (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0059">1984</link>). <anchor id="ch0026s0000a0010"/>

      <para id="ch0026s0000p0011">Coping is a transactional process that has been conceptualized as an individual’s cognitive, behavioral, and emotional efforts in response to demands, internal or external, or stressors appraised as exceeding existing resources (Folkman &amp; Lazarus,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0040">1988</link>; Folkman et al., 1986). According to this theory, the availability of adequate coping resources minimizes <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>.</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0012">There are two types of coping (Folkman et al., 1986).<emphasis>Problem‐focused coping</emphasis> involves the targeted reduction or removal of the underlying cause of a stressor. Problem‐focused coping, such as problem‐solving, can be most beneficial in situations that are within the individual’s control to change the stressor, such as using better time‐management skills, changing jobs, or moving to a more comfortable home or safer community. When a situation is beyond control of the individual, such as emotional loss, or if problem‐focused coping strategies are not financially or socially accessible, problem‐focused coping is less beneficial. Emotion‐focused coping can be potentially adaptive (e.g., meditation, prayer, emotional disclosure, writing) or maladaptive (e.g., emotional eating, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8412">substance abuse</ulink>, risk‐taking behaviors, or emotional avoidance), depending on the degree to which these strategies are used and their long‐term impact on health and well‐being. Emotion‐focused coping can be helpful when demands or stressors are less amenable to direct control by the individual.</para>

Arrows from both appraisal boxes point to a central process labeled mediating processes, which includes coping efforts with problem management and emotional regulation. From here, arrows <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to two separate boxes. One titled outcome, listing emotional well-being, functional status, and health behaviors.

      <para id="ch0026s0000p0013">A cumulative body of research suggests that coping strategies mediate the impact of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> on biopsychosocial processes that can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to adverse health conditions. For example, journaling or written emotional expression (Petrie Booth &amp; Pennebaker,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0071">1998</link>) was identified as a coping strategy that could influence immunoprotective outcomes. Research by Utsey (<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0085">1999</link>) and Mattis (<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0064">2002</link>) emphasized the importance of including culture‐specific coping strategies, and the limitations of placing coping strategies in exclusive problem‐ or emotion‐focused categories. Collective coping, religious and spirituality‐centered coping, and cognitive‐emotional debriefing are considered to be both problem‐ and emotion‐focused coping strategies that buffer associations between stressful life experiences and adverse psychological or physical health.</para>

Influential research on <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and coping in diverse populations identified <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> as a potential factor influencing health disparities, defined as “differences in the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups in the United States” (Carter‐Pokras et al.,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0030">2002</link>, p. 430). Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and other medically underserved groups are considered health disparity populations (NIH, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0069">2015</link>). Clark et al. (<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0032">1999</link>) were among the first research teams to identify racial discrimination as a stressor. Previous conceptualizations of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> were generic and did not include sources of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> related to race, culture, or gender nor the possibility that different groups may respond to the same stressors in different ways. Research by Woods‐Giscombe and Lobel (<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0095">2008</link>) later provided evidence that operationalizations of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> that include race and gender were more comprehensive and predictive of psychological and physiological symptoms of distress compared to operationalizations of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> that included more generic experiences of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> alone.</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0016">Grounded in the bioecological framework (Bronfenbrenner &amp; Ceci,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0027">1994</link>), expanded conceptualizations of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> included contextual, historical, developmental, structural, and social determinants that influence individual experiences and responses to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> (APA, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0015">2017</link>). In alignment with this <emphasis>bioecological approach</emphasis> (Bronfenbrenner &amp; Ceci, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0027">1994</link>), concepts such as Weathering (Geronimus et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0046">2019</link>) and John Henryism (James, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0052">1994</link>), described below, provide a more comprehensive understanding of how <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐coping responses influence health and health inequities.

Like allostatic load, the concept of “<emphasis>weathering</emphasis>” (Geronimus et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0046">2019</link>) provides an explanation for potentially greater susceptibility to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. Research on weathering has been focused on African American women to identify mechanisms through which <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> influences the disproportionately high rates of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">chronic illness</ulink> they experience compared with European American women. Support for the concept of weathering includes evidence that health disparities between African American and European American women become amplified after age 25 and are most evident from ages 35 to 64 (Geronimus, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0045">2001</link>; Simons et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0079">2021</link>).
