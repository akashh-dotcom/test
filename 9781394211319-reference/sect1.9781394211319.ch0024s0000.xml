   <title>Definition and Conceptualizations of Social Support</title>

   <para id="ch0024s0000p0007">Social support, social networks, and social integration are often used interchangeably but are distinct concepts. Although the influence of social relationships has been conceptualized and measured in diverse ways, they can be divided into three broad categories: the structure, functions, and quality of social relationships (Berkman et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0022">2000</link>; Holt‐Lunstad, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0060">2021</link>; NASEM, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0096">2020</link>; Uchino, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0125">2006</link>). Generally, these three approaches distinguish the dimensions of social networks, the support that they provide, and their quality.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0008">
      <anchor id="ch0024s0000a0007"/>
      <link linkend="ch0024s0000a0012">Figure 10.1</link> illustrates the three approaches. Structural aspects of relationships refer to the extent to which individuals are situated within or integrated into social networks. Social networks describe connections between individuals and their relationships or network ties (see <ulink url="ch0025">Chapter 11</ulink>). Measures of social networks typically assess the density, size, and/or number of social contacts. Social integration describes the extent of an individual's participation in a broad range of social relationships, including active engagement in various social activities or relationships and a sense of communality and identification with one's social roles. In contrast, functional measures focus on the specific functions served by relationships, and they are measured by the actual or perceived availability of support, aid, or resources from these relationships.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0009">Additionally, quality of support measures the sense of connection to others based on positive or negative qualities such as relationship satisfaction, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5669">strain</ulink>, or degree of perceived ambivalence regarding a relationship. Epidemiological studies that have linked social relationships to mortality can be categorized according to the specific measurement approaches described in<anchor id="ch0024s0000a0008"/>
      <link linkend="ch0024s0000a0013">Table 10.1</link>.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0010">The breadth of these three approaches—structural, functional, and quality—has been both a strength and weakness of research on social relationships and health. On the one hand, a broad approach more fully describes how aspects of social relationships may influence health and the potential interconnection among these constructs. On the other hand, such an approach makes it difficult to identify which particular aspects are related to health outcomes and through which pathways. It is also challenging to reconcile conflicting evidence when different measures are used to measure social support. This chapter focuses primarily on the perspective that social support is the functional aspect of relationship processes when describing specific mechanisms and outcomes.</para>

      <link linkend="ch0024s0000a0014">Table 10.2</link>). Supportive individuals make available or provide what can be termed emotional support (e.g., expressions of caring), informational support (e.g., information that might be used to deal with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>), tangible support (e.g., direct material aid, also referred to as instrumental, practical, or financial support), and belonging support (e.g., having others to engage with in social activities) (Cohen et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0039">1985</link>; Cutrona &amp; Russell, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0042">1990</link>; Uchino et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0127">2018</link>). Factor analyses have shown that these support components are distinct lower‐order processes that together make up the higher‐order concept of social support (Cutrona &amp; Russell, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0042">1990</link>). These functions also can be differentiated based on whether social support is perceived or received (Dunkel‐Schetter &amp; Skokan, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0046">1990</link>; Uchino et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0127">2018</link>). Perceived support refers to the perception that others will be available to provide support if needed. Received support is the actual support provided by others. Perceived support is correlated only moderately with received support. Hence, they are distinct constructs (Wills &amp; Shinar, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0138">2000</link>).</para>

Structure which is represented by three figures connected by lines, indicating the existence of relationships like network size, marital status, and living alone. 2. Functions that are depicted by two figures with one hand on the other’s shoulder, symbolizing support or inclusion like perceived or received social support. 3.

      <anchor id="ch0024s0000a0016"/> This is also referred to as instrumental support.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0012">A relatively large body of literature links social support to health‐relevant outcomes, including health behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation), adherence to medical regimens (e.g., medication), development of and the course of specific chronic conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease), and all‐cause mortality (Barth et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0019">2010</link>; DiMatteo, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0044">2004</link>; Hill et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0059">2016</link>; Holt‐Lunstad et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0062">2010</link>; Magrin et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0091">2015</link>; Olaya et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0099">2017</link>; Vila, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0134">2021</link>). Overall, there is good epidemiological evidence that distinct measures of social support are related to positive health outcomes. More specific findings will be described later, but a meta‐analysis by Holt‐Lunstad et al. (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0062">2010</link>) found that those reporting greater social connection (averaged across different measurement approaches utilized in studies) were associated with 50% increased odds of survival relative to those lacking social connection. Additionally, drawing on data from four nationally representative longitudinal samples of US population, Yang et al. (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0140">2016</link>) found that higher levels of social integration (structural support) were associated with lower risk of physiological dysregulation in a dose–response manner in both early and later life.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0013">Among measurements of social connection (e.g., structure, function, quality), the 2010 meta‐analysis found that perceived functional support was a significant predictor of lower mortality. Received support did not predict mortality risk significantly. This lack of significance was likely due to large heterogeneity across studies, suggesting that some kinds of support may be more effective than others. These data are consistent with studies finding that perceived support is a more consistent predictor of mental and physical health outcomes than received support (Haber et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0055">2007</link>; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0096">2020</link>; Uchino, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0126">2009</link>; Wills &amp; Shinar, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0138">2000</link>). As will be discussed later, this is a significant theoretical issue as interventions aimed at increasing support often try to increase the receipt of social support without considering whether it responds to the individual's needs or is perceived as supportive.</para>
