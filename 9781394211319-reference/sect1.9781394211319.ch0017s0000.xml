   <title>Health Belief Model (HBM)</title>

   <para id="ch0017s0000p0002">HBM has intuitive logic and clear central tenets, with defined ways to measure them (<ulink url="ch0018">Chapter 5</ulink>). The first study that used HBM addressed the very practical question: “Why did some people not get <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6145">tuberculosis</ulink> screening when it was available to them?”</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0003">Expectancy and value are central to HBM. The theory posits that people will engage in a health behavior when they believe that doing so can reduce a threat that is likely (expectancy) and would have severe consequences (value). HBM suggests that a health behavior is also more likely when people expect it to have more benefits and fewer barriers. The intuition behind expectancy and value also animates several other health behavior theories, most notably, RAA models (<ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Weinstein">Weinstein</ulink>,<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0014">1993</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0004">Another core construct of HBM—cues to action—may be as varied as medical symptoms, a doctor’s recommendation, reminders from a health plan, a poster near the checkout counter in a pharmacy, or a media campaign. The construct of cues to action is unusual among health behavior theories in providing a specific place for the effect of health symptoms in motivating behavior.</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0005">Self‐efficacy, originally part of Social Cognitive Theory, proposed as an addition after HBM was formulated, is not derived directly from an expectancy‐value approach. Substantial research has shown that self‐efficacy is a strong predictor of many health behaviors (see<ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink> on Social Cognitive Theory), and researchers made a logical case for incorporating it into HBM (Rosenstock et al., <link linkend="ch0017s0000li0007">1988</link>). However, we have not found systematic reviews that examined the predictive utility of adding self‐efficacy to HBM.</para>

   <para id="ch0017s0000p0006">HBM is parsimonious, requiring as few as six questions to assess key constructs. It is a proven way to identify correlates of health behavior that may be important in behavior changes and is useful for informing intervention design and evaluation. The theory is especially well‐suited to understanding preventive behaviors for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1210">infectious diseases</ulink> and screening for a range of diseases. Studies have shown the utility of HBM in understanding uptake of many health behaviors beyond screening and vaccination.</para>
