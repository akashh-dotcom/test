   <anchor id="ch0034s0000a0011"/>
   <para>We offer some key cross‐cutting propositions to readers to put the use of health behavior theory in perspective. These ideas are germane to the review and discussion of the chapters in this section and throughout this book.</para>

         <para>When combining theories, it is important to clearly think through the unique contribution of different theories to the combined model.

         <para>Theory use, testing, and development will be enhanced by use of shared instruments and reporting. The more we can build on past efforts, the more we are likely to advance the public’s health. We recommend adaptations of the protocol concept used in clinical research so that it is much more transparent and accessible to understand what measures were used to accompany particular theories and how theory is turned into interventions. Good examples can be found in the literature (Glanz et al.,<link linkend="ch0034s0000li0012">2005</link>; Harte et al., <link linkend="ch0034s0000li0014">2022</link>) but more are needed, and intervention researchers should publish protocol papers more routinely.</para>

         <para>Theory, research, and practice are part of a continuum for understanding the determinants of behaviors, testing strategies for change, and implementing effective interventions (see<ulink url="ch0031">Chapters 16</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0035">19</ulink>).</para>

         <para>There is no substitute for knowing the audience. This applies to the conduct of fundamental research to understand determinants of health behavior as much as it applies to developing health promotion programs for specific individuals, groups, and communities. Participatory research (<ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink>) and program design improve the odds of success.</para>

   <para id="ch0034s0000p0017">The authors of the next four chapters in Part Five describe tools, strategies, models, and issues for applying theories. This section of<emphasis>Health Behavior: Theory, Research and Practice</emphasis> tackles the complexity of health behavior and health promotion at multiple levels. A basic theme is that if intervention strategies are based on a carefully researched understanding of the determinants of behavior and environments, and if systematic approaches to tailoring, targeting, implementation, and evaluation are used, the chances are good that programs will be effective. And if they are not, then there should be good information about why an intervention did not work. Understanding past failure is critical to future success.</para>
