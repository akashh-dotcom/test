   <title>Fitting a Theory or Theories to Research and Practice: Building Bridges and Forging Links</title>

   <para id="ch0014s0000p0041">Effective health behavior change depends on marshaling the most appropriate theory<emphasis>and</emphasis> practice strategies for a given situation. Different theories are best suited to different units of practice, such as individuals, groups, and organizations. When one is attempting to overcome women’s personal barriers to obtaining mammograms, Health Belief Model may be useful. The Transtheoretical Model may be especially useful for smoking cessation interventions. When trying to change physicians’ mammography practices by instituting reminder systems, dissemination and implementation science approaches are more suitable. At the same time, physicians might use The Transtheoretical Model to inform their discussions with individual patients about getting a first mammogram or annual screening. The choice of a suitable theory or theories should begin with identifying the problem, goal, and units of practice (Sussman, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0096">2001</link>; van Ryn &amp; Heaney, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0099">1992</link>), <emphasis>not</emphasis> with selecting a theoretical framework because it is intriguing, familiar, or in vogue. As Green and Kreuter (<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0064">2005</link>) have argued, one should start with a logical model of the problem and work backward to identify potential solutions.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0042">The adequacy of a theory most often is assessed with three criteria: (1) its<emphasis>logic</emphasis>, or <emphasis>internal consistency</emphasis> in not yielding mutually contradictory derivations, (2) extent to which it is <emphasis>parsimonious</emphasis>, or broadly relevant while using a manageable number of concepts, and (3) its <emphasis>plausibility</emphasis> in fitting with prevailing theories in the field (McGuire, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0075">1983</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0043">Theories also are judged in the context of activities of practitioners and researchers. Practitioners may apply the pragmatic criterion of<emphasis>usefulness</emphasis> to a theory and thus would be concerned with its consistency to everyday observations. Researchers make scientific judgments of a theory’s <emphasis>ecological validity</emphasis>, or the extent to which it conforms to observable reality when empirically tested (McGuire, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0075">1983</link>). We should test theories iteratively in the field and in more controlled settings. When we do so, theory, research, and practice begin to converge.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0044">One of the most frequent questions students around the world ask is, “<emphasis>What theory should I use?</emphasis>” It is an important question whose answer is found not just in the readings contained in this book but also in the experiences and judgments that equip readers to apply what is learned here: <emphasis>theory into practice and research</emphasis>. We hope that <emphasis>Health Behavior: Theory, Research and Practice</emphasis> will provide and strengthen that foundation for readers.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0045">Science is, by definition, cumulative, with paradigm shifts that come more rarely as a result of crises when current theories fail to explain some phenomena (Kuhn,<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0072">1962</link>). The same applies to the science base that supports long‐standing and innovative health behavior interventions. More research is needed at all points along the research continuum—more basic research to develop and test theories, more intervention research to develop and test evidence‐based interventions, more implementation science research and practice to understand and apply the processes of implementation, and more concerted attention to dissemination of evidence‐based interventions (Institute of Medicine, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0068">2002</link>; Rimer et al., <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0086">2001</link>; Rohrbach et al., <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0087">2006</link>; <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Weinstein">Weinstein</ulink>, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0101">2007</link>).</para>
   <anchor id="ch0014s0000a0027"/>
   <beginpage pagenum="18"/>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0046">Health behavior research and practice communities are sorely in need of more rigor and precision in theory development and testing—in measures, assessment of mediating variables, and in specification of theoretical elements (Rejeski et al.,<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0085">2000</link>). Theory provides the conceptual underpinnings for well‐crafted research and informed practice. “The scientist values research by the size of its contribution to that huge, logically articulated structure of ideas which is already, though not half‐built, the most glorious accomplishment of mankind” (Medawar, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0077">1967</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0047">In this book, we aim to demystify theory and communicate theory and theoretically inspired research alongside their implications for practice. We encourage informed criticism of theories. The ultimate test of these ideas and this information rests on their use over time, critical assessment, refinement, and application. The process does not end with publication of a particular study. The goal of theory, for a small number of people, may be proof of the theory. But for most readers of this book, it will be improved health. Theory, then, is a tool to improve health outcomes. Thus, we should think about theory<emphasis>and</emphasis> practice, not theory <emphasis>or</emphasis> practice. Green said it well: The translational gap between research and practice has long been discussed, often as a one‐way street—get practitioners to recognize and utilize the research that is being conducted. While important, equally important is the reverse—integrating practice‐based evidence and context into the research conducted (Green, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0063">2006</link>). We need a bridge between the two, not a pipeline. Achieving this vision will require social support, supportive environments, and periodic reinforcement. The beneficiaries will be practitioners, researchers, and participants in <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Formal">formal</ulink> health behavior change programs—and ultimately, improved public health.</para>
