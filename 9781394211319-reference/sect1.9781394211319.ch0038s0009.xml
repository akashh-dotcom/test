      <para id="ch0038s0000p0001">Mary is 45, working for a marketing company, busy with her career, raising a family, and taking care of her parents. She is active in her community and volunteers her time at her children’s school with little time for herself. In her last routine mammogram, a growth was found in her breast, and she was diagnosed with early‐stage <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=737">breast cancer</ulink>. Suddenly she had multiple decisions to make about which medical procedures to undergo. And the decision making would be made under stressful conditions, including a lack of time and information. She had a great medical team and outstanding support from her colleagues, family, and friends. Still, she wanted information from others with similar experiences. She joined a social media group for women with breast <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink>. Initially, she just followed others and learned from them. Over time, however, she became active—posting questions and seeking answers—and she was gratified to hear from others who were going through similar experiences. Her social media “friends” helped her through emotional ups and downs, giving her tips, ideas, and support. Mary found the group so helpful that she began sharing her own experience and offering support to others. Being part of the group helped her navigate one of the most frightening experiences of her life. While there are many in‐person support groups in her community, the social media group allowed her to seek and get support any time of the day or night from people all over the world. It helped her cope, navigate, and thrive despite her condition.</para>
      <para id="ch0038s0000p0002">This chapter addresses the role of social media in health and health behavior, drawing on systematic reviews and recently published studies. We will discuss the literature on social media use and health under two broad categories. One focuses on social media use as a behavior and investigates how it affects health outcomes. A second category examines the role and effects of social media platforms and networks as channels for health interventions.</para>
