   <para id="ch0036s0000p0004">The problem of medication nonadherence in this chapter’s opening vignette provides a helpful illustration of how behavioral economics insights can be useful—and how they differ from standard economic models of decision‐making. It also illustrates why behavioral economics can usually offer a more intuitive lens through which to make sense of how and why people behave the way they do. If we have a more accurate understanding of behavioral drivers, policies and intervention approaches will be more effective and more cost‐effective.</para>
   <para id="ch0036s0000p0005">A traditional economic framework would conceptualize nonadherence as a patient’s<emphasis>choice—</emphasis>patients who do not adhere choose to do so because that is the best decision for them based on the information they have, their preferences, and other factors (Cohen &amp; Saran, <link linkend="ch0036s0000li0022">2018</link>). Put simply, the patient would be weighing the expected benefits of adhering to the medication with the expected costs. For example, the main expected benefit of adherence is the guarantee of maximum health benefit from the medicine and the expected costs include things like side effects, the hassle of taking the medicine, etc. If this model is the right way of understanding adherence, then policy approaches could include things like providing patients with information regarding the benefits of adherence (e.g., on the bottle label) or formulating the drug so it has fewer side effects.</para>
   <para id="ch0036s0000p0006">A behavioral economics lens of nonadherence would not necessarily assume patients are making the choice that is optimal for them or, even, that they are making a choice at all. For example, people may forget to take the medication, especially if their symptoms are mild and are thus not very salient or “top of mind.” Indeed, ACTs tend to decrease patients’ <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3716">malaria</ulink> symptoms quite quicky, with most of the symptom relief happening within the first day or two. Patients may be skipping the third day of the medication because they feel better and forget they need the pills. In this case, approaches to improving ACT adherence could focus on SMS reminder messages, e.g., text messages from the pharmacy or clinician’s office (Volpp et al.,<link linkend="ch0036s0000li0088">2017</link>). Behavioral economics can help expand the lens with which we understand behavioral drivers of health decisions, allowing us to target the relevant behavioral barrier or barriers and design more effective policies and interventions.</para>
   <para id="ch0036s0000p0007">Patient nonadherence is just one example of the ways individuals’ decisions are instrumental in shaping health outcomes around the world. While environmental and structural factors are critically important in influencing population health, so are a wide variety of human behaviors ranging from individuals’ decisions to use prevention services to healthcare providers’ decisions to prescribe medications. Despite major biomedical advances in recent decades, behavioral factors often limit the overall effectiveness of those advances when it comes to improving population health. In the cases of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> screening, childhood immunization, and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions, poor uptake, or adherence can pose major barriers to health improvement. Recent efforts to deploy COVID‐19 <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14154">vaccines</ulink> around the world proved just how central human behavior is in controlling the spread of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1210">infectious diseases</ulink>. Behavioral economics offers insights into health behavior and decision‐making, from explanations for suboptimal engagement in healthy behavior to suggestions for policies and interventions that promote healthy behavior.</para>
   <para id="ch0036s0000p0008">In this chapter, we describe several major ideas from behavioral economics and explain how they can be useful for explaining and influencing health behavior. We begin by summarizing the standard economic theory of human behavior and then contrasting it to behavioral economics theories. We then discuss key concepts in behavioral economics and summarize existing empirical evidence on how behavioral economics has been applied to health.</para>
