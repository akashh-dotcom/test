   <para id="ch0028s0000p0021">While all four chapters in this section describe trends and the emergence of new research and public health concerns, none makes these points in a more emphatic and dramatic manner than the chapter on Communication and Media Effects on Health Behavior (<ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink>). The multiplication of communication platforms, increased grassroots participation, the pace of change, and the persistence of communication inequalities are daunting for public health experts and health behavior researchers. Since the last edition of this book was written, the impact of COVID‐19 has highlighted issues relevant to each of these chapters: social justice; community engagement, dissemination, and implementation; and the role of communication and the media underscores each of the other chapters. The influence of health disparities and inequities along with politics have influenced community engagement, EBIs, and dissemination and implementation efforts regarding the risk of COVID‐19. This example of the complexity of communication about health foreshadows challenges that health behavior experts will confront.</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0022">An understanding of theory, research, and practice in communities, systems, and organizations will be increasingly critical to wide improvement of health in the future. This part of<emphasis>Health Behavior: Theory, Research, and Practice</emphasis> provides a diverse set of frameworks and applications for consideration of both researchers and practitioners. Readers should invest time and energy in digesting the complexity of these issues, models, and frameworks.</para>
