      <title>Case 1: Analyzing Background Variables in the Context of PrEP for HIV</title>

      <para id="ch0019s0000p0037">This section offers an example to demonstrate how to identify the ways sociodemographic and other background characteristics exert their influence on behavioral intentions by shaping determinants of intention. The analysis is based on data collected from women in the District of Columbia, one of the 48 US counties with the highest <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> incidence (HHS,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0027">2019</link>), to understand why women do or do not plan to use PrEP (Hull et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0044">2022</link>). PrEP is a pill that is highly effective in preventing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> infection when taken daily and is recommended for people without <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> who are <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10304">at risk</ulink> of being exposed to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> through sex or injection drug use. PrEP is underutilized by women generally and particularly by Black women relative to the number of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6782">HIV infections</ulink> diagnosed in these groups (Siegler et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0059">2018</link>). Because of low rates of PrEP uptake, this study sought to understand Black women’s perspectives about PrEP and psychosocial factors most relevant to their intentions to use PrEP to inform the development of communication efforts to increase its use. The data were used to identify how potentially relevant background variables—age, a history of injection substance use, and the proportion of casual (as opposed to committed) sex partners—affect attitudes, norms, and perceived control to ultimately shape women’s intentions to use PrEP.</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0038">The study was conducted in community (rented private office space in the community) and clinic settings. Recruitment methods included approaching women in the waiting room of the women’s health clinic to invite them to be screened, outreach by community‐based partners, and distributing flyers and palm cards. Cisgender women (or women who identified socially as female) who met study criteria based on an eligibility screening survey were invited to participate (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 398). Eligibility criteria included being sexually active, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> negative, age 20–49 and potentially eligible for PrEP due to residence in high prevalence area and the presence of any <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> risk factor (having an <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>‐positive sex partner, a recent sexually transmitted infection, participation in sex work, inconsistent condom use).</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0039">The survey assessed risk perceptions, knowledge of PrEP, demographic and background characteristics, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> risk and prevention behaviors, and reasoned action theoretical constructs (behavioral intention, attitudes, injunctive and descriptive norms, PBC). The target behavior was “My using PrEP daily for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> prevention in the next 12 months.” Attitudes were assessed with a semantic differential item: “Overall, would you say that using PrEP daily to prevent <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> is a good or a bad thing?” In addition, 5‐point Likert scales were used to measure injunctive norms (“Thinking about the people who are important to you, would they support or not support your using PrEP for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> prevention in the next 12 months?”), descriptive norms (“Thinking about people who are similar to you, how likely would they be to use PrEP for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> prevention in the next 12‐months.”), and PBC (i.e., “If I really wanted to, I could use PrEP daily for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> prevention,”). All items were coded such that higher scores represented more positive attitudes, more normative support, and higher PBC. Age was assessed continuously; injection drug use was a dichotomous assessment of participants’ lifetime history of “inject[ing] any drug other than those prescribed to you.” Sexual partnerships were assessed by asking: “Of the men you had sex with in the past 12 months, how many were casual sex partners?” (Responses: none, a few, some, most, all).</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0040">The statistical analysis tested mediation of the relationship between the background variables and intentions to use PrEP, through the proximal determinants. A path analysis was conducted with age, substance use history, and number of partners as the independent variables, behavioral intention as the dependent variable and attitudes, descriptive and injunctive norms, and PBC as parallel mediators. Injunctive and descriptive norms were kept separate in this analysis, because they were correlated at.23. As shown in<anchor id="ch0019s0000a0041"/>
         <link linkend="ch0019s0000a0043">Figure 6.3</link>, attitudes, descriptive norms, and PBC were significantly associated with intentions at the p&lt;.05 level, but the injunctive normative path was not significant.</para>

         <link linkend="ch0019s0000a0043">Figure 6.3</link> shows statistically significant paths for background variables to the determinants. Age was associated positively with descriptive norms, and the relationship between age and behavioral intentions worked (in part) through descriptive norms, as mediation was significant. That is, older women anticipated to a greater extent that their peers would utilize PrEP to prevent <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> infection, relative to younger women, and this belief shaped intentions. In addition, those with more casual partnerships reported lower PBC for using PrEP daily. Further, having more casual partnerships was associated with lower intentions to use PrEP, and this relationship is explained in part by lower PBC to utilize PrEP. Evidence suggests that women perceive PrEP to be a tool primarily for those in serodiscordant relationships, in which one of the partners is known to be living with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> (Bond &amp; Gunn, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0019">2016</link>). We anticipate that those with more casual partnerships may have low certainty about their <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> risk exposure and may have less confidence in their ability to adhere to such a tool, which has uncomfortable side‐effects and required a daily pill at the time the research was conducted.</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0042">History of injection‐drug use was not associated significantly with attitudes, norms, or self‐efficacy in this context; however, substance use may be related to other important background variables. For example, Roth and her colleagues (Roth et al.,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0058">2015</link>) reported that, among a sample of individuals who inject drugs, PrEP awareness was associated positively with use of syringe‐exchange programs, STI testing, and drug treatment. Injection‐drug use may shape and constrain individuals’ abilities to enact intentions, thereby moderating the intention‐behavior relationship.</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0043">Considering persistent inequities in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> infection, and disparately low utilization of PrEP among women, raising awareness of this <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> prevention option among women who may benefit from using it is an important step toward ending the epidemic. Findings from analyses like those reported here are being used to inform communication strategies to increase the use of PrEP. For example, given that older women in this sample were more likely to perceive their peers would use PrEP, strategies that cultivate positive descriptive norms and/or that rely on important normative referents to convey information may be particularly promising strategies for communicating effectively about PrEP. These results also suggest that efforts to build actual and perceived efficacy may be an important component of communication strategies that are designed to reach women in casual sexual relationships who may be eligible for PrEP.</para>

      <title>Case 2: Using the RAA to Increase Recruitment into Alzheimer’s Disease Research Registries</title>

      <anchor id="ch0019s0000a0044"/>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0044">The advancement of medical science depends on rigorous and representative trials to test new preventive therapies and treatments for diseases. Such trials require participation from people who are affected or are at‐risk and who come from diverse groups—including people of different race/ethnic groups. Health behavior theories can help understand and address the behaviors and intentions of individuals and groups participating in clinical trials. Black and Hispanic participation in registries and clinical trials related to AD is quite low (Langbaum et al.,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0046">2019</link>; Manly &amp; Glymour, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0049">2021</link>; Weiner et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0069">2018</link>). However, under‐representation of traditionally marginalized groups in clinical trials is not unique to AD trials. Nonwhite racial and ethnic groups report lower rates of participation in clinical trials across a range of diseases (Coakley et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0024">2012</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0000p0045">Although there are structural barriers such as access and system‐level barriers such as inclusion criteria that may reduce Black and Hispanic participant enrollment, individual‐level factors and decision‐making are also consequential. This second case demonstrates how the RAA can be used to determine whether the determinants of behavioral intention vary for different subgroups based on race and ethnicity, sex, and/or any number of possible individual or structural characteristics.</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0046">The StepUp (Study to Expand registry Participation of Underrepresented Populations) is designed to increase enrollment of cognitively healthy older adults and to advance recruitment science. StepUp is aimed at increasing participation of groups that are underrepresented in AD‐focused participant registries for AD prevention trials. Examples of these registries include the Alzheimer’s Prevention Registry (APR), the Alzheimer’s Association’s TrialMatch, the Brain Health Registry, and APR’s GeneMatch Program.</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0047">The message‐design process began with formative research that included elicitation interviews with 60 white, Black, and Hispanic older adults ages 49–80 years old, from the Philadelphia, PA area. Phone interviews were conducted in spring and summer 2020 by two experienced interviewers and were about 30 minutes long. The goal of elicitation interviews was to identify attitudinal, normative, and control beliefs among the target audience that were associated with registry enrollment and could serve as a basis for subsequent quantitative research. Findings from the elicitation study (Bleakley et al., 2022) were incorporated into a nationally representative survey about one year later. RAA data on the target behavior of “signing up for a brain health research registry” were collected through an online survey using a probability‐based sample of adults ages 49–80 years old (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 1,501) with oversamples of Black (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 334) and Hispanic (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 309) adults. Direct measures and underlying beliefs were used to measure all three determinants of intention. <anchor id="ch0019s0000a0046"/>
         <link linkend="ch0019s0000a0050">Table 6.3</link> provides descriptive statistics on the RAA direct measures for the three racial and ethnic subgroups of women.</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0048">Regression analysis of proximal determinants on intention was conducted within subgroups of interest—white women (for comparison;<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 415), Black women (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 194), and Hispanic women (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 134). In these analyses, the control and efficacy items (used to measure autonomy and capacity) were correlated with one another at <emphasis>r</emphasis> = 0.44, and the injunctive and descriptive norms were correlated at <emphasis>r</emphasis> = 0.55, and so they were each entered separately into the models. Attitudes were related significantly to intentions for all subgroups of women at the <emphasis>p</emphasis> &lt; 0.01 level (see <anchor id="ch0019s0000a0047"/>
         <link linkend="ch0019s0000a0051">Table 6.4</link> for all regression coefficients), and the association between intention and descriptive norms was also significant (<emphasis>p</emphasis> &lt; 0.05) for all three groups. Capacity was related uniquely to intention for Black women. These findings emphasize the importance of assessing specific groups within the target audience: different determinants are relevant for different groups. This has implications for interventions, such as health messaging, in which persuasive efforts are focused on specific beliefs about the salient determinants. Here, there are clear similarities and differences in important constructs for intention formation. This type of analysis could be conducted with an intersectional lens, which attends to the ways power and privilege are conveyed differently for people at different intersectional locations to examine the “dynamics of differences and sameness” (Cho et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0022">2013</link>, p. 787). For example, one might examine regional differences or differences between socioeconomic categories within groups of racially similar women.</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0049">Having identified salient global constructs, our next step was to conduct a belief‐level analysis that offered more specific information on potentially modifiable underlying beliefs for each group. Although attitudes are important for all groups of women, the beliefs that underlie those attitudes may be very different. Using an audience segmentation approach in which respondents were categorized into intenders and nonintenders, we examined relevant beliefs for each subgroup. For the purposes of an illustrative example,<link linkend="ch0019s0000a0051">Table 6.4</link> includes only select behavioral beliefs.</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0050">Beliefs are ordered by correlations of intention and each belief for Black women, from strongest to weakest. Highlighted cells represent beliefs identified as most salient for each group. Some beliefs about joining a registry, such as “help to advance science, “and “help people like you in the future” would be candidates for inclusion in a message aimed at women in general, although “helping others like me” is stronger for Black and Hispanic women, who are the actual groups targeted for enrollment. “Improve one’s community trust in medical research” also is more salient for Black and Hispanic women. Segmentation reveals numerous beliefs that, if bolstered, could <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to increased intentions for this behavior. The combination of these statistics helps researchers, practitioners, and clinicians make assessments about which beliefs are most salient and promising for intervention. For each belief, the larger the difference between intenders and nonintenders, the more room there is to move individuals; conversely, if the belief is not correlated with intention or attitude, it would not be a good candidate. This example highlights the versatility of the RAA, and all its predecessors, to find both similar and different points of potential intervention to encourage behavior change among various groups and demonstrates the necessity of moving beyond a one‐size‐fits‐all approach as it applies to understanding underlying behavioral determinants.</para>
