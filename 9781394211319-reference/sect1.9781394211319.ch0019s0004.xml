   <para id="ch0019s0000p0035">The RAA and its various iterations have been used widely in developing and evaluating a diverse range of behavioral and public health communication interventions. As a result, many meta‐analyses show support for the theories applied to a range of behaviors, including: condom use (TRA, TPB; Albarracin et al.,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0013">2001</link>), <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink> consumption (TPB; Cooke et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0026">2016</link>), exercise (TRA, TPB; Hagger et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0038">2002</link>), sun protection (TPB; Starfelt Sutton &amp; White, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0063">2016</link>), smoking (TPB; Topa &amp; Moriano, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0065">2010</link>), vaccine hesitancy (TRA, TPB, RAA; Xiao &amp; Wong, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0070">2020</link>), and dietary choices (TPB; McDermott et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0050">2015</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0019s0000p0036">Other meta‐analytic studies that pool research reports across behavioral domains also have shown support for reasoned action‐hypothesized relationships (e.g., TPB Godin &amp; Kok,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0035">1996</link>; Hagger et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0039">2018</link>). McEachan et al. (<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0051">2011</link>) conducted a meta‐analysis of 237 prospective tests of the TPB. They found that the TPB constructs account for a considerable amount of variance in behavioral outcomes (19%) and intentions (44%) and the intention‐behavior correlation was .43, which indicates a moderate relationship. Some argue that intention does not always translate into behavior. In a later meta‐analysis, McEachan et al. (<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0052">2016</link>) demonstrated significant prospective intention‐behavior relationships and showed that the components of the RAA were associated with behavioral intentions. Experiential and instrumental attitudes, descriptive and injunctive norms, and capacity, but not autonomy, were significant predictors of intentions, and these variables explained more than half of the variance in intentions (59%). In turn, intention and capacity but not autonomy, significantly predicted behavior, explaining almost one‐third of the variance in behavior (31%). These analyses provide strong support for RAA but also raise important unanswered questions about the autonomy dimension of the PBC construct.</para>
