      <para id="ch0023s0000p0001">Marcos is in sixth grade and recently joined the science club. He notices that several older kids, and even some in <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> grade, started using e‐cigarettes (vaping). They are using flavors of <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Mint">mint</ulink> and green apple, and he does not want to stick out for turning it down if one of the older kids offers him their e‐cigarette; he’s not sure how he’d say “no” in that situation. Marcos also remembers that when <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> older brother was caught vaping at school, he was grounded for a long time and had to miss a few basketball games.</para>

         <emphasis>What forces are at play as Marco decides what to do?</emphasis> Marcos may notice that many of <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> peers are vaping, and he wants to fit in. That is, he holds positive social norms toward e‐cigarette use as a result of seeing his peers vaping and has positive outcome expectations of vaping (enjoying the flavors; fitting in). Further, Marcos may not yet have the confidence and capacity to refuse offers to vape in all situations. SCT refers to these feelings and beliefs as a gap in self‐efficacy and skills to resist e‐cigarette use.</para>
      <para id="ch0023s0000p0003">Marcos may also be concerned that he could lose <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> spot in the science club as a possible negative consequence of using e‐cigarettes—that is, he also has negative outcome expectations. The negative perceptions of vaping held by Marcos are not rooted in his own personal vaping experience but are, instead, a consequence of observational learning from seeing what happened to his brother as a consequence of e‐cigarette use. Marcos’ dilemma can thus be interpreted through the lens of several important Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) constructs.</para>
