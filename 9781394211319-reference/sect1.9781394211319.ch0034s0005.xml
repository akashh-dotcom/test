   <para id="ch0034s0000p0018">After becoming familiar with some contemporary theories of health behavior, the challenge is to use them within a comprehensive planning process. They should be aligned with cultural and geographical circumstances and designed using technology that aligns with what is revealed during the planning steps. Researchers and practitioners can increase the odds of success by examining health and behavior at multiple levels, as articulated in ecological models (<ulink url="ch0015">Chapter 3</ulink>).</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0019">At its simplest, an ecological perspective emphasizes two main options: change people, and/or change the environment. The most powerful approaches will use both options together. Activities most directly tied to changing<emphasis>people</emphasis> are derived from individual‐level theories like Health Belief Model, Transtheoretical Model of Change, and Reasoned Action Approach. In contrast, activities aimed at changing the <emphasis>environment</emphasis> draw on community‐level theories. In between are Social Cognitive Theory, social support, and social networks. Each of these focuses on reciprocal relations among persons or between individuals and their environments.</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0020">Theoretical frameworks are guides in the pursuit of successful efforts, maximizing flexibility and helping apply abstract concepts of theory in ways that are most useful in diverse work settings and situations. Knowledge of theory and comprehensive planning systems offers a great deal. Other key elements of effective programs are a good program‐to‐audience match; accessible and practical information; active learning and involvement; and skill building, practice, and reinforcement. Strong interventions will often but not always be built on theory, but theory alone cannot <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to effective interventions. Theory helps one ask the right questions, and effective planning enables you to zero in on these elements in relation to a specific problem. Still, theory must be turned into effective interventions, and these must be applied with fidelity and evaluated well. A lot happens between theory and behavior change. Effective use of theory for practice and research requires practice but can yield important <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10420">dividends</ulink> in efforts to enhance the health of individuals and populations. In the end, we should ask ourselves whether our work has made a difference. Developing better theories is a means to that end.</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0021">The modern field of health behavior dates back only about 80 years, and progress has accelerated most rapidly in the past 30 years. As the chapters in this book have shown, many of the early ideas of social and behavioral theorists serve as solid foundations for our work today. To accelerate progress, we should stand on the shoulders of the pioneers in the field, equip ourselves to be explorers, address today’s problems with new tools, and anticipate the challenges of the future.</para>
