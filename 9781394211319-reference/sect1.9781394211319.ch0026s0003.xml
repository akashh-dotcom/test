      <para id="ch0026s0000p0020">The relaxation response, described by Benson and Klipper (<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0018">2000</link>), is a strategy for coping that can be induced to interrupt or counteract potential adverse effects of psychological <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. Through activating physiological mechanisms of parasympathetic activity, including reduced <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> pressure, slowed respiratory rate, slowed digestion, increased <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> flow, and muscle relaxation, the body can be protected from adverse impacts of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. Repeating words, sounds, prayers, or yoga can help induce the relaxation response, which can be beneficial for immune, inflammatory, cardiovascular, respiratory, and cognitive functioning (Jacobs, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0051">2001</link>; Wallace et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0087">1971</link>).

Practices that can enhance positive emotions include meditation, writing about positive experiences, and religious or spiritual practices (Fredrickson, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0043">2003</link>, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0044">2004</link>; Van Cappellen et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0086">2016</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0026s0000p0023">The Identity Vitality‐Pathology (IVP) Model (Bey,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0022">2022</link>) is an emerging theoretical framework that links self‐concept to health through identity‐related beliefs about worth and social status which are hypothesized to influence how individuals appraise and respond to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, both physiologically and behaviorally. The model describes this set of modifiable identity beliefs that may be influential in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> appraisal and coping as an <emphasis>identity state</emphasis>, which is characterized by the ways individuals primarily conceptualize: (1) an internalized, stable identity, (2) the value of living beings, and (3) whether concepts of self‐worth are attached to external evaluations. The IVP framework builds on existing theory and evidence on the roles of inclusive identities (Cross Jr. &amp; Vandiver, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0034">2001</link>; Myers et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0068">1991</link>), loving compassion (Kahana et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0054">2021</link>; Myers et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0068">1991</link>), and inherent self‐worth in well‐being (Crocker &amp; Knight, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0033">2005</link>), positing that modulation of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> by the three factors comprising one’s identity state has direct implications for the physiological processes underlying both mental and physical health.</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0024">The IVP framework is distinct from other <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and coping frameworks relevant to health inequities in that it hypothesizes an additional source of disease risk and resilience—pathological or vitalized identity states—as a modifiable target for bringing people closer to ideal states of health Identity states, as defined by the IVP model, exist on a spectrum from “vitalized” to “pathological” which can be captured using a scale, the recently developed IVP Scale. Individuals in “vitalized” identity states are hypothesized to have a reduced likelihood of appraising a high level of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> associated with identity‐based stressors such as race or gender discrimination (<anchor id="ch0026s0000a0028"/>

      <para id="ch0026s0000p0025">On the other end of the identity state spectrum is identity pathology (distinct from the psychopathologies previously described as identity pathology by Kaufman &amp; Crowell,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0055">2018</link>). Identity pathology is a pathogenic state characterized by an identity grounded in physical traits, and the belief that a person’s worth depends on their social position. In this pathologized identity state, individuals are more likely to appraise identity‐based <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> within the social environment (such as is associated with perceived discriminatory treatment or displacement from rightfully filled positions) that triggers harmful conditioned <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> responses and exacts a physiological toll.</para>

It begins with self-concept and structural inequality, which <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to identity beliefs and chronic stressors, respectively. These feed into psychosocial traits which along with stressor appraisal, contribute to psychosocial <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. This leads to a box labeled physiological <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> response,’ which in turn leads to two outcomes: coping’ and epigenetic D N A modification. Coping is connected to an outcome labeled age-related phenotype, while epigenetic D N A modification leads to a result called biological aging profile.</para>
