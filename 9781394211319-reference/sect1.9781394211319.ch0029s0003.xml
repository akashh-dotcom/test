   <para id="ch0029s0000p0027">To achieve health equity, it is important to consider behavior change not in isolation, divorced from pre‐existing systems of oppression, like racism, and to examine not just outcomes but also the processes. Interventions to address health inequities can be conceptualized as occurring upstream, downstream, or somewhere in between. Downstream determinants occur at individual levels, including individual biology and specific risk factors and behaviors. Intervening on that level will help individuals, perhaps in a clinical context, but does not address upstream factors that drive patterns—that is, inequities—in health behaviors, outcomes, and biology. Further upstream are living conditions—which include physical residential conditions, social environments, work environments, and services—and the inequities that emerge from them.</para>
   <para id="ch0029s0000p0028">The question of why some living conditions are more prevalent in certain communities relates to racial and socioeconomic disadvantage. Often, institutional inequities in the public and private sectors, and in public policy, drive the distribution of social determinants of health. Resource allocation for the structures and space and the absence of universal access to a living wage might drive the living conditions within public housing or a correctional facility; however one has to go farther upstream to social determinants of health inequities—systems of social inequities like racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, and ablism—to see how access to resources and healthy living conditions are inequitably allocated and distributed, especially institutionally, across pre‐existing hierarchies of power. To effect sustainable change, and, specifically, sustainably drive toward health equity, it is critical to consider ways to improve communities farther upstream. Furthermore, interventions that do not get at the root of health inequities may be perceived as metaphorical Band‐Aids and/or victim‐blaming. To have a real impact on health equity, public health as a field must be committed to dismantling systems of oppression, while health professionals mitigate its impacts on individuals.</para>
   <para id="ch0029s0000p0029">Moving beyond cultural competency,<emphasis>structural competency</emphasis> “seeks to promote skills … for recognizing how ‘culture’ and ‘structure’ are mutually co‐implicated in producing stigma and inequality” (Metzl &amp; Hansen, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0042">2014</link>). This requires developing the capacity to recognize influences of structures on individual health, in clinical/programmatic encounters, in clinics and community health organizations, and beyond the clinical or interventional spaces (Neff et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0046">2017</link>). While exploring and applying the theoretical foundations underlying structural racism, similar consideration can be given to other systems of oppression, which requires further exploration and investigation. Structural competency enables health professionals to better apply health behavior change models in real‐world programs seeking to reduce health inequities. Further, structural competency requires structural humility—“not the hubris of mastery, but the humility to recognize the complexity of the structural constraints that patients, [community residents, health professionals,] and doctors operate within” and continue to learn (Metzl &amp; Hansen, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0042">2014</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0029s0000p0030">Public health experts should think beyond simple health disparities and social determinants of health to social determinants of health inequities, including concrete ways by which racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, ableism, and other differences constrain and facilitate certain behaviors and actions. Furthermore, it is increasingly important to consider how research, interventions and communications may reinforce inequitable systems, and evaluate which community voices are not being heard and incorporated into the design and implementation of health promotion interventions. Those most impacted by health inequities can offer many of the most promising ideas about systemic improvements.</para>

   <para id="ch0029s0000p0031">With that in mind, for theory‐based health‐behavior interventions to be the most effective in communities with disproportionate needs, it is important to understand the structural constraints from the standpoint of structural humility and design interventions that seek to address multiple levels, or at the very least understanding the level of behavior change within a larger structural ecology. While some interventions may be limited in scope, this focus does not negate capacity‐building for facilitating collective action and organizing for social change—within a multilevel intervention by design or in partnership with other community partners.</para>
