   <para id="ch0022s0000p0011">A related but distinct concept is<emphasis>social networks</emphasis>, whose importance has grown with burgeoning social media in contemporary life (<ulink url="ch0038">Chapter 22</ulink>). Social network theory (SNT) focuses on the structure and system‐level properties of the web of social relationships within which individuals live. Social network analysis provides tools for understanding how social contexts influence decision‐making processes and actions. In <ulink url="ch0025">Chapter 11</ulink>, Valente and Piombo define the important components of SNT and social network analysis and provide examples of how they inform health behavior interventions.</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0012">Social network analysis quantifies the extent to which members of one’s social network endorse certain attitudes or engage in specific behaviors or in other ways influence cognitions, affect, and behaviors. Research suggests that when people are considering how often an unhealthy or risky behavior (such as smoking) is being performed by their peers, they tend to overestimate prevalence. On the other hand, people tend to underestimate the extent to which healthy behaviors are being performed. Social network analysis provides information necessary for an accurate descriptive norm among network members, thus offering data to influence people’s behaviors to be more in line with the accurate—and ideally, healthy—behavioral norm (Berkowitz,<link linkend="ch0022s0000li0001">2003</link>). By mapping social networks and analyzing individuals’ positions within their networks, those who have many ties to others (are highly central network members), and those who bridge between disparate subgroups within a network can be identified and recruited to be change agents for their communities.</para>

   <para id="ch0022s0000p0013">
      <emphasis>Homophily</emphasis> is a critical concept in SNT. SNT posits that when a high proportion of network members are very similar to each other, it is difficult to effect change among network members (Valente, <link linkend="ch0022s0000li0016">2010</link>). One key finding from a recent systematic review suggests that <emphasis>selection</emphasis> of friends who are similar to themselves in health behaviors (homophily), good or bad, reinforced member behaviors (Montgomery et al., <link linkend="ch0022s0000li0011">2020</link>). Social influence, whereby friends influence each other, is another important social process within a network.</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0014">Flow of information is another critical feature of networks. A network may include those who consider themselves “health mavens” interested in sharing knowledge among their network members (Hayashi et al.,<link linkend="ch0022s0000li0006">2020</link>). Their impact on health behaviors requires more work. The role of social networks attained greater importance during the COVID‐19 pandemic with the assumption that networks influence information sharing, whether accurate or not, and that network norms may influence adoption of public health prevention behaviors like vaccination (Rabin &amp; Kohler, <link linkend="ch0022s0000li0015">2023</link>).</para>
