   <title>Overview of the Book</title>
   <anchor id="ch0008s0000a0007"/>
   <para id="ch0008s0000p0008">The chapters, written expressly for this sixth edition, address theories and models of health behavior at the level of the individual, interpersonal, group, organization, and community and approaches that are integrated across multiple levels.</para>
   <para id="ch0008s0000p0009">The book is organized into five parts. Part One defines key terms and concepts and introduces ecological models. The next three parts reflect important units of health behavior and education practice: the individual, the interpersonal or group level, and the community or aggregate level. Each of these parts begins with an introductory chapter to orient readers to the next chapters and their interrelationships, and has several chapters. Part Two covers theories of individual health behavior, and its chapters focus on variables<emphasis>within individuals</emphasis> that influence their health behavior and response to health promotion and education interventions. Three bodies of theory are reviewed in separate chapters: Health Belief Model; Theory of Reasoned Action/Theory of Planned Behavior/Integrated Behavioral Model and the Reasoned Action Approach, and The Transtheoretical Model. Part Three examines interpersonal theories, which emphasize elements in the <emphasis>interpersonal</emphasis> environment that affect individuals' health behavior. Four chapters examine Social Cognitive Theory: social support, social networks; and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and coping. Part Four covers models for the <emphasis>community or aggregate level</emphasis> of change and includes chapters on race, health, and health equity; community engagement; implementation, dissemination, and diffusion of innovations; and media communications. Part Five explores “Using Theory,” which presents the key components and applications of overarching planning and process models and integrated models and approaches to health behavior change. It includes chapters on theory‐based planning models, behavioral economics, social marketing, and social media (new for this edition).</para>
   <para id="ch0008s0000p0010">The major emphasis of this book is on the analysis and application of health behavior theories to public health and health promotion practice. The section introductory chapters in Parts Two, Three, Four and Five introduce the theories in their sections; summarize their potential application to the development of health behavior change interventions; and highlight strengths, weaknesses, gaps and areas for future development and research, and promising strategies. Each core chapter in Parts Two, Three, and Four begins with a discussion of the background of the theory or model and a presentation of the theory; reviews empirical support for it; and concludes with one or two applications.</para>
   <para id="ch0008s0000p0011">Chapter authors are established, highly regarded researchers, and practitioners who draw on their experiences in state‐of‐the‐art research to critically analyze and apply the theories to health behavior and education. This text makes otherwise lofty theories accessible and practical, and advances both research and practice in the process.</para>
   <para id="ch0008s0000p0012">No single book can be truly comprehensive and still be concise and readable. Decisions about which theories to include were made with both an appreciation of the evolution of the study of health behavior and a vision of its future (see<ulink url="ch0014">Chapter 2</ulink>). We emphasize theories and conceptual frameworks that encompass a range from the individual to the societal level. We acknowledge that there is substantial variability in the extent to which various theories and models have been codified, tested, and supported by empirical evidence. Of necessity, some promising emerging theories were not included.</para>
   <para id="ch0008s0000p0013">The first five editions of this book grew out of the editors' own experiences, frustrations, and needs as well as their desire to synthesize many literatures and to draw clearly the linkages between theory, research, and practice in health behavior and education. We have sought to show how theory, research, and practice interrelate and to make each accessible and practical. In this sixth edition, we have attempted to respond to changes in the science and practice of public health and health promotion and to update the coverage of these areas in a rapidly evolving field. Substantial efforts have been taken to present findings from health behavior change interventions based on the theories that are described and to illustrate the adaptations needed to successfully reach diverse and unique populations. Through the preceding five editions,<emphasis>Health Behavior: Theory, Research and Practice</emphasis> has become established as a widely used text and reference book.</para>

   <para id="ch0008s0000p0014">It is our sincere hope that the sixth edition will continue to be relevant and useful, and to stimulate readers’ interest in theory‐based health behavior and health education. We aspire to provide readers with the information and skills to ask critical questions, think conceptually, and stretch their thinking beyond using formulaic strategies to improve health. Ultimately, we aim to encourage users to use, test, refine, and even develop theories with the goal of improving health for people around the world and to benefit especially those populations that have suffered disproportionately from the conditions that predispose to poor health.</para>
