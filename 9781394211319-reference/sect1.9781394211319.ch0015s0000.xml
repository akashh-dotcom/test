   <para id="ch0015s0000p0017">Ecological models offer a framework for understanding the totality of the influences on health behavior (Bronfenbrenner,<link linkend="ch0015s0000li0018">1989</link>). Ecological models recognize that health behaviors are complex processes that rarely can be linked to a single defining influence. They also recognize that influences on behavior can vary considerably from behavior to behavior. Broadly, ecological models organize influences from those internal to an individual to those that are most external: intrapersonal, interpersonal, community/societal, and environmental factors can all have an impact on the behavior in question (Richard et al., <link linkend="ch0015s0000li0050">2011</link>). While there is general agreement on the basic structure of ecological models, scholars have proposed different versions of this structure that differ in some key constructs, and in their level of detail.</para>
   <para id="ch0015s0000p0018">Ecological models do not make assertions regarding specific elements within each level, nor the directionality among the levels. They also do not always specify how to measure elements at each level nor how to conduct multilevel analyses. These features introduce key aspects of ecological models: they are much more general and flexible than what we traditionally think of as fully articulated theories of health behavior.</para>
