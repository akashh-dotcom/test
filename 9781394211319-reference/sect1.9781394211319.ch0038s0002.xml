   <title>Effects of Social Media on Health</title>

   <para id="ch0038s0000p0014">The impact of social media use on health and health behavior is a topic of growing interest. To date, the research on both positive and negative impacts of social media on health and behavior is mixed and inconclusive.<anchor id="ch0038s0000a0018"/>
      <link linkend="ch0038s0000a0019">Figure 22.1</link> presents a framework of pathways through which social media, as one element of the complex information ecosystem, can influence health (physical, mental, and social) and health behaviors. As the framework shows, individuals could be exposed to social media and several other information sources at multiple levels: interpersonal, organizational, and mass media (Also see <ulink url="ch0015">Chapters 3</ulink>, <ulink url="ch0023">9</ulink>, and <ulink url="ch0025">11</ulink>). Exposure to these sources could be from naturally occurring communication processes and/or from planned communications and interventions. Effects of exposure to information sources should be seen against the backdrop of demographic characteristics and social factors. As indicated by the bidirectional vertical arrows in the figure, there can be mutual influence between routine/unplanned and planned communication processes, and individuals could be exposed to complementary or contradictory information from both processes. The framework also depicts the bidirectional nature of relationships between social media and background factors and health outcomes, as indicated by the two‐headed horizontal arrows.</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0015">This framework illustrates factors that have been used in research to examine effects of social media on health and behavior. Researchers have studied social media use for a range of health behaviors, including smoking, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink> use, diet, and sleep. Several studies have examined these questions in youth and college students; the findings are intriguing but also have important methodological limitations. A study using longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of American youth found that watching and posting tobacco‐related content on social media were associated with greater tobacco use among youth nationwide (Pérez et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0051">2022</link>). Similarly, in another study, it was reported that for adolescents, greater social media use and heavier exposure to advertisements and e‐cigarette content in social media were associated with greater risk for e‐cigarette use (Vogel et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0071">2021</link>). Further, exposure to peers’ <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink>‐related content on social media during the initial six weeks of college was found to predict <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink> consumption six months later (Boyle et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0028">2016</link>). A systematic review of literature on the link between social media use and dietary behaviors among children and adolescents found that greater social media use was associated with skipping breakfast, increased intake of unhealthy snacks and sugar‐sweetened beverages, and lower fruit and vegetable intake, in both short‐term experimental exposure studies and large cross‐sectional surveys (Sina et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0060">2022</link>). However, the experiments were limited by single outcome measures, and the cross‐sectional surveys cannot discern causal relationships.</para>

   <para id="ch0038s0000p0016">In a survey among a sample of Midwestern university students in the U.S., Lee and colleagues found positive correlations of social media use with higher levels of C‐reactive protein (a marker of chronic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3144">inflammation</ulink>), more somatic symptoms, and more visits to doctors or health centers for an illness (Lee et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0043">2022</link>). The survey could not discern whether the health issues were causes of high social media use or effects, or whether they were both a result of some other factor(s).</para>

   <para id="ch0038s0000p0017">One concern about the harmful effects of social media is articulated by the<emphasis>displacement hypothesis</emphasis>—that social media may displace health‐promoting behaviors, such as physical activities and adequate sleep. A study drawing data from a nationally representative longitudinal sample of 12,866 young people ages 13 years to 16 years in England found that very frequent social media use increased in both boys and girls as they got older. The study also showed that mental health problems were related to cyberbullying and displacement of sleep or (to a small degree) less physical activity among girls (Viner et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0066">2019</link>). The negative effects from frequent use of social media were found only among girls in this study, suggesting the moderating role of gender (Viner et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0066">2019</link>). Thus, the picture is complicated when studying how social media are associated with mental health and social well‐being outcomes.</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0018">A meta‐analysis examining the association of different dimensions of social media use found that depressive symptoms were significantly, but weakly, associated with time spent using social media and intensity of social media use. However, the association of depressive symptoms to ?span Start cssStyle="text-decoration:underline"?problematic social media use (e.g., social media use in combination with addictive symptoms) was moderate and significantly higher than for time spent or intensity of use (Cunningham et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0033">2021</link>). Another recent systematic review reported that different dimensions of social media use (time spent, type of activity, investment, and addiction) were correlated with depression, anxiety, and psychological distress (Keles et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0041">2019</link>) while also noting caveats due to methodological limitations such as of cross‐sectional design, sampling, and measures.</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0019">The question of whether and how social media use impacts health itself has also garnered attention from the public and policy makers alike. Important questions are whether social media could be categorically bad or good for health, and whether there is sufficient evidence supporting any policy intervention. As shown by<link linkend="ch0038s0000a0019">Figure 22.1</link>, the effects of social media on physical health and well‐being (emotional and social well‐being) should be seen within the complex information ecosystem. Causal relationships are complex and often bi‐directional (various health conditions leading to problematic use of social media).</para>

   <para id="ch0038s0000p0020">A narrative review of trends in studies of social media and well‐being by Kross and colleagues indicated that several experiments in recent years have found small, negative effects of social media use on well‐being (Kross et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0042">2021</link>). They acknowledge that well‐being is a complex construct, and that increasing evidence suggests that social media can either enhance or diminish health (physical, mental, and social), depending on how people use them (Kross et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0042">2021</link>). This notion is supported by data from a survey of nationally representative American adults that found routine use of social media and emotional connection with social media had divergent associations with social well‐being, positive mental health, and self‐rated health (Bekalu et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0024">2019</link>). Routine use of social media was associated positively with all three types of well‐being; while emotional connection to social media was associated negatively with all the three outcomes. This is consistent with the above‐noted Cunningham meta‐analysis that found negative impacts of problematic social media use.</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0021">In summary, the literature on the impact of social media on health is mixed and inconclusive. The notion that “social media” is a singular phenomenon and can have good or bad effects on health is overly reductionist and simplistic, and more nuanced analyses need to be interpreted within their specific contexts. A recent field experiment in the United Kingdom on the effects of social media hiatus (short breaks from social media commonly known as “digital detoxing”) on well‐being did not find any positive effects (Przybylski et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0056">2021</link>). In addition, while a systematic review of reviews found that misinformation can negatively affect mental health (Borges Do Nascimento et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0027">2022</link>), eight of 31 reviews in that study also reported <emphasis>positive</emphasis> health outcomes, some finding that several social media platforms generated significantly improved knowledge and awareness, higher compliance with health recommendations, and more positive health‐related behaviors among users of social media compared to other conventional information dissemination tools.</para>
