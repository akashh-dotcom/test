      <para id="ch0031s0000p0019">Diffusion of Innovations theory focuses on the social processes by which an innovation is communicated through specific channels and among members of a social system over time. An innovation can be an idea, practice, product, or program that actors in a system perceive as new (Rogers,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0091">2002</link>). Diffusion of Innovations is one of the most widely used theories to describe, understand, and accelerate the spread of innovations through a system and has been applied and studied internationally for more than 50 years.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0020">Everett Rogers, trained as a rural sociologist, developed the theory while studying the adoption of a new type of seed in a network of farmers. Many early studies applying this theory assessed the role of change agents and characteristics of innovations and social networks that accelerated adoption. Diffusion concepts that first originated in agriculture have spread to other fields, including health, business, communications, and education. It has had a major impact on health research and has evolved from a theory focused on learning about naturalistic diffusion to a foundation for the practice and study of dissemination (Dearing, 2009).</para>

      <anchor id="ch0031s0000a0022"/>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0021">At its core, the theory was developed to examine how innovation is communicated through a specific social system, over time, and via distinct channels (Dearing,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0043">2008</link>; Dearing &amp; Cox, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0045">2018</link>; Estabrooks et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0049">2018</link>; Rogers, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0092">2003</link>). There are three main stages in the diffusion process: (1) adoption (deciding to take up the innovation), (2) implementation (putting the innovation to use), and (3) institutionalization (long‐term integration of the innovation in practice). A key premise of Diffusion of Innovations is that some innovations spread quickly and widely, following an S‐shaped curve, with slow initial adoption that increases rapidly and then hits a ceiling.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0022">Also, innovations are adopted at different rates by different individuals, groups, and organizations. Potential adopters are categorized based on the speed with which they adopt<emphasis>the specific innovation</emphasis>. First, are the “innovators,” individuals who are willing to adopt the innovation even if it has not become common in their social system. The second group includes “early adopters,” some of whom serve as influential opinion leaders in their social systems. They have weighed the advantages and disadvantages of the innovation and decided to adopt. The third and fourth groups are the “early majority” and “late majority,” respectively, who feel social pressure to adopt the innovation, and may be influenced by early adopters. The final group is labeled “laggards”; they take the longest to adopt and are not compelled by social pressures or norms to take action. This category has sometimes been criticized for not considering that social structural conditions, and not the person or group, may explain the slowness in adopting an innovation. Also, the “laggard” label does not describe people who may appear to be slow to adopt an innovation but are in fact actively opposed to taking action, such as the example of “vaccine deniers.”</para>

      <para id="ch0031s0000p0023">Diffusion of Innovations has been cited more than 50,000 times over the past 50‐plus years (Tabak et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0101">2012</link>) and has one of the most extensive histories of both conceptual and historical study among social science theories (Dearing, 2009). Several recent reviews (Green et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0056">2009</link>; Greenhalgh et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0057">2004</link>, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0058">2005</link>; Haider &amp; Kreps, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0060">2004</link>) and syntheses (Dearing &amp; Cox, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0045">2018</link>) have quantified the evidence in support of the theory and tracked the evolution of its applications over time.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0024">Perhaps the most comprehensive review of concepts from Diffusion of Innovations theory is found in a “meta‐narrative review” of 495 sources (a mix of empirical and nonempirical studies) conducted by Greenhalgh and colleagues (Greenhalgh et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0057">2004</link>, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0058">2005</link>). Synthesis of the evidence on this theory across four major disciplines (rural sociology, medical sociology, communications, marketing) largely reinforces the effectiveness and important roles of the attributes in <anchor id="ch0031s0000a0025"/>
         <link linkend="ch0031s0000a0027">Table 16.2</link>. The Greenhalgh review focuses on the uses and usefulness of Diffusion of Innovations to the organizational and management literature (Greenhalgh et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0057">2004</link>) and provides some important insights. First, organizational innovativeness is primarily influenced by structural determinants (e.g., internal division of labor, specialization of the organization). Second, the spread of innovations within and across organizations is strongly influenced by intra‐ and interorganizational norms. Third, organizations that strongly support on‐the‐job learning are often more effective in spreading innovations due to their values and goals of supporting the creation and sharing of new knowledge. Fourth, innovative organizations are often those in which new stories can be told that capture and support the idea of “communities of practice” (groups that share a common purpose and interact regularly to improve their practice). And fifth, organizations are complex, and effective diffusion addresses this complexity while maintaining an ability to adapt to change.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0025">Several limitations of Diffusion of Innovations have been identified (Greenhalgh et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0057">2004</link>; Oldenburg &amp; Glanz, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0081">2008</link>). These include a major focus on the individual innovation and adopters (perhaps downplaying systems effects), an inherent pro‐innovation bias, and the lack of transferability of diffusion research principles from one setting or context to others. Dissemination and implementation science frameworks generally focus on transfer of EBIs, whereas Diffusion of Innovations Theory may examine innovations that are or are not evidence‐based. In fact, in some settings, the rapid spread of unproven, even harmful, medical treatments and preventive strategies is of great concern, as occurred with some COVID‐19 treatments. Even so, understanding how unproven innovations spread can make important contributions to public health science (see <ulink url="ch0032">Chapter 17</ulink> for more on communication of misinformation).</para>

      <para id="ch0031s0000p0026">Applications of Diffusion of Innovations in recent health behavior and public health research are noteworthy in their focus on<emphasis>active</emphasis> dissemination. In the physical activity field, the SPARK (Sports, Play, and Active Recreation for Kids) and CATCH (Coordinated Approach to Child Health) programs for school‐based physical education have been disseminated widely, using some of the core constructs of Diffusion of Innovations to describe dissemination and implementation efforts (Owen et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0082">2006</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0027">Body and Soul, a nutrition intervention to increase fruit and vegetable intake and conducted through African‐American churches, was disseminated broadly through a partnership with the American <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">Cancer</ulink> Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">Cancer</ulink> Institute, and was rigorously evaluated (Campbell et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0031">2007</link>). It was particularly important that major organizations with responsibility for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> control collaborated in creating and deploying the dissemination version of the effective nutrition program in the first‐generation dissemination. A later study evaluated the results of disseminating Body and Soul without researcher or agency involvement, and found the intervention to be no more effective than a control group (Allicock et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0020">2012</link>). The latter findings were somewhat disappointing but underscored the need for both strong partnerships and ongoing evaluation of widely disseminated interventions.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0000p0028">In the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> control field, the Pool Cool sun‐safety program for aquatic settings is an example of a health‐behavior‐change program that progressed from an efficacy trial to a dissemination‐implementation trial conducted in more than 400 pools in 33 metropolitan areas in the United States and Okinawa (Brownson et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0028">2015</link>; Glanz et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0051">2005</link>, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0052">2015</link>). The Pool Cool Diffusion Trial evaluated the effects of two strategies on implementation, maintenance, and sustainability, and improvements in organizational and environmental supports for sun protection. The enhanced dissemination strategy, which provided additional resources along with goals and rewards for documenting greater implementation, resulted in greater maintenance of the program and significantly greater sun‐safety policies over time (Glanz et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0052">2015</link>). The Pool Cool program was sustained long‐term beyond the end of the dissemination‐implementation trial with support from state health departments, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> agencies, and the CDC. One of the largest and longest‐lasting examples of sustainable implementation of Pool Cool is in Kansas, where the Masonic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">Cancer</ulink> Alliance has partnered with aquatic councils and swimming pools—training over 4,400 aquatic staff members from 70 different swimming pool sites between 2014 and 2022 (National <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">Cancer</ulink> Institute, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0076">2023</link>). This illustrates how an effective, easily used intervention blended with a train‐the‐trainer model and many examples of successful partnerships aligns with Diffusion of Innovation concepts to achieve broad adoption and long‐term sustainability.</para>
