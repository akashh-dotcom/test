         <emphasis>A Day in the Life of Sophie and Sofia</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0002">Sophie and Sofia have never met but have many things in common. They are both 26‐year‐old, working‐class, single women living in big, bustling cities: Sophie in Houston, United States and Sofia in Mexico City, Mexico. Both are relatively healthy and work in an office. The vignettes below describe their daily routines.</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0003">
         <emphasis>Sophie</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0004">Sophie’s alarm clock goes off at 7 a.m. She lives in a single‐family home in East Houston, with two roommates. The home is not too big but is on a quiet street and has a small yard where her dog can play. Upon waking, Sophie lets her dog into the yard and has a quick <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=622">bite</ulink> and some coffee while getting ready for work. Because it would take her over one hour to walk to the nearest light‐rail stop that can get her to her job downtown, and most streets in her area do not have sidewalks or shade, using public transit is not feasible. A few years ago, she saved enough money to buy a used but reliable car that gets her everywhere.</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0005">Sophie leaves her home no later than 7:50 a.m. since traffic can be bad in Houston, and it takes her about one hour to get to work, which starts at 9 a.m. Once she finds a good parking spot, she walks about five minutes to reach the entrance of her building and takes the elevator up to the 12<superscript>th</superscript> floor where her cubicle is located. She spends her day on her computer, taking video conference calls and a few in‐person meetings on the same floor. Her floor does not have a kitchen. So, when it’s time for lunch, she warms up her food from home in the microwave oven on the 10<superscript>th</superscript> floor. She usually takes the elevator to the 10<superscript>th</superscript> floor, but if it is taking too long, she walks down the hall and takes the stairs two floors down. She usually eats lunch in the common dining area with other administrative assistants who work there too. On busy workdays, she brings her warm dish back to her cubicle and eats while catching up on email.</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0006">Work usually ends by 5:30 p.m. The drive back home is about an hour long, due to traffic. Once home, she takes her dog out on a long walk, which usually involves a stop at the nearby neighborhood park that has a nice off‐leash area where her dog loves to run, and where Sophie enjoys the fresh air. About 45–60 minutes later, they come back home, and Sophie prepares dinner. Depending on the day of the week, she eats with her roommates, or alone while watching her favorite Netflix show. After dinner, she catches up on chores or calls her parents, who live in Arizona. Later in the evening, at around 9:30 p.m., she takes her dog on a quick 10‐minute stroll and calls it a night.</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0007">Sometimes, Sophie feels lonely and wishes she lived closer to family, but she has already invested in her career in Houston and would find it hard to start over in a different place.</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0008">
         <emphasis>Sofia</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0009">Sofia’s alarm clock goes off at 5:30 a.m. She lives in Northeastern Mexico City with her parents and three siblings—in the same home where they all grew up, which is in the neighborhood where her entire extended family has always lived. Her job starts at 8 a.m. and is in a central business district. Sofia takes a quick shower, and leaves no later than 6 a.m. after her mom routinely reminds her to be careful to avoid certain routes that are known to be unsafe for women walking alone when it is still dark outside.</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0010">Sofia walks about 15 minutes to a busy intersection located along the path of the “feeder bus system” (small buses that make frequent stops anywhere along their route, connecting riders to more structured mass transit systems in the city). Conveniently, a<emphasis>tamales</emphasis> and <emphasis>atole</emphasis> (a hot sweet beverage) stall is located there. So, she buys breakfast while waiting for the bus. About five minutes later, Sofia is on the bus, which at this hour is still quite empty, although it soon fills up with people of all ages (including many children with their parents heading to school). Forty‐five minutes later, she gets off and walks about 10 minutes to reach a Metro (subway) station. Fortunately, virtually all roads in Mexico City have sidewalks (although some are full of cracks or are very narrow), but at least they keep people separated from traffic—this is nice in a city where about 2/3 of all daily trips are not done by car! Once at the Metro station, she waits less than six minutes to board a train. She must be very careful at this point, as the trains are crowded, and sometimes, the front wagons, which are officially reserved for women and children (as a safe environment), are already full at this hour. Pickpocketing and sexual harassment are, unfortunately, very common in crowded city trains and buses. About 20 minutes later, Sofia gets off at a station in the business district where she works.</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0011">Now, there is an<emphasis>EcoBici</emphasis> station right outside of the Metro stop. <emphasis>EcoBici</emphasis> is an inexpensive, city‐run bicycle‐sharing program. Sofia became an <emphasis>EcoBici</emphasis> user when she realized how convenient it was in helping her travel the last portion of her commute, with a short, 10‐minute bike ride. The business district where she works has invested a lot in building protected bicycle lanes, so she feels safe. There is an <emphasis>EcoBici</emphasis> docking station less than a three‐minute walk from her work, so it is perfect!</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0012">Once she gets to work, at around 7:45–8 a.m., she takes the stairs to the third floor, and greets her co‐workers, who are all close friends after more than three years on the job together. They are all preparing a warm pot of coffee to kick off the workday. She then gets to her workstation, answers emails, and works the phone all morning. At around noon, the administrative staff, including Sofia, usually take a quick coffee break while walking around the block, or head to a nearby public square, to get some fresh air and stretch their legs. Later, at about 2 p.m., they all walk together to one of the many<emphasis>fondas</emphasis> (affordable, prix‐fix local diners offering home‐cooked, three‐course menus) in the area. There, they eat lunch together (lunch in Mexico happens at around this time and is the main meal of the day).</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0013">At about 7 p.m., Sofia leaves her office and starts heading back home. She gets home between 8:30 and 9 p.m., and helps her mother and siblings prepare dinner. Her father arrives shortly after, and they all eat together. At around 10:30 p.m., she goes to bed.</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0014">Sometimes, Sofia wishes she could afford a car to avoid the long commute via multimodal public transit. She even considers moving closer to work. However, living near her work would be very expensive, and she would miss her family. Also, buying and maintaining a car is very expensive in Mexico City. She would like to have a dog one day, too, but worries about not having enough time to take care of one during the week.</para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0015">
         <emphasis>Contextual Differences and Health</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para id="ch0015s0000p0016">The stories of Sophie and Sofia help underscore<emphasis>contextual differences</emphasis> across settings (Houston, Texas, United States, and Mexico City, Mexico), operating at <emphasis>multiple ecological levels</emphasis>, including family life, social norms, work‐life culture, and built environments. Although at first glance, Sophie and Sofia may appear to be similar <emphasis>individuals</emphasis>, their day‐to‐day routines tell a different story about their <emphasis>interpersonal</emphasis> (e.g., family), <emphasis>organizational</emphasis> (e.g., worksite), <emphasis>social</emphasis> (e.g., crime in their neighborhood), and <emphasis>built</emphasis> (e.g., transit infrastructure) <emphasis>environments</emphasis>. These different environments help explain some of the differences between them in physical activity, sleep, mental health, and overall quality of life.</para>
