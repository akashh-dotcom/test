   <title>Applications of PHCRP and CRT to Public Health</title>

   <para id="ch0029s0000p0024">This section discusses two applications that use PHCRP and CRT to address health disparities.</para>
   <para id="ch0029s0000p0025">At a 793‐bed academic medical center in Boston, MA, PHCRP was used to design a quality improvement (QI) intervention aimed at eliminating disparities in quality of care for patients with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2608">congestive heart failure</ulink> (Osuagwu et al.,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0048">2023</link>). Black and Latinx patients with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2608">congestive heart failure</ulink> were less likely to be admitted for diagnosis‐indicated specialty care (cardiology service vs. general medicine service) compared to white patients, resulting in comparatively poor rates of cardiology follow‐up and higher 30‐day readmission rates. The initiative explicitly drew upon PHCRP to engage QI teams and other key <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink> in design of the QI intervention. The intervention included but was not limited to enhanced nurse education, social work consultation for patients, electronic referrals for cardiology follow‐up, and templates for progress notes including criteria for cardiology consultation, guideline‐directed therapy, and guideline‐concordant discharge documentation in the electronic health record. While the sample size was smaller than anticipated and therefore not disaggregated, there was a significant improvement in 30‐day readmission rates (post: 19.0% versus pre: 24.8%, <emphasis>p</emphasis> = 0.024) and scheduling 14‐ and 30‐day post‐discharge cardiology appointments among chronic heart failure patients admitted to general medicine service (Osuagwu et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0048">2023</link>). The authors argued that the inclusion of “racism‐conscious framework” in typical QI approaches is feasible.</para>

   <para id="ch0029s0000p0026">Another application of PHCRP focused on identifying the root causes of excessive use of force by police among Black men, offering an alternative framework by which to interpret the research focused on their criminalization, justifications for over‐surveillance of segregated Black communities, the reification of stereotypes of violence‐prone Black neighborhoods, and the continued disinvestment in Black communities (Gilbert &amp; Ray,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0029">2016</link>). This application not only identifies different lines of empirical inquiry and intervention but also suggests a direction for community mobilization and intervention. The PHCRP is one empirical model/approach for systematically investigating the macro‐level structural determinants that are often loosely discussed or ignored in commonly used health behavior models. As PHCRP continues to be utilized, there may be further empirical support for this conceptual and methodological orientation.</para>
