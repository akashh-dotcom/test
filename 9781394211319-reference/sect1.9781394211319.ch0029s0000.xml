      <para id="ch0029s0000p0007">In public health, health behavior, and health promotion, it is often assumed that there is a common understanding of what race is and is not. For example, health professionals often reference racial and ethnic disparities in health—“preventable differences [by race and ethnicity] in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal health that are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations” (Division of Population Health, National Center for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">Chronic Disease</ulink> Prevention and Health Promotion,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0018">2017</link>). Across many measures of health status, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander people fare worse than their white counterparts (Mahajan et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0039">2021</link>; Zimmerman &amp; Anderson, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0066">2019</link>). In 2019, Black people in the United States had a life expectancy of four years less than non‐Hispanic/Latinx white people, with the lowest life expectancy among Black men. By 2021, during the second year of the COVID‐19 pandemic, these disparities had widened; Black people’s life expectancy was 5.6 fewer years than non‐Hispanic/Latinx white people (Arias et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0006">2022</link>). Similarly, non‐Hispanic/Latinx American Indian and Alaska Native people were expected to live seven fewer years than their white counterparts in 2019 and 11.2 fewer years than their white counterparts in 2021 (Arias et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0006">2022</link>). However, these numbers do not explain structural factors driving these disparities.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s0000p0008">Rooted in sociological theory, concepts of race and racism are inextricably linked (Bonilla‐Silva,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0009">1997</link>; Feagin, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0022">2006</link>; Omi &amp; Winant, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0047">1994</link>; Smedley &amp; Smedley, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0057">2005</link>). Fundamentally, race is a social construct whose meaning stems from complex historical and contemporary social ideology, whereby people are categorized by physical appearance, skin color, and (real or perceived) ancestry based on society‐specific and time‐specific contexts. The conceptualization of race as a social construct developed over time. In the United States, for instance, the concept of race has evolved from the settler‐colonial origins of the nation—“othering” by way of genocide and slavery. However, historians contend that the inferior social status that came to be associated with African ancestry was not a given, but “a deliberate choice the English elites came to over time” (Kauanui, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0034">2017</link>; Morgan, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0043">1975</link>; Wolfe, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0065">2016</link>). For instance, in early 17<superscript>th</superscript>‐century colonial Virginia, many Africans were sold into forced indentured servitude alongside poor European immigrants, bound by specific contracts rather than legalized slavery (Kauanui, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0034">2017</link>; Morgan, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0043">1975</link>; Takaki, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0059">2008</link>). Between 1619 (when the first Africans were forced onto American land) and 1661, Africans lived in Virginia without laws legalizing chattel slavery, and there is historical record of free Africans who owned property (Kauanui, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0034">2017</link>; Takaki, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0059">2008</link>). However, the construction and evolution of racial meaning—racialization—quickly began to be legally and administratively codified to reflect historical social dynamics, including labor organizing and threats of insurrection (e.g., social dynamics leading to Bacon’s Rebellion). The 1660s ushered in a period of codification of race‐based chattel slavery in Virginia, with a law defining enslaved African people as property (Kauanui, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0034">2017</link>; Takaki, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0059">2008</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0009">Through racialization over time—“the extension of racial meaning to … previously racially unclassified relationship[s], social practice[s], or group[s],” cultural, historical, ideological, geographic, and legal influences—primarily racist influences—have driven the importance ascribed to phenotypic and genetic characteristics (Omi &amp; Winant,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0047">1994</link>). Race derives its meaning through the differentiation of groups rather than any intrinsic, precise measure of characteristics associated with any one group (Gonzalez‐Sobrino &amp; Goss, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0030">2019</link>; Omi &amp; Winant, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0047">1994</link>; Smedley &amp; Smedley, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0057">2005</link>). In fact, there are more genetic differences within races (or geographic ancestral groups) than across races (or geographic ancestral groups) (Duello et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0021">2021</link>; Sirugo et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0056">2021</link>). In short, race is a symbol or marker of processes of racialization and racism. In the words of Ta‐Nehisi Coates, “race is the child of racism, not the father” (Coates, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0013">2015</link>). Race and racism have essential implications for the distribution of biological mechanisms, psychosocial mechanisms, health behaviors, and health outcomes. In fact, when racial/ethnic disparities in health are considered, discussions of race must be grounded in society‐ and time‐specific experiences of racism on multiple levels.</para>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of Race and Racism</title>

      <anchor id="ch0029s0000a0009"/>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0010">Much of the theory surrounding race and racism stems from a sociological tradition, including Michael Omi and Howard Winant’s racial formation theory (Omi &amp; Winant,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0047">1994</link>), Joe Feagin’s systemic racism (Feagin, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0022">2006</link>), and Bonilla‐Silva’s racialized social systems (Bonilla‐Silva, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0009">1997</link>). Racism is not a collection of isolated acts. On the contrary, it is “an organized social system in which the dominant racial group, based on an ideology of inferiority, categorizes and ranks people into social groups called ‘races’ and uses its power to devalue, disempower, and differentially allocate valued societal resources and opportunities to groups defined as inferior” (Williams et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0063">2019</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0011">Eduardo Bonilla‐Silva’s theory of the racialized social system emphasizes a structural approach to racism that has a historical progression with key starting points and evolutions over time and over different geographies (Bonilla‐Silva,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0009">1997</link>; National Academy, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0044">2022</link>). Racism is not static over time and does not operate in the same ways in different places. Most obviously, racism across different racialized societies may operate through different institutions and different material implications across different groups. For example. the so‐called “one‐drop rule”—the classification of anyone with even one Black ancestor as “Black”—operating in the United States through much of its history can be contrasted with colorism and (unfounded) ideologies of racial democracy that often influence racial hierarchies in Latin American societies, like Brazil and Cuba, where racial identities and conflict have been downplayed in favor of a broader national identity (Burdick, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0012">1992</link>; de la Fuente, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0028">1999</link>; Hickman, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0031">1997</link>; Hollinger, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0032">2005</link>; Peña et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0050">2004</link>; Winant, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0064">1999</link>). However, racism—particularly, the structural components of racism—can occur differently in distinct local contexts. For example, Black‐white racism has been experienced strongly across the United States, with Southeastern states legally enforcing the structural racism of Jim Crow (Fredrickson, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0027">2015</link>; Packard, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0049">2003</link>), more operationally similar to South African apartheid (Maylam, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0041">2017</link>), while other states imposed racism in other ways (e.g., restrictive covenants, residential markets) (Jones‐Correa, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0033">2000</link>; Rothstein, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0054">2017</link>).</para>
      <anchor id="ch0029s0000a0010"/>
      <beginpage pagenum="177"/>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0012">Structural racism can be defined as “the totality of ways in which societies foster racial and ethnic discrimination, via mutually reinforcing inequitable systems […] that in turn reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values, and distribution of resources,” also described as “über discrimination” by Barbara Reskin and as “systemic racism” by Joe Feagin (Bailey et al.,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0007">2017</link>; Feagin, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0022">2006</link>; Reskin, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0053">2012</link>). Structural racism reinforces discriminatory beliefs, including—perhaps most destructively on an organizational or systemic level—the normalization and legitimization of adverse outcomes for people of color, resulting in the color‐blind enforcement of a racialized social system, even by seemingly “innocent” or “colorblind” actors (Bailey et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0007">2017</link>; Bonilla‐Silva, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0009">1997</link>). Focusing more narrowly on individual or interpersonal experiences of racism negates the broader impact of structural racism, which constrains and facilitates health behavior.</para>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0013">Ecosocial theory is a health‐equity‐focused population‐level approach that comprehensively assesses the relationship between discrimination and health. First proposed by Nancy Krieger in 1994, the theory describes and explains causal relationships in disease distribution, namely development of health inequities (Krieger,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0035">2012</link>). One of its key concepts is that material and social conditions are embodied biologically to produce inequities in health. This embodiment occurs through key pathways, including economic and social deprivation, exposure to environmental toxins, inadequate healthcare, targeted marketing of harmful substances and practices, and forced migration. Harmful exposures are cumulative, synergistic, and continually interact with individual susceptibility and resistance across the life course and generations. Furthermore, this approach emphasizes the role of accountability and agency, that is, the concept that we can and should act to disrupt inequitable systems (<anchor id="ch0029s0000a0011"/>
         <link linkend="ch0029s0000a0014">Table 14.1</link>). While potential policy and system changes might be based on these analyses, it is important to note that Ecosocial Theory is not intended as a foundation for intervention development.</para>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0014">Critical Race Theory (CRT) and the associated Public Health Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP) provide foundational theoretical bases for considering race and racism in the study of racial/ethnic inequities. CRT, originally developed in the legal field, primarily by scholars of color, drew attention to the practices and cultures that embed racism in institutions, laws and structures (Bell,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0008">1995</link>; Crenshaw &amp; Gotanda, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0015">1995</link>; Delgado &amp; Stefancic, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0017">2005</link>; Lawrence III, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0038">1995</link>; Matsuda, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0040">2018</link>; Taylor, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0060">1998</link>; Williams, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0062">1991</link>). The PHCRP, drawn from CRT, is focused on answering two main questions: (1) How is racialization relevant to the problem? and (2) How is racialization relevant to the production of knowledge about the problem? (Ford, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0024">2016</link>; Ford and Airhihenbuwa, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0025">2010a</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0015">The PHCRP is based on four focus areas (<anchor id="ch0029s0000a0012"/>
         <link linkend="ch0029s0000a0015">Table 14.2</link>): contemporary patterns of racial relations, knowledge production, conceptualization and measurement, and action. It also espouses 10 major principles: race consciousness; primacy of racialization; race as a social construct; ordinariness of racism; structural determinism; social construction of knowledge; critical approaches; intersectionality; disciplinary self‐critique; and voice (Ford &amp; Airhihenbuwa, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0025">2010a</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0026">b</link>) (see <link linkend="ch0029s0000a0015">Table 14.2</link>). Given the comprehensive nature of the framework, the applications of PHCRP in empirical work vary widely but are most often used to design, analyze, and interpret observational research, and not to design interventions. Two such applications are discussed at the end of the chapter.</para>
