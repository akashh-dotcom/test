   <title>Theory, Research, and Practice: Interrelationships</title>

   <para id="ch0014s0000p0001">In the period around 320–380 BCE, the Greek philosopher Aristotle distinguished between<emphasis>theoria</emphasis> and <emphasis>praxis. Theoria</emphasis> signifies those sciences and activities concerned with knowing for its own sake, while <emphasis>praxis</emphasis> corresponds to action or doing. This contrast between theory and practice (Bernstein, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0041">1971</link>) permeates Western philosophical and scientific thought from Aristotle to Karl Marx (major work around 1867) and on to John Dewey (groundbreaking essays early 1900s) and other contemporary 20<superscript>th</superscript>‐century philosophers. Theory and practice often were regarded as irreconcilable opposites. Within academic departments, there is often a hierarchical split between those who conduct theoretical work and those who pursue practice. Dewey attempted to resolve the dichotomy by focusing on similarities and continuities between theoretical and practical judgments and inquiries. Dewey described empirical investigation, that is, research, as the bridge between theory and practice and the testing of theory in action.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0002">The editors of this book follow Dewey’s tradition and focus on the similarities and continuities of theory and practice rather than on differences. Theory, research, and practice are a continuum along which the skilled professional should move with ease. Not only are they related but they are each essential to understanding health behavior and health behavior change. The best theory is informed by practice; the strongest practice should be grounded in theory. There is too little of both in health behavior. As Green (<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0063">2006</link>) wrote compellingly, there is a need for more practice‐based evidence. Researchers and practitioners may differ in their priorities, but the relationship between research and its application can and should move in both directions. The world needs more “reflective practitioners,” who can ensure that theories and practice build on each other (Schön, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0090">1983</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0003">Among the most important challenges is to understand health behavior and to transform knowledge about behavior into effective strategies for health enhancement. Research in health behavior will be judged by its contributions to improving the health of populations. The authors of this book examine theories in terms of their application. By including an explanation of theories and their applications in each chapter, we aim to dispel the dichotomy between theory and practice.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0004">Relationships between theory, research, and practice are not simple or linear. The larger picture of health improvement and disease reduction is a cycle of interacting types of endeavors, including fundamental or basic research (research into determinants and development of methods), intervention research (research aimed at change), surveillance research (tracking population‐wide trends, including maintenance of behavior changes), and application and program delivery, including what will be discussed later in this book as implementation (Hiatt &amp; Rimer,<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0066">1999</link>). At the heart of this cycle is knowledge synthesis. Regularly updated critical appraisals of the available literature are central to identifying interventions that should be disseminated and implemented to reduce the burden of disease (Rimer et al., <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0086">2001</link>; Tricco et al., <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0098">2011</link>). The use of evidence‐based health behavior interventions is essential to improving population health at scale.</para>

   <para id="ch0014s0000p0005">This sixth edition of<emphasis>Health Behavior: Theory, Research and Practice</emphasis> aims to help healthcare providers, public health professionals, and behavior change experts and educators—whatever their backgrounds or disciplines—understand some of the most important theoretical underpinnings of health behaviors and use theory to inform research and practice. Editors of this volume believe that “there is nothing so useful as a good theory” (Lewin, <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0074">1935</link>). Each chapter demonstrates the practical value of theory, summarizes what was learned through conceptually sound research and practice, and draws linkages between theory, research, and practice. Chapter authors, writing based on their own impressive experiences, aim to provide readers with real‐world cases in which a specific theory was used to understand and/or change behaviors.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0006">Professionals charged with responsibility for improving health behavior are generally interventionists. They are action‐oriented. They use their knowledge to design and implement programs to improve health. Design of interventions that yield desirable changes can be improved when it is done with an understanding of behavior change theories and an ability to use them skillfully in research and practice (Glanz &amp; Bishop,<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0054">2010</link>). Most public health educators, managers, and behavior change clinicians work in resource‐constrained settings. This makes it essential that they reach evidence‐based judgments about the choice of interventions, to achieve <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10423">efficiency</ulink> and effectiveness. There may be no second chances to reach a critical target audience. It may be about life and death.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0007">A synthesis of theory, research, and practice will advance what is known about health behavior (Michie et al.,<link linkend="ch0014s0000li0081">2013</link>). The professional who understands theory and research can comprehend the “why,” and design and craft well‐tailored interventions. In health behavior, the circumstances include the nature of the target audience, setting, resources, goals, and constraints (Bartholomew et al., <link linkend="ch0014s0000li0040">2006</link>). As <ulink url="ch0035">Chapter 19</ulink> shows, there are good planning models to help professionals and communities decide on which problems and variables to focus on and help them understand key elements of the background situation.</para>
   <para id="ch0014s0000p0008">The health professional in a community clinic who understands how to use the Transtheoretical Model or Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) may design better interventions to help patients lose weight or stop smoking. The community health educator who understands principles of social marketing and media communication can make better use of relevant tools than one who does not. The nurse, who recognizes that observational learning is important to how people learn, as postulated in SCT, may do a better job of teaching people with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> how to administer their injections. A working knowledge of community organizations can help the educator identify and mobilize key individuals and groups to develop or maintain a health promotion program. A physician who understands interpersonal influence can communicate more effectively with patients. The health psychologist who understands the Transtheoretical Model of change will know how to design better smoking cessation and exercise interventions and how to tailor them to the needs of patients.</para>
