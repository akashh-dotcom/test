   <title>Historical Overview of Stress and Coping Research</title>

   <para id="ch0026s0000p0005">The definition of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> is conceptually complex. The term “<emphasis>stress</emphasis>” has been referred to as a stimulus, a response, and an interaction (Brannon &amp; Feist, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0025">2004</link>). As early as 1950, Hans Selye described what he referred to as the “General Adaptation <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5801">Syndrome</ulink>” or GAS. Selye later updated this description, referring to it as the “<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> response.” Selye introduced the terms “distress” and “eustress” to describe negative and positive <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, respectively (Selye, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0076">1950</link>). Considered one of the foundational, modern‐day frameworks for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and coping, GAS developed in three stages: (1) alarm reaction; (2) stage of resistance; and (3) stage of exhaustion. As a physician and a chemist, Selye’s pioneering research and description of biological <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> focused on the physiologic characteristics of the alarm‐reaction stage and the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐reactive processes of both defense and damage, including actions of the nervous, hormonal, and adrenal systems leading to catabolism of tissue, gastrointestinal disruptions, adrenal cortex secretory discharge, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3040">hypoglycemia</ulink>, and the work the body endured to maintain what French physiologist Claude Bernard described as <emphasis>milieu interior</emphasis> (Bernard, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0020">1974</link>; Holmes, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0049">1986</link>). Implications for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related health conditions were described, including (but not limited to) vascular damage, inflammatory and immune dysfunction, as well as cardiac, kidney, renal, and lymphatic dysfunction. Selye dedicated <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> research career to integrating American physiologist Walter Cannon’s previously articulated concepts of “homeostasis” and “fight‐or‐flight” (coined as early as 1915) (Cannon, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0029">1941</link>) to “better understand life and the treatment of disease” (Selye, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0076">1950</link>, p. 1). Selye identified what we now refer to as the hypothalamic‐<ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pituitary">pituitary</ulink> axis system, and “diseases of adaptation,” including rheumatoid <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=454">arthritis</ulink>, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3007">allergies</ulink>, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1444">dermatitis</ulink>, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink>, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3616">lupus</ulink> erythematosus, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=203">alcoholism</ulink>, and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3015">hypertension</ulink>. Selye identified the challenges of chronic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> in limiting adaptability to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>.</para>
   <para id="ch0026s0000p0006">The social sciences were not included in Selye’s list of necessary multidisciplinary fields needed to understand <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and disease, although they are prominent in present‐day understanding of social determinants of health, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, and coping. Yet, Selye wisely contextualized <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> initial definition of GAS by proclaiming it would take years, if not generations, to comprehensively understand the concepts of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and adaptation. He also declared that <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> preliminary conceptualization was knowingly incomplete and perhaps even incorrect, but it was an attempt to begin the important operationalization of the influence of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, adaptive processes, and disease states. The term “<emphasis>stressor</emphasis>” refers to the environmental demand, event, threat, or stimulus to which an individual is exposed. The term “<emphasis>distress</emphasis>” refers to an adverse state evidenced by physical or psychological symptoms, including tension, worry, weakness, or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2569">headaches</ulink>, influenced by exposure to environmental demands in the context of inadequate resources (Dohrenwend &amp; Dohrenwend, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0036">1974</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0026s0000p0007">Another influential stream of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> research in the 1960s and 1970s focused on identifying and quantifying potential stressors or stressful life events. Holmes &amp; Rahe (<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0050">1967</link>) developed the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS), a tool to measure stressful life events to understand how they might cause illness. Studies showed that people with high scores on the SRRS had more illness episodes than those with low scores. This scale stimulated a substantial body of research that continues to the present day. Selye and psychiatrists Holmes and Rahe were oriented primarily toward understanding biological mechanisms of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and adaptation and how <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> influences illness.</para>
