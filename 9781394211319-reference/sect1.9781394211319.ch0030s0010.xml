      <para id="ch0030s0000p0001">African Americans make up nearly half of all new human immunodeficiency <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9711">virus</ulink> (<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>) cases in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0023">2021</link>). Many go too long living with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> before being diagnosed and treated because of stigma, discrimination, and homophobia. Not getting <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> treatment when needed increases their chances of developing acquired immunodeficiency <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5801">syndrome</ulink> (<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=66">AIDS</ulink>) and lowers their chances of survival. Yet, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> can be prevented with behavior change (e.g., condom use) and effectively treated with antiretroviral therapy.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0002">To improve <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> awareness and screening among African Americans,<emphasis>Taking It to the Pews</emphasis> (TIPS) was launched in 2007 (Berkley‐Patton et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0018">2013</link>) as a community‐based participatory research (CBPR) project by researchers from the University of Missouri and leaders of the Black Church—churches predominantly comprised of an African American congregation and leadership—in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area. Church leaders helped set the research agenda, define the partnership, and evaluate and strengthen the church’s capacity to address <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>/<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=66">AIDS</ulink>. The result was a targeted <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> awareness and screening intervention for delivery by church leaders at multiple levels (e.g., individual, church, and community) to both church and community members.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0003">The TIPS partnership tested its effectiveness by comparing the results between churches that were assigned randomly to either receive the tailored <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> intervention or not (Berkley‐Patton et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0019">2019</link>). They found that church leaders were effective in delivering the intervention, and that it led to significantly more <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> screenings among the people they served. Because of its success as a community‐engaged initiative, the TIPS intervention is being implemented by churches that are part of the Calvary Community Outreach Network to reach the larger African American community in Kansas City. This chapter draws on TIPS throughout to illustrate community engagement in action.</para>
