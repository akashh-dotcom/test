They incorporated the role of individual psychological characteristics, previous life experiences, and the environment in the experience of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0059">1984</link>, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0060">1987</link>). To date, many of the fundamental assumptions and assertions of TMSC have been empirically demonstrated in diverse populations (Giurgescu et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0048">2015</link>; Sanguanklin et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0073">2014</link>). <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">Stress</ulink> research largely has moved away from the development of new theory toward clarifying the complex relationship between the individual and their environment outlined by TMSC.</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0037">This shift has allowed for a much more expansive and impactful conceptualization of the role of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> in health outcomes. Chronic stressors such as economic deprivation, caregiver burden, and increasingly, experiences of racism, prejudice, and discrimination have been identified as key contributors to a wide array of mental and physical health outcomes (Berjot &amp; Gillet,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0019">2011</link>). Attention to the individual characteristics (e.g., gender, race, personality, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9723">trauma</ulink> history) influencing stressor appraisal and coping response has further highlighted mechanistic pathways from <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> exposure to health disparities (Bey et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0021">2019</link>; Lee et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0061">2020</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0026s0000p0038">The body of health research grounded in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> theory could be further strengthened by addressing several persistent gaps. One of the most prominent of these growth areas is the need for a more nuanced understanding of common<emphasis>sources</emphasis> of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> (such as discrimination and other social determinants of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>) and methods of coping across racially diverse and other marginalized populations. For example, prominent <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> frameworks do not specifically identify the role of structural inequity in shaping the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> process for populations across different social positions, even as they may acknowledge prejudice and discrimination as stressors (Clark et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0032">1999</link>). As a rule, moreover, prevailing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> frameworks do not consider the mechanisms by which structural racism and other social determinants act to influence the experience of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and coping behavior across differently racialized groups, highlighting the need to integrate minority‐<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> hypotheses into the core tenets of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> theory.</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0039">Few efforts have been directed toward elucidating how the disproportionate and unjust accumulation of social and material resources, including wealth and political capital, may impose psychological pressures to which individuals do not have adequate resources to adapt (Bey et al.,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0021">2019</link>). Addressing this deficit, emerging theories (Bey, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0022">2022</link>) and growing evidence support the assertion that hierarchical social dynamics facilitating maladaptive behaviors in response to these psychological pressures may partially explain racialized and gendered patterns in antisocial tendencies such as the perpetuation of mass shootings, trophy hunting, domestic violence, and child sexual abuse (Alegria et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0012">2013</link>; Batavia et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0017">2019</link>), which may be triggered by acute and/or chronic exposure to stressors as noted in the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1544">diathesis</ulink>‐<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> model (Broerman, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0026">2017</link>; Levi, 1974). Failure to identify these predilections as correlates of dominant social status may be attributable to the tendency within the health disciplines to normalize the pathologies of members of dominant status groups (Bey, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0022">2022</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0026s0000p0040">The field of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> research could also contribute more to resolving growing tensions regarding <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10324">best practices</ulink> for reducing and eliminating health inequities (see<ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink>). The core tenets of what is often referred to as positive psychology within the psychological disciplines (Frederickson, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0044">2004</link>; Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0075">2000</link>) provide a foundation for a growing interest in identifying sources of both community‐ and individual‐level resilience rather than focusing solely on risk within the health research literature (Boehm &amp; Kubzansky, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0023">2012</link>; Taylor &amp; Carr, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0082">2021</link>). Modifiable psychosocial factors, such as optimism, and culturally rooted practices such as spirituality, modulate the effects of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> exposure on health behaviors and outcomes (Boehm &amp; Kubzansky, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0023">2012</link>; Laubmeier et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0058">2004</link>). However, an increased interest in resilience has met with resistance from some health‐equity researchers questioning the utility of such approaches for long‐term improvements in health at the population level. Approaches focused on promoting adaptive coping and resilience as a viable intervention strategy for population‐level, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐driven health outcomes often are positioned as, at worst, counter to and, at best, tangential to those focused primarily on eradicating structural inequity as a stressor through policy and other structural interventions (Bailey et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0016">2017</link>; Brown et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0028">2019</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0041">In this vein, additional implementation science research is needed to understand the longitudinal effects of interventions. This approach could help to promote adaptive coping, resilience, well‐being, and health. While promising evidence from cross‐sectional and other observational studies suggests that many interventions on <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐responsive cognition and behavior are accessible, sustainable, amenable to culturally tailored adaptations, and effective across the life course at mitigating the health consequences of prolonged <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> exposure (Borgi et al.,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0024">2020</link>; Miller‐Graff &amp; Campion, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0067">2016</link>; Woods‐Giscombe et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0093">2019b</link>), these findings largely have not been replicated in the context of rigorous prospective experimental investigation. Well‐designed longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining Mind‐Body, identity‐based, or positive emotion interventions are a necessary next step for the field.</para>
