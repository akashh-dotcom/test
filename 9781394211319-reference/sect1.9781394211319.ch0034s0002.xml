   <para id="ch0034s0000p0010">In<ulink url="ch0037">Chapter 21</ulink>, Storey and colleagues review the purpose, key components, and methods of social marketing. They illustrate the application of social marketing in two health communication programs: a project in Kenya that supports adoption of behaviors and access to products and services to improve health; and a project in Indonesia that sought to expand the availability of various contraceptive methods and to increase the use of longer‐acting methods when appropriate for not having any more children or spacing the next birth.</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0011">Social marketing is a process that promotes desired voluntary behaviors among members of a target market, by offering attractive benefits and/or reducing barriers associated with healthful choices. It involves the adaptation of commercial marketing technologies to promote socially desirable goals. In<ulink url="ch0037">Chapter 21</ulink>, Storey, Kumoji, Rareiwa, and Wahyuningrum take a fresh look at Social Marketing. They emphasize how social marketing can be applied within a strategic health communication framework and link key theories of health communication and health behavior to the effective practice of social marketing.</para>
   <para id="ch0034s0000p0012">Success with social marketing is most likely when marketers accurately determine the perceptions, needs, and wants of target markets and satisfy them through the design, communication, pricing, and delivery of appropriate, competitive, and visible offerings. The process is consumer‐driven, not only expert‐driven. This orientation is consistent with principles of community organization, and its product development approach parallels the innovation development process of diffusion theory. At the same time, it shares an economic perspective with behavioral economics, a field of inquiry that relates individual behaviors to economic variables (Bickel and Vuchinich,<link linkend="ch0034s0000li0011">2000</link>, <ulink url="ch0036">Chapter 20</ulink>). Both social marketing and behavioral economics are adapted from an economic or market‐based foundation: social marketing uses some principles from commercial marketing, whereas behavioral economics builds on classic economic theory.</para>

   <para id="ch0034s0000p0013">As with the PRECEDE/PROCEED Model and IM, social marketing provides a framework to identify what drives and maintains behavior and behavior change. It also requires identification of potential intermediaries, channels of distribution and communication, and actual and potential competitors. As the authors indicate, theories of health behavior can guide the analytical process in social marketing and aid in the formulation of intervention strategies and materials. They explicitly illustrate four theories that contribute to social marketing approaches: Theory of Planned Behavior, Extended Parallel Processing Model, Social Cognitive Theory, and diffusion of innovations. Because of the focus on understanding consumers (or target audiences), social marketing models are robust for use in diverse and unique populations, including disadvantaged groups and ethnic minorities, and in many countries. In fact, it is often thought that social marketing programs tend to be inherently culturally sensitive because they follow a consumer‐oriented process. In social marketing, it is always important to identify and fulfill demand—that is, to “start where the people are.”</para>
