      <para id="ch0026s0000p0002">Candace is a 42‐year‐old African American mother of two sons. She was married to her sons’ father for 16 years before he unexpectedly died of a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4092">heart attack</ulink> 3 years ago. Candace and her husband were both career‐oriented and successful. Her husband was an engineer, and Candace is a television producer. Over the past three years, Candace has been managing her household while raising her very active teenage sons. She spends her evenings taking her sons to and from athletics, music, and leadership‐related activities after school. Once her sons go to bed, Candace takes care of last‐minute work‐related tasks, and she repeats her routine each day. Candace has benefited from the strong support system at church and in her women’s clubs, in the context of raising her sons as a widowed mother. Candace and her sons adjusted to the loss of Candace’s husband and their father through the support of friends and family. Candace’s parents live in her neighborhood, and she benefited from their consistent support. However, over the past 18 months, Candace’s life took a challenging turn as both of her aging parents became ill.</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0003">Despite needing help from her friends, Candace tried everything she could possibly do to make it work on her own, unassisted by others. She eventually made an appointment with a counselor after one of the pastors at her church encouraged her to reconsider her assumptions about seeking therapy. The counselor was a faith‐based therapist who encouraged Candace to enroll in a mindfulness course to learn new skills for responding to chronic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. After only four weeks of the course, Candace noticed feeling like she had more space to think and exist. She began to view the overall situation as an opportunity for growth and development for her and her sons. Candace was also able to return to regular church services, which provided her with additional resources for coping, such as prayer and music, to promote relaxation and acceptance, in addition to the mindfulness practices that helped her be more mentally and physically healthy.</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0004">The accumulation of interpersonal and life <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> experienced by Candace can be understood and managed in the context of theories of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, coping, and health described in this chapter. These theory‐based constructs also inform how she responded to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, and her use of coping resources to manage contextual stressors that were adversely influencing her health.</para>
