   <para id="ch0008s0000p0001">Programs to influence health behavior, including health promotion and education programs and interventions, generally are more likely to benefit participants and communities when guided by a theory or theories of health behavior. Theories of health behavior can help program planners consider the sources of influence on particular health behaviors and identify the targets for behavior change and methods for accomplishing these changes. Theories also can inform the evaluation of change efforts by helping planners, evaluators, and others to specify the outcomes to be measured and the timing and methods of study. Although the evidence is not unequivocal, when they are developed and implemented thoughtfully and systematically, theory‐driven health promotion and education efforts stand in contrast to programs based primarily on precedent, tradition, intuition, or general principles.</para>
   <para id="ch0008s0000p0002">Theory‐driven health behavior change interventions and programs require an understanding of the components of health behavior theories and operational or practical forms of the theories. The first edition of this book, published in 1990, was the first text to provide an in‐depth analysis of various theories of health behavior relevant to health education in a single volume. It brought together dominant health behavior theories, research based on those theories, and examples of health education practice derived from theory that had been tested through evaluation and research. The second (1996), third (2002), fourth (2008), and fifth (2015) editions of this book updated and improved upon the earlier volumes. People around the world are using this book. It has been translated into multiple languages, including, most recently, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese editions.</para>
   <para id="ch0008s0000p0003">We are confident that the sixth edition of<emphasis>Health Behavior: Theory, Research, and Practice</emphasis> improves upon on the preceding edition, as each earlier edition has done. The main purpose of the book is the same: to advance the science of understanding health behavior and the practice of health behavior change through the informed application of theories of health behavior. Likewise, this book serves as the definitive text for students, practitioners, and scientists in these areas and education in three ways: by analyzing the key components of health behavior theories, by describing current applications of these theories in selected public health and health promotion programs and interventions, and by identifying important future directions for research and practice in health behavior change.</para>
   <para id="ch0008s0000p0004">The sixth edition responds to new developments in health behavior theories and the application of theories in new settings, to new populations, and in new ways. This edition includes an enhanced focus on the application of theories for diverse populations and settings, and there are more chapters written by diverse authors. There is a corresponding integration of issues related to race and ethnicity in multiple chapters and a new chapter (<ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink>) focused on theories of race and racism. Authors recognize the complexity of race/ethnicity; these are not mere variables. Rather, they are the lenses through which people experience the world. Issues of culture and health inequities are also integrated into many chapters. These issues are of broad and growing importance across many theories and models. We believe that these additions strengthen the book and increase its value for use in settings around the world. The world is more global than ever before, and professionals working on behavior change often will work in multiple countries. We have a heightened commitment to addressing health risks and threats in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Thus, more global applications from both developing and developed countries are included.</para>
   <para id="ch0008s0000p0005">As new information and communication technologies have opened up an unprecedented range of strategies for health behavior change, this edition integrates expanded coverage of social media and digital health behavior interventions examples throughout the book.</para>
