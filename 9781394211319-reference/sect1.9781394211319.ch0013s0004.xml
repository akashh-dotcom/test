   <title>Health Behavior Foundations for Theory, Research, and Practice</title>
   <anchor id="ch0013s0004a0001"/>

   <para id="ch0013s0000p0015">This chapter has discussed the dynamic nature of health behavior today in the context of emerging patterns of disease and trends in social interaction and communication, health care, health education, and disease prevention in the United States and globally. It has provided definitions of health behavior and described the broad and diverse parameters of this maturing field. Although thousands more studies of health behavior change have been conducted and reported since the last edition of this book, their variable results continue to raise new questions and pose methodological, theoretical, and substantive challenges. The interrelationships and importance of theory, research, and practice are set against a backdrop of the urgent, growing, and complex imperative to improve the health of populations around the world and to do so in a context that recognizes that healthcare services are only some of the forces that influence health status. Today’s students, researchers, and practitioners can make a difference in the burden of illness and the potential to develop effective, scalable interventions to improve health.</para>
   <para id="ch0013s0000p0016">Observations by McGinnis (<link linkend="ch0013s0000li0046">1994</link>) are still relevant today: The challenge of understanding and improving health behavior is “one of the most complex tasks yet confronted by science. To competently address that challenge, the … research community must simply do more and do it better” in certain key areas of behavioral research. A coordinated and focused effort is essential to resolve many of the most vexing health issues facing our society (Smedley &amp; Syme, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0049">2000</link>). Integration of the best available knowledge from theory, research, and behavior change practice can advance that agenda in the years ahead.</para>
