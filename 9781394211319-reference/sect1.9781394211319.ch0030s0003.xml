   <title>Concepts and Principles</title>

   <para id="ch0030s0000p0017">The core concepts and principles of community engagement offer practical guidance and strategies, a foundation for scientific inquiry, and core values that can guide health professionals, researchers, health care providers, community leaders, and organizations in their efforts. They place the notions of respect, trust, equal participation, and integrity at the forefront of working with communities. Understanding how power is negotiated between academic and community partners in community engagement activities is critical to developing respectful, trusting, and equal partnerships (Wallerstein et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0076">2019</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0018">In this section, we define four overarching concepts of community engagement with their embedded principles: (1)<emphasis>community capacity</emphasis>, with principles of the community as the unit of identity that builds on community strengths; (2) <emphasis>empowerment and critical consciousness</emphasis>, with principles that promote co‐learning and integrates knowledge and action; (3) <emphasis>participation and relevance</emphasis>, with principles to facilitate equitable involvement of all partners in practice and research; and (4) <emphasis>health inequities</emphasis> as the focus of change. These concepts and principles are summarized in <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0012"/>

      <title>Community Capacity</title>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0003a0002"/>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0013"/>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0019">Community capacity is the development of knowledge, skills, commitment, structures, systems, and leadership to enable effective health promotion (Israel et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0037">2013</link>). It is integral to challenging power imbalances and effectively addressing problems. Capacity building involves actions to improve health at three levels: (1) the advancement of knowledge and skills among practitioners; (2) the expansion of support and infrastructure for health promotion in organizations; (3) the development of cohesiveness and partnerships for health in communities (Smith et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0069">2006</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0020">Community capacity recognizes the community as a<emphasis>unit of identity</emphasis>. Communities’ identities often are linked to a sense of emotional connection and relationship to others, shared norms and values, common language and customs, similar goals and interests, and a desire to meet shared needs. There also may be situations in which communities of identity may benefit from involving individuals and groups from outside the community who bring additional needed skills and resources to address communities’ concerns.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0021">Community capacity building includes the ability of community members to take action to address their needs and the social and political support that is required for the successful implementation of programs (Israel et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0038">1998</link>). As community members actively participate in identifying and solving community issues, they become better able to address future issues collaboratively. While communities may benefit from academic or health professional skills and resources external to the community, recognition of and building on community strengths is critical for effective capacity building, and relationships are a precursor to building capacity to achieve mutual goals (Smith et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0069">2006</link>). Rather than viewing communities in terms of deficits, communities should be viewed in terms of their assets and resourcefulness.</para>

      <title>Empowerment and Critical Consciousness</title>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0003a0003"/>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0016"/>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0022">Empowerment and critical consciousness are embedded deeply within community engagement. Empowerment is “a group‐based, participatory, developmental process through which marginalized or oppressed individuals and groups gain greater control over their lives and environment, acquire valued resources and basic rights, and achieve important life goals and reduced societal marginalization” (Maton,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0046">2008</link>, pp. 4–5). Although often used as a catch‐all phrase, empowerment remains a central tenet of community organization, community building, and community engagement.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0023">Researchers use empowerment approaches to explore relationships between individuals within specific social, organizational, educational, and political environments (Freire,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0031">2018</link>; Zimmerman, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0083">2000</link>). As a methodology, community empowerment involves both processes and outcomes and focuses on transforming power relations for individuals, the organizations to which they belong, and the community social structure itself. For individuals, psychological empowerment includes perceived control, critical consciousness, political efficacy, and participation in change (Peterson et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0057">2006</link>). Organizational empowerment incorporates advocacy processes as well as organizational effectiveness and collective efficacy in policy change (Laverack, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0042">2007</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0024">Community empowerment outcomes include an increased sense of community, or sense of belonging to and identification with a group or geographic area; community capacity; actual changes in policies, transformed conditions, and/or increased resources—all of which can contribute to reducing health inequities (Wallerstein et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0077">2020</link>). There is evidence that empowerment is a viable public health strategy, and that empowering initiatives can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to improvement in health outcomes (Wallerstein, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0073">2006</link>). The most effective empowerment strategies are those that build on and reinforce authentic participation and ensure autonomy in decision‐making, a sense of community and local bonding, and psychological empowerment of community members (Wallerstein, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0073">2006</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0025">Freire’s (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0031">2018</link>) notion of <emphasis>critical consciousness</emphasis> is a philosophical, theoretical, and practice‐based idea. A major tenet of the concept of critical consciousness is empowerment and action to promote equity and social justice. The process of critical consciousness promotes critical reflection on how social determinants of health can impact individual and community health outcomes (Windsor et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0078">2022</link>). In essence, reflection and action on social determinants of health can promote health equity by increasing willingness and ability to effectively combat health inequities and may affect individual and community health outcomes (Wallerstein, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0073">2006</link>).</para>

      <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0017"/>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0026">The concepts of participation and relevance represent the core value of working with communities in ways that acknowledge the strengths and skills of community partners. The principle of involving communities means equitable involvement of all partners in all stages of practice and research, from identifying the problem to implementing and evaluating plans and strategies (Wallerstein et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0075">2018</link>). Within this principle is the recognition that fundamental change requires a long‐term commitment to tackling complex and multilayered social and health problems.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0027">One of the most important steps in community engagement involves effective differentiation between problems that are troubling and issues that the community feels strongly about (Staples,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0070">2004</link>). Various methods may be used to help a community group obtain data needed to document issues while ensuring their relevance. Face‐to‐face data collection processes, including focus groups, surveys, and interviews, can be useful in assessing perceived needs and, at the same time, increasing a sense of participation (Duran et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0028">2012</link>).</para>

      <anchor id="ch0030s0003a0005"/>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0018"/>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0028">Braveman et al. (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0021">2017</link>) define health equity as everyone having a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires removing obstacles to health, such as poverty, discrimination, and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, safe environments, and healthcare. Health equity is the value underlying a commitment to reduce and ultimately eliminate health inequities. Thus, health equity, more broadly, means reducing and ultimately eliminating disparities in health and its determinants that adversely affect excluded or marginalized groups. While efforts to achieve health equity do not originate in community‐engaged practice and research and are not important solely in the context of community engagement, health equity has an important role in community‐based health behavior efforts. (see <ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink> on Race, Health, and Health Equity for more in‐depth coverage.)</para>
      <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0019"/>
      <beginpage pagenum="189"/>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0029">Health equity also means social justice and reflects ethical and human rights concerns. Equity requires a concerted effort to achieve more rapid improvements among those who were worse off to start, within an overall strategy to improve everyone’s health, and not by worsening advantaged groups’ health (Braveman et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0021">2017</link>). Increasingly, the term “health inequity”—the opposite of health equity—is being used instead of “health disparity” to capture the moral dimension and to emphasize health differences thought to reflect injustice as distinct from health differences in general.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0000p0030">Ideally, partnerships promote co‐learning and capacity building among all partners; foster empowerment and power‐sharing processes that reduce social and health inequities; and ensure local relevance and participation. It is important for partnerships invested in equity to critically evaluate the extent to which they provide opportunities for meaningful participation and engagement of community members. As Robert K. Ross, President and Chief Executive Officer for The California Endowment, stated, “The path to health equity and healing<emphasis>begins</emphasis> with participation in the process,” which, indeed, is “the engine that drives” the entire effort (Ross, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0062">2016</link>, p. 1).</para>
