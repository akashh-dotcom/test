   <para id="ch0019s0000p0008">In TRA, TPB, IM, and RAA, the most powerful determinant of behavioral performance is intention to enact the behavior. Performing the behavior is most likely if individuals have the necessary skills and/or abilities, believe they can perform the target behavior, and if environmental constraints are not prohibitive. Depending on the theoretical iteration, intention formation is determined by attitudes, social norms, and PBC. Generally, attitudes refer to the perceived favorability or unfavorability of a behavior. Perceived norms (also, normative pressure) are of two types.<emphasis>Injunctive norms</emphasis> are perceptions about whether the behavior is approved by people who are important to an individual, and <emphasis>descriptive norms</emphasis> are whether these important others themselves perform the behavior. PBC refers to perceptions about one’s capability to accomplish the behavior, even in the context of important barriers (self‐efficacy), and about having the autonomy to do so.</para>
   <para id="ch0019s0000p0009">Each of these determinants is a function of corresponding underlying beliefs, which have an<emphasis>expectancy‐value form</emphasis> (Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0011">2000</link>). That is, attitudes (favorability) are determined by experiential (having to do with affective or emotional responses) and instrumental (having to do cognitive responses about outcomes) beliefs weighted by the valence of the outcome. For example, to the extent that someone feels that exercising to sweat for at least 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week leads to primarily positive outcomes (e.g., increased energy, increased self‐confidence, better health outcomes), she would demonstrate a more positive attitude toward exercising. If she associates exercising primarily with negative outcomes (e.g., soreness, discomfort, embarrassment), she would have a more negative attitude toward the behavior. This formulation of attitudes accounts for the fact that two individuals might hold the same belief (that exercising to sweat for at least 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week results in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6651">weight loss</ulink>), but that belief may contribute differently to attitudes, depending on the evaluation of the outcome as desirable or undesirable. Similarly, normative pressure is determined by normative beliefs; beliefs about whether specific important others (normative or social referents) approve of the behavior weighted by the motivation to comply with the referent. PBC is determined by <emphasis>control beliefs</emphasis>: perceptions of one’s ability to overcome specific barriers to behavioral performance.</para>

      <title>Which Theory Should be Used?</title>

      <anchor id="ch0019s0000a0019"/>
      <para id="ch0019s0000p0010">With each iteration in this set of theories, construct measurement and conceptualizations became more refined, and predictive validity improved. However, the availability of multiple versions may raise questions about which version should be used for a new purpose. For example, although IM and RAA are more recent, TPB is more frequently referred to in the scientific literature, even in recent publications. In an informal search on Google Scholar since the last edition of this book in 2015, approximately 408,000 results were returned from a search simply for “theory of planned behavior” compared to about 64,000 results for “reasoned action approach.” Decisions about which model to use involve several considerations, including the empirical question(s) being asked, context of use (e.g., for intervention development versus explanation), and measures available. The process for identifying beliefs may also vary depending on available resources. For example, the measurement development process, including elicitation research, can be labor‐intensive and costly. When resources are limited, some researchers may use alternative strategies to identify salient beliefs, including literature review and secondary data analysis. While the latest iteration of the model may offer a more complete understanding of various behaviors and maximize explained variance (McEachan et al.,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0052">2016</link>), earlier versions still are valuable.</para>

         <para id="ch0019s0000p0011">The use of the word “reasoned” may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to a misconception about these theories. Critics sometimes assume that the intention formation process is “rational” or “deliberative” (Ajzen,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0007">2011</link>; Reyna &amp; Farley, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0056">2006</link>). However, here, the word “reasoned” reflects how intention formation is predicted by development of attitudes, norms, and control beliefs in a consistent way, but not necessarily through a process that is unbiased or logical. In other words, these theories assume nothing about how attitudes are cognitively constructed. In addition, these theories recognize that individuals’ underlying beliefs may be “irrational” and may not be grounded in objective reality, yet, still be predictive of behavior.</para>

         <para id="ch0019s0000p0012">According to this reasoned action framework, the target behavior must be defined at “various levels of generality or specificity” based on the four<emphasis>TACT components: target, action, context, and time (TACT)</emphasis>. RAA posits that changing any aspect of the formulation results in a different behavior (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0032">2010</link>, p. 30). For example, suppose we are interested in the goal of women asking health providers about pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP, an <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> prevention medication). The action is “asking about PrEP,” the target is the “health care provider,” the context might be “during your check‐up” or “at your local clinic,” and the time “in the next 30 days” or “the next time you go to your provider.” A behavior defined only by action and time, for example, is the most general application of the components but is often appropriate for some behaviors in which the target and context are not applicable.</para>
         <para id="ch0019s0000p0013">A common mistake is confusing goals, behavioral categories, and behaviors. For example, “losing weight” is not a behavior; it is a goal. Behaviors needed to achieve this goal might be a range of actions, such as avoiding sugary drinks, walking to work, increasing exercising, or bariatric surgery. A behavior in the avoiding sugary drink category would be “eliminating sugary drinks at mealtimes every day for the next six weeks.” The general principle is that a target behavior should be specifically defined using TACT so there is a clear understanding of what is being predicted or explained, but not so detailed that the behavior is impractical or of little interest.</para>
         <para id="ch0019s0000p0014">Related to defining the target behavior is the concept of compatibility. Compatibility refers to measuring intention and behavior at the same level of TACT specificity (Ajzen &amp; Fishbein,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0010">1980</link>; Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0032">2010</link>). Compatibility extends to measures for attitudes, norms, and control as well. That is, they should all refer to the same definition of the target behavior. A lack of compatibility attenuates the relationships among intention, its determinants, and the target behavior.</para>

         <para id="ch0019s0000p0015">Volitional control refers to the actual (not perceived) ability of an individual to act on their intention to perform a behavior. In TRA, behavioral intention is determined based only on attitudes and norms because it was presumed that agency was high, and the target behavior was volitional. In response to criticisms about this assumption, PBC was added to TRA, creating TPB, to account for behaviors in which volitional control is low, or may be perceived as low. Studies have shown that PBC explains more variance in behavior beyond that explained by intention when perceived control is low; its contribution to behavioral prediction is limited in other instances when perceived control is higher (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0032">2010</link>). In RAA, PBC moderates the relationship between intention and behavior, as does actual control. Although some behaviors may occur involuntarily, those behaviors were not meant to be explained by the theory, as they are “outside of awareness.”</para>

         <para id="ch0019s0000p0016">In the context of the reasoned action framework, theoretical sufficiency is the notion that performance of the target behavior is predicted directly by intention to perform the behavior and, sometimes, actual behavioral control; and behavioral intention is predicted solely by attitude, normative pressure, and control factors. The effect of additional variables (demographics, media exposure, personality traits) on intention and behavior is<emphasis>mediated</emphasis> through these attitudinal, normative pressure, and control factors. In instances where sufficiency may not occur or intention is a poor predictor of behavior, measurement error (e.g., poor reliability) or a lack of compatibility among measures are often to blame (Ajzen, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0009">2020</link>).</para>
