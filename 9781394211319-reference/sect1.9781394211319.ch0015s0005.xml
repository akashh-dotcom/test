   <para id="ch0015s0000p0045">To date, ecological models have mostly been used conceptually for explaining the totality of influence of health behaviors, and to determine what needs to be measured or accounted for when designing observational, program evaluation, or intervention studies. A common criticism of ecological models is that despite their excellent face validity, they remain “too general” and are perceived as being “hard to test” through traditional empirical approaches. Another consistent critique is that while it is often safe to assume that there are multiple levels of influence on health behavior, most health behavior interventions to date focus on the more proximal levels—the individual (interpersonal and community levels)—versus the more distal ones (policy and planetary levels) (Parkinson et al.,<link linkend="ch0015s0000li0049">2022</link>). The still‐limited work on multilevel interventions that include strategies across all or most levels of influence likely has several causes. Simply determining the specific influences on which to intervene at each level is challenging, while multilevel interventions are more complex, and may require more expertise and resources for implementation and evaluation.</para>

   <para id="ch0015s0000p0046">Although individual researchers and interventionists may have little or no direct control over factors at the societal, environmental, and planetary levels, the evidence produced by research is critical to advocate effectively for health‐promoting modifications to these very systems. Tobacco research and its influence on policy in the United States, and the work by nutrition researchers in Mexico to evaluate sugar‐sweetened beverage tax policies, are both excellent examples of how science based on ecological models has influenced policies and large‐scale environmental changes for improving public health (Batis et al.,<link linkend="ch0015s0000li0015">2016</link>; Warner &amp; Tam, <link linkend="ch0015s0000li0061">2012</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0015s0000p0047">Some studies have tested interventions that target only one level of the ecological model—with those at the community/societal, governmental/policy, or planetary level more likely to be explicitly identified as informed by ecological models. Ecological models can still be useful for guiding this work. A single‐level intervention could be acceptable if existing evidence has established, that, for this specific behavior, that level exerts an outsized influence on behavioral outcomes, and that the optimal use of limited resources is to focus on a single level. One classic public health example is fluoridated <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> (Newbrun,<link linkend="ch0015s0000li0045">1989</link>). While the occurrence of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1417">dental caries</ulink> is influenced by factors across multiple levels, fluoridating the public <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> supply, an upstream, single‐level environmental intervention, is a simple, cost‐effective approach with major impact. This is not to say, however, that fluoridated <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> minimizes <emphasis>all</emphasis> risk of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1417">dental caries</ulink>, and that a multilevel intervention would not be preferable. Indeed, recent evidence points to significant increases in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1417">dental caries</ulink> incidence among children globally (Bagramian et al., <link linkend="ch0015s0000li0014">2009</link>), which further emphasizes that multilevel approaches are necessary for better controlling the issue. It should also be noted that examples like the case of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> fluoridation and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1417">dental caries</ulink> are increasingly rare, and hence, for most health behaviors, a multilevel approach is usually preferable.</para>
   <para id="ch0015s0000p0048">Another instance for which single‐level interventions may be useful is as part of a larger effort to flesh out the behavior‐specific ecological model, and to help establish credible evidence on the causal link between factors at a given level of the ecological model on the behavior<emphasis>while accounting for the influence of factors at other levels</emphasis>. When there is consistent etiologic evidence for a problem at multiple levels, it is increasingly important for intervention work to focus on more than one level.</para>
   <para id="ch0015s0000p0049">There are some comprehensive analyses that attempt to quantify the relative influence of different levels, and of different factors within each level, on health behaviors. There are many good examples of this type of work in the food environment and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink>‐behavior literature (Cobb et al.,<link linkend="ch0015s0000li0021">2015</link>). One example is the comprehensive analysis by Ohri‐Vachaspati et al. (<link linkend="ch0015s0000li0048">2015</link>), who combined individual respondent survey data with neighborhood environment data to understand the relative contributions of factors from different levels of the ecological model to understand childhood <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4357">obesity</ulink>. These levels included child, parent, household and neighborhood characteristics, parental perceptions of the neighborhood environment, and measured presence of food and physical activity facilities. The investigators found that the strongest contributors were parental characteristics (such as education and body mass index) and parental perceptions of the neighborhood environment (such as safety from crime and traffic, availability of fruits and vegetables, and condition of sidewalks). This type of research can help indicate where to prioritize intervention efforts to reduce childhood <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink>. On the basis of this analysis, a future multilevel intervention might target certain important changeable factors, including increasing the availability of fruits and vegetables at nearby stores and quantity and quality of spaces for physical activity, as well as parental perceptions of those facilities. Parental perceptions might be targeted either directly, such as by individually directed interventions to address concerns around safety, or indirectly, through further environmental interventions, such as sidewalk reconstruction, crosswalk painting, and the like.</para>
   <para id="ch0015s0000p0050">Other important factors to consider when thinking about which levels to prioritize for intervention are the expected effect sizes for proximal versus distal influences, and the need (or desire) to achieve individual‐ versus population‐level impact. It is reasonable to expect interventions targeting intrapersonal or interpersonal factors (proximal influences) to generally result in larger effect sizes for behavior change in individuals than those operating at higher levels of the ecological model (distal influences). However, the reach, long‐term maintenance, and scalability potential of these strategies may be limited. So, if the goal is to find solutions to address a large‐scale, public health problem such as the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink> epidemic in the United States or Mexico, one might argue that targeting the most upstream‐level factors (policies, environments) that promote unhealthy eating and sedentary lifestyles may be the most effective approach. Previous sections of this chapter have discussed the complexities entailed by this type of intervention, occurring at the outer‐most rings of ecological models. Still, let us assume that all of those challenges have been overcome and that we have successfully implemented a policy‐level intervention involving a junk food and soda tax in a large city to reduce caloric intake and unhealthy eating. Under this scenario, it would be reasonable to expect that the individual‐level effect size of this type of policy intervention (say on the average reduction in caloric intake per person) would be low. However, from a public health standpoint, achieving small health behavioral improvements among a large proportion of the population may be preferable to achieving larger changes among only a few people (Letson et al.,<link linkend="ch0015s0000li0040">2016</link>). Obviously, the ideal scenario would be to implement effective, complementary, and coordinated strategies targeting multiple levels of the ecological model. However, this is not always feasible in real life and in the short term. Hence, the thresholds for what we consider effective may need to be adapted to reasonable expectations depending on the level(s) targeted by health behavior interventions.</para>

   <para id="ch0015s0000p0051">Finally, other emerging considerations with respect to the use of ecological models for identifying strategies to improve health behaviors involve the need to develop<emphasis>globally and locally varying ecological models</emphasis>. It is not enough to recognize that the ecological model for one health behavior will operate differently for another health behavior. For example, it is possible that the ecological model for gun violence in the United States includes very different factors or elements at all levels when compared to the ecological model for gun violence in Australia, as each country has different policies and social norms around gun ownership. The same could be said about any health behavior. In fact, new evidence even suggests that the factors populating each level of the ecological model for a given health behavior can vary across neighborhoods within a single city (Feuillet et al., <link linkend="ch0015s0000li0026">2015</link>). More research exploring the global and local variations of ecological models for “the same health behavior” is needed, as this type of work is not just interesting, but most importantly, can help us design and implement more effective health behavior change strategies for specific settings, contexts, and population groups.</para>
