   <para id="ch0037s0000p0052">This chapter has introduced the core principles and some examples of social marketing to improve health behavior and health outcomes. Social marketing is not—any more than other approaches described in this book—a panacea for overcoming public health challenges. Nevertheless, in its systematic approach to understanding audience characteristics and the market structure surrounding behavioral decisions, social marketing offers powerful guidelines for communication planning.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0053">Social marketing draws attention to factors beyond the individual level toward ways that communication can affect—even transform—social conditions through policy change (think of fluoridation of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink>, iodization of <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Salt">salt</ulink>, automotive safety regulations), legislation (such as mandatory seat belt use and bans against use of mobile phones while driving) and normative change (reduced <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>/<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=66">AIDS</ulink> stigma, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10267">abandonment</ulink> of FGM), thereby facilitating the voluntary uptake of beneficial health behaviors. Even so, social marketing strategies necessarily work backward from the existing needs and conditions of consumers’ lives to identify and reduce barriers and create structures that facilitate beneficial behavior. In both commercial and social marketing, it is sometimes necessary to build or create value, but in social marketing it is always important to identify and fulfill demand. Creating appealing messages about the product is important, but this must be done together with considerations of the cost‐benefit ratio, where the exchange is likely to take place, what forces compete against the product for attention and resources, and how the entire social ecology of decision‐making affects health choices and sustained health outcomes.</para>
