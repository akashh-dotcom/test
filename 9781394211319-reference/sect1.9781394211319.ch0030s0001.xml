   <para id="ch0030s0000p0005">Communities can be characterized by<emphasis>geographical proximity</emphasis> (e.g., a neighborhood), <emphasis>sociocultural proximity</emphasis> (e.g., race/ethnicity), or <emphasis>similar situations/experiences</emphasis> (e.g., exposure to environmental contaminants). Transcending geographical proximity, Fellin (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0030">2001</link>) identified three dimensions of communities: (1) <emphasis>functional spatial units</emphasis> seeking to meet basic needs (e.g., residents of low‐income housing projects mobilized to address food insecurity); (2) <emphasis>units of patterned social interactions</emphasis> (e.g., patients and physicians brought together to improve <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10343">primary care</ulink>); and (3) <emphasis>symbolic units of collective identity</emphasis> (e.g., migrant workers engaged to improve their sexual health). Another dimension is that of social units seeking change on a political level (Minkler et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0051">2008</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0006">TIPS’ notion of community focused on several community characteristics; African Americans (sociocultural proximity) affected by <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>/<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=66">AIDS</ulink> (similar situation) living in the greater Kansas City Metropolitan area (geographical proximity). TIPS also exemplifies Fellin’s (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0030">2001</link>) symbolic units of collective identity: a community defined by its shared religious affiliation and ethnocultural history. These characteristics and dimensions of a community, and how communities are defined more broadly, are informed by several broad perspectives.</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0007">The<emphasis>ecological systems perspective</emphasis> (see <ulink url="ch0015">Chapter 3</ulink>) focuses on distinct community components, each with its purpose, activities, levels of influence, and boundaries to meet the diverse needs of communities. The <emphasis>social systems perspective</emphasis> focuses on the social and political networks (see <ulink url="ch0025">Chapter 11</ulink> on social networks) at multiple levels (e.g., family, community, and geopolitical) that connect individuals, community organizations, and leaders to each other. TIPS exemplifies these perspectives. The organizers designed a multilevel <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink>/<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=66">AIDS</ulink> intervention built upon the church’s natural components—outreach ministry, church services, and group ministry—to reach different segments of their community in different ways (e.g., testimonials and testing events during services), but all with the same goal. In doing so, they leveraged the social connections among African American church members and church leaders and the church’s influence in the community.</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0008">The<emphasis>virtual perspective</emphasis> focuses on computer‐mediated forms of communication and networking. Many people connect with others, access information, and seek solutions to their concerns through social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) and networking services (e.g., text messaging and e‐chat rooms) (see <ulink url="ch0038">Chapter 22</ulink>). This has led to virtual communities, or organized groups of people with shared interests, who interact over the Internet or on social media platforms, offering unique ways to engage communities in health promotion and research (Patten et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0056">2021</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0009">The<emphasis>individual perspective</emphasis> recognizes that people can have multiple and intersecting identities, interests, or conditions that do not fall neatly along geographical, socioeconomic, racial/ethnic lines, or any other single characteristic (McCloskey et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0048">2011</link>). No single definition or perspective of a community can capture all the possible ways and reasons people choose to identify, connect, interact, or organize themselves. This is why it is important to understand how communities define themselves.</para>
