   <title>Integrating Racism‐Focused Constructs into Health Behavior Models</title>
   <anchor id="ch0029s0001a0001"/>
   <anchor id="ch0029s0000a0016"/>
   <para id="ch0029s0000p0016">Health equity‐focused theoretical foundations can be incorporated into applications of individual, interpersonal, or community health behavior change models, though this can be challenging. At the extreme, health behavior change models can overemphasize individual level factors, such as self‐efficacy, self‐control, and intention, while population‐level theories can undervalue individual and collective agency. The lack of inclusion of structural constraints perpetuates an inequitable status quo, while a sole focus on structures limits the role of agency. Therefore, the work of achieving health equity should be to integrate theories of structural injustice, namely race, racialization, and racism into traditional health behavior change models. To explore approaches to doing this, this section discusses two widely used health behavior models exploring (1) how social environments can be better integrated into theories and (2) how each model’s constructs may be contextualized within racialized social systems.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s0000p0017">The SEM (<ulink url="ch0015">Chapter 3</ulink>) is one of the most widely used health behavior change models for designing and/or adapting interventions, especially for incorporating social and policy contexts. This model emphasizes a multilevel and interconnected ecological system that affects human development and behavior (Bronfenbrenner, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0010">1979</link>; Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0011">2007</link>). At the intrapersonal level, each person has unique biological and psychological characteristics that influence behavior. Behavior and behavior change are influenced and constrained by interpersonal, familial, community‐level, and societal‐level factors.</para>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0018">Considering childhood <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink> prevention as an example, numerous <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink> researchers have identified factors at the biological, household, social, environmental, and policy levels that interact to explain patterns of childhood overweight/<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink> and eating behaviors (Quick et al.,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0052">2017</link>; Story et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0058">2008</link>). In a review of studies published between 1984 and 2018 on determinants of childhood <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4357">obesity</ulink> by SEM level, Pereira and colleagues found that most studies using SEM models to guide research on determinants of childhood <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4357">obesity</ulink> focused predominantly on individual and family‐level factors. They concluded that “… more evidence is needed about the role of the community, environmental, and policy level determinants,” which were included in only between 20% and 40% of studies included in their review (Pereira et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0051">2019</link>). The review did not examine interventions.</para>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0019">Thus, a substantial minority of studies on childhood <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink> in the review focused on factors at levels higher than the individual level. Furthermore, the SEM does not explicitly incorporate inequitable power dynamics—namely, systems of oppression—into how these levels influence behavior. Systems of oppression are “discriminatory institutions, structures, norms, to name a few, that are embedded in the fabric of our society,” including racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism, and ablism (Simon Fraser Public Interest Research Group,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0055">2023</link>). These systems of oppression often constrain behavior and act as barriers to the implementation of behavior change interventions at the individual and population levels. It is likely that the researchers who conducted many of the studies in Pereira’s review did not have access to, and thus did not consider, incorporating measures of racism and related power dynamics.</para>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0020">Kumanyika’s Framework for Increasing Equity Impact in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">Obesity</ulink> Prevention seeks to prioritize equity when pursuing policy, systems, and environmental change (Kumanyika,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0036">2019</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0037">2022</link>). The premise is that disparities related to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink> and other health problems cannot be remedied without attention to underlying inequities. Approaches to address underlying inequities include increasing healthy options, such as health‐promoting built environments and retail food stores, reducing deterrents like discrimination and higher costs, improving social and economic resources through legal services and nutrition assistance programs, and building on community capacity through strategic partnerships and behavior change, knowledge, and skills. For instance, in addition to its more individually focused <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink> prevention and disease management programs, building on almost a decade of efforts to work with food retailers, in 2012 the New York City Health Department launched the Shop Healthy program to increase access to healthy food in neighborhoods with high levels of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink> and poorer nutritional options, namely disinvested communities of color (Adjoian et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0004">2017</link>; Arevalo, <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0005">2017</link>; Dannefer et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0016">2016</link>; Del Signore Dresser et al., <link linkend="ch0029s0000li0020">2023</link>). Over time, there were directed efforts to counteract racialized practices, like targeted corporate marketing of unhealthy food and beverages and distributors’ assumptions of unhealthy food consumption in disinvested neighborhoods of color. The Shop Healthy program’s approach moves beyond individual behavior to consider systemic constraints that contribute to health disparities. Results were modest (e.g., in terms of purchases of healthier food choices and reductions in unhealthy advertisements), however, and there remains a pressing need to study long‐term impacts of novel, anti‐racism interventions. If they work, they should be implemented widely; and if not, evaluators should study the obstacles to success and develop more promising approaches.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s0000p0021">The Integrative Behavioral Model, first published in 2000 (Fishbein,<link linkend="ch0029s0000li0023">2000</link>), builds on constructs from several previously developed health behavior models, including the Theory of Reasoned Action and Theory of Planned Behavior (<ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 6</ulink>). Key constructs are hypothesized to contribute to an individual’s intention or decision to perform a behavior, with a range of “other factors” modifying the key constructs and behavior itself beyond intention. Considerations for incorporating race and racism theory can be applied to the IM constructs.</para>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0022">An individual’s emotional response to getting a colonoscopy after a positive stool‐based screening test result and the beliefs about the outcomes associated with getting a colonoscopy are structurally patterned, with perceived norms based on real social norms that may have structural bases. For instance, perceived norms around colonoscopies may be rooted in stigma related to the invasiveness of the procedure, historical experiences of late‐stage diagnosis of health conditions with poor prognoses, or out‐of‐pocket costs disproportionately experienced by Black and Latinx patients. Personal agency is based on evaluation of real structural, racialized barriers, including insurance coverage, work constraints, and childcare constraints. The salience of the desired behavior is rooted in a complex context of competing desired behaviors and structural barriers. This can be broadly characterized, especially through social and material deprivation, forced migration, resource scarcity, and other pathways between racism and health. These issues should be considered when scheduling colonoscopy screenings when they are completed, and when results are given to patients. New, patient‐centered communication and education approaches that take these factors into account should be developed and evaluated.</para>
      <para id="ch0029s0000p0023">In essence, the argument is that health behavior theories that focus on individual and interpersonal factors can accommodate issues stemming from structural racism, thus making them more robust in their explanation and allowing for the development of interventions that can be applied to address health disparities.</para>
