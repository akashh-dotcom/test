   <para id="ch0018s0000p0034">In this chapter, we described origins of the HBM, reviewed and defined its key components and hypothesized relationships, summarized critical reviews, and provided examples of applications—most recently in the study of COVID‐19‐related behaviors. The model, which has been used for more than 60 years to predict health‐related behaviors and inform development of behavior‐change interventions, is still being used in health behavior research today. The model’s intuitive concepts have made its modifiable beliefs popular for designing interventions (e.g., messages to strengthen perception of benefits and weaken perceived barriers). As the chapter describes, this approach has been exceptionally popular in global studies.</para>
   <para id="ch0018s0000p0035">However, we still know relatively little about relationships among HBM constructs, such as whether they all directly predict behavior or whether some beliefs have indirect effects or mediate relationships to behaviors. Notable exceptions are studies by Gerend and Shepherd (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0038">2012</link>), comparing the value of HBM and the TPB in predicting HPV vaccine uptake, and Murphy et al. (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0061">2013</link>), comparing the value of HBM and Theory of Reasoned Action in evaluating mammography behavior. In addition, few researchers have investigated factors that moderate HBM constructs’ effects on behaviors (Li et al. <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0053">2003</link>). Another persistent limitation is that the way HBM constructs are measured and addressed varies widely. However, as shown during the COVID‐19 pandemic, the HBM is alive and well—informing assessment of health beliefs and interventions to change those perceptions and, ultimately, behaviors. As with all models, a good measurement of the constructs and effective intervention components addressing them will continue to be important as we use the HBM to influence behavior change.</para>
