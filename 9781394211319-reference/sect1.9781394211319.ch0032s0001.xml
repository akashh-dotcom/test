First, communication can be used purposively or intentionally to achieve public health goals, whether these are shifts in health beliefs, attitudes, support for public policies, or health behaviors. Historically, one of the most salient of these <emphasis>planned or strategic uses</emphasis> of communication for health has been large‐scale media campaigns, where the objective is, typically, increasing public awareness and/or promoting behavior change. Other examples of planned communication include: entertainment‐education initiatives designed to encourage behavior change through engaging storylines rather than more expository informational approaches; point‐of‐sale communication of information, such as nutrition labels on foods and beverages or warning labels on tobacco packaging; and community‐based interventions that leverage communication technology to improve outcomes, including health literacy and information efficacy.</para>

<emphasis>Note.</emphasis> Social media are relevant to both planned (strategic) and unplanned (nonpurposive) approaches to communication. For example, multimedia health campaigns are increasingly disseminated via social media, and social media are also a source of incidental exposure to health information—including mis/disinformation.

      <para id="ch0032s0000p0010">Communications also are used for health in<emphasis>unplanned or nonpurposive ways</emphasis> through the public’s routine interactions with the media and broader information environment. These unplanned communications can shape health behavior and its antecedents as much as (if not more than) planned communication efforts, often in unintentional ways. This second approach to communication in public health has become increasingly important in recent years, with widespread availability of health information in both news and entertainment media (e.g., news stories that discuss e‐cigarette use among youth, movies that portray tobacco use), alongside greater ability to share such information within both offline and online social networks. Such information diffusion via social ties occurs in both unplanned and planned communication contexts, although inequalities in information sharing across population groups have been identified (Southwell, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0070">2013</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0032s0000p0011">Consider again the case of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Between 2020 and 2022, there were countless strategic communication messages to promote mitigation behaviors, such as masking, social distancing, and vaccine uptake—efforts that were spearheaded by a wide range of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink>, including local and state health departments, federal agencies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), community‐based organizations, schools, and universities, and hospitals and health systems. This messaging took the form of full‐scale national media campaigns (such as the US Department of Health and Human Services’ “We Can Do This” campaign and the Ad Council’s “It’s Up to You” campaign), as well as more localized efforts in communities, clinical settings, and schools. However, these planned applications of communication to promote COVID‐19 prevention measures had to compete with other messages about COVID‐19 circulating in the broader information environment, such as news media coverage of debates over vaccine mandates and social media discourse surrounding unproven COVID‐19 treatments. As described above, this information ecosystem has been characterized by competing recommendations from health experts and politicians, and rampant mis‐ and disinformation. Ultimately, then, both planned and unplanned approaches to communication for health are interrelated forces that vie for audience attention and engagement—and although each can be consequential for health behavior, there is increasing concern that competing, inaccurate, and often politicized media content to which the public is routinely and rapidly exposed can undermine public health campaigns and messaging.</para>

      <para id="ch0032s0000p0012">Theories provide guidance in efforts to consider how the information environment—including both planned and unplanned communication—influences the public. Theories can help researchers and communication planners understand and make predictions about which key variables might be manipulated and/or affect important outcomes. Communication processes can operate directly, where media exposure influences behavior, and, more often, indirectly, where media exposure influences beliefs, attitudes, norms, and, in turn, behavior. However, no single theory explains and predicts all communication outcomes, and theories can operate on different levels.</para>

         <para id="ch0032s0000p0015">Several theories that are often used in health behavior and health education offer explanations for media effects at the individual level. For example, the<emphasis>Health Belief Model</emphasis> (<ulink url="ch0018">Chapter 5</ulink>) and <emphasis>Reasoned Action Approach</emphasis> (<ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 6</ulink>) propose pathways of behavior change through a finite set of determinants. Specifically, these theories emphasize that people’s behaviors (and, in the case of reasoned action, people’s behavioral intentions, in particular) are driven by the beliefs they hold about the behavior—including their evaluations of or attitudes toward the behavior, their perceptions of whether the behavior is normative, and their judgments about their capacity to perform the behavior. Communication messages, including those in media, may be targeted to change these beliefs (Fishbein &amp; Yzer, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0025">2003</link>). For example, one study applied the Reasoned Action Approach by randomizing American Indian youth to view a culturally resonant message about tobacco use and then measuring their attitudes (instrumental and experimental), norms (injunctive and descriptive), and perceptions of autonomy and capacity (self‐efficacy perceptions)—all theoretical factors known to shape behavioral intentions (Yzer et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0088">2021</link>). A campaign related to the Health Belief Model’s construct of perceived susceptibility might similarly be used to increase youth’s perceptions of the harms of e‐cigarettes.</para>

            <emphasis>Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)</emphasis> (see <ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>)—often considered an “interpersonal” model—suggests that people can learn why and how to perform a behavior by observing others. As part of this process, people rely on their perceptions of outcome expectations (judgments about the consequences of performing a behavior) and self‐efficacy (perceived capability or confidence in performing a behavior); cognitive capabilities, such as the ability to derive meaning from symbols, also support learning through observation (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0007">1986</link>). Perhaps the most important implications of SCT for understanding the effects of health communication are the concepts of self‐efficacy and modeling. For example, as described later in this chapter, actors who smoke on‐screen are modeling a risk behavior for young audiences, typically in the absence of negative health consequences.</para>

         <anchor id="ch0032s0000a0019"/>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0017">Information processing theories focus on the cognitive pathways through which media messages may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to changes in attitudes or reinforce existing attitudes; they also can explain the process through which people select into receiving messages in the first place. There are several relevant theories. The most commonly used are dual process models, such as the<emphasis>Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)</emphasis> (Petty &amp; Cacioppo, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0066">1986</link>), and the <emphasis>Heuristic‐Systematic Processing Model (HSM)</emphasis> (Chaiken et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0015">1989</link>). Both models suggest that persuasive messages, such as antismoking messages, are processed in either of two ways. A central or a systematic processing route involves the deliberate, thoughtful weighing of message arguments (e.g., the health reasons for quitting smoking), and the attitude changes accompanying such processing are likely to be more enduring (e.g., positive attitudes toward quitting, which can prompt quit attempts). In contrast, peripheral or heuristic processing occurs under conditions of low motivation and ability, where the recipient relies on peripheral cues (e.g., the celebrity status of a spokesperson for a youth antivaping campaign), and any resultant attitude change tends to be shortlived.</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0018">Certain individual characteristics, such as personality traits, values, emotional arousal, and ideology or worldviews, can affect how information in communication is processed. Understanding such audience characteristics allows message designers to target messages more effectively. For instance, researchers have examined the match between message content and the values orientation of audiences, generally finding that messages that resonate with particular social or political values are more persuasive (Shen &amp; Edwards,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0069">2005</link>). Research on the concept of <emphasis>reactance</emphasis> (Brehm, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0013">1966</link>) suggests that any persuasive message (particularly one that threatens individuals’ perceptions of freedom) may arouse a motivation, called reactance, to reject the advocacy (Dillard &amp; Shen, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0020">2005</link>). For example, there is some evidence that smokers’ reactance to graphic health warnings on tobacco packaging can weaken the impact of these warnings on intentions to quit smoking (Hall et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0037">2018</link>). Psychological reactance has also been found to be related to reduced mask‐wearing during the COVID‐19 pandemic (Young et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0086">2022</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0019">The theory of biased processing (also known as<emphasis>motivated reasoning</emphasis>) offers a complementary explanation to reactance, explaining that people are motivated to evaluate the strength and credibility of messages differently depending on their predisposing attitudes and beliefs (Taber &amp; Lodge, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0073">2006</link>). For instance, people respond in different or opposing ways to messages about a sugar‐sweetened beverage tax, based on predisposing ideological beliefs about taxation (Gollust et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0031">2017</link>). Evidence also suggests that people evaluate messages about <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=737">breast cancer</ulink> screening overdiagnosis differently based on their past routines of screening (Nagler et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0057">2017</link>). Research also demonstrates biased selection into messages in the media: people seek out media sources that they expect will be more concordant with their worldviews (Stroud, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0071">2011</link>). As we describe below in the COVID‐19 application, motivated reasoning also may help explain the emergence of polarized responses to information about COVID‐19.</para>

         <para id="ch0032s0000p0020">Research on message effects examines how the format and content of messages interact with audience characteristics to influence information processing and impact. Several theoretical approaches—including framing and narrative persuasion—speak to commonly investigated elements of messaging that have major public health implications and applications.</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0021">
            <emphasis>Framing</emphasis> has multiple definitions that originate from multiple disciplines, but communication scholars generally refer to two. First, framing can refer to presenting logically equivalent information in different ways (“<emphasis>equivalency frames</emphasis>”), as Tversky and Kahneman did in framing disease risk information in terms of “lives lost” or “lives gained” (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0075">1981</link>). This work launched a productive research agenda on gain/loss framing (see, e.g., Rothman et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0067">2006</link>) that examines the effects of health messages framed positively or negatively and that continues to this day. Another type of equivalency frame can be seen in a study that showed differences in risk perception by racial group when researchers examined the effects of a health‐disparity statistic presented on its own (e.g., risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for Black teen girls) versus presenting that same statistic as a comparison (e.g., risk of STIs for Black versus White teen girls) (Bigman, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0010">2014</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0022">A second common definition of issue framing (also known as “<emphasis>emphasis framing</emphasis>”) refers to messages that emphasize specific problem definitions, often invoking the cause of, groups affected by, solutions to, and moral valence of a particular issue in society (Entman, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0023">1993</link>). For instance, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink> might be framed as a problem of individuals behaving poorly (failing to diet, failing to exercise) or as a problem of an obesogenic environment characterized by social inequities that constrain individual opportunities to make healthy choices (Barry et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0008">2013</link>). Such frames can activate underlying attitudes about who is responsible for addressing the health issue. Another feature of messaging related to emphasis framing is the inclusion of brief anecdotes, which are often included in media depictions of health issues and that can raise similar concerns of contributing to an individualized, versus structural, understanding of social issues.</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0023">In contrast to message framing,<emphasis>narratives</emphasis> are powerful message structures for packaging more comprehensive health information (Hinyard &amp; Kreuter, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0039">2007</link>). When health information is conveyed in a story (including characters, plot, conflict, and resolution), audiences may be more likely to engage in a target behavior or change their attitudes than when information is communicated through more traditional didactic messages and formats (i.e., statistics or evidence; exhortations or arguments) (Braddock &amp; Dillard, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0012">2016</link>). The persuasive potential of narrative interventions is supported by social cognitive theory (as described briefly above and in <ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>): by observing a modeled behavior (even if conveyed as fictional), individuals are more likely to attempt it. Narrative persuasion may be particularly effective for health behaviors that individuals are likely to resist, such as getting <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14154">vaccines</ulink> or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> screenings (Hinyard &amp; Kreuter, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0039">2007</link>). The process of “<emphasis>transportation</emphasis>” (Green &amp; Brock, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0036">2000</link>) explains why narratives are likely to be effective: When individuals become immersed in a narrative’s plot and/or characters, they are less likely to resist a message because they may not necessarily identify its persuasive intent; also, they become so absorbed by the emotional aspects of the story that they have reduced motivation and ability to counterargue.</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0024">Recent research has explored how narratives can communicate about the social determinants of health and health equity while avoiding the trap described earlier of leading readers to overly focus on individual considerations and personal responsibility (Niederdeppe et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0061">2008</link>). This body of research suggests that stories have promise in influencing how audiences think about the determinants of health and shape their opinions about policies that target those factors, although these stories must be constructed carefully. For example, these stories should acknowledge individual choices within the context of the social and environmental barriers that shape those choices, explain how the story applies to other people and groups, and articulate policy solutions to the health problems that the narrative’s character faces (Niederdeppe et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0063">2015</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0064">2021</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0032s0000p0026">Media effects also occur at the societal level, where they are not seen as effects on a given individual’s cognitions or behavior, but rather, as effects on how society, or people at large, view the world. For example, media exposure can inform what issues people think are important, and how they think about those issues; it can even shape their perceptions of social reality. There are also theoretical perspectives that underscore how communication and media exposure can have differential effects across social groups, directly connecting communication research with health equity priorities. Several of these theories and perspectives are reviewed below and summarized in<link linkend="ch0032s0000a0012">Table 17.1</link>.</para>

         <para id="ch0032s0000p0027">While media influence (like framing effects, described above) happens at the individual level, these effects, in aggregate, can also have societal‐level implications so they can be considered cross‐level phenomena. Communication researchers have long focused on the influence of media on mass public opinion, especially in politics and policymaking. Early media scholars, such as Walter Lippman described the news media’s behavior as a “restless searchlight,” panning from one issue to the next while seldom lingering on any single issue (Lippman,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0052">1922</link>). Later researchers such as Bernard Berelson noted that while the media influence public opinion, the reverse is also true: public opinion drives what the media report (Berelson, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0009">1948</link>). Paul Lazarsfeld and colleagues noted that media attention confers status upon issues and raises their importance (Lazarsfeld et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0048">1968</link>). These insights coalesced in the 1970s, with a focus on the media’s powerful role in setting the public agenda of important issues and problems (McCombs &amp; Shaw, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0054">1972</link>). Gerald Kosicki later identified three types of <emphasis>agenda‐setting</emphasis> research: (1) public agenda setting, which examines the link between media portrayal of issues and issue priorities assigned by the public; (2) policy agenda setting, which examines the connection between media coverage and the legislative agenda of policymakers; and (3) media agenda setting, which focuses on factors that influence whether and how the media cover certain issues (Kosicki, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0045">1993</link>). Subsequent research further refined agenda‐setting theory, as initial correlational studies gave way to more empirically sophisticated designs that enabled clearer causal links and stronger conceptualizations (McCombs &amp; Valenzuela, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0055">2020</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0028">Researchers now agree that the media not only tell us what is important in a general way, but they also provide ways of thinking about specific issues by the signs, symbols, terms, and sources they use to define the issue in the first place. This perspective—that the media do not simply tell us what to think<emphasis>about</emphasis>, but also what to think—has been broadly referred to as framing (similar to issue framing described above, but at the aggregate level). In this view, public problems are social constructions (Borah, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0011">2011</link>). That is, groups, institutions, and advocates are in competition to identify problems, move them onto the public agenda, and define them, in competition across spatial contexts and over time (Druckman, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0022">2022</link>). This view suggests that the media’s agenda‐setting function is not independent but is in fact shaped by various community groups, institutions, and advocates, which has implications for those in public health who seek to use the media to raise public salience and awareness of specific problems. For example, although there is considerable evidence that immigration policy is a determinant of health, little is known about the mechanisms through which such policy shapes health processes and outcomes, such as health behaviors and care seeking. Guided by theories of agenda setting and issue framing, Trinidad Young and colleagues focused on one potential mechanism—news coverage of US immigration policy—by conducting a content analysis of such coverage during the 2010s. They found that most coverage focused on exclusionary immigration policies at the federal level, despite a marked increase in integration policies in recent years, with immigrants tending to be framed either negatively as criminals or positively as part of families (Young et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0087">2021</link>). By understanding these patterns in news coverage, advocates may be positioned to agitate for reporting that better reflects the current state of immigration policy and, in turn, bolster public support for policies that center on immigrant health and health equity.</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0029">Communication researchers increasingly consider the role of<emphasis>priming</emphasis> alongside agenda‐setting and framing effects (Scheufele &amp; Tewksbury, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0068">2006</link>). With roots in cognitive social psychology, priming refers to the activation of certain emotions, thoughts, or ideas that are embedded in our minds—specifically, in associative networks, or mental models that link together nodes, which represent concepts (Ewoldsen &amp; Rhodes, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0024">2020</link>). In psychology, an associative network that is activated can affect how subsequent concepts are evaluated; applied to communication research, media content can activate relevant networks, and this activation can have behavioral consequences. In the immigration policy example from above, for example, news media coverage could prime stereotypes of immigrants that already exist within people’s associative networks, and such activation could shape the way people think about immigration policy and, ultimately, whether they support efforts to advance immigrant health, with implications for political agenda‐setting at the societal level.</para>

         <para id="ch0032s0000p0030">By the 1960s, television had replaced radio as the new medium of the day, and its presence in homes across the US raised concerns about its impact, especially the effects of televised violence on children. In 1968, George Gerbner was appointed by President Johnson’s National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence to study the content of television programs. Thus began Gerbner’s long‐running Cultural Indicators project, which assessed both the prevalence and nature of violence portrayals (“message system analysis”) and whether exposure to such portrayals might shape people’s perceptions of the world (“cultivation analysis”). The theory of<emphasis>cultivation</emphasis> emerged from this research program, positing that habitual television exposure shapes people’s beliefs about the nature of the world (Gerbner et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0029">1980</link>), and that the heavier that exposure, the more likely a person is to subscribe to television’s version of social reality (Gerbner et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0030">2002</link>). One of the project’s most compelling findings was that heavy television viewing was associated with an overestimation of crime and violence—or, put another way, the belief that the world was a mean and dangerous place (“mean world <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5801">syndrome</ulink>”) (Gerbner et al. <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0029">1980</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0031">Fundamentally, cultivation is a theory about dominant media rather than about television, specifically. It suggests that the messages (or, in Gerbner’s terms, the message systems) to which we are exposed—repetitively, cumulatively, over the long term—shape our perceptions of social reality. Thus, cultivation is no less relevant today, despite the differences between the current media ecosystem and the one that existed when cultivation research began. That said, recent research has focused less on generalized television media exposure than content‐ or genre‐specific exposure. For example, studies have linked local television news viewing in particular with fatalistic beliefs about <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> prevention (see, e.g., Niederdeppe et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0062">2010</link>). From a public health perspective, cultivation theory underscores the notion that health messages, both planned and unplanned, can operate as a set and offer a prevailing view of the world. A media campaign about a given health behavior therefore does not operate in a vacuum, but as part of a complex message ecosystem.</para>

         <para id="ch0032s0000p0032">There are two primary strands of media effects research that foreground issues of health equity. The first is research on communication inequalities, which has historical roots in the knowledge gap hypothesis; the second is research on communicating about health inequity.</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0033">Conventional wisdom once held that persistent social problems could be resolved through public education alone. Yet, with the work of Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien in the 1970s, it became clear that knowledge and information are unequally distributed across population groups. Referring to this observation as the<emphasis>knowledge gap hypothesis</emphasis>, they proposed that an increasing flow of information into a social system (from a media campaign, for example) would be more likely to benefit groups of higher socioeconomic status (SES) than those of lower SES (Tichenor et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0074">1970</link>). In other words, increasing the information available in the system would only exacerbate existing differences in knowledge between these groups. The disturbing implication of this research was that media campaigns would actually perpetuate inequities. This implication is also at the core of the related theory in public health that posits that social conditions are a “fundamental cause” of disease because better social conditions convey resources (including access to health information, but also power, money, access to care, and other advantages) that contribute to better health (Link &amp; Phelan, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0051">1995</link>).</para>
         <para id="ch0032s0000p0034">The knowledge gap hypothesis was one of the first theoretical perspectives in the media effects tradition to draw attention to the role of the social environment in shaping media influence (Viswanath &amp; Finnegan,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0078">1996</link>)—and it attracted the attention of scholars and policymakers alike. For instance, Viswanath’s early research applied the knowledge gap hypothesis in the health context (Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0079">1991</link>), but ultimately he broadened the concept to include inequalities across other communication dimensions. And so emerged a body of research that systematically documents a broad range of <emphasis>communication inequalities</emphasis>, defined as (1) differences among social groups in the generation, manipulation, and distribution of information at the institutional level, and (2) differences among social groups in their ability to access, process, retain, and act on information at the individual level (Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0081">2022</link>). Communication inequalities at the institutional level have been observed among organizations. For example, consider the marketing and promotional budgets of the tobacco industry ($8.2 billion in 2019 in the United States alone; CDC, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0014">2021</link>) and food and beverage industry (estimated at $1.8 billion in the United States in 2009 in marketing to children and adolescents; <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=FTC">FTC</ulink>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0027">2012</link>), and contrast these to the limited communication capacity of community‐based organizations working to prevent tobacco use or promote healthy eating among youth. At the individual level, studies show the pervasiveness of communication inequalities across several dimensions, including information access and processing (e.g., <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Lin">Lin</ulink> et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0050">2014</link>), information avoidance (e.g., McCloud et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0053">2013</link>), and differential effects of communication interventions (e.g., Lee et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0049">2022</link>). Unfortunately, such inequalities have become more pronounced during the COVID‐19 pandemic (Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0080">2020</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0032s0000p0035">A second strand of research on communication and health equity builds upon this work by considering how communication can be leveraged to alleviate health inequities. Specifically, research in this space has focused on how strategic communication can (1) raise public awareness of health inequities (which remains low, particularly for disparities by race and income; Gollust et al.,<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0032">2022</link>), (2) shape perceptions that such inequities are serious and should be addressed, (3) influence beliefs about who or what is responsible for such inequities, (4) promote support for policies that could reduce inequities, and (5) mobilize key <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink> and groups to advocate for social change (Niederdeppe et al., <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0060">2013</link>).

(<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0064">2021</link>) tested several evidence‐based strategies to generate public support for investments in early childhood education, finding that policy narratives—“short stories with a setting, characters, and a plot that unfolds over time and offers a policy solution to a social problem” (p. 1088)—may be a promising message strategy, particularly for persuading people who are inclined to oppose such policies.</para>
