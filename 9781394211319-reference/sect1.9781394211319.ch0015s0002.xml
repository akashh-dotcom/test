   <para>Ecological models do not propose a specific set of constructs, with hypothesized directional relationships among those constructs. For this reason, we refer to ecological<emphasis>models</emphasis> or <emphasis>frameworks</emphasis>, rather than ecological <emphasis>theories</emphasis>. Ecological models are centered on a hierarchical organization of broad influences on behavior (see <anchor id="ch0015s0000a0010"/>
      <link linkend="ch0015s0000a0013">Figure 3.1</link>). These levels, as they are typically called, of the ecological model, broadly include the following:</para>

   <para id="ch0015s0000p0021">Note that we have included an additional, distal level to this version of the Ecological Model focused on planetary factors. There is growing evidence of the multiple influences that things like the weather and climate (including climate change and its determinants, like carbon emissions) can have on health behaviors and outcomes (Marinova &amp; Bogueva,<link linkend="ch0015s0000li0042">2019</link>; Santos et al., <link linkend="ch0015s0000li0053">2021</link>; Sorensen et al., <link linkend="ch0015s0000li0055">2018</link>). For example, extreme weather events resulting from climate change can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to food shortages, which, in turn, can have an impact on food insecurity and food‐purchasing and consumption behaviors (Leisner, <link linkend="ch0015s0000li0039">2020</link>). Also, the term “environment” can be used in different ways to describe different levels of ecological models. For instance, many researchers define the built <emphasis>environment</emphasis> of neighborhoods or cities as a specific level of interest (Mahmoudi &amp; Zhang, <link linkend="ch0015s0000li0041">2020</link>), which is usually best fitting under the broader umbrella of community/societal level factors, while we describe global <emphasis>environmental</emphasis> or planetary factors as a more distal level of influence. An implicit underpinning of the idea of including the “planetary level” is that human behavior over time has contributed to many important changes in the natural environment.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0015s0000a0014"/>
      <link linkend="ch0015s0000a0016">Table 3.1</link> provides definitions of key concepts for understanding ecological models. Scholars have chosen various terms to name the levels of the ecological model; these names may or may not be identical to our chosen terminology for this chapter. However, they are usually consistent. Possible differences across versions of the ecological model should, however, be seen as a feature of ecological models. This is an example of their flexibility and adaptability to the specific circumstances of settings and health behaviors.</para>
   <para id="ch0015s0000p0023">Although the term<emphasis>hierarchical</emphasis> is used above to describe the organization of the ecological model, ecological models do not assert that any level is more or less important in terms of its potential influence on the behavior at hand. Rather, the term <emphasis>hierarchical</emphasis> is in reference to how proximal or distant the given factor is to the individual level. Importantly, not only do ecological models posit that factors at higher levels affect the behavior of individuals, but they also assume that the components of the higher levels of the model (e.g., policies of an organization, state or country; or the social and physical assets of a neighborhood) can be changed by groups of individuals, and often, by their collective health behaviors. This bidirectional interdependence is referred to as reciprocal determinism, a concept that is well known to many readers from its use in Social Cognitive Theory (see <ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>).</para>

               <entry>Ecological models organize the influences of health behavior “hierarchically,” from those most internal to an individual to those most external: intrapersonal, interpersonal, community/societal, policy, and planetary. The term “hierarchical” does not imply that one level is more important than another one, but rather, denotes proximity or distance to the individual.</entry>

   <para id="ch0015s0000p0024">Also inherent to the idea of ecological models is that these models are not merely convenient ways of organizing discrete influences on behavior. Rather, ecological models assume that, for virtually any health behavior, there will be interactions among the various levels. That is, the effects of factors within a certain level do not operate on health behavior in isolation; instead, they influence each other, and together, they influence the health behavior at hand (Van Dyck et al.,<link linkend="ch0015s0000li0060">2014</link>). The interactive nature of influences from multiple levels highlights the insufficiency of merely knowing a health behavior is influenced by factors at multiple levels: rather, interventions must be designed to account for these factors.</para>
