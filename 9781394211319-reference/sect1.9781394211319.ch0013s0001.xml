   <para id="ch0013s0000p0007">Substantial suffering, premature mortality, and medical costs can be avoided by positive changes in behavior at multiple levels. During the past 30 years, there has been a dramatic increase in public, private, and professional interest and investment in preventing disability and death through changes in lifestyle and increasing participation in screening programs. Much of the interest in disease prevention and early detection was stimulated by the growth of noncommunicable diseases around the world, while injuries and old and emerging infections continue to pose growing threats to health. Risks associated with the highest number of deaths worldwide now include behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink> use, and dietary risks; child and maternal <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9459">malnutrition</ulink>; unhealthy air; and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">chronic disease</ulink> risk factors and conditions such as <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4356">obesity</ulink>, kidney dysfunction, and elevated <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> pressure, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13529">glucose</ulink>, and lipids. Leading causes of disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) are <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2605">heart disease</ulink>, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8963">stroke</ulink>, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink>, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3605">lung diseases</ulink>, road injuries, neonatal disorders, and congenital <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=12">birth defects</ulink> (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation,<link linkend="ch0013s0000li0040">2020</link>). Global aging is bringing rapidly escalating healthcare costs and large increases in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1407">dementia</ulink>, currently the seventh highest cause of death, with catastrophic costs (World Health Organization, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0058">2023a</link>).</para>

   <para id="ch0013s0000p0008">Country and global population health goals are an essential part of strategies to improve health behavior and health. Landmark reports in Canada and the United States during the 1970s and 1980s heralded the commitment of governments to health education and promotion (Epp,<link linkend="ch0013s0000li0036">1986</link>; Lalonde, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0044">1974</link>; U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0054">1979</link>). In the United States, federal initiatives for public health education and monitoring population‐wide behavior patterns were spurred by the development of the <emphasis>Health Objectives for the Nation</emphasis> (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0051">1980</link>) and their successors that have been released each decade (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0052">2023</link>). International agencies have drawn attention to the global burden of diseases and health inequalities (World Health Organization, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0057">2014</link>) as have the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), released in 2015 (United Nations, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0050">2023</link>). Several of the SDGs focus specifically on health and health‐related behaviors, including zero hunger, clean <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> and sanitation, climate action, reduced inequalities, and the broad category of good health and well‐being (United Nations, <link linkend="ch0013s0000li0050">2023</link>). Increased interest in behavioral and social determinants of health behavior change has spawned numerous training programs and public and commercial service programs.</para>
