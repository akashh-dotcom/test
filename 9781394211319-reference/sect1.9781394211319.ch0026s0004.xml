   <para id="ch0026s0000p0027">The application of frameworks that consider how environmental factors, discrimination, or adverse childhood experiences (APA,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0015">2017</link>) influence <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and coping mechanisms may provide critically important information to inform the development of individual‐ and system‐level interventions to prevent or reduce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and promote adaptive coping responses.</para>
   <para id="ch0026s0000p0028">Emerging research on moderators and mediators of the relationships of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, coping, and well‐being can offer promise for developing effective interventions across the lifespan. In this section, we discuss examples of how research on <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, coping, and health has been applied empirically toward this goal. We describe the value of mindfulness‐based approaches to address <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> responses and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related biobehavioral risk factors for adverse health conditions (Woods‐Giscombe &amp; Gaylord,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0091">2014</link>; Woods‐Giscombe et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0093">2019b</link>).</para>

      <anchor id="ch0026s0000a0032"/>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0029">The Superwoman Schema (SWS) Conceptual Framework and the subsequently developed SWS Questionnaire were informed by Woods‐Giscombe’s series of quantitative and qualitative investigations of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, coping, and health (Giscombe &amp; Lobel,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0047">2005</link>; Woods‐Giscombe, 2010). The framework grew out of research on contextually relevant operationalizations of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and coping (Woods‐Giscombe &amp; Gaylord, 2014; Woods‐Giscombe &amp; Lobel, 2005, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0095">2008</link>), and has led to the development of culturally tailored, mind‐body interventions to reduce risk for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">chronic illness</ulink>. Early observational research with 189 African American women from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds demonstrated how <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> related to racism and gender‐related <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> contribute to outcomes that include psychological and physical symptoms (Woods‐Giscombe &amp; Lobel, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0095">2008</link>). This research suggested that interventions to reduce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related disparities may be more effective if they specifically target race‐related and gender‐related stressors. Gender‐related <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> was defined not just as sexism, but as a culturally nuanced interaction between exposure to stressors and historical and socially sanctioned reactions to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> that influence coping responses such as perceived obligations to project an image of strength and the suppression of emotions—collectively described as the SWS.</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0030">According to the SWS framework, historical and sociocultural events in the United States related to gender and race have resulted in the development of five characteristics among African American women that manifest as a superwoman role, including (1) a perceived obligation to manifest an image of strength; (2) a perceived obligation to suppress emotions; (3) resistance to being vulnerable or dependent; (4) determination to succeed, even in the face of limited resources; and (5) a perceived obligation to help others. More specifically, this framework posits that factors such as a historical legacy of racial or gender stereotyping or oppression, lessons from foremothers about how to manage these experiences, a history of disappointment or abuse influenced by chronic socioeconomic deprivation, and spiritual values all contribute to the development of the SWS and role manifestation. The SWS characteristics help women with the preservation of self, family, and community. Otherwise stated, SWS is a survival tactic.</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0031">SWS characteristics are associated with objectively measured physiological and behavioral risk factors for chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and autoimmune conditions (Allen et al.,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0013">2019</link>; Woods‐Giscombe et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0090">2019a</link>). Endorsement of SWS characteristics has been associated with adverse outcomes such as postponement of self‐care, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related eating, interpersonal conflict, disturbance in sleep quality or quantity, psychological distress, anxiety, and depression (Sheffield‐Abdullah &amp; Woods‐Giscombe, 2021; Woods‐Giscombé, 2010).</para>

      <para id="ch0026s0000p0032">The emergence of mind‐body practices such as Mindfulness‐Based <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">Stress</ulink> Reduction, Relaxation Response (described above) (Benson &amp; Klipper<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0018">2000</link>; Kabat‐Zinn, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0053">2005</link>) and the promotion of positive emotions as a method of fostering healthy coping and well‐being (Frederickson, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0042">1998</link>) can be used as a foundation for health‐promoting interventions. These concepts have been translated into community‐based programs and population‐level interventions, with the aim of reducing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related risk factors and health inequities among racial minorities and other marginalized groups (Woods‐Giscombe et al., <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0090">2019a</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0033">The “We Can Prevent <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">Diabetes</ulink>” study (Woods‐Giscombe et al.,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0093">2019b</link>) was a randomized controlled, feasibility study that integrated mindfulness meditation into a conventional behavioral lifestyle intervention. This study examined whether addressing psychological stressors with a mindfulness‐based intervention would improve individuals’ ability to engage in and sustain healthy eating and physical activity. Sixty‐eight African American adults were randomized into one of two groups that each participated in a 4‐hour retreat, eight weekly intervention sessions, and six weekly booster sessions (a total of 33 hours). The control group focused on information and behavior change skills, while the mindfulness program included an adapted mindfulness‐based <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> reduction training component in addition to conventional <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> risk‐reduction education.</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0034">Findings showed that both groups had reduced hemoglobin A1C, indicating successful risk reduction. However, respondents who also received the mindfulness‐<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> management component reported trends toward enhanced peacefulness; lower <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>; and lower fat, carbohydrate, and calorie intake; and lower body mass index (Woods‐Giscombe et al.,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0093">2019b</link>). The SWS Conceptual Framework and the subsequently developed SWS Questionnaire were informed by Woods‐Giscombe’s series of quantitative and qualitative investigations of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, coping, and health (Giscombe &amp; Lobel, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0047">2005</link>; Woods‐Giscombe, 2010; Woods‐Giscombe &amp; Lobel, <link linkend="ch0026s0000li0095">2008</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0026s0000p0035">Findings from this study were used to develop a more nuanced, culturally tailored behavioral lifestyle program called “Harmony” to reduce biobehavioral factors associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in African American women. The “Harmony” intervention program is being tested in a randomized trial with 200 women to assess its efficacy for self‐care and behavioral change to reduce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related risk factors for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">chronic illness</ulink> in African American women over 10 months of intervention (Woods‐Giscombe &amp; Gaylord,<link linkend="ch0026s0000li0092">2022</link>). We hypothesize that the evidence‐based, culturally tailored “Harmony” intervention will support women’s goals to be healthier by enhancing their abilities to practice mindfulness, self‐compassion, and self‐care in the context of social stressors known to increase risk for cardiometabolic conditions.</para>
