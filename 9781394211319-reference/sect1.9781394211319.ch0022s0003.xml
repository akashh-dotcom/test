   <title>Stress, Coping Adaptation, and Health Behavior</title>

   <para id="ch0022s0000p0015">The experience of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> is pervasive, and its potential adverse effects on health are well‐known. In<ulink url="ch0026">Chapter 12</ulink>, Woods‐Giscombe and Bey describe the challenges in studying <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, since it is “referred to as a stimulus, a response, and an interaction.”</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0016">The authors propose that <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> affects health through two pathways. The first, the behavioral pathway, opens possibilities of how the different strategies people use to cope with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> influence the negative or positive impact that <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> has on health. They explicitly mention the importance of culture‐specific coping strategies. Second is a physiological pathway that affects the body’s physiological conditions or systems including hormones and the well‐known allostatic load (McEwen,<link linkend="ch0022s0000li0010">2012</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0017">New to this edition is the focus on stressors that stem from racism, discrimination, and inequalities (see<ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink>). Giscombe‐Woods and Bey assert that even though the effects of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> on health and the importance of coping strategies to buffer <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>’s impact on health are well‐established, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> among racial and ethnic minorities is understudied. Some exposures to stressors persist for long periods of time while others are of short <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10481">duration</ulink>. The experience of racism is often persistent over time and across contexts, resulting in profound physiological and psychological changes (Krieger, <link linkend="ch0022s0000li0008">2014</link>; Kwate and Goodman, <link linkend="ch0022s0000li0009">2015</link>). In contrast, daily hassles might include getting caught in traffic or having an argument, and these types of stressors usually manifest less intense, shorter‐<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10481">duration</ulink> responses.</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0018">The authors assert that measures of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> that account for stressors from identifying with a racial or ethnic minority group are more robust than generic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> measures. <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">Stress</ulink> research, including concepts of “weathering” and “John Henryism” provides a more complete understanding of the impact of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and stressors on health of minorities and health inequities.<emphasis>Weathering</emphasis> posits that the impact of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> on African American women is cumulative, stemming from experiences of exclusion from social, political, and economic opportunities. Thus, they argue that <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> experienced by African American women is gendered. On the other hand, <emphasis>John Henryism</emphasis> draws attention to the adequacy of resources and hypothesizes and high degree of coping through hard work under high <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and limited resources could <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to unhealthy outcomes. Some studies show that the John Henryism type of coping may also be protective. How <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> affects different racial and ethnic minorities and how it is gendered remains an important area of inquiry.</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0019">The authors also review frameworks that focus on adoption of different types of coping strategies against <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, including contemplative practices, such as mindfulness, positive emotions, spirituality, and religion (Davidson,<link linkend="ch0022s0000li0005">2021</link>). Turning to specific interventions, the authors draw on the <emphasis>Superwoman Schema</emphasis> (SWS) to explain <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and coping among African American women. The SWS is characterized by expectations to project strength, suppression of emotions, and determination to succeed despite the odds and obligation to help others. High scores on SWS question items are associated with higher <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, and the authors are developing interventions drawing on mindfulness to cope with it.</para>
