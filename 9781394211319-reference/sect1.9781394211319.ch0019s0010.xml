      <para id="ch0019s0000p0002">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a family disease not because of its hereditary component but due to the emotional and other challenges families face watching a loved one’s cognitive decline. Having a family history of AD is one reason people may participate in AD research. Unfortunately, there are not nearly enough volunteers, especially from historically underrepresented groups who are at higher risk of developing AD. For example, Black adults are twice as likely to have AD compared to their non‐Hispanic white counterparts; Hispanic adults are 1.5 times as likely. Research to develop improved prevention, treatment, and care for AD is advancing, but it could be accelerated by having more diverse study participants. Diversifying prevention and clinical trial participation in medical research is a priority, with both scientific and ethical justification. Efforts to recruit participants should be based on an understanding of different beliefs and motivations that can inform recruitment efforts and promote enrollment. Researchers and practitioners can use health behavior theories for that purpose. They offer a framework to identify individual‐level determinants specific to specific groups—such as specific racial or ethnic groups, genders, or political identifications—that may predict and explain participation. More importantly, they provide a structure to identify salient group‐specific modifiable beliefs that can be used to design effective messaging about participating in AD research and build an evidence base to advance the science of recruitment. The theories described in this chapter—Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM), and Reasoned Action Approach (RAA)—offer frameworks that can help understand and address challenges like this.</para>
