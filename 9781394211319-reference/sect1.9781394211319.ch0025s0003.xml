   <para id="ch0025s0000p0047">SNT has been applied to many health areas and other domains. SNA can be applied to any discipline or health issue, including individual behavior, organizational performance, interorganizational relations, policy diffusion, service delivery improvements, community‐based participatory research, and so on. SNA also provides useful tools for measuring key constructs in other theories. For example, the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior include constructs, such as normative beliefs, that influence decisions to engage in behaviors (see<ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 6</ulink>). In this chapter, network theory is applied to contraceptive decision‐making among women in developing countries and adolescent tobacco/<ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=3261">nicotine</ulink> use, two important <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10536">public health issues</ulink>.</para>

      <para id="ch0025s0000p0048">Many factors influence whether and how many children a couple will have. These factors can be classified into “supply versus demand” or “economic versus sociocultural.” People may know how babies are made, but regulating how many children to have has been an evolving concept, one most effectively aided by use of modern contraceptives. The development, supply, and diffusion of contraceptives are of major public health importance and have generated considerable academic study. Social networks are also a frequently cited source of information and influence on contraceptive choices.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0049">An early, foundational, study applying SNT to understand the adoption and diffusion of contraceptive use was conducted among women in 25 Korean villages. This study showed that individual contraceptive use by individuals was correlated with use by their network partners (Rogers &amp; Kincaid,<link linkend="ch0025s0000li0046">1981</link>). In alignment with these findings, subsequent studies have continued to demonstrate that women’s social networks influence their decisions to use contraceptive methods in many developing countries (Comfort et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0023">2021</link>). These studies show that women are aware of and use the same methods as their friends (Valente et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0058">1997</link>), and women who report being encouraged to use methods by their friends are more likely to use them (Gayen &amp; Raeside, <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0030">2010</link>; Valente et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0058">1997</link>). Since contraception use is not easily or directly observable by researchers, information about how women obtain and use contraception must often be transmitted via informal conversations.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0050">A person’s close social network and larger community network also can influence other factors related to family planning, such as when to have children. A study exploring high rates of adolescent pregnancy in Honduras examined network factors associated with adolescent childbirth in 176 villages (Shakya et al.,<link linkend="ch0025s0000li0049">2019</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0048">2020</link>). Each village was considered its own network, from which the researchers collected complete census data on social network connections, attitudes, and norms regarding adolescent pregnancy. Participants were asked questions about their social relationships and to name individuals in their village. They were then asked normative questions about pregnancy, such as, “At what age is it OK for a girl to have her first baby?” The outcome of interest, adolescent childbirth, included any female participants who had given birth before age twenty.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0051">Several personal and community network factors were associated with increased risk of adolescent childbirth in these villages. First, village norms regarding adolescent childbirth were associated significantly with an adolescent’s risk of pregnancy, but there were differences based on network cohesion. Cohesion, or density of a social network, is calculated as the number of social ties out of the total number of possible ties (Valente,<link linkend="ch0025s0000li0054">2010</link>). In low‐cohesion villages, if 40% of the community supported or approved of adolescent childbirth, then, an adolescent woman’s risk was 17%; however, in high‐density villages with the same level of approval, an adolescent woman’s risk was 35% (Shakya et al. <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0049">2019</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0052">Second, a woman’s personal social network also was associated with her probability of pregnancy. Even when controlling for village‐level norms, if someone in a woman’s proximal social network gave birth as an adolescent, this increased her own risk for adolescent childbirth. This association was stronger for closer relationships and social contacts closer in age. However, if a woman still had a father in her social network, this was a protective factor and reduced her probability of adolescent pregnancy (Shakya et al.,<link linkend="ch0025s0000li0048">2020</link>). These studies illustrate how the attitudes and behaviors of individuals in our personal networks can affect health risks and outcomes. They also suggest the importance of considering the larger social network in which people are embedded, as societal norms can also strongly influence perceptions and behaviors.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0025s0003a0003"/>

      <para id="ch0025s0000p0053">Electronic <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=3261">nicotine</ulink> delivery systems, also known as e‐cigarettes, e‐cigs, or vapes, have become extremely popular recently and are a global public health concern. According to results from the Global Youth Tobacco Surveys, the overall pooled estimates for adolescent e‐cigarette awareness and ever‐use were 56.7% and 20.2%. The World Health Organization (<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10051">WHO</ulink>) regions with the highest e‐cigarette ever‐use rates among youth were the European Region (34.5%), the South‐East Asian Region (20.5%), and the Region of the Americas (18.7%) (Sreeramareddy et al.,<link linkend="ch0025s0000li0051">2022</link>). E‐cigarette use has continued to increase rapidly and is the most used tobacco product among adolescents. In the United States, 14.1% of high school students and 3.3% of middle school students reported being current e‐cigarette users in 2022 (Cooper et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0025">2022</link>).</para>
      <anchor id="ch0025s0000a0037"/>
      <beginpage pagenum="147"/>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0054">E‐cigarettes are not only detrimental to health but are also correlated with initiation of combustible cigarette use among adolescents and young adults (Barrington‐Trimis et al.,<link linkend="ch0025s0000li0012">2016</link>). E‐cigarettes can contain higher levels of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=3261">nicotine</ulink>, are more addictive, and are often marketed to young audiences. Adolescents have more positive attitudes toward e‐cigarettes and perceive them as less harmful and more socially acceptable than combustible cigarettes. Evidence shows that e‐cigarettes are addictive and that e‐cigarette dependence strongly predicts continuation of use (Vogel et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0060">2020</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0055">SNA can help us understand the social mechanisms driving e‐cigarette use among adolescents and yield information that might be valuable in developing network‐based interventions. E‐cigarette use is likely driven by a combination of psychological, social, environmental, and systemic factors. During adolescence, the importance of friendships, social connections, and the desire to fit in may exacerbate the effects of friends’ opinions and behaviors on individual behavior. Prior social network research has shown that having friends who smoke is associated with individuals’ cigarette use (Alexander et al.,<link linkend="ch0025s0000li0009">2001</link>; Mercken et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0041">2010</link>). One of the first studies to demonstrate this association by Cheryl Alexander and colleagues showed that the risk of adolescent smoking increases with smoking prevalence in one’s social network. The odds of smoking are twice as high if one or two of a person’s best friends smoke (Alexander et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0009">2001</link>). E‐cigarettes are now more prevalent and popular than combustible tobacco among adolescents, which suggests that there are distinct differences in the social dynamics driving e‐cigarette use.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0056">Understanding social network dynamics is key to implementing effective interventions and curtailing the use of tobacco products among adolescents (Valente,<link linkend="ch0025s0000li0055">2012</link>). Preliminary studies have also begun to show potential for peer‐led interventions to reduce e‐cigarette use (Chu et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0022">2021</link>). A recent study recruited peer leaders in schools to model healthy norms and reduced acceptability or approval of vaping (Wyman et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0061">2021</link>). The leaders’ messages had relatively good exposure, but some vulnerable students, nonusers who reported being susceptible to e‐cigarette use, viewed the peer leaders’ message as less impactful. Recent vapers had greater exposure to other high‐risk students and to students who viewed vaping as minimally harmful, whereas students who had more peer‐leader friends were less likely to report recent vaping (Wyman et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0061">2021</link>). Understanding network dynamics is essential to designing effective interventions. In this study, network analysis revealed that clustering of high‐risk students might reinforce acceptability toward vaping. It also showed that students who are isolated from adults were at higher risk, and more likely to be recent e‐cigarette users. SNA provides insight into the diffusion of vaping attitudes and behaviors in the network and helps inform creation of interventions that strategically engage high‐risk groups.</para>

         <link linkend="ch0025s0000a0041">Figure 11.2</link> shows vaping prevalence among high school students at two time points from a network study. At the first time point, prevalence of vaping in the network was 42%, and at follow‐up, it had risen to 52%. The plot below shows students’ friendship networks and indicates which students have ever vaped (gray nodes) and which never vaped (clear nodes). Over time, vaping behavior has diffused through the network resulting in a 10‐percentage‐point increase at follow‐up.</para>

Subsequently, this student became a vaper at time two and named two new friends who were also vapers. These micro‐level analyses illustrate the role of network influence and network selection.</para>

      <para id="ch0025s0000p0059">Although these two applications provide ample evidence for network effects on health behaviors, there is still much work to be done. Estimating network influences can be a challenge due to the nonindependent nature of network data. Statistical regression approaches typically expect each unit in the database to be independent, and not connected to any other unit in the data. For network data, this assumption is explicitly violated. The problem is further compounded by the network properties of reciprocity, transitivity, and homophily, each of which provides alternative explanations for network effects. For example, if the data show that a smoker is more likely to have smoking friends, it does not necessarily indicate that the friends’ smoking has caused the smoking of the individual. Rather this smoking homophily could be a function of ethnicity if both the individual and network are homophilous with respect to ethnicity and smoking rates vary by ethnicity.</para>

      <para id="ch0025s0000p0060">To address these issues, network statisticians have developed several approaches that account for network structure in the estimation of network effects. The critical insight was to make the network the dependent variable, the outcome, and the behavior the independent variable. The two tools developed using this approach are exponential random graph models (ERGMs) (Robins et al.,<link linkend="ch0025s0000li0045">2007</link>), and stochastic actor‐oriented models (SAOMs) implemented in Rsiena (Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis) (Snijders et al., <link linkend="ch0025s0000li0050">2010</link>). Both models are implemented in the open‐source statistical system, R (CRAN).</para>

      <beginpage pagenum="148"/>
      <para id="ch0025s0000p0061">To estimate an ERGM, the researcher specifies the network and attributes of the nodes in the network, and optionally, attributes of the relationships in the network. For example, the network is a link list of the ID numbers for each relationship and separate fields for the type or strength of the relationship. In a separate file, the researcher stores the attributes of the nodes, characteristics such as age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and so on. The researcher then specifies a model of the theoretical relationships thought to be contained in the data such as whether there is reciprocity, transitivity, and homophily on various characteristics. The ERGM software as implemented in STATNET or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=7882">PNET</ulink> will indicate the magnitude and statistical significance of the effects specified in the model. SAOMs are estimated similarly, though the model specification process is a bit more complicated due to the longitudinal nature of the data. The science and theory of social networks have expanded greatly with the development of these tools because they have extended our theoretical thinking about how networks influence health behaviors and how network structure and behaviors co‐evolve.</para>
