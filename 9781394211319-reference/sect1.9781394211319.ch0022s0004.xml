   <para id="ch0022s0000p0020">If there is one defining theme of the chapters in this section, it is that the web of relationships in which we are embedded influences how we learn about the world, our emotional responses and feelings of belonging, the decisions we make, and how we cope with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. These chapters convey a rich understanding of the influence of interpersonal interactions on health and their underlying mechanisms of action. Even so, some important areas for further research remain. These include matching the best strategy to a given situation; expanding our understanding of the roles of social class, race, and ethnicity; intersectionality; and examining how new information and communication technologies (ICTs) affect social support, networks, and health behaviors. While many strategies to strengthen social relationships are available, there is little research to aid in deciding which strategy to use in any given situation.</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0021">The roles of social class, race, and ethnicity provide other fruitful avenues for inquiry. These three factors all influence interpersonal relationships, the support that we receive (or perceive), and the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> that we experience. The combined effect of class and race could be even more devastating to individual health than class or race alone (Williams et al.,<link linkend="ch0022s0000li0017">2019</link>). However, we are only now beginning to develop an understanding of how the accumulation of daily experiences due to racism or classism or intersections of race and ethnicity, class, place, and gender may affect health. Important questions to explore on this issue include: What are the effects, including cumulative effects, on interpersonal interactions and health at the intersection of class, race and ethnicity, and gender?</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0022">Platforms such as online support groups and social media have created important new opportunities for seeking and offering information and other types of support. However, the role of virtual social interactions and internet‐based exchange of social support is only beginning to be rigorously explored and evaluated. To what extent will computer‐mediated relationships prove to be health promoting? Will online communication increase the number of social relationships but reduce the quality or depth of those networks? Or is it creating an entirely new type of support that is enabled by the online domain? Can all the mechanisms introduced in this chapter for enhancing the health‐promoting aspects of social relationships take place in a virtual environment? How should virtual interventions be developed to be optimally effective? The chapter on social media in a later part of this book (<ulink url="ch0038">Chapter 22</ulink>) reviews some of this work, but the answers are elusive. Also, there are benefits of giving support, and this area requires further investigation. The entire area of study of ICTs in health can benefit from theories described in the chapters in this section. For whatever reason, research in ICT and health seldom draws from the work described here.</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0023">Models and theories of interpersonal influences on health behavior stand at the critical juncture where the social environment molds and modifies intraindividual factors, such as cognitions, emotions, and health behaviors. A thorough understanding and appreciation for issues at this level will assist in developing more effective interventions and policies to enhance individual and population health.</para>
