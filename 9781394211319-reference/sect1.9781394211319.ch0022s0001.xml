   <para id="ch0022s0000p0007">Holt‐Lunstad and Proctor (<ulink url="ch0024">Chapter 10</ulink>) provide a clear conceptualization of social support and summarize the empirical evidence linking social support to good health. A key point they make is that there is an important distinction between perceived support and received support. <emphasis>Perceived support</emphasis>, or the expectation that others will provide support if it is needed, has been consistently associated with better health. <emphasis>Received support</emphasis>, or the actual provision of support by another person, has a more complicated association with health. Sometimes received support has a positive association with good health, but other times it has been linked with adverse effects on health. It has been suggested that the effect of received support is dependent on whether the support receiver perceives the support to be responsive to their needs.</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0008">In view of strong empirical evidence for the health‐promoting power of perceived support, consider how interventions to increase behavior‐specific perceived support might look. Rather than engaging in provider‐driven support, support providers could be trained in (1) how to help support recipients articulate the form of support that they think will be most helpful and (2) how to support individuals attempting to change health behavior. Involving recipients in planning and developing social support programs will likely increase their acceptability and effectiveness. But, of course, even when people in programs can articulate the support they prefer, it is not assured that their supporters will fulfill their needs.</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0009">The relationship of social support to loneliness was examined in a meta‐analysis which showed that perceived social support is strongly and negatively associated with loneliness, thus identifying one potential solution to the “loneliness epidemic” raised by the US Surgeon General (Zhang &amp; Dong,<link linkend="ch0022s0000li0018">2022</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0010">Holt‐Lunstad and Proctor raised an intriguing issue in the randomized trials they described, which is whether support recipients must be aware of the support that they are receiving for it to be health promoting. This may be a fruitful line of research for developing and evaluating effective social support interventions.</para>
