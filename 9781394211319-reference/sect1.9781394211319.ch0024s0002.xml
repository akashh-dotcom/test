   <para id="ch0024s0000p0019">Since the 1970s, there has been growing interest and subsequent systematic research examining the impact of social support on health. General models emerging from this work suggest that social support can be health‐promoting by influencing both psychological and behavioral processes (Hostinar,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0063">2015</link>; Uchino, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0125">2006</link>). For instance, relevant psychological pathways include <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> appraisals, and behavioral pathways include health behavior change. These pathways were thought to influence health‐relevant biological pathways that ultimately influence either the development or course of physical health problems. An overarching framework that highlights these general pathways but incorporates more specific models (e.g., direct effect, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐buffering models) is highlighted in <anchor id="ch0024s0000a0020"/>
      <link linkend="ch0024s0000a0022">Figure 10.2</link>.</para>
   <para id="ch0024s0000p0020">As shown in<link linkend="ch0024s0000a0022">Figure 10.2</link>, functional support can have both a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related and a direct effect on health outcomes but via distinct theoretical pathways. The <emphasis>direct effect pathway</emphasis> highlights the generally health‐enhancing influence of social support. The <emphasis>stress‐buffering pathway</emphasis>, in comparison, suggests that social support diminishes the adverse health effects of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> (Cohen &amp; Wills, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0038">1985</link>). A <emphasis>stress prevention pathway</emphasis> is also included, as it was highlighted in an early review by Gore (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0054">1981</link>), who pointed to the importance of a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐preventive function of support. As such, the pathways depicted in <link linkend="ch0024s0000a0022">Figure 10.2</link> are not necessarily competing perspectives but highlight different contexts and processes by which social support operates (Uchino, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0125">2006</link>). Where they converge is in the “downstream” processes that ultimately link them to health. That is, the final common pathways include health behaviors such as exercise, diet, drug use, and sleep patterns, which in turn can influence health‐relevant outcomes. These outcomes range from health‐relevant biomarkers (e.g., <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> pressure, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3144">inflammation</ulink>) to clinical disease endpoints such as <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3015">hypertension</ulink>. The model also suggests that social support can directly impact physical health outcomes.</para>

      <title>Social Support as a Buffer for Stress</title>
      <anchor id="ch0024s0002a0002"/>
      <anchor id="ch0024s0000a0023"/>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0021">One of the earliest models of social support in relation to health, the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> prevention model, focuses on the possibility that social support might decrease exposure to adverse life events (Gore,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0054">1981</link>). As shown in <link linkend="ch0024s0000a0022">Figure 10.2</link>, this model suggests that social support is beneficial because network members may provide resources to avoid or reduce exposure to some types of stressors. Social support may reduce our exposure to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> through several intriguing pathways. First, social support may influence cognitive processes so that people are less likely to appraise or interpret a situation as threatening or challenging (Cohen, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0079">1988</link>) (Also see <ulink url="ch0026">Chapter 12</ulink>). Second, social support that encourages proactive coping—including, for example, informational support on planning for a rainy day—can help individuals make informed decisions that minimize subsequent exposure to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> (Aspinwall &amp; Taylor, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0018">1997</link>). Finally, adequate social support in one context may decrease exposure to <emphasis>secondary stressors</emphasis> (Pearlin, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0102">1989</link>). For instance, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> at work can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to conflict at home. However, if spousal support reduces work <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, it may effectively eliminate potential spillover of work <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> into marital interactions and reduce exposure to such secondary stressors (Pearlin, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0102">1989</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0022">The best‐known <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related model is the stress‐buffering model of support (Cohen &amp; Wills,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0038">1985</link>). As shown in <link linkend="ch0024s0000a0022">Figure 10.2</link>, this model differs from the stress prevention model in that individuals might still experience stress, but social support is predicted to decrease the strength of the association between stress and physical health outcomes (Cohen &amp; Wills, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0038">1985</link>). This model is based on the hypothesis that stressors have an adverse influence on health behaviors and physical health outcomes but that appropriate support can minimize such links. Consistent with <link linkend="ch0024s0000a0022">Figure 10.2</link>, Cohen postulated that this stress buffering occurs through a cognitive appraisal process (interpretation of the situation and one’s coping resources), which can, in turn, weaken or “buffer” the typically robust association between stress and health‐related outcomes (Cohen, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0079">1988</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0023">A major variant of the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐buffering model is what has been called the<emphasis>matching hypothesis</emphasis> (Cutrona &amp; Russell, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0042">1990</link>). This hypothesis predicts that <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> buffering is most effective when the type of support matches the needs or challenges of the stressful event. More specifically, it predicts that informational and tangible support should be most effective for controllable events (such as preparing for a job interview), whereas emotional and belonging support should be most effective for uncontrollable events (such as being laid off from a job) (Cutrona &amp; Russell, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0042">1990</link>). This version of the stress‐buffering model is one of the few theoretical models of social support that highlights how different functional components of support might be related to outcomes based on the nature of the stressor (such as its controllability).</para>

      <title>Overview of the Direct Effect Model</title>
      <anchor id="ch0024s0002a0003"/>
      <anchor id="ch0024s0000a0024"/>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0024">The direct effect model postulates that social support is effective more generally, regardless of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> levels (Cohen &amp; Wills,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0038">1985</link>). Cohen and Wills’s (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0038">1985</link>) review found that structural support measures were more likely to demonstrate direct effects. The direct effect of structural measures was seen as representing the influence of social support on social identity via direct (e.g., demands from others to behave more healthily) or indirect (e.g., behaving more healthily because relationships add greater life meaning) social control processes (Umberson, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0128">1987</link>). However, there is now evidence that functional support also can directly affect outcomes by promoting a sense of connection, self‐esteem, and control over life, due to knowing that one is cared for and supported by others (Lakey &amp; Orehek, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0080">2011</link>; Thoits, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0122">2011</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0025">Lakey and Orehek (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0080">2011</link>) extended the direct effect model by proposing the relational regulation theory (RRT) to account for the direct effects of social support on mental health outcomes. According to RRT, everyday interactions (e.g., talking about events of a typical day, gossip) help individuals generalize their relationship representations to stressful contexts (i.e., is this person I am comfortable with likely to be supportive during stress?). These researchers have been able to forecast which relationships might be most beneficial months later, based on analyses of brief (e.g., 10‐minute) lab‐based general discussions (Veenstra et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0131">2011</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0024s0000p0026">The <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐buffering model has been tested in several well‐controlled laboratory studies, many of which examine cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) as the outcome. In these studies, either a friend or a stranger (the experimenter or a confederate) provides the participant with support while the person is undergoing a standardized task designed to induce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, such as giving a speech in front of a confederate. Most of these studies find that social support is associated with lower CVR (Creaven et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0041">2020</link>; Teoh &amp; Hilmert, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0121">2018</link>). Some emerging evidence examining threat arousal via brain activation has shown that perceived social support is associated with lower activation of the hypothalamic‐<ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pituitary">pituitary</ulink>‐adrenal (HPA) region of the brain (Coan et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0035">2017</link>), which is partially responsible for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> response regulation (Brown et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0026">2017</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0027">There is much less research evaluating links between the other <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related models and processes in these models. The matching hypothesis has received some support in terms of psychological and relational outcomes (Cutrona &amp; Russell,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0042">1990</link>; Lee et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0083">2020</link>), but has been tested less frequently in epidemiological and physical health studies. Some studies examining objective health outcomes also provide some supportive evidence of the matching hypothesis. For example, one study of 41 American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian patients with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> examined five types of support offered and found that emotional and esteem social support messages from healthcare providers accounted for 32.5% of the variance in diabetic patient glycemic control (Robinson et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0108">2017</link>). Though it was unclear why the patients only benefited from emotional and esteem social support, these findings raise the question of whether proactively matching support to patient needs may optimize benefits—the key contention of the matching hypothesis.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0028">The <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> prevention model is the least tested of the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>‐related models in the health domain despite the fact that longitudinal studies are consistent with its basic premise. One longitudinal study of 301 older adults found that individuals with limited social support experienced more depressive symptoms 12 months later, and that the effect was both direct and indirect (Russell &amp; Cutrona,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0111">1991</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0029">The direct effect model suggests that social support should affect physical health outcomes directly. There is strong evidence that perceived social support is related directly to beneficial influences on biological function (Howard et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0066">2017</link>; Uchino et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0127">2018</link>; Lutgendorf et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0088">2005</link>). Consistent with a health behavior link, there is also consistent evidence linking perceived support to health‐promoting behaviors, including more exercise, less smoking or <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12847">alcohol</ulink> consumption, and better sleep quality (Ailshire &amp; Burgard, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0015">2012</link>; Kent de Grey, 2018; Laird et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0079">2016</link>; Stewart et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0119">2011</link>). Finally, a comprehensive meta‐analysis shows that social support is also associated with better patient cooperation with treatment regimens in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">chronic disease</ulink> populations (DiMatteo, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0044">2004</link>; Magrin et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0091">2015</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0030">The overall model in<link linkend="ch0024s0000a0022">Figure 10.2</link> posits that only part of the link between social support and health is due to health behaviors, as shown in prior studies. One study, for example, reported that the link between social support and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=901">cardiovascular disease</ulink> was mediated by poor sleep among women but not men (Nordin et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0098">2008</link>). Thus, there is both a direct and indirect link (through health behaviors) between social support and physical health, though future studies will have to directly test such association using more robust tests of mediation (Rucker et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0110">2011</link>).</para>
