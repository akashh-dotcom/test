   <para id="ch0020s0000p0025">There are several critical assumptions about the nature of behavior change and how population health interventions can best facilitate such changes upon which the TTM is based. The first is that behavior change is a process that unfolds over time through a sequence of stages that are both stable and open to change. Second, programs, interventions, and initiatives should emphasize specific principles and processes of change at specific stages for individuals to make forward progress through the stages. Finally, most at‐risk populations are not prepared for action and will not be well‐served by traditional programs that emphasize action. Setting realistic goals, such as progressing to the next stage of change, facilitates the change process and eventual progression to action.</para>
