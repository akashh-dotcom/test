   <para id="ch0030s0000p0010">Community engagement has its roots in social justice and social change movements, such as the indigenous land rights, women’s rights, civil rights, and environmental justice movements (Minkler et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0051">2008</link>). The researchers who developed TIPS engaged leaders of African American churches, in part, because of the Black Church’s historical and current role in social justice movements. In this section, we explore the progress of community engagement as an approach to health behavior change and health equity through its endorsement by public health agencies, healthcare organizations, researchers, policymakers, funders, and community leaders. (see <ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink> on Race, Health, and Health Equity.)</para>

   <para id="ch0030s0000p0011">Since 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) has promoted the view that “informed opinion and active cooperation on the part of the public are of the utmost importance in the improvement of the health of the people” (World Health Organization,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0081">2022</link>). In 1978, the Declaration of Alma‐Ata called for communities to take part in the “… planning, organization, operation, and control of primary health care…” (Kalra et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0040">2018</link>). In 1986, the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion called for community involvement in priority setting, decision‐making, and strategic planning and implementation for health promotion (World Health Organization, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0079">1986</link>). WHO’s Commission on Social Determinants of Health (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0082">2008</link>) called for community engagement to achieve health equity.</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0012">In the United States, major federal agencies have encouraged community engagement in public health practice and in research, thus setting the stage for communities and researchers to adopt community‐engaged approaches. The CDC has long recognized the importance of community engagement. In 1983, their Planned Approach to Community Health (PATCH) provided a model for state and local public health agencies and local community partners to plan, conduct, and evaluate health promotion and disease prevention programs. Other past CDC programs include the Community Transformation Grants (2011–2014) and the Partnerships to Improve Community Health (2014–2016). For over 20 years, their Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) program supported community partnerships to address racial and ethnic disparities in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">chronic disease</ulink> burden.</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0013">Also in the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its institutes have advanced community engagement in research. The National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences was the first at NIH to establish a CBPR grant initiative in 1995. In 2005, the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities launched an 11‐year CBPR Initiative to support community‐academic partnerships to plan, implement, and disseminate interventions to reduce health disparities. The National <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">Cancer</ulink> Institute funded a Community Networks Program (2005–2014) that involved partnerships with community‐based groups to help reduce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink>‐related disparities. Today, many of NIH’s research infrastructure programs require a community engagement core. These cores are among several fundamental components of research infrastructure grants, with a distinct objective of engaging community‐based organizations and practitioners in research and the dissemination of research discoveries.</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0014">Due to the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic and inequities in the disease caused by it, COVID‐19, public health agencies quickly turned to community engagement as a health equity strategy during the pandemic. CDC called for the engagement of at‐risk communities and effective communication with them, data sharing, and partnering for program implementation, dissemination, and evaluation (Michener et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0050">2020</link>). NIH took advantage of existing programs with community partnerships to expedite COVID‐19 research. For example, NIH formed the Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL). Against COVID‐19 Disparities, a network of researchers, policymakers, and community‐based organizations to help communities hardest hit by COVID‐19 across 21 states (Hunter et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0036">2021</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0015">Outside the United States, other countries have endorsed community engagement for health promotion and health equity. For example, the New Zealand Government initiated 11 National Science Challenges in 2014 as a mission‐led form of research funding for environmental and social/human health (Prussing &amp; Newbury,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0059">2016</link>). These challenges had the expectation of community engagement to address health equity issues, particularly for Māori (the indigenous people of New Zealand) and Pasifika (a group of people from South Pacific Island nations that include Samoa, Tonga, and Cook Island) communities. The challenges initially were critiqued as centering scientific knowledge production in the context of neoliberalism with Māori researchers reasserting the importance of Māori processes of knowledge production (Prussing &amp; Newbury, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0059">2016</link>). This “pushback” improved the expectations and practice of community engagement in the later stages of these efforts.</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0016">Other indigenous populations have expressed similar concerns regarding the recognition of indigenous knowledge and knowledge production (Nicholson et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0052">2021</link>) and data sovereignty (McCartney et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0047">2022</link>). Guiding principles, recommendations, and processes for engaging indigenous communities in research and data ownership have been developed and implemented, centering on indigenous knowledge and autonomy (Laird et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0041">2021</link>). In the United States, many American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, as sovereign nations, have developed protocols for participating in research, which places a greater emphasis on community and cultural benefits, respect for participants, and human‐subject protection.</para>
