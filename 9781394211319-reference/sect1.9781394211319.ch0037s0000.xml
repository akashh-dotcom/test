   <para id="ch0037s0000p0005">Seventy years ago (1951–1952), the psychologist G.D. Wiebe famously asked, “Why can’t you sell brotherhood like soap?” The notion that promoting universal <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10430">goodwill</ulink> and marketing a common cleaning product might be equated <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5669">strains</ulink> the imagination, but it has had enormous appeal and generated controversy ever since. What we now call social marketing—generally understood as the use of principles of commercial marketing to promote desirable social conditions—has evolved and grown in sophistication while informing efforts to create positive social and behavior change in all parts of the world and across nearly the full spectrum of issues reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations,<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0121">2023</link>). The field of public health, in particular, has been a major domain of social marketing research, theory development, and practice, and has produced compelling evidence of effectiveness in improving health outcomes on both large and small scales.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0006">The translation of commercial marketing into social marketing approaches is complicated. Marketers of soap typically have much larger budgets than marketers of brotherhood, as well as much larger infrastructures dedicated primarily to the marketing function. They also are more often focused on selling specific brands (for example, Pedialyte™) rather than generating demand for a product category (e.g., oral rehydration products) or a class of behavior (e.g., treatment of diarrheal disease) that could be practiced in different ways. Like commercial marketing, social marketing also seeks to influence behavior, but with broader social implications, including shifts in attitudes, norms, and social priorities in ways that serve the public interest in addition to individual needs.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0007">What distinguishes social marketing from other health promotion and health communication approaches? Why should one consider social marketing as a strategy for influencing positive health behaviors? How can principles of social marketing be used in the current media environment defined by rapidly spreading information and dominated by online and digital communication? The rest of this chapter will address these questions drawing examples from social marketing programs in non‐US settings and two case studies from Kenya and Indonesia.</para>
