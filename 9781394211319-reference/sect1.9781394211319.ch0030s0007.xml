   <title>Benefits and Challenges of Community Engagement</title>

   <para id="ch0030s0000p0056">TIPS and PPYEP illustrate the benefits of community engagement by showing how stakeholder input and active involvement strengthen research efficacy. Their use of CBPR also demonstrates how community engagement can support recruitment and implementation. Clinical trials that used CBPR have been shown to achieve good levels of participation of racial and ethnic minority groups (McFarlane et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0049">2022</link>). However, this conclusion is preliminary because CBPR has yet to be compared to approaches without community engagement. A recent meta‐analysis found some evidence that programs and studies conducted with substantial community engagement can improve health‐related behaviors and outcomes in disadvantaged populations with small to medium effect sizes (O’Mara‐Eves et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0055">2015</link>).</para>

   <para id="ch0030s0000p0057">The TIPS study exemplifies how community engagement can expedite the translation of research findings into public health programs and policies. TIPS now is reaching the larger African American community through its implementation in churches as part of the Calvary Community Outreach Network. Engagement of community <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink> in the development, implementation, and interpretation of research can ensure they are practical, relevant, and sustainable for successful dissemination and implementation (Estabrooks et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0029">2018</link>). (see <ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink> on Implementation Science.)</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0058">Despite the benefits of community engagement, there are challenges. They include considerable time demands on all partners to develop and foster trusting relationships, reconcile cultural and other differences, resolve ethical concerns, establish expectations for partners and funding agencies, and familiarize or train community partners on research protocols (De las Nueces et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0027">2012</link>). All these activities, including compensating community partners for their time, require financial resources and time frames beyond what traditional funding sources usually offer (Cole et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0024">2013</link>). The time investment needed to develop and foster trusting and equitable relationships may not immediately satisfy traditional benchmarks of success for academic partners or community partners’ desire for swift action (Lowry &amp; Ford‐Paz, <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0044">2013</link>). There is a need to balance scientific rigor and standards with the needs, expectations, and capacity of the community.</para>
