   <title>Conceptualizing Dissemination and Implementation</title>

   <para id="ch0031s0000p0012">Dissemination and implementation activities can be thought of as a series of steps, much like the program planning and evaluation process (see<ulink url="ch0035">Chapter 19</ulink> on Planning Models). As seen in <anchor id="ch0031s0000a0011"/>
      <link linkend="ch0031s0000a0016">Figure 16.1</link>, and described below, dissemination efforts seek to spread EBIs, and implementers engage with EBIs through a series of steps to facilitate their delivery within specific settings.</para>

      <para id="ch0031s0000p0013">Since most effective innovations do not spread without planning, persuasion, and action, a “designing for dissemination” lens prompts intervention developers to address the needs and resources of future adopters and implementers (Kwan et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0064">2022</link>). In the past, too often, researchers thought about dissemination after demonstrating effectiveness of an intervention. This often is too late because the intervention elements may be valid but not feasible for organizations to adopt. Working with organizations from the beginning can help assure that intervention elements will be adopted, if effective. Such an approach keeps <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink> at the center of the development and tailoring of strategies to facilitate dissemination. Co‐creation of interventions can help assure that community needs are addressed. It is also respectful of communities and other partners. Such a perspective addresses the development of both dissemination products (e.g., manuals and toolkits with EBI content, tailored to potential adopters in that context) and dissemination activities (e.g., using tailored communication and guidance to support a network of institutions to adopt an EBI). Connecting back to the initial vignette, a designing for dissemination approach might include: (1) establishing the effectiveness of the program for ultimate use in accessible community settings instead of only well‐resourced pediatrician’s offices, (2) manualizing the program and creating plans to distribute the program, (3) engaging afterschool program leaders and staff who will adopt and sustain the program, and (4) tracking adoption, implementation, and sustainment of the program, particularly with attention to which settings and populations are not reached or able to adopt the program.</para>

Additionally, research teams that have developed EBIs may seek dissemination and implementation partners and organizations for more widespread adoption and delivery and may facilitate active dissemination efforts in those settings. Ideally, such partnerships were built into the original program design.</para>

The goal is to balance staying true to the original EBI (or maintaining fidelity to the core components deemed necessary to improve health outcomes) while making strategic adaptations to increase relevance, appropriateness, and acceptability for the new setting or population. It is useful at this stage to understand barriers and facilitators to implementation and identify possible supports that will help implementers and organizations use the EBI within the intended setting (e.g., schools, worksites, clinics). These supports are called implementation strategies and may include identifying champions, providing training or technical assistance, engaging leadership, or changing incentives for practitioners (Powell et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0084">2015</link>). Strategies are customized for the implementation setting and specific barriers to delivery for that particular EBI. Thus, training may be critical to support delivery of one EBI, whereas changing incentive structures might be critical for another EBI implemented at the same site.</para>
