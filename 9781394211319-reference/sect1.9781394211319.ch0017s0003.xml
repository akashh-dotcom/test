   <title>Similarities and Differences in the Theories’ Constructions</title>

   <para id="ch0017s0000p0017">Theories in this section have some marked similarities, and all of them include some focus on motivation, attitudes, and self‐efficacy. Motivation is central to all three theories but appears in different forms. RAA posits that behavior change for deliberative health behaviors occurs through behavioral intentions. Attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control also operate through intentions in RAA. In contrast, TTM views behavior change as a series of stages through which people progress—beginning in precontemplation and moving toward action and maintenance. While HBM does not explicitly include a variable for motivation, it is implicit in the theory.</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0018">The three theories in this section all include attitudes toward health behavior. Because many important attitudes<emphasis>are</emphasis> changeable, they are ideal targets for intervention. In HBM, perceived benefits of engaging in health behavior are a predictor of behavior, and RAA includes attitudes and an antecedent to behavioral intentions and behavior. TTM focuses on decisional balance of pros and cons (positive and negative attitudes toward the behavior). The three theories all include self‐efficacy, though RAA calls it perceived behavioral control.</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0019">The three health behavior theories also have important differences. They conceptualize risk appraisals in different ways. HBM includes perceived vulnerability (feeling susceptible) and perceived severity (how bad that harm is). Some views of HBM, for example, in this book, interpret the theory’s original proposal of perceived vulnerability as being about perceived likelihood (chances of being harmed).</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0020">Social norms are another area where the theories diverge. HBM and TTM do not include social norms per se, although processes of change in TTM include social processes. RAA specifies injunctive norms (what a person thinks others want them to do), which are measured as the multiplication of powerful others wanting the respondent to perform the behavior and motivation to comply. In the last iteration of RAA, the authors dropped multiplication and focused on awareness of the norm, based on data showing that motivation to comply did not add predictive power (Fishbein and Ajzen,<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0002">2010</link>). This evolution is an example of how RAA models have changed over time.</para>
   <para id="ch0017s0000p0021">Finally, theories of health behavior that focus on individuals generally incorporate race, ethnicity, and other demographic characteristics as distal influences, peripheral to more central psychological constructs, such as attitudes. Theorists of race and racialization have challenged this approach, quite appropriately, by placing race as central to people’s lived experiences, where they first experience the world through the lens of race (see<ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 14</ulink>). One potential approach is to blend individual‐level theories with other theories built explicitly to address race and racism. New insights from such synthesis may include explaining greater variance in health behavior, designing more effective interventions, and better understanding intersectionality of race with other constructs and experiences. Additional research is needed to quantify these potential impacts.</para>
