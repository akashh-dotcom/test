   <para id="ch0020s0000p0056">While many efficacy studies and implementation trials support the use of the TTM, much still needs to be done to advance understanding about the processes of behavior change, effective interventions to achieve population impact and other issues related to the TTM, specifically, and behavior change research more generally. Basic research should be done with other theoretical variables, such as processes of resistance, well‐being, and problem severity, to determine if such variables relate systematically to the stages and predict progress across specific stages.</para>
   <para id="ch0020s0000p0057">More research is also needed on the structure and integration of processes and stages of change across a broad range of behaviors, such as acquisition behaviors, like exercise, and cessation behaviors, like smoking cessation (Rosen,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0098">2000</link>). It is important to examine what modifications are needed for specific types of behaviors, such as fewer processes perhaps for infrequent behaviors, like mammography screening, or behaviors that may <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5159">relapse</ulink> less often, such as sunscreen use.</para>
   <para id="ch0020s0000p0058">Since tailored communications have been found to be the most promising interventions for applying TTM to date, more research is needed to compare the cost‐effectiveness and impacts of alternative technologies. As technologies evolve, it will be important to evaluate the best modalities to increase engagement and retention in programs. The costs of personnel and technology required for developing tailored interventions have dropped dramatically over the past two decades. One promising approach is to add tailored texting to best‐practice internet‐based computer‐tailored interventions and digital therapeutics. In one study, this enhancement produced an improvement in cigarette abstinence of 11 percentage points (44% versus 33%) (Evers et al., in press). In addition, the use of computerized, tailored interventions and digital therapeutics based upon the TTM should be applied in multi‐level interventions, such as biological (e.g., pharmacological adjuncts), community, and social (e.g., policy) level interventions.</para>
   <para id="ch0020s0000p0059">While the application of the TTM to diverse populations and evaluation of the effectiveness of TTM‐tailored interventions minority populations has been promising (for examples see Albright et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0006">2005</link>; Benitez et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0010">2017</link>; Gazabon et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0034">2007</link>; Paxton et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0073">2008</link>; J. M. Prochaska, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0077">2007</link>), more research should be done to compare alternative communication modalities for engaging such populations. It is possible that alternative intervention modalities—such as mobile applications, conversational agents (Martinengo et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0060">2022</link>), text messaging, neighborhood or church leaders, gaming (Mulchandani et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0063">2022</link>), or community programs—may empower diverse populations to engage with and increase the impact of health‐enhancing programs.</para>
   <para id="ch0020s0000p0060">Changing multiple behaviors creates special challenges, including the demands placed on participants and providers. Alternative strategies beyond the sequential (one at a time) and simultaneous (each treated intensely at the same time) should be assessed. Integrative approaches are promising. With bullying prevention, multiple behaviors (for example, hitting, stealing, ostracizing, mean gossiping and labeling, damaging personal belongings) and multiple roles (bully, victim, and passive bystander) require attention. The available classroom intervention time may be as little as 30 minutes. If behavior change is construct‐driven (for example, by stage or self‐efficacy), what is a higher‐order construct that is common to the behaviors that could be used as an integrative factor for the focus of an intervention? In one case, that concept was “relating with respect.” Significant and important improvements across roles and behaviors have been found with elementary, middle, and high school students (Prochaska et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0088">2007</link>). Effective applications may be limited more by our creativity and resources for testing than by the ability of the theory to drive significant research and effective interventions.</para>
   <para id="ch0020s0000p0061">The TTM is dynamic and open to modifications and enhancements as more students, scientists, and practitioners apply the TTM to a growing number of theoretical issues, diverse behaviors, and at‐risk populations.</para>
