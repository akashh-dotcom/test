   <para id="ch0035s0000p0068">This chapter presented two models for developing theory‐based health promotion interventions. Both frameworks have been used extensively in health promotion planning, with PRECEDE‐PROCEED beginning in the late 1970’s and IM beginning in the late 1990’s. Both of these frameworks have been used across the globe in settings such as schools, communities, and workplaces, and have been used for planning multilevel interventions for many health topics. These frameworks take an ecological approach to planning and provide guidance for the use of theory both to understand health problems and to plan interventions that influence the determinants of those problems. Both also start with the important assumption that a diagnostic process should be undertaken before program components are selected. While the frameworks can be used in tandem, they are most often used independently and can guide planners to incorporate the use of theory, evidence, new data, and community engagement to make planning and implementation decisions.</para>
   <para id="ch0035s0000p0069">Both planning frameworks underscore the importance of engaging the priority population and other <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink> in collaborative planning to increase intervention ownership, relevance, and appeal (Bartholomew et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0041">2016</link>; Grembowski, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0059">2016</link>). The concept of the importance of co‐creation of interventions with priority populations being true collaborative partners helps ensure that programs address community needs and contexts and increase the potential for sustainment over time (Hawe, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0061">2015</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0035s0000p0070">Both frameworks use logic models and graphic illustrations that depict the relationship between elements or components of interest. The logic models used in each framework are similar in some ways but also have several differences. They differ in how the determinants of behaviors and environmental conditions are categorized (predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling in PRECEDE‐PROCEED vs. personal determinants in IM). Another difference is that in IM, the logic model includes a description of intervention methods and practical applications, and how they are proposed to influence the determinants of behavior and environmental conditions that drive health and quality of life.</para>
   <para id="ch0035s0000p0071">Both IM and PRECEDE‐PROCEED have been used to guide community‐based work and are flexible enough to be useful tools for CBPR (Belansky et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0042">2011</link>). Because they do not specify or restrict which theories and constructs should be used to understand problems and create solutions, these frameworks are useful for a wide range of health problems and have been used broadly to address health disparities and problems in under‐resourced communities worldwide (Bryant‐Stephens et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0044">2020</link>). The frameworks also have been applied to influence detailed reporting of health promotion interventions (Bartholomew &amp; Mullen, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0040">2011</link>), to understand theory‐based change methods at the community level (Wallerstein et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0086">2020</link>), and to guide the adaptation of evidence‐based interventions in new settings (Bartholomew et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0041">2016</link>).</para>
