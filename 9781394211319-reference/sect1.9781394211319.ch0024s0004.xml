   <para id="ch0024s0000p0055">Theoretical models linking social support to health highlight the potential role of behavior (e.g., medical cooperation and health behaviors) in linking support to disease outcomes (Uchino,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0125">2006</link>). The next section describes evidence from two research areas to illustrate modifiable consequences of social support on health behaviors. The first application summarizes evidence for the link between social connection and opioid misuse, and the second describes evidence pointing to social support interventions for suicide prevention.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s0000p0056">Earlier research has brought to light evidence that endogenous opioids play a significant role in social bonding in humans and other primates (Machin &amp; Dunbar,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0090">2011</link>; Inagaki et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0069">2016</link>). Christie (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0034">2021</link>) has theorized that there is a temporal connection between higher levels of social isolation and greater levels of opioid misuse. Albertín and Íñiguez (<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0016">2008</link>) found that people who used opioids reported that the drug replaced the need for sexual intimacy, and the human need to socially connect by spending time with friends. When these participants were forced to choose between use of opioids and relationships, they were more likely to choose opioid use.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s0000p0057">A systematic review of 29 studies found that social connection was a correlate to opioid misuse; however, the directionality was not consistent, and associations were both negative and positive (Cance et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0029">2021</link>). A study of 371 methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients aged 18 and older (Polenick et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0104">2019</link>) found that the gender of the patient was the moderator in the association between illicit opioid use and loneliness. “Severe loneliness was associated with higher odds of using illicit opioids among women (OR = 3.00, 95% CI [1.19, 7.57], <emphasis>p</emphasis> = 0.020) but lower odds of using illicit opioids among men (OR = 0.35, 95% CI [0.14, 0.87], <emphasis>p</emphasis> = 0.024), accounting for age, marital status, work status, depressive symptoms, and MMT characteristics (treatment episode, treatment <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10481">duration</ulink>, and methadone dose).” In a nationally representative sample of 6,017 older adults (aged 65 and above), loneliness was a strong predictor of higher use of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> medications, such as opioids and <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=NSAIDs">NSAIDs</ulink>. In this study, loneliness was related to higher <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> medication use and more than two times the frequency of use of antidepressants, sleep medications, and benzodiazepines (Kotwal et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0076">2021</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0058">More research is needed to understand the relationship between opioid misuse and levels of social isolation and lack of perceived social support. The psychobiological mechanistic function of endogenous opioids for bonding may provide clarity as to why opioid misuse leads to lower levels of social connection in those who use opioids.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s0000p0059">The rate of suicide in the United States increased by 30% between 2000 and 2018 but decreased between 2019 and 2020 (CDC,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0032">2022</link>). Though suicide was no longer listed as one of the top ten causes of death in the United States in 2020 during the COVID‐19 pandemic, it is still a leading cause with 45,979 deaths by suicide in 2020 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0031">2020</link>). Suicide and other nonfatal self‐harm cost the US economy close to $490 billion in amelioration for medical bills, costs of work loss, quality of life costs, and other estimated costs (Peterson et al., <link linkend="ch0024s0000li0103">2021</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0024s0000p0060">Several social support interventions for preventing suicide have been developed and evaluated. One study focused on a sample from Chennai, India, where over 153,000 deaths by suicide occurred in 2020, more than any other country in the world (National Crime Records Bureau, n.d.). This randomized controlled study found that brief intervention and contact (BIC) was effective in reducing subsequent suicidal behavior among people who attempted suicide (Vijayakumar et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0133">2011</link>). Researchers randomly assigned 680 individuals who had attempted suicide and were admitted to Government Royapettah General Hospital in Chennai to either the BIC group (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 320) or the treatment‐as‐usual (TAU) group (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 360). During each visit, the subjects in the BIC group were asked how they were feeling and whether they needed any support. If they indicated needing support, they were referred to an agency that would provide outpatient mental health care.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0061">Completed and attempted suicide was significantly lower in the BIC group after the intervention at an 18‐month follow‐up compared to the TAU group, with eight attempted and only one completed suicide in the BIC group, 17 attempted and 9 completed suicides in the TAU group, and 65% of the participants in the BIC group considering the visits to be helpful and supportive. These findings showed that a brief intervention session, combined with systematic long‐term contact after discharge, can have a positive impact on preventing subsequent suicide and suicide attempts. While there are many possible factors involved, BIC may have acted as an added social support network, enhancing a feeling of connectedness or feeling more cared for by others.</para>

      <beginpage pagenum="129"/>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0062">A recent meta‐analysis that examined 22 intervention studies (including the above study) found a 52% reduction in suicides in the BIC intervention groups. The analysis concluded that social support interventions may reduce the risk of using lethal means and therefore reduce deaths by suicide, but not suicide attempts (Hou et al.,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0064">2021</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s0000p0063">People with greater perceived and received social support have a decreased likelihood of lifetime suicide attempts (Kleiman &amp; Liu,<link linkend="ch0024s0000li0075">2013</link>). While cognitive reasons for death by suicide are difficult to study, research suggesting that social support is protective against suicidal ideation and attempts is promising. Social support is a behavior that can be modified and can be used globally to bolster suicide prevention programs around the world.</para>
