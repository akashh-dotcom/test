   <title>Analyzing TPB, TRA, IM, and RAA Data</title>

   <para id="ch0019s0000p0030">Causal pathways in the RAA are the starting points for statistical analysis. The various ways the RAA frameworks are analyzed are related directly to two main uses of the model: to explain and predict behavior and to identify salient underlying beliefs as a basis for intervention development. A multiple regression model with direct measures predicting intention will identify which factors predict a particular behavior.</para>
   <para id="ch0019s0000p0031">However, often the effects of various background or precursor variables on a behavior are the focus of empirical studies. In each version of reasoned action, effects of all precursor variables on intention and behavior are mediated through attitudes, norms, and control (Hennessy et al.,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0041">2010</link>; Lee et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0047">2018</link>), although in <anchor id="ch0019s0000a0036"/>
      <link linkend="ch0019s0000a0016">Figure 6.2</link>, they are only pictured for IM and RAA.</para>
   <para id="ch0019s0000p0032">It is always an empirical question whether a particular variable will be related to any of the underlying beliefs or direct determinants, and which precursors to include in a model varies according to the population and behavior of interest. Background variables are not limited to individual‐level characteristics and may also include social or structural variables (such as density of health care providers in a community). In instances when precursors are included in the model,<emphasis>path analysis</emphasis>, which is a regression‐based approach that allows one to assess the effects of a system of variables, is used to estimate mediated effects from the precursor to the observed determinants and then on to intention. Advanced statistical techniques, such as structural equation modeling, also can be appropriate (Hennessy et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0042">2012</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0019s0000p0033">Ideally, component items for the higher‐order constructs (injunctive and descriptive norms; autonomy and capacity) should be combined into a single measure. However, they can be separate and entered individually into regression models. One important reason to keep component measures separate is that they can be used individually if there is interest in exploring the underlying beliefs, or if they are not well‐correlated.</para>
   <para id="ch0019s0000p0034">Because underlying beliefs specific to a target behavior are often modifiable, they may be incorporated into messaging and other behavior‐change interventions. They can also be used to divide a population according to a particular characteristic (Slater,<link linkend="ch0019s0000li0060">1996</link>): In analyses using the reasoned action framework, the audience is segmented by their behavioral intention into intenders and nonintenders (Fishbein &amp; Yzer, <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0033">2003</link>). Several data points on the belief level may be used together to inform selection of salient beliefs. These may include: correlation of the belief with intention, mean difference in the beliefs between intenders and nonintenders, and the percent of agreement with the belief within intenders and nonintenders (for examples see Bleakley et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0018">2018</link>; Hornik et al., <link linkend="ch0019s0000li0043">2019</link>).</para>
