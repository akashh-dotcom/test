   <para id="ch0018s0000p0004">The HBM remains one of the most widely used conceptual frameworks in health behavior research and practice. Over the decades, it has been expanded, compared, and contrasted to other theories and frameworks, and used to inform behavior‐change interventions—both alone and in combination with other theories.</para>
   <para id="ch0018s0000p0005">In this chapter, we review the HBM’s historical development, core constructs, hypotheses, and relationships of constructs to each other and to specific health behaviors, as well as the empirical evidence supporting it. Of the many health behaviors to which researchers have applied the HBM, we provide examples relevant to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> risk and COVID‐19 mitigation measures, using the first example to focus on how the constructs of this model are measured, and the second on how they can be used in interventions to change health behavior.</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0006">The HBM was originally developed by Dr. Godfrey Hochbaum, a social psychologist who immigrated to the United States from Austria following World War II, and <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> colleagues at the US Public Health Service to explain the widespread failure of people to participate in programs to prevent and detect disease (Hochbaum,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0042">1958</link>; Rosenstock, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0067">1960</link>). It was then extended to study people’s behavioral responses to opportunities for early detection of potentially curable diseases, and their response to illnesses, with particular focus on adherence to medical regimens (Becker, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0025">1974</link>; Kirscht, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0049">1974</link>). HBM constructs were built on tenets of <emphasis>Cognitive Theory</emphasis> briefly discussed below.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0007">During the first half of the 20<superscript>th</superscript> century, social psychologists had developed two major approaches for explaining behavior: <emphasis>Stimulus‐Response (S‐R) Theory</emphasis> (Watson, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0086">1925</link>) and <emphasis>Cognitive Theory</emphasis> (Lewin, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0050">1951</link>). S‐R Theory posited that events (termed <emphasis>reinforcements</emphasis>) affect physiological drives that, in turn, activate behavior. American psychologist B. F. Skinner (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0073">1938</link>) hypothesized that behavior is determined by its consequences, or reinforcements, and that the mere temporal association between a behavior and a reward or punishment immediately following that behavior was sufficient to increase the probability that the behavior would be repeated or avoided. According to S‐R Theory, behavior is automatic and does not require mental processes, such as <emphasis>reasoning</emphasis> or <emphasis>thinking</emphasis>. Researchers now regard behavior as more complicated in most cases.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0008">Conversely, cognitive theorists argued that reinforcements operated by influencing expectations rather than by influencing behavior directly. Mental processes—thinking, reasoning, hypothesizing, or expecting—are critical components of cognitive theories, which are often termed<emphasis>value‐expectancy</emphasis> models because they propose that behavior is a function of the degree to which individuals value an outcome of a specific behavior and their assessment of the probability, or <emphasis>expectation</emphasis>, that a particular action will achieve that outcome (Lewin et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0051">1944</link>). For health‐related behaviors, the <emphasis>value</emphasis> is avoiding illnesses and staying or getting well. The <emphasis>expectation</emphasis> is that a specific health action may prevent (or ameliorate) an illness or condition for which people believe they may be <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10304">at risk</ulink>.</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0009">Findings from Hochbaum's initial study of participation in TB screening were striking (Hochbaum,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0042">1958</link>). Among individuals who believed that they were more susceptible to TB, and who believed that early detection offered benefits, 82% had at least one voluntary chest X‐ray. In contrast, only 21% of those who perceived lower personal susceptibility and benefits obtained X‐rays. Some recent studies have found more modest associations between perceived susceptibility and health behavior.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0010">In addition to TB screening, the HBM can be applied to many other health behaviors (such as medication adherence) with potential to reduce risk of developing a health condition and/or the effects of an existing disease or condition. As Charles Abraham and Paschal Sheeran explain, the cognitive theorists who developed and refined this model did not ignore social factors that influence health behaviors. They understood that demographic and socioeconomic factors were associated with both preventive behaviors and accessing health services. However, because their goal was to develop a framework that could be used to influence behavior change, they focused on specifying a set of “common‐sense beliefs” that might be modified via health education interventions (Abraham &amp; Sheeran,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0017">2015</link>). In our 21<superscript>st</superscript>‐century conceptualization of multi‐level determinants of both health and health behaviors, the HBM should be understood as primarily applicable to individual‐level factors. However, it can be combined with constructs from other theories that operate at different levels. Other chapters in this book address some of those theories.</para>

            <para>. In 1958, Hochbaum originally proposed that perceived susceptibility and perceived benefits were relevant only if activated by other factors that he termed “cues” to instigate action (Hochbaum, ). These cues could be internal (such as noticing a symptom that increased perceived threat), or external (such as media publicity; receiving a recommendation from a doctor, a free sample, or an individualized reminder from a health center; or even learning about a friend’s diagnosis).<emphasis>Cues to Action</emphasis>

            <para id="ch0018s0000p0012" role="listPara1">In the 1990s, Victor Strecher, Victoria Champion, and Irwin Rosenstock suggested that cues operate mainly as perceived threats, such as a painful <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5762">sunburn</ulink> increasing perceived risk of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5571">skin cancer</ulink> and prompting people to add sunscreen to their shopping list (Strecher et al.,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0075">1997</link>). However, Hochbaum (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0042">1958</link>) also suggested scenarios through which the cue directly prompts behaviors without operating through beliefs. <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">His</ulink> often‐used classroom example was a point‐of‐purchase display at the drugstore counter that prompts a person to add a tube of sunscreen to the cart even if her perceptions do not change: she already believes in the benefits of sunscreen but would have left the store without it were it not for the prompt and easy access at the cash register. This construct of a cue resembles more recent suggestions by behavioral economists that a simple “nudge” may prompt a person to change behavior (Thaler &amp; Sunstein, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0077">2009</link>) (Also see <ulink url="ch0036">Chapter 20</ulink>).</para>

               <emphasis>Efficacy Expectations</emphasis>. Years after the HBM was developed, Albert Bandura (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0023">2005</link>) introduced the constructs of self‐efficacy and outcome efficacy expectations in <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> Social Cognitive Theory, postulating that behavior is guided by cognitive and affective (emotional) factors as well as biological and external events (see <ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>). Outcome efficacy<emphasis>—</emphasis>beliefs about the extent to which a particular behavior will <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to a certain outcome (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0021">1997</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0022">1999</link>)—resembles the HBM construct of perceived benefits. The construct of self‐efficacy—the conviction that one can successfully execute a behavior—was not clearly represented by an HBM construct (although lack of self‐efficacy was sometimes noted as a barrier to taking action) (Mahoney et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0056">1995</link>). In 1988, Rosenstock and colleagues suggested that self‐efficacy be added to the HBM as a separate construct (Rosenstock et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0069">1988</link>).</para>

               <emphasis>Other Variables</emphasis>. An early assumption of the HBM was that demographic, structural, and psychosocial factors may affect beliefs and indirectly influence health behaviors. For example, sociodemographic factors, such as educational attainment, can indirectly influence behaviors by altering perceptions of susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers (Rosenstock, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0068">1974</link>; Salloway et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0071">1978</link>).

As shown, sociodemographic variables, such as age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, and insurance status, may moderate relationships between health beliefs and health behaviors. For example, because <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> is more prevalent among older people, a person’s age may moderate the relationship between perceived threat and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> screening behavior such that older individuals believe themselves to be at a greater risk for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> and rate <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> as a more severe disease than younger adults.

It begins with health beliefs, which are divided into perceived benefits and perceived barriers. Below that, the perceived threat is divided into perceived susceptibility and perceived severity. These <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to self-efficacy, which, along with cues to action, leads to the outcome of healthy action or behavior.

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0014">The HBM clearly specifies that health beliefs collectively affect behaviors, but it does not delineate precise combinations, weights, and relationships among variables (Abraham &amp; Sheeran,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0017">2015</link>). This ambiguity has led to variations in how the HBM is applied in research. For example, while many studies have evaluated the direct path between beliefs and a given health behavior, others have tested constructs by using mathematical combinations that were not part of the model’s original specification.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0015">In the 1970s, Marshall Becker and Lois Maiman (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0026">1975</link>) evaluated whether barriers should be subtracted from benefits. Conceptually, they argued that a kind of unconscious cost‐benefit analysis occurs wherein individuals weigh the behavior’s expected benefits against perceived barriers: “It could help me,” the person might think, “but it may be expensive, painful, unpopular, unpleasant, or inconvenient.” This combination of benefits and barriers is similar to the <emphasis>Transtheoretical Model</emphasis>’s later proposition that people weigh pros and cons of a given behavior against each other to form a single decisional balance score (see <ulink url="ch0020">Chapter 7</ulink>). However, Neil <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Weinstein">Weinstein</ulink> (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0087">1988</link>) later argued that benefits and barriers are qualitatively different and should be treated as distinct constructs with the potential to be linked to other HBM constructs and behavior through different pathways. <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Weinstein">Weinstein</ulink>’s position has been borne out in the HBM context through psychometric testing of barrier and benefit scales, showing that they act as separate factors influencing behavior (Tiro et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0078">2005</link>). Studies using structural equation modeling to test multiple pathways have also shown that perceived benefits and barriers have independent associations with behavior (Gerend &amp; Shepherd, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0038">2012</link>; Murphy, et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0061">2013</link>).

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0016">Over the years, critical reviews of the HBM’s predictive validity have combined or analyzed results from many studies to assess its performance. Generally, the model’s constructs have been found consistently to predict health behaviors (Carpenter,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0030">2010</link>; Harrison et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0040">1992</link>; Janz &amp; Becker, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0044">1984</link>; Jones et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0046">2014</link>; Zimmerman &amp; Vernberg, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0095">1994</link>). Researchers’ interest in the relative predictive value of individual HBM constructs has waxed and waned over time.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0017">Studies that have assessed individual contributions of various constructs have found that the construct<emphasis>perceived barriers</emphasis> seem to be the most powerful single predictor of behavior (Carpenter, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0030">2010</link>; Harrison et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0040">1992</link>), followed by <emphasis>perceived benefits,</emphasis> with the magnitude of effect higher for prevention and risk‐reduction behaviors (such as vaccination, child safety restraints) than for treatment behaviors (such as adherence to a drug or medical regimen). <emphasis>Perceived susceptibility</emphasis> was found to follow the same pattern as <emphasis>benefits</emphasis>, being a stronger predictor of preventive health behaviors (Janz &amp; Becker, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0044">1984</link>), some of which are one‐time or periodic actions, like having a vaccine (although the need for multiple vaccine doses for HPV and COVID‐19 adds complexity) or screening test, rather than behaviors like smoking cessation or physical activity, that must be practiced daily. In some meta‐analyses, <emphasis>perceived severity</emphasis> (Harrison et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0040">1992</link>; Janz &amp; Becker <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0044">1984</link>) and <emphasis>perceived susceptibility</emphasis> (Carpenter, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0030">2010</link>) have been the weakest behavioral predictors.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0018">In the 1990s, some researchers (such as Lewis,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0052">1994</link>) suggested that susceptibility and severity should be combined additively or multiplicatively to create the overarching construct of perceived threat (threat = susceptibility + [susceptibility × severity]). Others suggested that low variance in perceived severity for some health conditions—such as the almost universal perception that <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3615">lung cancer</ulink> is very severe—empirically leads to small effect sizes (Harrison et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0040">1992</link>). No reviews have evaluated the contribution of cues to action due, in part, to the fact that few studies have explained whether or how cues were measured or used for interventions (Abraham &amp; Sheeran, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0017">2015</link>). Finally, no systematic reviews have evaluated whether the addition of self‐efficacy increases the HBM’s predictive validity.</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0019">One of the most important limitations in both observational and intervention research using the HBM has been variability in measurement of its central constructs (Carpenter,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0030">2010</link>; Harrison et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0040">1992</link>; Janz &amp; Becker, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0044">1984</link>). If researchers do not measure people’s HBM‐related perceptions consistently, they will be unable to understand the extent to which those perceptions are related to health behaviors and whether interventions are effective in changing these perceptions.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0020">Several important principles should thus be used to guide HBM measurement. First, construct definitions should be consistent with the HBM as originally conceptualized. Measures also should be specific to the behavior being addressed (e.g., barriers to mammography may be quite different from barriers to colonoscopy) and relevant to the population among whom they will be used (e.g., groups with lower versus higher health literacy may respond differently to certain measures). Further, to ensure content validity of each HBM construct, it is important to measure the full range of factors that may influence behaviors, especially where the constructs are inherently complex. For example, measuring a single barrier to a health behavior would be insufficient if a person perceived multiple barriers to a health behavior. Formative research can identify factors perceived as particular benefits, barriers, and susceptibility beliefs for particular health behaviors, among particular populations, and in particular settings. Once identified, these beliefs may be incorporated into scales that include multiple items for each construct (King et al.,<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0048">2012</link>; Rawl et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0065">2000</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0064">2001</link>; Russell, et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0070">2003</link>; Vernon et al., <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0082">1997</link>).</para>
