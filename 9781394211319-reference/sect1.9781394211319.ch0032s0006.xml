      <para id="ch0032s0000p0001">The date was February 28, 2020. Only a few dozen COVID‐19 (“coronavirus”) cases had been identified in the United States, most of which could be linked to international travel. Although the vast majority of US states had yet to document a single case, a handful of new cases recently identified on the West Coast with no known exposure pathway suggested evidence of community spread. Major sports games and concerts had been cancelled, and the US State Department began issuing recommendations against international travel. Anxiety levels among many in the public and health officials were high. In full swing of the election primary season, President Trump held a rally where he devoted much attention to the coronavirus situation. What happened at that rally, and how it would be covered in the news media, was a pivotal moment for the course of health communication over the next months (and years) of the pandemic.</para>
      <para id="ch0032s0000p0002">The<emphasis>New York Times</emphasis> headline describing the rally was “Trump Accuses Media and Democrats of Exaggerating Coronavirus Threat” (Baker &amp; Karni, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0006">2020</link>). This news article—and the hundreds of others published that week by political journalists charged with reporting on the primary race—recounted that Mr. Trump declared that the coronavirus pandemic was overblown, even going so far as to describe it as a “hoax.” Trump explicitly stated that the Democrats were exaggerating the threat as an election‐year issue, or “politicizing the coronavirus” (Baker &amp; Karni, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0006">2020</link>). As this chapter aims to make clear, this coverage, and the dynamics of public opinion that followed, exemplify how information in the mass media—traditional broadcast and print news media, as well as social media—has great power to shape the public’s attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors about health issues.</para>
