   <title>Social Media Use and Health Inequities</title>

   <para id="ch0038s0000p0010">Inequalities in social media use follow some of the same patterns as differences in the use of mass media more generally. Differences in access to, engagement with, processing of and ability to act upon health information, or<emphasis>communication inequalities</emphasis>, are pervasive among population groups of different socioeconomic status (SES) and residence (Bekalu et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0020">2016</link>; Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0068">2021</link>). While differences in access to and use of mass media have declined steadily, some differences persist in use of all types of communication media, with higher income groups using more cable and satellite television, Internet, newspapers, and media that require recurring fees (Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0070">2012</link>; Whitacre et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0073">2015</link>). More educated and higher‐income groups have more access to these information resources compared with lower SES groups. Income, education, and ethnicity are also associated with discrepancies in “going online” for health information and may influence active seeking of health information.</para>

   <para id="ch0038s0000p0011">Differences in social media use between other groups also occur, though such differences may or may not constitute inequalities. For example, according to recent data in the U.S., social media use differs by age, with 84% of those between 18 and 29 years reporting the use of at least one social media platform compared to 45% of those 65 years and older (Pew Research Center,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0054">2021</link>). There are also notable differences by income, education, and residence, with over 75% of those earning $75,000 or higher, with college education, and with urban residence, respectively, reporting using at least one social media platform compared to 64–69% of those earning less than $30,000, with high school or less education, and rural residence (Pew Research Center, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0054">2021</link>). Such differences are parallel to more general health inequities (Lee &amp; Viswanath, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0044">2020</link>; Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0067">2020</link>, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0068">2021</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0012">A study of a nationally representative sample of American adults found that the association of social media use with social well‐being and self‐rated health (SRH) also varied across population subgroups (Bekalu et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0024">2019</link>). While the benefits seem to be generally higher among younger, better educated, and white racial/ethnic groups, harms seem to be higher among older, less educated, and minority racial/ethnic groups (Bekalu et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0024">2019</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0038s0000p0013">Inequalities in social media use also may magnify differences found in population health surveillance. When social media are used to monitor incidence and/or prevalence of physical and mental health conditions in populations (Merchant et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0048">2019</link>), this may complement and enhance traditional surveillance systems. But it may also exacerbate the impact of “data absenteeism,” where data from disadvantaged groups are not represented or are underrepresented in health studies (Lee &amp; Viswanath, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0044">2020</link>; Viswanath et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0069">2022</link>). Thus, the age‐, income‐, education‐ and residence‐based differences in use of social media may contribute to data absenteeism if social media is used for public health surveillance.</para>
