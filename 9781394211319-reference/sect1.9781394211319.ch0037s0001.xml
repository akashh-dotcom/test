   <title>Definition of Social Marketing</title>

   <para id="ch0037s0000p0008">Social marketing began to take shape in the late 1960s (Kotler &amp; Levy,<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0102">1969</link>). The term itself is usually attributed to Kotler and Zaltman (<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0104">1971</link>) who originally defined it as “a social influence technology involving the design, implementation and control of programs aimed at increasing the acceptability of a social idea or practice in one or more groups of target adopters” (Kotler &amp; Roberto, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0103">1989</link>, p. 24). Some of the earliest applications of social marketing may have occurred in public health, specifically FP campaigns in India in the 1960s (Harvey, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0095">1999</link>). Since then, social marketing has evolved through extensive application and scholarship.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0009">Andreasen’s definition is one of the most concise and comprehensive: “Social marketing is the<emphasis>application of commercial marketing technologies</emphasis> to the analysis, planning, execution and evaluation of programs <emphasis>designed to influence the voluntary behavior</emphasis> of target audiences in order <emphasis>to improve their personal welfare and that of their society</emphasis>” (Andreasen, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0080">1994</link>, p. 11; emphasis added). These three highlighted aspects—the use of a commercial marketing perspective to influence voluntary behavior for individual and social good—lie at the heart of all social marketing efforts. The <emphasis>focus</emphasis> on outcomes that improve personal and social <emphasis>welfare</emphasis> is the primary feature that distinguishes social from commercial marketing.</para>
   <para id="ch0037s0000p0010">To the features noted by Andreasen (<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0080">1994</link>, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0081">2006</link>), it is worth highlighting another one derived from Bagozzi (<link linkend="ch0037s0000li0082">1974</link>, <link linkend="ch0037s0000li0083">1978</link>): the mutual fulfillment of self‐interest through <emphasis role="strong">voluntary exchange</emphasis>. Voluntary exchange from a consumer’s view means that the interaction with a marketer fulfills a felt need or desire, the perceived cost of which—in social, economic, psychological, and/or physical terms—does not outweigh the perceived gain. Voluntary exchange from a marketer’s point of view primarily means providing a good or service that is in <emphasis>their</emphasis> best interest, often expressed in financial terms. In the case of social marketing, consumers and marketers presumably share the same goal, namely increasing benefits to all parties not just those in a position to pay for a product.</para>

   <para id="ch0037s0000p0011">While debates over the definition of social marketing will continue, social marketing is now a well‐developed area of scholarship and practice. Major international, regional, and national associations such as the International Social Marketing Association (<ulink url="https://isocialmarketing.org/">https://isocialmarketing.org/</ulink>), the European Social Marketing Association (<ulink url="https://europeansocialmarketing.org/">https://european‐socialmarketing.org/</ulink>), and the Latin American Social Marketing Association (<ulink url="http://www.mercadeosocial.org/">http://www.mercadeosocial.org/</ulink>) serve networks of professionals and scholars. Expansion continues; the relatively new African Social Marketing Association held its first regional conference in 2023.</para>
