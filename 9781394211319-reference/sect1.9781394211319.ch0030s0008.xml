   <para id="ch0030s0000p0059">Community engagement is a highly valued and widely practiced approach to developing effective and sustainable health behavior and health equity programs and to conducting health‐related research with real‐world impact. It is a paradigm shift away from the traditional hierarchical approach that privileges the academic and scientific perspective to a collaborative approach that values and recognizes diverse perspectives and the community’s autonomy in health promotion and research. It is a strength‐based approach to empower and engage communities in building their capacity to address their most pressing health problems and ensure fair and equitable treatment. For these reasons, it is strongly promoted by public health agencies and funders and widely applied by practitioners and researchers from disciplines with a shared goal to improve human health, such as public health, medicine, nursing, psychology, and social work.</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0060">At the very core of community engagement is social justice and addressing social determinants of health. It is especially meaningful when it involves marginalized communities, and addresses overarching social issues such as dismantling structural racism, ensuring access to quality health care, promoting neighborhood safety, and obtaining livable wages. It is most effective when the historical and cultural context of the community is respected and integrated; the social determinants of health are targeted for improvement; community partners are engaged before starting a research or health promotion project; a trusting relationship among all partners is built and nurtured over time; and community capacity is assessed and built upon to leverage community assets and resources.</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0061">CBPR applies the concepts, principles, and practices of community engagement in the research context. It is a highly collaborative research approach that involves community organizations, leaders, and members in all phases of research—from conceptualization to dissemination—as co‐producers of research. Various research designs can be embedded in the CBPR context. CBPR is used to co‐design a research agenda and tailor interventions for different populations, settings, and contexts. Although rigorous comparative effectiveness studies of CBPR have yet to be done, CBPR does appear to improve the recruitment and retention of historically underrepresented populations in programs and research (McFarlane et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0049">2022</link>), the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10423">efficiency</ulink> and ecological validity of the research (Collins et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0025">2018</link>), and targeted psychosocial and health outcomes (O’Mara‐Eves et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0055">2015</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0062">Despite the prominence of community engagement, there are many practice‐related and methodological challenges to community‐engaged programs and research. There are also ethical questions to resolve (Glanz et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0034">2010</link>). For example, institutional review boards are designed to evaluate the risks and benefits of research to individual participants, but what about the risk and benefits to an entire community? Should entire communities or their governing bodies consent to research? Who should own or have a say in how data from community members should be collected, stored, analyzed, and shared?</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0063">Although community engagement involves important challenges, the potential benefits are fundamental to improving health and health equity. Community <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink> need to be part of the solution—lending their voices, experiences, and skills—to solve their most pressing health concerns in ways that make sense for their community context. In doing so, the solutions developed are more likely to be practicable, acceptable, and sustainable. A popular slogan used by activists for social change—initially attributed to the disability rights movement—sums up the intent of community engagement: “Nothing about us without us.”</para>
