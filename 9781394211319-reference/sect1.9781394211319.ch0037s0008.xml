      <para id="ch0037s0000p0001">Meet Sara. Sara and her husband Adel live in a low‐income neighborhood of a major city in the Global South. They have a son and a daughter, aged 5 and 2 years old. Like most of their neighbors, they struggle to make ends meet. They rely on small, local retail shops for family health supplies like hygiene products and basic pharmaceuticals. There is a government hospital a few miles away, but it is always crowded and seeing a health worker there takes more time than Sara can afford. She occasionally pays a close neighbor, who is a private midwife, for care and advice about her personal and family health needs. Sometimes she searches for answers on the internet using her cell phone but does not always find the information she needs.</para>
      <para id="ch0037s0000p0002">Sara and Adel do not want any more children—at least for the next couple of years—but they are not sure about the best way to prevent another pregnancy. Condoms are available at the local retail shop and the midwife provides injectable contraceptives that work for a month at a time, but paying for that for the next three years or more would be challenging. Last week, Sara tried to talk to the local retail shop owner about alternatives to condoms, but he did not have any other over‐the‐counter options and got impatient when she asked too many questions. Sara does not know who to turn to for help with these important decisions.</para>
      <para id="ch0037s0000p0003">Sara and Adel are facing challenges at multiple levels. The people they can turn to for help are not knowledgeable or prepared to help them make healthy choices, and in some cases, the commodities they need are not easily available. In the past, a typical health communication campaign to address these challenges would focus on what Sara and Adel needed to know to understand specific health issues like child health, birth spacing, and family planning (FP), and support them to make healthy choices. Other strategies might have focused on improving service‐provider communication skills to teach clients about specific health issues and decisions. However, increased client knowledge or motivation, by itself, is unlikely to overcome the many challenges that prevent Sara and Adel from achieving what they want—a healthy, happy family, and good quality of life—even if they know how and want to.</para>
      <para id="ch0037s0000p0004">With a comprehensive, well‐designed social marketing program in place, Sara and Adel might see more salient messages in the media, around the community, or on her phone about contraceptive options for couples with small children. Her midwife would be more knowledgeable about the benefits of birth spacing and trained to help her choose a contraceptive that is right for her and Adel’s stage of family life. The local retail shop owner would have a better stock of family health products, displayed in attractive and informative ways to appeal to customer needs and would be better prepared to answer Sara’s questions and refer her to services that he cannot provide. Encouraged by activists from a local NGO, Sara and Adel could feel empowered to speak up at community meetings about their health needs. In response, local government leaders would potentially introduce subsidies to make certain health services and products more accessible and affordable for low‐income households.</para>
