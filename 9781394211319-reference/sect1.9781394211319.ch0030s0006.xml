   <title>Application: Pasifika Prediabetes Youth Empowerment Program</title>

   <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0033"/>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0051">We illustrate community engagement in action through the PPYEP, a partnership between two Pasifika communities and researchers from Massey University in New Zealand. Pasifika people are individuals from various Pacific Island nations who are residing in New Zealand. Pasifika adults and youth have a much higher prevalence of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4953">prediabetes</ulink> (higher than normal <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> sugar levels but not high enough for a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> diagnosis) than their non‐Pasifika counterparts (Coppell et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0026">2013</link>). Thus, PPYEP was started to develop the health knowledge and skillsets of Pasifika youth through an empowerment program to mobilize the community into collective action to reduce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4953">prediabetes</ulink> risk in working‐aged NZ Pasifika (Firestone et al., <link linkend="ch0030s0000li0032">2021b</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0052">PPYEP is an empowerment program based on Freire’s (<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0031">2018</link>) theory about empowering individual and societal transformation. It uses five strategies to systematize the process of collective engagement between the community and research partners as part of the empowerment process. <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0034"/>
      <link linkend="ch0030s0000a0037">Table 15.2</link>. summarizes these strategies and illustrates the concepts and principles of community engagement in action. Informed by these strategies, PPYEP includes six empowerment modules and five co‐design modules, which are summarized in <anchor id="ch0030s0000a0035"/>
      <link linkend="ch0030s0000a0038">Table 15.3</link>. The empowerment modules focus on building the youths’ capacity and capabilities as agents of social change. The co‐design modules help develop the youth’s capacity to <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> the ideation, planning, implementation, and evaluation of an intervention they help develop.</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0053">PPYEP was implemented in a rural and an urban community in New Zealand. At each location, the academic partners engaged a Pasifika community member who helped to recruit 41 Pasifika youth between 15 and 24 years old to participate in the program. Delivered weekly over five months, PPYEP activities provided the youth a knowledge base to view themselves as societal agents of social change, and to recognize that their capacity and capabilities (if channelled under propitious conditions) can affect positive change in their communities. They also helped youth think of health in terms of holistic well‐being encompassing physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual wellness, strengths in capacity and capability development, and a collaborative approach to health promotion. They learned about health equity in the context of social justice to affect the social, environmental, and cultural determinants of health. As empowerment focuses on building knowledge and skillsets, it also develops the youth researcher’s capability to engage with all antagonists of the community.</para>

   <para id="ch0030s0000p0054">Of the 41 Pasifika youth who started PPYEP, 29 (71% retention) completed the program. A formative evaluation of these 29 youths’ experiences found that the program offered a safe space to develop their knowledge about health and healthy lifestyles and confidence in their leadership ability to make a social change (Prapaveissis et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0058">2022</link>). They also believed they had acquired the skills necessary to develop a culturally centered, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4953">prediabetes</ulink> intervention to benefit their communities.</para>
   <para id="ch0030s0000p0055">The Pasifika youth of PPYEP later implemented and evaluated the eight‐week, community‐based <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4953">prediabetes</ulink> interventions they co‐designed with the research team for a group of adults. They delivered the interventions to 32 Pasifika adults, ages 25–39, who had excess <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=673">body weight</ulink>. The program included lessons on healthy eating and physical activity and a group‐based four‐kilometer walk. At the end of eight weeks, 26 of the 32 participants (81%) completed the entire intervention. This high retention rate was attributed to the close connection between the youth and their community members. A pre‐ and post‐intervention evaluation of the eight‐week program showed significant reductions in percent <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=673">body weight</ulink> (an average of 2.43% decrease) and waist circumference (an average of 1.6% decrease), and an increase in the total number of steps taken (an average of 47,252 more steps) over eight weeks (Firestone et al.,<link linkend="ch0030s0000li0033">2021a</link>). Despite the small size of this program, it demonstrates how community engagement and co‐design approaches, together, enable a feasible, culturally acceptable method with short‐term effectiveness for improving health while building community capacity to address other health concerns.</para>
