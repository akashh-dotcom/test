   <para id="ch0031s0000p0046">There are several important challenges for dissemination and implementation science moving forward. First, there is a need for a richer pool of measures that are psychometrically validated, pragmatic, theory‐driven, and adaptable to different situations and populations (Mettert et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0072">2020</link>). When possible, consistent use of comparable measures across studies will accelerate the growth of the evidence base. Also, new and existing frameworks should be adaptable to different settings, populations, and cultures; there are some examples available, but more are needed to enhance their generalizability and applicability. Diffusion of Innovations has a long history of use in global settings (Rogers, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0092">2003</link>). The CFIR framework has been adapted to address equity, pragmatic applications, and use in LMIC (Allen et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0019">2021</link>; Means et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0071">2020</link>), and continued adaptation for these contexts is needed.</para>
   <para id="ch0031s0000p0047">Additional attention is needed to shorten the often‐prolonged timelines and low rates of uptake associated with innovations and EBIs. This will require more academics to actively work and partner in a range of community settings. Participatory and community‐engaged research approaches in which community partners engage iteratively with researchers can leverage diverse expertise, co‐create solutions, address power imbalances, build capacity, and support the integration of research evidence into communities (Ramanadhan et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0090">2023</link>; Shelton et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0097">2024</link>). For additional details, see <ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink>.</para>
   <para id="ch0031s0000p0048">Two growing areas of research in dissemination and implementation science warrant more attention. One is de‐implementation research, which focuses on discontinuing or reducing EBI delivery when inappropriate, costly, or harmful (Nilsen et al.,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0079">2020</link>). Another emerging focus is policy implementation, given the potential for policy change to create change at scale and impact health equity (Emmons &amp; Chambers, <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0048">2021</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0031s0000p0049">Last, it is becoming ever more essential that dissemination and implementation frameworks and research focus explicit attention on health equity. Several equity‐focused frameworks and refinements of existing frameworks have been developed in recent years, offering a path forward (Baumann &amp; Cabassa,<link linkend="ch0031s0000li0023">2020</link>; Shelton et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0095">2021</link>; Snell‐Rood et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0099">2021</link>; Woodward et al., <link linkend="ch0031s0000li0105">2019</link>).</para>
