   <title>Adoption of Models from Outside the Health Field</title>
   <anchor id="ch0028s0002a0001"/>
   <anchor id="ch0028s0000a0010"/>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0018">In each of these four chapters, the history of various frameworks and models did not emerge within the field of health, medicine, or public health. Concepts and principles of race and social justice have strong roots in sociology. Community engagement and community organization concepts and principles started with social work (<ulink url="ch0030">Chapter 15</ulink>). Implementation, dissemination, and diffusion of innovations grew from efforts to spread the use of hybrid seed corn in Iowa—work originally done by rural sociologists working in the field of agriculture. (<ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink>). The core concepts described in the communications and media come from psychology, social psychology, and sociology (<ulink url="ch0032">Chapter 17</ulink>).</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0019">The adaptation of these models to address health behavior has brought challenges in measurement and research design. Kaholokula and colleagues point to important issues in the development of measures of process and outcomes for community engagement and CBPR, acknowledging the need for conceptual clarity to measure the goals most valued by a community and/or partner. The CFIR, a framework meant to unify key constructs from many implementation science frameworks, is relatively new in terms of developing measures to assess its core constructs and domains though the literature using CFIR is growing rapidly (<ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink>).</para>
   <para id="ch0028s0000p0020">Research designs to test active strategies for promoting social justice, community engagement, implementation and dissemination, and media communications present shared challenges. First, the foundations for such intervention strategies are usually complex, and when they embrace multiple levels (individual, interpersonal, and group/organization/community), they present challenges for conducting rigorous research and evaluation. However, as illustrated in<ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 16</ulink>, there have been cluster‐randomized controlled trials of efficacious intervention strategies conducted at churches, medical centers, and swimming pools. Trials of mass media communication have randomized media markets. But, it is not always feasible (e.g., due to the cost of such research) to undertake such ambitious research—leaving practitioners and researchers challenged with optimizing the assessment of process indicators and intermediate outcomes. No doubt, there will continue to be debates about whether it is necessary to assess individual behavior or health outcomes in large, multiorganization and/or multicommunity interventions; or whether endpoints of adoption and implementation of EBIs are sufficient to conclude that positive impacts have occurred.</para>
