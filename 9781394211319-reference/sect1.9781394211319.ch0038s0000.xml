      <para id="ch0038s0000p0004">There are three main reasons why social media are important and relevant to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10536">public health issues</ulink> and health behavior. First, the penetration of social media is broad and deep. There are more than 4.7 billion social media users worldwide, and the average social media user visits or uses 7.4 different social media platforms every month (DataReportal,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0034">2023</link>). Social media use has become an important digital activity in the lives of people across age groups and geographies. Second, as face‐to‐face social interactions have diminished across societies, social media networks complement and, in some cases, substitute for decreasing face‐to‐face social interactions and may even affect health‐related outcomes (Bekalu et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0023">2021</link>), though the empirical evidence is somewhat mixed (Rumas et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0057">2021</link>). During the COVID‐19 pandemic, in‐person interactions decreased, and social media use increased. In 2020, the average time US users spent on social media was 65 minutes daily, compared to 55 minutes in prior years (Tankovska, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0061">2021</link>). Third, social media are being used increasingly as tools and channels for health promotion and disease prevention interventions, such as in smoking cessation (Naslund et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0049">2017</link>), <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9659">HIV</ulink> and sexual health (Cao et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0031">2017</link>), <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> patient support, and physical activity and dietary behaviors (Goodyear et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0037">2021</link>; Günther et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0038">2021</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0038s0000p0005">Users’ engagement with social media platforms and content can be studied along three dimensions: user activity, communication partners, and content.</para>

         <anchor id="ch0038s0000a0010"/>
         <para id="ch0038s0000p0006">Researchers have categorized users’ activities into passive versus active use and examined the differential effects on health outcomes. Active use refers to the production and sharing of social media content (Verduyn et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0063">2015</link>, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0064">2017</link>). Passive use refers to content consumption (e.g., browsing newsfeeds and one’s own or others’ profiles). Most studies of user engagement have examined the differential effects of users’ passive versus active use of social media platforms. In a longitudinal study, for example, Frison and Eggermont found differential effects of Facebook use on adolescents’ well‐being depending on whether use was “active” or “passive” (Frison &amp; Eggermont, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0036">2020</link>). In their study, active Facebook use (engaging in exchanges with other users) was associated with positive outcomes, but passive Facebook use (viewing others’ posts and profiles without engaging in exchanges) sometimes resulted in less healthy strategies for coping with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. Notably, although the active versus passive dichotomy has been studied to explain differential effects of social media use on coping and health, the validity of the dichotomy has been questioned. Users’ engagement on social media might be captured more accurately on a continuum rather than as completely active or completely passive.</para>

         <para id="ch0038s0000p0007">Uses and Gratifications Theory, which posits that media users are active agents who choose and use media to fulfill specific, personally salient needs (Katz et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0040">1974</link>), has often been used to describe social media use. The most common motives include seeking information, experiencing positive feelings, maintaining relationships, establishing new relationships, obtaining social recognition, building social connections, and expressing oneself (Pertegal et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0052">2019</link>). However, little research has examined the relationship between motives for social media use and health (Yang et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0075">2021</link>). The motives that have been associated with health outcomes include relationship formation, relationship maintenance, entertainment/passing time/fun, and escapism (Yang et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0075">2021</link>). Recent studies also have shown the role of fear of missing out (FOMO) as an important psychological drive for general and problematic use of social media (Balta et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0016">2020</link>; Beyens et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0026">2016</link>; Yang et al., <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0075">2021</link>). For example, Beyens et al. (<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0026">2016</link>) showed that increased FOMO was associated with increased <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> related to Facebook use.</para>
