School‐based programs are an efficient strategy to promote healthy relationship behaviors, which may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to reduced bullying and teen dating violence (DV). Teen dating violence is a complex problem that affects many teens in the United States each year (CDC, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0046">2023</link>) and is influenced by multiple levels of the socio‐ecological model (<ulink url="ch0015">Chapter 3</ulink>) (e.g., youth, family, and school staff).

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0059">The multidisciplinary planning team included behavioral scientists, epidemiologists, psychologists, and other public health professionals. They used several methods to gain input and ensure the program met the needs of the priority population (predominantly African American and Hispanic middle school students attending a large, urban school district in the south‐central United States): (1) formation of an ethnically diverse 15‐member teen advisory board (TAB); (2) focus groups with parents and teenagers from the priority population, and (3) school district presentations and meetings. All students attended middle schools with high participation in the free or reduced school lunch program, an indicator of low socio‐economic status.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0060">The planning group used theory (social cognitive theory, social ecological model) (Bandura,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0038">1986</link>; Sallis et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0080">2008</link>) and evidence to guide their needs assessment and complete the logic model of the problem. Because the priority population was middle school students, they identified unhealthy emotional, physical, and sexual relationship behaviors, from dating partners and peers, as target behaviors. Further, because they often share similar risk factors (Coker et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0047">2014</link>) and co‐occur (Reeves &amp; Orpinas, <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0077">2012</link>; Ybarra et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0089">2016</link>), unhealthy relationship behaviors encompassed both perpetration and victimization.</para>
      <para id="ch0035s0000p0061">As shown in<anchor id="ch0035s0000a0046"/>
         <link linkend="ch0035s0000a0048">Figure 19.2</link>, the planning group’s needs assessment revealed that youth exposed to DV experience multiple health problems, including increased risk of depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, substance use, risky sexual behavior, and physical injury, and quality of life outcomes such as poor academic performance and poor life satisfaction and increased risk of future relationship difficulties, including adult intimate partner violence. Environmental factors, such as low parental communication about healthy relationships, and low parental monitoring or closeness are associated with increased teen dating violence, and school staff often fail to recognize unhealthy peer or dating relationships or lack skills and perceive barriers toward identifying dating violence and referring youth to support staff. Finally, many psychosocial determinants such as knowledge, self‐efficacy, attitudes, social norms and beliefs influence adolescent behavior. These findings emphasized the need for effective healthy relationship education for early adolescents.</para>

Behaviors and environmental factors. Health problems. Quality of life. Under psychosocial factors, comes a lack of knowledge about healthy relationships, self-efficacy, and communication skills. Behaviors include unhealthy relationship patterns. Environmental factors include low parental monitoring and lack of recognition by school staff. Health problems listed are depression, suicide, and substance use. Quality of life includes poor school performance and participation in delinquent violence.</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0063">After completing Step 2 tasks, the planning group selected potential theory‐based methods shown to be effective for healthy relationships education (Foshee et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0050">2004</link>; Wolfe et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0088">2009</link>) and matched them to specific change objectives in the matrices. These methods included: active learning, group discussion, anticipated regret, chunking, modeling, scenario‐based risk information, planning coping response, skills training with guided practice, resistance to social pressure, goal‐setting, information about others’ approval, and cultural similarity. The group then developed practical applications to operationalize these methods for the priority population and setting. <anchor id="ch0035s0000a0054"/>

The <emphasis>parent component</emphasis> included two parent newsletters, and three parent‐child take‐home activities to encourage parent‐child communication about healthy dating relationships. The <emphasis>school staff component</emphasis> was a two‐day teacher training prior to curriculum implementation and a school newsletter that highlighted information about TDV and bullying and provided strategies for recognizing and referring related incidents.</para>

      <para id="ch0035s0000p0067">Program planners can use the logic model of change to identify evaluation outcomes. Most often, the relationship between the behavioral and health and quality of life effects have been established previously, but determinants should be measured to verify whether the objectives selected in Steps 2 and 5, respectively, have been achieved (Bartholomew et al.,<link linkend="ch0035s0000li0041">2016</link>). Some of the effects of this program measured in a randomized controlled trial with urban middle school students included DV perpetration and victimization (behavioral outcomes) as well as norms for boy‐against‐girl violence and girl‐against‐boy violence, conflict‐resolution skills, and attitudes about sexting (determinants) (Peskin et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0074">2019</link>). Students who received <emphasis>Me and You</emphasis> reported less favorable norms for boy‐against‐girl violence and girl‐against‐boy violence, greater constructive conflict‐resolution skills, and more negative attitudes about sexting than did the comparison students (Peskin et al., <link linkend="ch0035s0000li0074">2019</link>). The evaluation plan was derived directly from the previous steps of IM.</para>
