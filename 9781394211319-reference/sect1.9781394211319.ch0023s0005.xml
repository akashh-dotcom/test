   <para id="ch0023s0000p0068">SCT is an action‐oriented approach to understanding the influence and interaction of cognitive, social‐environmental, and supporting behavioral factors on behaviors. SCT has broad utility in the pursuit of public health, with an extensive history of effectively addressing health‐enhancing and health‐compromising behaviors through individual and collective action. SCT has been extensively applied in the development and evaluation of theory‐based, behavioral health interventions. When applying SCT, the number of theoretical constructs can seem overwhelming, and the processes of change do not necessarily seem linear or even logical. However, the first step for public health practitioners is to carefully review the SCT‐oriented risk factor literature for the selected behavioral outcomes (e.g., goal setting, predicting physical activity) and to examine relevant intervention literature to determine the strongest evidence‐based combination of intervention components. A key step is to identify the most relevant and effective SCT constructs associated with the targeted behavior with consideration of the appropriateness and relevance for the intended audience and setting. Another important step usually involves facilitating the use of SCT and the tenets of reciprocal determinism with community partners.
