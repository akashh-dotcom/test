   <para id="ch0022s0000p0004">Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) addresses the classic tension between human agency and the social structure by emphasizing the construct of<emphasis>reciprocal determinism</emphasis>, which suggests that human agency and the environment interact with and influence each other, leading to individual and social change. As Mantey, Hunt, Hoelscher, and Kelder explain in <ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>, underlying SCT is the proposition that individuals have the capacity to change or even build the environment. By emphasizing the <emphasis>dynamism in the interactions</emphasis> among human behavior, personal cognitive factors, and social‐environmental influences, SCT moves away from an exclusive focus on one level or the other and has been one of the most influential theories in health behavior.</para>

   <para id="ch0022s0000p0005">The various key SCT constructs and the relationships among them are detailed in the chapter, but it is worth noting that many researchers have tested only selective concepts from the theory rather than the entire theory. A few deserve particular attention: self‐efficacy and its counterpart, collective efficacy, and observational learning or modeling. Self‐efficacy is one of the most widely used constructs by health behavior theorists and practitioners and some have gone so far as to argue that it is the “central mechanism of behavior change” (Cervone,<link linkend="ch0022s0000li0003">2000</link>). Self‐efficacy has been applied to many domains of health behavior and has been adopted for use in other theories, such as the Health Belief Model (<ulink url="ch0018">Chapter 5</ulink>), the Theory of Planned Behavior, Integrative Behavioral Model, and Reasoned Action Approach (<ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 6</ulink>). <emphasis>Collective efficacy</emphasis>, a community‐level concept, has been argued by some as promoting social cohesion and reducing health disparities (Butel &amp; Braun, <link linkend="ch0022s0000li0002">2019</link>). A major appeal of the concepts of self‐efficacy and collective efficacy is that they are modifiable factors.</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0006">The concept of<emphasis>observational learning</emphasis> (or <emphasis>modeling</emphasis>) proposes that behavior change may occur as a result of observing others. This idea has been a deep vein mined in a variety of disciplines that explain phenomena such as media violence, intervention skills to address <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8412">substance abuse</ulink>, and adapting new behaviors and skills.</para>
