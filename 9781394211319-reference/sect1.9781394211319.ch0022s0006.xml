   <para id="ch0022s0000p0001">Humans are social beings, and the power of social connections to influence health is one of the most pervasive, consistent findings in the public health and social science literature. There have been myriad and divergent changes in our social fabric over the last two decades. Almost a quarter‐century ago, in <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> book<emphasis>Bowling Alone</emphasis>, political scientist Robert Putnam (<link linkend="ch0022s0000li0014">2000</link>) documented how participation in many traditional social groups and structures (such as bowling leagues, religious organizations, and parent/teacher associations) has been diminishing. The US Surgeon General drew attention to the diminishing social connections as the reason for the loneliness “epidemic” and issued an Advisory and guidance to promote social connections (Office of Surgeon General, <link linkend="ch0022s0000li0012">2023</link>). The importance of interpersonal connections is further amplified by an exponential growth in social media and virtual communications as important ways for people to connect, with an estimated 4.7 billion users worldwide (Data Reportal, <link linkend="ch0022s0000li0004">2023</link>; Pew Research Center, <link linkend="ch0022s0000li0013">2021</link>). Social media use has been blamed for both promoting and diminishing social connections, with mixed evidence (See <ulink url="ch0038">Chapter 22</ulink>).</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0002">The mechanisms that link individuals’ social contexts with health effects revolve around two important social processes: social support and social influence. Both are products of how strongly or weakly individuals are integrated into the society around them. Integration in the form of ties to social networks or to larger social institutions plays a profound role in an individual’s health (Holt‐Lunstad et al.,<link linkend="ch0022s0000li0007">2010</link>).</para>
   <para id="ch0022s0000p0003">A fundamental assumption driving the theories and models in this section is the reciprocal influence between cognitions, affect, and behaviors of individuals and the environments around them. This chapter introduces these theories and models, describes their defining characteristics, and discusses some future research directions.</para>
