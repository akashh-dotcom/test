      <title>Break‐it‐Off (BIO) Smoking Cessation Campaign</title>

      <anchor id="ch0038s0000a0028"/>
      <para id="ch0038s0000p0030">Break‐it‐Off (BIO) is an innovative, multicomponent, web‐based, and social media approach to smoking cessation (Baskerville et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0018">2016</link>). The campaign, developed and implemented by the Canadian <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">Cancer</ulink> Society, was aimed at young adult smokers aged 19–29 in six provinces across Canada to engage them in smoking cessation through use of a website and social media. BIO used a “break‐up” metaphor, comparing quitting smoking with ending a romantic relationship, to provide support and encourage young smokers to “break up” with their smoking addiction.</para>
      <para id="ch0038s0000p0031">The intervention guided users through the challenging stages of ending an unhealthy relationship with smoking: getting it over with, staying split up, and moving on with life. Users could also learn through the website about established quit methods, such as telephone counseling, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=3261">nicotine</ulink> patches, and <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=3261">nicotine</ulink> gum. They could upload a video of their “break‐up with smoking” experience as well as announce their break‐up status to friends via Facebook.</para>
      <para id="ch0038s0000p0032">BIO was evaluated using a quasi‐experimental design with baseline and three‐month follow‐up data from smokers exposed to BIO (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 102 at follow‐up) and a comparison group of Smokers’ Helpline (SHL) users (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 136 at follow‐up). Findings demonstrated that the campaign resulted in reaching a wide swath of young adults and led to significantly higher quit attempts and quit rates compared with SHL users alone.</para>
      <para id="ch0038s0000p0033">The success of this intervention may be attributed to social influence, social norms, and social support delivered through virtual social networks. For example, when smokers posted videos about their “break‐up” experiences and/or announced their break‐ups, they exerted a form of social influence that encouraged others in the network to follow suit. As elaborated in Social Cognitive Theory (see<ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 9</ulink>), individuals learn by observing the behaviors of others (modeling) and that learning can occur intentionally or unintentionally (Bandura, <link linkend="ch0038s0000li0017">2001</link>, p. 271).</para>

      <para id="ch0038s0000p0034">In November 2020, the number of COVID‐19 cases was rapidly increasing across the United States, and, owing to concerns that holiday travel would exacerbate the problem, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that people stay home for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. In this context, researchers (Breza et al.,<link linkend="ch0038s0000li0029">2021</link>) ran a large, clustered, randomized controlled trial with Facebook users in randomly selected zip codes in the United States. The purpose of the study was to identify whether short videos delivered through Facebook would influence population‐level holiday travel and, in turn, cause a decline in COVID‐19 cases after the holidays.</para>
      <para id="ch0038s0000p0035">Researchers worked with physicians and nurses before Thanksgiving and Christmas to record 20‐second videos to encourage people to stay home for the holidays. They then disseminated the videos as sponsored content (ads) to Facebook subscribers in randomly selected zip codes in 820 counties in 13 states. Over 11 million people (35% of users in the targeted regions) received at least one ad before Thanksgiving, and over 23 million people (66% of users in targeted regions) received at least one video before Christmas. On average, each user reached by the campaign received 2.6 videos at Thanksgiving and 3.5 at Christmas.</para>
      <para id="ch0038s0000p0036">The primary COVID‐related outcome was COVID‐19 infections recorded at the zip code level in the two‐week period starting five days after the holiday. Infections declined by 3.5% in intervention compared to control zip codes. Researchers concluded that social media messages recorded by health professionals before the winter holidays in the United States led to a significant reduction in holiday travel and subsequent COVID‐19 infections.</para>
      <para id="ch0038s0000p0037">This study seems to have exploited a unique characteristic or capacity of social media: targeting and engaging people in specific regions and/or population groups. This distinctive ability distinguishes social media from conventional mass media such as television where messages are usually pushed out to largely undifferentiated mass audiences.</para>
