   <para id="ch0020s0000p0050">Several commentaries, studies, and evaluations have challenged the applicability and/or utility of the TTM. One criticism is that stage of change is not the most appropriate predictor of long‐term outcomes. Several studies have been conducted to examine, within the TTM, which variables predict long‐term outcomes across multiple behaviors (Blissmer et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0011">2010</link>; Redding et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0093">2011</link>). Some researchers have emphasized that severity, or level of addiction, is a more important predictor of long‐term outcomes than stage of change (Abrams et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0004">2000</link>; Farkas et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0026">1996</link>); indeed, severity has been confirmed as an important variable in addition to stage. However, the second important variable is a stage in which participants in Preparation at baseline have better 24‐month outcomes for smoking, diet, and sun exposure than those in Contemplation, and those in Contemplation do better than those in Precontemplation (Blissmer et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0011">2010</link>; Redding et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0093">2011</link>). The third variable is treatment in which participants in treatment do better at 24 months than those randomly assigned to control groups for smoking, diet, and sun exposure. The fourth and final variable is an effort effect, in which participants in both treatment and control groups who progressed to Action and Maintenance at 24 months were making better efforts with TTM variables like pros and cons, self‐efficacy, and processes at baseline. There were no consistent demographic effects across the three behaviors. What these and other similar results indicate is that either‐or thinking (such as either severity or stage) is not as helpful as an approach that seeks to identify the most important effects, whether they are based on TTM or an addiction or severity model.</para>
   <para id="ch0020s0000p0051">Another frequent criticism of the TTM is the categorization of the stages of change. O’Keefe (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0071">2016</link>) raises the concern that classification criteria into stages may seem artificial or vary between studies and across behaviors. A review of the literature may seem to show that this is true, but discrepancies are often due to misinterpretation of the stage definitions or a lack of fidelity in the application of the theory. In addition, the TTM has been widely used in studies of diverse behaviors and populations including low‐income individuals, nurses, pregnant women, adolescents, children, elderly, employees, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10343">primary care</ulink> patients, and those receiving in‐patient treatment (see Hashemzadeh et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0038">2019</link>; Jiménez‐Zazo et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0047">2020</link>; Kleis et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0052">2021</link>; Nunes et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0070">2017</link> for examples), and researchers have adapted the definitions based upon their knowledge of specific behaviors. O’Keefe (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0071">2016</link>) also raises the concern that the stages may not be mutually exclusive categories and that a continuum may be better suited for understanding behaviors than discrete stages. However, in all early publications on the topic of the stages of change, they were in fact described as a continuum.</para>
   <para id="ch0020s0000p0052">Some researchers have explored alternative ways of formulating stages or have attempted to develop more parsimonious theories that use fewer constructs (Abrams et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0004">2000</link>; Herzog et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0040">1999</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0041">2000</link>). Other research has found that change processes and other TTM variables predict stage progress (for example, DiClemente et al., 199l; Dijkstra et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0019">2006</link>; Evans et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0022">2000</link>; Prochaska et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0083">1985</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0087">2004</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0089">2008</link>; Sun, et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0106">2007</link>; Velicer et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0109">2007</link>). Evans et al. (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0022">2000</link>) explained some of the inconsistencies in previous research by demonstrating better predictions over 6 months versus 12 months, and better predictions using all 10 processes of change instead of a subset.</para>
   <para id="ch0020s0000p0053">Although TTM has been applied across at least 48 behaviors and populations from many countries, limitations of its application have been identified. To date, population trials based on TTM have not produced significant effects in preventing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8412">substance abuse</ulink> among children (see, for example, Aveyard et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0007">1999</link>; Hollis et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0042">2005</link>). For example, in 2000, Peterson et al. (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0074">2000</link>) commented that most school‐based smoking prevention trials failed and suggested that the field should move beyond social influence models but raised the question of whether this was due to methodological issues or actual failure of the interventions. Indeed, individually focused prevention trials are challenging across theories. Further, after the Master Tobacco Settlement in 1998, and with the increase in policies restricting tobacco sales to minors, it became increasingly difficult to find intervention effects due to the overall reduction in adolescent use of combustible tobacco products.</para>
   <para id="ch0020s0000p0054">It might be concluded that TTM does not apply very well to children and adolescents. There is a basic question regarding the age at which intentional behavior change begins. Applied studies of bullying prevention in elementary, middle, and high schools produced significant results (Prochaska et al.,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0088">2007</link>). Similarly, early intervention with adolescent smokers using TTM‐tailored treatments produced significant abstinence rates at 24 months that were almost identical to rates with treated adult smokers (Hollis et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0042">2005</link>). This was also true for TTM‐tailored interventions targeting sun‐protective behaviors in adolescents (Norman et al., <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0069">2007</link>). Because there has been much more research done applying the TTM to reducing risks than to preventing risks, conclusions about intervention effects related to life stage may be confused with questions of reduction versus prevention of risks.</para>

   <para id="ch0020s0000p0055">Given the global application of TTM, it will be important to determine in which cultures TTM can be applied effectively and in which cultures it may require major adaptations or if other theoretical frameworks may be a better fit. In a meta‐analysis of the relationships between stages and pros and cons of changing in studies conducted in 10 countries, there was no significant effect by country (Hall &amp; Rossi,<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0036">2008</link>). However, the studies included were only in 10 of the many countries in the world, and mainly in industrialized higher‐income nations.</para>
