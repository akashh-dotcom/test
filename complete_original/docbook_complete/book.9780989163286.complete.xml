      </preface><preface id="pr0002"><title>Preface</title><para>Since its introduction into clinical practice in the early 1980s, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has exhibited exceptional growth and created a paradigm shift in medicine. Not only has this imaging modality markedly expanded the roles of imaging in medical diagnoses, opening up vistas in neurological, musculoskeletal, oncological, cardiovascular and a variety of other diseases not accessible to prior imaging techniques, but it has also had a profound impact on our basic understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of abnormal conditions and disease processes.</para>
    <para>The continuous growth of MRI has led to an explosion in the number of patients, healthcare professionals, and other individuals exposed to the powerful static magnetic field, rapidly changing magnetic fields, and intense radiofrequency fields used during the procedures. Numerous investigations have been performed during the past 35+ years in an effort to characterize the bioeffects and safety aspects of MRI. However, the interactions of the MRI-related electromagnetic fields with biologic tissues are still incompletely understood and safety issues persist despite best efforts to implement preventive practices. Unfortunately, this has led to many adverse consequences, including injuries to patients and healthcare workers, as well as several patient deaths.</para>
    <para>The transformative impact of MRI on medicine continues to progress and advances in technology continue unabated. Whereas the highest magnetic field used in routine clinical imaging was 1.5-Tesla during most of the 1990s, 3-Tesla is currently the standard. Presently, a 7-Tesla scanner is approved for clinical use and research is routinely performed at 9.4-Tesla, 10.5- and an 11.7-Tesla MR system recently came on line to scan human subjects. In addition to the high static magnetic fields, both the speed of magnetic field gradient switching and the levels of radiofrequency field exposures are pushing limits well beyond what was possible just a few years before. Therefore, we strongly believe that, for progress to continue in this field, appropriate safeguards must be in place to protect all human subjects exposed to MRI, which includes both patients and healthcare workers, alike. This is best accomplished by conducting careful research directed towards studying the effects of the electromagnetic fields used in clinical and research MRI settings and implementing cautionary measures based on the knowledge acquired during the last three and a half decades.</para>
    <para>Ultimately, MRI safety must begin with understanding the interactions of the electromagnetic fields used in MRI with biologic tissues. The issues concerning human safety in the MRI environment led us to enlist leading physicians and scientists around the world to collaborate on the first edition of this textbook, published in 2014, which organized and reviewed the scientific literature on the safety aspects of MRI. Since then, there have been thousands of new articles published in the scientific literature detailing MRI safety issues from every conceivable approach. Thus, the first edition of this textbook rapidly became outdated. Accordingly, we once again brought together an internationally respected group</para>
    <para>v</para>
    <para>of experts who are directly involved in all areas of MRI bioeffects, safety, and patient management to update this important book. Notably, several new chapters were added to this second edition, with the intent of covering advanced or emerging topics for the MRI community. The unique collective expertise of these physicians (radiologists, cardiologists, internists, etc.), scientists, engineers, and other professionals has once again resulted in vital contributions to this resource of essential scientific knowledge that covers all of the critical topics of interest to physicians, MRI technologists and radiographers, physicists, scientists, healthcare professionals, imaging center managers, bioengineers, regulatory affairs professionals, and laypersons. The ambitious purpose of this textbook is to provide actionable information that will be used to ensure that the MRI environment is as safe as possible under all circumstances. We hope that we have accomplished this important goal and that the MRI community will benefit from the indispensable contents of this textbook.</para>

      </para>
      <para>Most medical professionals today are well aware of the fact that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology uses systems with powerful magnets that make considerable amounts of noise and that you generally cannot bring ferromagnetic objects or patients with certain implants into the scanner room. However, these individuals may not be aware that MR systems use relatively safe radiofrequency (RF) radiation instead of ionizing radiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, etc.) to create images and they may not understand just how powerful the magnets are, why they may always be "on" and why they make so much noise. This chapter provides simple explanations for these matters by presenting information pertaining to basic MRI physics.</para>
      <para>MRI has at its root the chemical technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance or NMR (1, 2). As every chemist knows, the use of the word "nuclear" has nothing to do with radioactivity, but since the general population is not composed of mostly chemists, the medical community has dropped that emotionally laden word to become, simply, MRI. For most MRI examinations, the word "nuclear" has to do with the nucleus of the hydrogen atom, which consists of a single proton. The content of this chapter will begin by examining the magnetic properties of protons and then continue with an explanation of the MRI signal, some basic tissue properties, spin echo formation, and conclude with a brief discussion of MRI hardware issues. Much of the information in this chapter is adapted from<emphasis role="italics">All You Really Need to Know About MRI Physics</emphasis> (3). Several other textbooks also cover this introductory material (4-7).</para>

            <para>A moving electric charge, be it positive or negative, produces a magnetic field. The faster a charge moves or the larger the charge, the larger the magnetic field it produces. Think back to when you were a child and would make a crude electromagnet by wrapping wire around a nail and connecting it to a battery. The larger the voltage of the battery, the larger the current and the stronger the magnet.</para>
            <para>Some of the basic properties of a simple proton include mass, a positive electric charge and spin. Granted, a proton does not have a very large electric charge, but it does spin very fast and, therefore, does produce a very small, yet significant, magnetic field. Water is the largest source of hydrogen protons in the body, followed by fat. Normally, the direction that these tiny magnets point in is randomly distributed (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1A</emphasis>).</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> Spinning protons are little magnets which are frequently referred to as "spins".</para>

            <para>Just as a compass aligns with the Earth's magnetic field, a spinning proton placed near (or within) a large external magnetic field (called<emphasis role="bold">B0</emphasis>) will align with the external field. Unfortunately, it is not quite so simple. At the atomic level, some of the protons align with the field and some align against the field, cancelling each other out. A slight excess will align with the field so that the net result is an alignment with the external field. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1B</emphasis> depicts nine protons, four of which have aligned <emphasis role="italics">against</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">B0</emphasis> and five have aligned <emphasis role="italics">with</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">B0</emphasis> resulting in an excess of one proton. (Note that this diagram showing the protons aligning perfectly with or against <emphasis role="bold">B0</emphasis> is not completely accurate.

            <para>A complete explanation of why the protons align both with and against the external magnetic field would require a study of quantum mechanics.

            <para>tinually oscillating back and forth between the two states but at any given instant, and with a large enough sample, there will be a very slight majority aligned with the field. The larger the external static magnetic field, the greater the difference in energy levels and the larger the excess number aligned with the field.<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> demonstrates this for a sample of two million protons. At 1 T there are just six extra protons. At 1.5 T, there are only nine extra protons for every two million. At 3 T there are 18 and at 7 T, the highest field strength used in the clinical setting, there are 42 excess protons for every two million. The number of excess protons is directly proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 2.</emphasis> The number of excess protons aligned with the B<subscript>0</subscript> field is directly proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field. At 1.5 T, for every two million protons there are nine more protons aligned with the field than there are aligned against the field. At 3 T, there are 18 excess protons.</para>
            <para>As will be discussed more fully later in this chapter, the MR signal comes from just these excess protons. With only nine out of two million protons (at 1.5 T) in excess, one might ask how can we even detect such a small signal? We shall answer that question by first asking a different question: how many excess protons are there in a single imaging voxel? (A voxel is a three-dimensional or volume pixel.) Without going into the math in great detail, assume a voxel dimension of 1-mm x 1-mm x 5-mm = 0.005-cm<superscript>3</superscript> or 0.005-ml. Using Avogadro's Number, we can calculate that there are a total of 3.4 x 10<superscript>20</superscript> water protons in a 0.005-ml voxel. If nine out of every two million protons are in excess, then there are a total of 1.5 x 10<superscript>15</superscript> protons in every voxel that will contribute to the MR signal (or, on the order of a million billion protons). The important lesson here is that even though a spinning proton is a very poor magnet, the number of excess protons that align with the field is so large that we can basically ignore quantum mechanics and focus on the classical mechanics description.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> The total magnetic field of the excess protons is defined as <emphasis role="bold">M0</emphasis>.</para>
            <para>While it was stated above that, due to the large number of excess protons, we can pretty much ignore quantum physics, there is still one issue that is best discussed using quantum physics terminology. The relationship between the energy (E) of a photon or a unit of electromagnetic radiation and its frequency (ν) (the Greek symbol 'nu') is described by the Planck's equation:</para>
            <para>E = h ν                                                                                                                                    (1)</para>

          <title>Basic MRI Physics: Implications for MRI Safety</title>
          <para>Where h is known as Planck's constant. In simple words, the energy of electromagnetic radiation goes up directly with the frequency of the radiation.<emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> lists the approximate frequency ranges for different types of electromagnetic radiation. As will be discussed in detail shortly, MRI uses radio waves with frequencies around 10<superscript>7</superscript>-Hz (cycles per second). Most other radiology imaging techniques (e.g., X-ray, computed tomography, and nuclear medicine) use ionizing radiation with frequencies in the 10<superscript>18</superscript>- to 10<superscript>19</superscript>-Hz range or roughly 10<superscript>12</superscript> larger than those used in MRI. Accordingly, X-rays are roughly a trillion times more "energetic" (and potentially damaging) than radio waves. MRI is able to provide such great images not because of the high energy involved (like computed tomography) but because of the large number of protons found in the body, primarily in water and fat.</para>

Imagine the first one is spinning on the international space station. In the absence of gravity, it behaves just like a gyroscope and spins without wobbling. Imagine the second one is spinning on the moon. In the low gravity of the moon, the Dreidel will wobble rather slowly. The third dreidel is spinning on the Earth and wobbles faster than the dreidel on the moon. Imagine a fourth dreidel somewhere on Jupiter (if you could find a solid surface, that is). That dreidel would be wobbling the fastest yet.</para>

            <para>Previously, a spinning proton was described as being a very tiny magnet. Just as a spinning dreidel wobbles about its axis, so do spinning protons wobble, or precess, about the axis of the external B<subscript>0</subscript> field. The frequency of the precession is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field and is defined by the Larmor Equation:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italics">Memorize this!</emphasis> ω<subscript>0</subscript> = γB<subscript>0</subscript>                    (2)</para>
            <para>Where, ω<subscript>0</subscript> is known as either the precessional, Larmor or resonance frequency and γ (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio and is a constant unique to every atom. For a simple proton, γ = 42.56-MHz/T. As before, B<subscript>0</subscript> represents the externally applied static magnetic field. At the magnetic field strengths used in clinical MR systems, 0.2 to 7 T, the resonance frequency of hydrogen ranges from 8.5-MHz to 298-MHz (8.5 x 10<superscript>6</superscript>-Hz to 2.98 x 10<superscript>8</superscript>-Hz). In Table 1, it is shown that this range is in the radiofrequency (RF) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.</para>
            <para>As such, it is now apparent how<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1B</emphasis> was slightly inaccurate. The spins do align roughly with (or against) the static magnetic field but, if you could take a freeze frame snapshot of all of the protons in a voxel, you would see that each individual proton is slightly tilted. However, remember that the protons are each precessing at faster than ten million times per second, so if you take the average position of the vectors over even a very short amount of time, they will each be aligned either perfectly with, or perfectly against, the main magnetic field.</para>

            <para>If an electromagnetic radiofrequency (RF) pulse is applied at the resonance (Larmor, precession, wobble) frequency, then the protons can absorb that energy. At the quantum level, a single proton "jumps" to a higher energy state. At the macro or classical level, to an observer in the external or laboratory frame of reference, the magnetization vector, M<subscript>0</subscript>, (roughly a million billion protons) spirals down towards the XY plane (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4A</emphasis>). If you could somehow jump aboard M<subscript>0</subscript>, just like onto a merry-go-round, the laboratory would be seem to be rotating around you. In this rotating frame of reference, M<subscript>0</subscript> would seem to smoothly tip down (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4B</emphasis>).

            <para>When the spins are first tilted down to the XY-plane, they are all in-phase. Think of a playground with a million children on swings. If all of the children are going up and down together, at exactly the same rate, then they are swinging in-phase. Assuming that all the children are pumping their legs with the same force and frequency, then they will stay in-phase. But if one child stops pumping for a few seconds and another child pumps a little harder or a little faster, then they will start to get out of sync with everyone else. The same type of thing happens to the spins. For reasons that will be described later, some protons spin a little faster while others spin a little slower (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). Very quickly, they get out of phase relative to some reference (usually the spins at the center of the magnet).</para>

An isolated proton, far from any other proton (or electron), is only affected by the main magnetic field,<emphasis role="bold">BO</emphasis>. As protons (or spins) move together (e.g., due to random motion), their magnetic fields begin to interact. If the field from one proton increases the field that the second proton feels, while the field from the second proton reduces the field that the first proton feels, then the second proton will precess at a slightly faster rate, while the first proton will precess slightly slower (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11A</emphasis>). If the fields from both protons add to the main field, then both protons will precess more rapidly (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11B</emphasis>). As soon as the spins move farther apart, their fields no longer interact and they both return to the original frequency but at different phases. This type of interaction is called spin-spin interaction. These temporary, random interactions cause a cumulative loss of phase across the excited spins resulting in an overall loss of signal.</para>

          <title>FREE INDUCTION DECAY (FID) AND SPIN ECHO FORMATION</title>
          <para>To summarize what has been covered so far, after the RF transmitter is turned off, the protons immediately begin to re-radiate the absorbed energy. If nothing is affecting the homogeneity of the magnetic field, all of the protons will spin at the same resonance frequency. The initial amplitude of the signal is determined by the portion of the magnetization vector (M<subscript>0</subscript>) that has been tipped into the XY-plane. This, in turn, is determined by the sine of the flip angle, α. The maximum resonant signal is obtained when the flip angle is 90°. [Note: sine (0°) = 0, sine (90°) = 1.0] The signal unaffected by any gradient is known as a Free Induction Decay (FID) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>). The time constant that determines the rate of decay is called T<subscript>2</subscript>.</para>

          <para>In the real world, the MR signal decays faster than T<subscript>2</subscript> would predict. Pure T<subscript>2</subscript> decay is a function of completely random interactions between spins. The assumption is that the main external B<subscript>0</subscript> field is absolutely homogeneous. In reality, there are many factors creating imperfections in the homogeneity of a magnetic field. The main magnet itself will have flaws related to the manufacturing process. Every tissue has a different magnetic susceptibility which distorts the field at tissue borders, particularly at air/tissue interfaces. Additionally, patients may have some type of metallic implants (e.g., clips, staples, heart valves, etc.) which cause disruptions of the magnetic field. The sum total of all of these random and fixed effects is called T<subscript>2</subscript>* (pronounced "T-two star") (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 14</emphasis>).</para>

          <para>Thus, T<subscript>2</subscript> relaxation comes from random causes while T<subscript>2</subscript>* comes from a combination of both random and fixed causes. There is nothing that can be done to prevent or compensate for random losses in-phase, but what about the fixed effects? Can anything be done about these losses? The answer is yes.</para>
          <para>Consider the following race (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15A</emphasis>). The contestants are a turtle, a bicyclist, a pace car, an airplane, and a rocket. At the start of the race, everyone is together (in-phase.) Once the race starts (at t = 0), the contestants all move out, each at their fastest pace. Soon, there is a noticeable distance between them.</para>
          <para>After some time, let's call it TE/2, a signal is given for everyone to turn around and go back. Assuming that everyone is still going at the same rate as before, then after an additional time, TE/2, they all arrive at the starting/finish line together (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15B</emphasis>). In terms of MRI, at the time TE (TE/2 + TE/2), all the spins are back in-phase, producing a large signal. This large signal is called a spin echo and the time TE is called the echo time (δ).</para>

          <para>As described above, a 180° pulse can be used to reverse the T<subscript>2</subscript>* dephasing process and, thereby, produce a spin echo. As soon as the spins all come back into phase at the echo time, they immediately start to go out of phase again. A second 180° pulse will generate a second echo. This process can be repeated many times, producing many echoes, as long as the pure T<subscript>2</subscript> decay mechanisms have left some signal to work with (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 17</emphasis>). This repeating echo train can be used to produce multiple images or can be used to greatly speed up the acquisition time using a method known as fast or turbo spin echo imaging.</para>

          <para>In order to perform MRI, the patient must be placed inside of some sort of magnet. There are many factors that go into the design of a magnet used in an MR system. As stated above, the higher the strength of the static magnetic field, the larger the number of excess protons there are to produce the MR signal (which usually means better quality images). Also, in order to reduce T<subscript>2</subscript>* signal dephasing the magnetic field in the imaging volume should be as homogeneous as possible over as large a volume as possible.</para>

However, it is the areas that have the most rapidly changing density of field lines (i.e., the largest spatial gradients) that produce the greatest forces that can act on ferromagnetic materials. In other words, it is these areas that represent the greatest danger for items to become projectiles. Examples of projectiles that occurred in the MRI environment may be seen at www.simplyphysics.com (9).</para>
          <para>The vast majority of high field strength MR scanners use superconducting electromagnets to produce the main magnetic field. [Note that some low field MR systems use permanent magnets, which in the past have been limited to fields ≤ 0.35 T (10). More recently, a few vendors have released permanent magnets of 0.4 and 0.5 T (11).] A simple four-loop design of such a magnet used in an MR system is depicted in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 18</emphasis>. The two central loops produce the majority of the field and the two outer loops help to shape it, to make it more homogeneous. Note that the center of the magnet is where the field lines are most closely packed meaning this is where the highest field strength is. The area marked as "isocenter" is also referred to as the "sweet spot", the region with the greatest magnetic field uniformity.</para>

          <para>A current running through a loop of wire wrapped around a nail and attached to a battery produces a small magnetic field. (Actually the nail isn't needed, it just acts to intensify the field.) The larger the current flowing, the greater the magnetic field produced. This type of magnet is called a resistive electromagnet because the wire resists the flow of electrons. This resistance to the current flow also produces heat. While larger currents can generate higher magnetic fields, they will also produce considerable heat.</para>
          <para>Similar to resistive magnets, the field from a superconducting magnet is produced by current flowing in multiple loops of wires. The wires are made out of niobium-titanium which, when cooled to 9.5°K (9.5° above absolute zero), lose all resistance to current flow. The coils are surrounded by liquid helium which boils at 4.2° K (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 19</emphasis>). When the scanner is first installed, a power supply is utilized to slowly build up the current and, thus,</para>

Once it is up to its full field strength, the power supply is disconnected and the current will continue virtually for centuries (as long as it's kept cold, of course).

It is this fringe field that can cause problems with ferromagnetic objects. In general, the five gauss line is the demarcation between what is considered safe or a danger for certain objects. Modern-day MR systems use what is known as "active shielding". An actively-shielded magnet has an inner or primary set of field coils that produces more than the desired field with an outer or secondary set of field coils with a lower current going in the opposite direction (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 20</emphasis>). The smaller opposite field partially cancels the field at the center of the magnet but cancels a much larger portion on the outside. For example, the primary set coils might produce a positive 2 T field while the secondary coils produce a negative 0.5 T, resulting in a net 1.5 T field at the center of the magnet but, because the secondary coils are closer to the outside, they create a greater amount of cancellation.</para>

        <para>The advantage of modern actively-shielded magnets is that the five gauss line can be restricted relatively close to the magnet. However, this also means that as one moves closer to the bore of the magnet, the field strength rises rapidly over a relatively short distance (i.e., a high spatial gradient magnetic field is present). Understandably, a relatively high spatial gradient magnetic field can produce substantial issues for ferromagnetic objects.

          <title>Time-Varying Gradient Magnetic Fields</title>
          <para>The main magnetic field, B<subscript>0</subscript>, discussed above is also known as the static magnetic field, meaning that it never changes over time. In order to actually produce MR images, it is necessary to apply a magnetic field that changes over time and space in a predictable fashion. What is needed is to be able to produce a change that is linear moving away from the magnet center, with positive changes in one direction and negative changes in the other. (Note, the field at the center of the magnet never changes.) The field produced by a current in a single loop of wire reaches a peak at the center of the coil and drops off non-linearly as it move out (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22A</emphasis>). Obviously, this won't suffice for MRI.</para>
          <para>However, if a second coil with a current flowing in the opposite direction is placed one coil diameter away from the first, the fields from each coil totally cancel each other at the point midway between them (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22B</emphasis>). The fields interact in such a way that they produce an almost perfectly linear change in the area midway between them. The field change then drops off as you move outside of the coils. This linear change (also known as a gradient) is not only along the centerline between the two coils but remains linear for about half of the center volume. If properly designed, this region of reasonable linearity corresponds with the "sweet spot" or most homogeneous portion of the magnet. Note that the locations with the greatest offset from the field at the center of the magnet are located near the center of each loop. This is also the location of the greatest change in magnetic field per unit time, dB/dt, during an imaging sequence.</para>

          <para>Every gradient system is characterized by two parameters: the peak gradient amplitude, which primarily effects how small the field of view (FOV) may be, and the peak slew rate, which is how fast the gradients can be turned on and off, which affects things like minimum echo and/or repetition times. Between the two, a fast slew rate is usually better from an MR imaging consideration than a high peak amplitude, however, faster slew rates cause more safety-related issues, as will be discussed below.</para>
          <para>From the standpoint of MRI safety, these time-varying gradients raise two primary areas of concern. The first is acoustic noise that is associated with the gradient magnetic fields (13-15). An MR system can be compared to a giant speaker system. In a typical stereo speaker, there is a small permanent magnet with loops of wire wrapped around it and the magnet is attached to the center of a diaphragm. When an oscillating current is applied through the wire, it creates a time-varying gradient magnetic field that pushes and pulls on the permanent magnet, causing the supporting speaker diaphragm to vibrate.</para>
          <para>The static B<subscript>0</subscript> magnet of the MR system is like the speaker's permanent magnet. The imaging gradients are like the little loop of wire wrapped around the permanent magnet. The gradient tube is like the diaphragm. During the imaging process, the imaging gradient can be turned on and off in as little as 1-msec (corresponding to 1000-Hz) or as much as 20-msec (corresponding to 50-Hz). This causes the imaging gradients to push and pull against the main magnetic field, and the physical supporting structures, resulting in vibrations that occur in the typical audio range. The higher the magnetic field, B<subscript>0</subscript>, and the faster the imaging sequence (higher slew rates), the louder the noise is that will be produced. The resulting acoustic noise can be at levels that may cause hearing damage if hearing protection is not used in the MR system room. As shown in the pulse profile of Figure 24, imaging gradients can be turned on and off rather abruptly (i.e., the trapezoidal lobe) or more gradually (i.e., the sinusoidal lobe). There are always trade-offs when designing an imaging se-</para>

          <para>sequence (see below), but using the lowest amplitude and lowest slew rates possible helps to minimize acoustic noise.</para>
          <para>One of the important properties of electromagnetism is that just as an electric current creates a magnetic field, a time-varying gradient magnetic field can produce an electric current in any nearby conductor. This brings us to the other issue that is associated with time-varying gradient magnetic fields. The human body is an electrical conductor. If a patient undergoing MRI has crossed-arms or crossed-legs, these may create a closed loop for current to flow under certain imaging conditions. The rapidly changing imaging gradients can induce current to flow across the body and peripheral nerve stimulation may occur (16). The area near the center of the coils in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22B</emphasis> is the location of the largest dB/dt, so it is at this location where the greatest danger of induced currents exists with respect to peripheral nerve stimulation. Note that at the center of the magnet, the gradients do not produce any change in the magnetic field, so this is where the potential for nerve stimulation is the least.</para>
          <para>To summarize, the potential problems caused by time-varying gradient magnetic fields are, as follows: (1) acoustic noise and (2) peripheral nerve stimulation. The more rapidly the gradients change and the higher the amplitude, the greater the risks. Importantly, for patients with electronically-activated devices, the location of the greatest risk is not at the center of the MR system but at the outer edges of the gradient coils where the absolute changes in the magnetic fields per unit time (i.e., dB/dt) are the highest.</para>

            <emphasis role="bold">RF Coils and RF Power Deposition</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>As discussed above, MRI requires the use of a radio transmitter to provide the RF excitation pulses. Every scanner has a built in body RF coil (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 19</emphasis>) which is used for many of the imaging sequences. Alternatively, the RF excitation pulses can be applied by a smaller transmit RF coil, most commonly designed for imaging either the patient's head or a knee. While some of the applied RF energy that is absorbed ends up producing the MRI signal, most of it actually results in tissue heating of the patient (17). The amount of RF power absorbed by the body increases approximately with the square of the field strength. Accordingly, at higher static magnetic fields, there can be an inherent danger of over-heating the patient (17). The mass normalized rate at which RF energy is coupled to biological tissue is characterized by the specific absorption rate (SAR) and is reported in W/kg relative to the use of a particular pulse sequence and the body weight of the patient.</para>
          <para>The built in transmit body RF coil deposits RF energy over a relatively large area of the patient. Even if only a small amount of tissue is actually being imaged, a large amount of tissue will absorb much of the transmitted energy. By comparison, smaller transmit/receive RF coils have a limited volume of coverage and result in greatly reduced RF power deposition. Additionally, a class of RF coils known as quadrature (quadrature is an engineering term that has nothing to do with the number four) coils result in less power deposition than comparably-sized linear coils. Notably, this information has implications for scanning patients with certain types of biomedical implants insofar as it may be necessary to prevent substantial implant heating by limiting the MRI examination to the use of a transmit/receive head RF coil only, versus performing the MRI procedure using a transmit body RF coil and a receive-only head coil (e.g., certain neurostimulation systems used for spinal cord stimulation have these particular conditions specified in the MRI labeling).</para>

            <title>Imaging Sequences</title>
            <para>While there are many different types of imaging sequences used for MRI, most have three basic steps in common which are: (1) Exciting a slice or slab of tissue by using a slice select gradient combined with one or more RF excitation pulses. In an axial image, the Z-gradient is the slice select gradient. (2) Applying one (2D) or two (3D) spatial encoding gradients known as phase encoding pulses. The details of how this works are beyond the scope of this chapter. In an axial plane 2D image, the phase encoding direction can be in either the X-direction (i.e., left/right) or the Y-direction (i.e., anterior/posterior). For the moment, let's assume it is in the Y-direction. For a three dimensional image, there will also be a phase encode pulse in the Z or slice select direction. (3) Reading out the MRI signal while applying a third spatial encoding gradient known as the frequency encoding gradient.</para>
            <para>The pulse diagrams of two of the simplest imaging sequences, a basic gradient echo (GRE) (18), also known as a field echo (FE) and a basic spin echo (SE) are shown in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 25</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 26</emphasis>, respectively (8). As was previously discussed (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 16</emphasis>), a SE sequence requires two RF pulses while, as shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 25</emphasis>, a GRE sequence uses a single RF pulse. The SE pulse sequence is most commonly used for T1-weighted imaging incorporating a 90°/180° pair of RF pulses. The GRE pulse sequence can use virtually any flip angle, which then impacts the type of image-weighting that results, in part, by the combination of the flip angle, echo time (TE) and repetition time (TR). Typically, flip angles from 20° to 40° are used for T<subscript>2</subscript>*-weighting and flip angles from 70° to 90° are used for T<subscript>1</subscript>-weighting. The key point here is that, with only one RF pulse, the RF power deposition, or SAR, is substantially lower with GRE sequences than with SE sequences. This is particularly important on MRI examinations using MR systems operating at 3 T or higher.</para>

This type of sequence can have an echo train length (ETL) as short as two to four for T<subscript>1</subscript>-weighted or proton density-weighting, or moderate echo train lengths of eight to 32 for T<subscript>2</subscript>-weighted imaging, or as long as 128 to 256 for MRI procedures such as single shot myelograms or cholangiograms (20, 21).

            <para>With all of the associated gradient activity, a FSE pulse sequence may suffer from the consequences of time-varying gradient magnetic fields discussed earlier. More importantly, particularly at 1.5-T and higher fields, all of the 180° RF pulses significantly increase the specific absorption rate (SAR) level. Accordingly, the MR system reported SAR may exceed the recommended FDA limits for specific absorption rate. When this happens, there are five possible options: (1) Increase the repetition time (TR) so that the average power per unit time goes down. (2) Decrease the total number of slices acquired per TR (3, 17), as half the number of slices means half the RF power. (3) Use the technique known as Half-Fourier imaging (22). This takes advantage of the symmetry in MRI raw data to reduce the number of lines of data required (and the associated acquisition time and RF power) by roughly one half. The disadvantage to this is that it reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by the square root of two. (4) Use refocusing RF pulses less than 180°. The amount of RF energy per RF pulse of a given duration is proportional to the square of the flip angle so a 180° RF pulse deposits four times as much as a 90° pulse of the same length. Reduce the flip angle of a large number of RF pulses and the total SAR will be decreased. (5) Use "low SAR" RF pulses. The amount of RF energy per RF pulse of given amplitude is proportional to the duration of the pulse. Instead of doubling the amplitude of the 90° RF pulse to obtain a 180° flip, you can double the duration. This will reduce the specific absorption rate in half but will also result in much longer time between echoes reducing the number of echoes possible per repetition time (TR) thereby increasing the total scan time.</para>
            <para>Reducing the flip angle of the refocusing pulse does reduce the SAR, but with all things in MRI, there are tradeoffs. In terms of refocusing spins that are going out of phase due to T<subscript>2</subscript>* effects (Figure 16), a 180° pulse is optimal. Reducing the refocusing flip angle from 180° to 140° for a single echo will reduce the effectiveness by about 12%. The effect on the signal-to-noise (SNR) when using multiple refocusing pulses becomes very complicated but suffice to say that the SNR is maximum with 180° pulses and goes down from there. While RF power deposition is mainly a problem at higher static magnetic field strengths,</para>

This type of sequence is most commonly used for diffusion-weighted imaging (DTI) or functional MRI (fMRI). The RF excitation utilizes a single 90°/180° pair so the SAR levels associated with these pulse sequences are usually not a problem. However, these sequences use the absolute fastest changing gradients so they have the greatest potential for creating the possible problems related to the time-varying gradient magnetic fields discussed above.</para>

          <title>Parallel Imaging Reconstruction</title>
          <para>The goal of most clinical MRI examinations is to achieve the best quality that is possible in the shortest acquisition time. Over the years, gradient slew rates have increased dramatically, improving the imaging speed of many techniques (such as FSE and EPI discussed above). However, there is still a physical limit as to how fast gradients can be turned on and off as well as the practical limit that exists to prevent problems such as peripheral nerve stimulation. The main purpose of the imaging gradients is to impart spatial information to the MRI signal. One might ask is there any other way of obtaining at least some of the spatial information?</para>
          <para>As discussed earlier, with the exception of transmit/received RF coils such as those used for the knee or head, most MRI procedures use the body RF coil for excitation and passive receive-only coils to detect the MRI signal. Modern-day MR systems use multi-channel phased-array (PA) RF coils that are designed for specific, limited anatomical coverage. These PA coils consist of multiple small coils (anywhere from two to 64) where each coil is sensitive to signal from only a portion of the FOV. A very simple four channel configuration typical of early torso phase-array coils is shown in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 29</emphasis>. In this case, four images are produced, one from the signal obtained from each coil, which are then combined to make a single composite image. Roughly speaking, the SNR of the final image obtained with a PA coil increases by the square root of the number of channels used (24).</para>

          <para>of a class of parallel imaging reconstruction methods, utilize the known or measured sensitivity profile of each individual coil to impart some spatial information. This makes it possible to reduce the number of phase encoding (PE) steps that are required for virtually any imaging technique. As the number of PE steps goes down, so does the total SAR. If the acquisition time is reduced by a factor of two, then the SAR is cut in half. If the acquisition time is reduced by a factor of four, then the SAR is cut to one-fourth. Theoretically, while it is possible to "speed up" a scan by a factor equal to the number of different coil elements, in practice the speed up factors are usually less than four. The main reason for this limitation is that while the acquisition time may be faster, the SNR of the final image is proportional to the square root of the number of actual phase encoding views used. If the scan is speeded up by a factor of four, the SNR is cut in half. Therefore, while high field strength MR systems have an initially high SNR, there is a limit as to how much SNR can be "thrown away".</para>
          <para>One final cautionary note about parallel imaging techniques: some MRI centers may decide to use "speed up" factors of two or three but then are unhappy with the SNR of the final images. Therefore, these MRI facilities use two or three signal averages for the pulse sequence. Of course, that just takes the acquisition time back to what it would have been without the use of parallel imaging. In fact, parallel imaging reconstruction can actually add artifacts to the image, particularly if the patient moves. Thus, parallel imaging should only be used with one signal average. If better SNR is desired, it is best to not use parallel imaging.</para>

          <title>IS THERE AN OPTIMAL FIELD STRENGTH?</title>
          <para>As of 2020 there are at least 16 different companies that manufacture and sell FDA approved MR systems in the United States with static magnetic field strengths ranging from 0.2 T to 7 T (11). An obvious question to ask is, is there an optimal field strength for MRI? The simple answer is, no. A better question is, what are the various tradeoffs at different field strengths? In this final section, many considerations including safety issues when selecting a magnetic field strength for a clinical MR scanner will be presented. A more thorough discussion of the physics of MRI safety is presented in another chapter in this textbook.</para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">Cost</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>As a general rule of thumb, the cost of an MR scanner is around $1M per Tesla (28). The cost will also go up with the number of RF coils and the number of channels the system can handle. Furthermore, higher field magnets are usually larger and heavier and have more expensive siting requirements. Choosing an MR system requires a careful examination of the cost-to-benefit ratio.</para>

            <emphasis role="bold">Signal-To-Noise</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>As was illustrated in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>, the number of excess protons that align with the static magnetic field goes up linearly with field strength. It is these excess protons that are used to produce the MR image. Therefore, the signal strength goes up with the field strength. While there are many other issues that affect SNR, such as the differences of RF penetration and sources of RF noise at different field strengths, as well RF coil design, the number of</para>
          <para>channels, differences in relaxation time constants and details of the imaging sequences, in general, the SNR goes up linearly with the field strength (29-31).</para>
          <para>This extra SNR can be utilized to obtain higher resolution images in the same scan time or to keep the overall resolution constant but with shorter scans, meaning potentially higher patient throughput. Because the SNR of a scan is proportional to the square root of the scan time, to get the same SNR of a four minute scan at 1.5 T would only require a one minute scan at 3 T. (Of course what usually happens at 3 T is that a higher resolution scan is obtained at some slightly shorter scan time.) At higher static magnetic fields it is also possible to perform techniques that inherently have low SNR such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI) (32-33). However, for these techniques there are still tradeoffs. For example, scanning at 3 T may be roughly four times faster than at 1.5 T, but problems with image distortion also go up proportional to field strength.</para>
          <para>In addition to the inherent higher SNR at higher field strengths, most high and ultra-high field scanners utilize phased array coils with a high number of channels, typically between 8 and 32 channels or even as high as 64. As was stated above, the SNR increases, roughly, with the square root of the number of channels providing more opportunities for faster and/or higher resolution scans. Of course, the greater the number of channels, the higher the monetary cost.</para>

          <title>Tissue Heating (SAR)</title>
          <para>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has set guidelines for the specific absorption rate (SAR) during a clinical MRI examination (Table 4). It is important to note that these guidelines are independent of the strength of the static magnetic field. Because the RF power deposited in the body increases roughly with the square of the magnetic field (17, 31, 34-36) higher field strength scanners are more likely to bump up against these limits, (1.5 T occasionally, 3 T and up quite frequently).</para>

          <title>Acoustic Noise</title>
          <para>One of the most commonly asked questions about an MR scanner is, why is it so noisy? As was discussed above in the section on time-varying gradient magnetic fields, an MRI system is comparable to a stereo speaker. The force that causes the vibrations is known as the Lorentz force and is described for a single charged particle moving through a magnetic field as (34):</para>
          <para>F<subscript>L</subscript> = q (v × B)                    (5)</para>
          <para>Where q is the charge of a particle, v is the velocity of the charge and F<subscript>L</subscript> is the Lorentz force. If we change q, the charge of a single particle, to Q, the total charge going through a wire, then the product Qv is effectively the current in the wire which determines the strength of the applied gradient. We see from this that the relevant forces that result in the acoustic noise go up with both the magnetic field and the amplitude of the imaging gradients. Typically, low field magnets have low amplitude gradients with low slew rates and high field magnets have higher amplitudes with higher slew rates.</para>
          <para>Price, et al. (34) reported typical acoustic noise levels of approximately 83 dB(A) on a 0.23 T low field open MR system and over 118 dB(A) on a 3 T scanner. These investigators found that pulse sequence parameters (particularly FOV and TR) had a greater effect on the acoustic noise level than did the field strength. However, it should be noted that high field systems typically utilize smaller FOVs and faster scans, inherently resulting in greater acoustic noise.</para>

          <title>Flying Objects (Projectiles)</title>
          <para>It is well known that ferromagnetic objects are attracted to magnets and, thus, they should not be brought near an MR scanner lest the object become a projectile. Does the danger go up with the field strength? Not necessarily! The translational force exerted on a ferromagnetic object as it is moved near a magnet is not dependent on the strength of the</para>
          <para>magnet but, rather, it is dependent on the rate of change or spatial gradient of the magnetic field (35). At the magnet isocenter, where the field is fairly homogenous, there is almost no translational force regardless of the field strength. However, consider the case of two whole body magnets, a 1.5 T and 3 T. Typically, the 5 gauss line is somewhere just past the foot of the patient table or maybe near the scan room door. Between the 5 gauss line and the center of the magnet there is a region where the magnetic field changes fairly rapidly. If the design of the two magnets are similar, then the maximum spatial gradient of the 3 T scanner will be roughly twice that of the 1.5 T scanner. However, you could have one design where most of the change of the 1.5 T field occurs over a shorter distance, say 0.5 meter while a 3 T magnet may be designed to have most of the change occur over a 1.0 meter distance. The spatial gradient magnetic fields would be similar. That being said, the higher the static magnetic field, the greater the likelihood that it will have a higher spatial gradient and a greater danger of projectile-related incidence objects.</para>

            <emphasis role="bold">Artifacts</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>Another consideration for image quality is the presence of imaging artifacts. In general, higher field strengths are more prone to motion artifacts (37). While it is easier to do fat suppression at higher fields, they can also suffer from chemical shift artifacts (38). Susceptibility artifacts also increase with magnetic field strength and may be very problematic in the presence of metallic implants (38, 39). One of the biggest sources of artifacts at high field strengths, and the last topic for this chapter, is the dielectric effect.</para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">RF Penetration and the Dielectric Effect</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>With all imaging sequences, image contrast depends greatly on the type of RF pulse(s) used. The assumption is that all of the protons in the field of view (FOV) experience roughly the same levels of RF during the imaging sequence. In other words, we assume that the RF field (also known as the B<subscript>1</subscript> field) is fairly uniform across the FOV. With a well-designed transmit RF coil, at 1.5 T and lower, this is a reasonable assumption. However, at higher field strengths than 1.5 T, dielectric effects can cause substantial variation in the B<subscript>1</subscript> field across the FOV which, in turn, can cause significant variations in signal amplitude and/or contrast in an image (35, 40-42).</para>
          <para>The dielectric constant, ε<subscript>r</subscript>, of water (which predominates in the human body) is approximately 80 (in a vacuum it is 1.0). The wavelength of radio waves moving through a medium other than a vacuum is reduced by the square root of ε<subscript>r</subscript>, or in this case roughly a factor of 9. At 3 T, with a resonance frequency of 128 MHz, the wavelength in a vacuum is 235 cm but in the human body it is approximately 26 cm. This is on the same order as the dimensions of the human body, particularly of the torso. As a result, "standing waves" can form inside of the body resulting in peaks and troughs of different effective RF strength or flip angles. At 7 T the wavelength drops to around 11 cm and you get substantial dielectric effects in the brain, as well.</para>
          <para>When using simple gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequences to image a uniform phantom, the signal amplitude is determined by the amount of spins tipped onto the XY plane and is proportional to the sine of the flip angle (ignoring T1, T2, TR and TE). Figure 30 depicts a series of images obtained on a Siemens 1.5 T Aera and a Siemens 3 T Skyra using a GRE</para>
          <para>pulse sequence with a flip angle of 720°. Since the sine of 720° = 0 (as are the sine of 0°, 180°, 360° and 540°) any spins that experience a full 720° flip angle should produce little to no signal.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 30A</emphasis> shows axial, coronal, and sagittal MR images acquired using a water filled phantom on a 1.5 T scanner. The dark ring in each image shows where in the phantom the spins were all flipped the full 720°. The brighter regions show where spins experience either a little more RF or a little less. (Remember, most MR images are magnitude images. If they had been "real" or "complex", then any spins experiencing more than 720° would have a positive signal and less than 720° would have a negative signal.) Unfortunately, with this single GRE sequence, it is not possible to tell exactly how much more or less than 720° the other spins experienced. The important thing to note about these images is that the signal distribution is rather simple, moderately uniform, and with good circular symmetry.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis> shows the same water filled phantom imaged on the 3 T MR system. These images are much more complicated, with multiple bands or regions of bright and dark signal. The dark signal occurs everywhere a spin experiences a flip angle that is close to a multiple of 180°, most likely either 540° or 720°. The brightest regions occur where the flip angle is a multiple of 180° ± 90°, most likely 630°, with the grey signal somewhere in between. The situation is actually still more complex. Not only does the RF have to penetrate the phantom and excite the spins, the signals from these spins have to make it back out to the RF coil, further complicating the interpretation of these images.</para>
          <para>At 3 T and higher, many phantoms used to perform QA testing are filled with some sort of oil (42). General Electric uses poly(dimethylsiloxane) or silicone based oils which have a dielectric constant less than 3. This translates into a wavelength of 136 cm (at 3 T), which is long enough to avoid the same problems that plague water filled phantoms.<emphasis role="bold">Figures 30C</emphasis></para>

          <para>While the images in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 30</emphasis> help to visualize the problem of the dielectric effect they lack detailed quantitative information. There are many approaches to provide better maps of the B<subscript>1</subscript> distribution (43-48) the details of which are beyond the scope of this chapter. Siemens provides in their standard service protocol library a sequence, (rf_map), where the amplitude of each pixel in the phase image is directly proportional to the effective flip angle at that pixel assuming that a nominal 90° RF pulse is applied. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 31</emphasis> shows two 3 T axial B<subscript>1</subscript> field maps obtained with this sequence.

Note that the contours agree with the axial images in <emphasis role="bold">Figures 30B</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">D</emphasis>. The actual flip angles in the water phantom show extensive spatial fluctuation and range from a low of 69° on the left and right 'wings' to a high of 90° at the exact center.

While not shown, at 1.5 T, both phantoms yielded a mean flip angle of about 87° ± 2°) This shows that an oil filled phantom can be used to evaluate the performance of an RF coil without the complication of the dielectric effects.</para>

          <para>The final question is, how does this affect clinical MR images? This is not an easy question to answer because it depends on the type of pulse sequence being used. The greater the number of RF pulses used, the greater the effect. For this discussion, let's only consider a few simple pulse sequences. In each case, we shall call the excitation RF pulse alpha (α) and any refocusing pulse(s), 2α.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italics">Gradient Echo:</emphasis> This is the simplest sequence with only a single α RF pulse. If you have a long TR so that all of the spins have full M<subscript>z</subscript> recovery, then the signal amplitude is proportional to sin(α). Since sin(90) = 1.0, the maximum signal is obtained with a 90° flip</para>
          <para>angle. The average flip angle in the water filled phantom of<emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis> was 77.1° and sin(77.1) = 0.975, so there is less than a 3% decrease in signal. Where the flip angle is 69° (the minimum value shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis>) there is a 7% loss in signal. However, because the spins are <emphasis role="italics">not</emphasis> flipped all the way down to the XY plane, they don't take as long to recover back to M<subscript>z</subscript>=0, so T<subscript>1</subscript> contrast can be reduced.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italics">Spin Echo</emphasis>: This is the next level up in complexity. An ideal spin echo has a 90° excitation pulse and a 180° refocusing pulse. However, any two RF pulses will generate what is known as a Hahn Echo (8) and the signal amplitude is proportional to the product sin(α<subscript>1</subscript>)•sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α<subscript>2</subscript>/2), ignoring T<subscript>1</subscript> recovery. In our case α<subscript>2</subscript> = 2α<subscript>1</subscript> so the product becomes sin(α<subscript>1</subscript>)•sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α<subscript>1</subscript>) = sin<superscript>3</superscript>(α) If α = 90°, then the product equals 1.0. If α = 77.1, then the product equals 0.93, a loss of 7%. At α = 69°, the product equals 0.81, so a loss of 19%. If the TR is short as for a T<subscript>1</subscript>-weighted image, then things become complicated. If we assume that the TE is short relative to the T<subscript>2</subscript> decay rate, then most of the spins effectively experience an α+2α=3α flip angle. When α = 90°, then that is 270° or completely on the XY plane (M<subscript>z</subscript> = 0). However, if α = 70° then this becomes 210° or just 30° past 180° meaning that most of the spins are much closer to the -M<subscript>z</subscript> axis than they are the XY plane and, therefore, will take longer to recover resulting in greater T<subscript>1</subscript> contrast.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italics">Fast Spin Echo</emphasis>: One would expect that each additional non-optimal refocusing pulse would further reduce the MR signal. However, this is not the case. While the first echo in the echo train is just like the spin echo discussed above and is reduced by sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α<subscript>2</subscript>/2) (49, 50), the longer echo train drives the magnetization into a pseudo-steady state with a signal that is reduced by only sin(α<subscript>2</subscript>/2). Again, since α<subscript>2</subscript> = 2α<subscript>1</subscript> the net signal is proportional to sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α), (squared instead of cubed). If α = 90°, then the product equals 1.0. If α = 77.1, then the product equals 0.95, a loss of 5%. At α = 69°, the product equals 0.87, so a loss of 13%.</para>
          <para>The analysis of other types of imaging pulse sequences is beyond the scope of this text. Suffice to say that the non-uniformities in the B<subscript>1</subscript> field at higher static magnetic field strengths caused by dielectric effects seriously complicate image contrast. However, there has been much work done to reduce these effects such as the use of dielectric pads (51-54) or multi-channel, transmit RF coils (51-58).</para>

The same physics helps us to understand the potential risks and problems associated with MRI technology and guides us in how to deal with those issues.

MRI is a safe and effective imaging modality as long as careful attention is given to established safety policies and procedures (59). The other chapters in this textbook provide comprehensive details related to the bioeffects, safety, and patient management aspects of MRI.</para>

          <title>INTRODUCTION: MAIN SOURCES OF RISK IN MRI</title>
          <para>The Standard Model of physics requires 61 fundamental particles to describe the world we live in: 24 for matter and for antimatter, and 13 for interactions between them. Thankfully this chapter is mostly about just one, the electron. Some of the fundamental particles truly have superhero powers: Neutrinos can fly through the Earth as if it were not even there; about 65 billion solar neutrinos do so every second for every square centimeter of Earth's surface facing the Sun. The Higgs boson can give mass and inertia to objects. Quarks and anti-quarks can mix and match into hundreds of wildly different composite particles, some as mundane as neutrons and protons and others as exotic as pentaquarks or Upsilon mesons. Fortunately, this chapter is only about electrons.</para>
          <para>A magnetic resonance MR system or scanner in operation can be thought of as a dance of electrons. A torrent of them goes around and around in the coils of the main magnet, while jets of them streak back and forth in the wires that form the gradient and radiofrequency (RF) coils. Each electron generates a field around itself, to inform the Universe about how everything with electrical charge should get attracted or repelled by it. When an electron moves, it sends a new field, an updated version of the old one. These updates travel outward at the speed of light, broadcasting an electromagnetic wave. As electrons dance, they coax nuclear spins into a dance of their own and the MRI signal is created. This chapter is about this dance of electrons and how individuals may be injured when it goes wrong.</para>

            <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     35</title>
            <para>As the term "magnetic" in the name announces, an MR system is very much about magnetism, and fields generated by electrons flowing in three main types of coils are involved in creating images. First, there is the so-called "main magnet", which produces the large static magnetic field. This is most often a superconducting electromagnet but it could also be a permanent magnet. Added to this are coils to generate the radiofrequency electromagnetic field, referred to as "RF coils". Lastly, the "gradient coils" are responsible for creating linearly-varying magnetic fields, for spatial encoding purposes. While these coils and the manner in which the fields they generate interact with matter can lead to useful images, they can also cause serious threats to human subjects (1-11).</para>
            <para>The main risks associated with MRI have been extensively reported and studied. For example, everyday objects may turn into projectiles, RF energy deposition can cause burns, time-varying gradient magnetic fields can induce nerve stimulation and loud noises can lead to auditory loss. These various risks are associated with the three types of coils discussed above: main magnet, RF coils, and gradient coils, and will be discussed in turn, below. A number of reviews and exposés on related topics can be recommended as supplemental reading (12-23). For those who wish to go even deeper into the physics, excellent basic textbooks exist on electromagnetism (24, 25) and the magnetic properties of materials (26). Good intuition on the interactions between electromagnetic fields and materials can be obtained through numerical simulation of Maxwell's equations (27), the fundamental equations that govern these interactions. For this we recommend an excellent textbook by Elsherbeni and Demir (28) that comes complete with well-documented Matlab code.</para>
            <para>The present chapter is focused toward providing intuition about the physical mechanisms that give rise to MRI-related risks. In the process, several equations will be presented, including the Lorentz force equation and two of Maxwell's equations that provide the mathematical basis for the physical interactions considered. All others, along with their application in several detailed sample calculations, are meant to assist the reader gain intuition about these interactions, in particular, with respect to size and degree. How strong is the magnetic force? How much will the RF field heat the tissues? How much current will be induced in a conductor? In this chapter, we intend to provide an understanding of the degree to which a particular interaction might represent a hazard, and in this sense, we hope that this information will be useful to the reader.</para>

          <title>RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAIN MAGNET</title>
          <para>The main magnet of a commercial MRI system is the most distinguishing feature of the device, and also the greatest source of risk. The field it generates, approximately 1.5 to 3.0 Tesla (T) for the most widely used high field strength scanners, is much stronger than magnetic fields casually encountered in everyday life. For example, it is roughly 30,000 to 60,000 times stronger than the earth's magnetic field at the surface and is roughly 300 to 600 times greater than the field of a common refrigerator magnet. While the universe can certainly create much stronger magnets (e.g., the field generated by some neutron stars may reach 100 billion Tesla), the magnets used for MRI are among the strongest that exist on Earth. Because MRI involves field strengths much higher than the typical everyday experience, regular objects may behave in a non-intuitive manner near scanners. How objects behave in such conditions greatly depends on what they are made of, and for this reason we will</para>

      <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most flexible tools in diagnostic imaging as well as a highly active field of medical and methodological research (1). In 2015, approximately 37.8 million MRI examinations were performed in the United States (U.S.) alone, with an annual growth rate of around 4% since 2011 (2). However, despite many advances in technology in recent decades, the low sensitivity of MRI remains a limiting factor. Noise in the MRI measurement is not only determined by the underlying hardware, but predominantly by the body to be examined. Consequently, a stronger spin polarization of the body is pursued by using stronger static magnetic fields (B<subscript>0</subscript>). While early work demonstrated that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases linearly with B<subscript>0</subscript>, at ultra-high fields (UHF above 3 T the complete Maxwell equations must be considered, which leads to a more than linear increase in SNR with field strength. Pohmann, et al. (3) experimentally described a supralinear increase (SNR ~ B<subscript>0</subscript><superscript>1.65</superscript>) between 3 and 9.4 T. In a numerical simulation study, Guerin, et al. (4) found a field-strength dependence that varies with the position within the sample. For voxels near the surface of the sample, the SNR increases roughly linearly, while for deeper-lying voxels, the increase can even be quadratic. Since the relationship between SNR and B<subscript>0</subscript> applies not only to the hydrogen nuclei, but also to all "MR-</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">INTRODUCTION</emphasis>Among the three different electromagnetic fields associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the static magnetic field has always been a primary focus of safety considerations. The need for intermittent exposure to the powerful static magnetic field of the MR system is at the base of safety concerns, from the pioneers working on developing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to the diagnostic imaging technique that is currently used today, as MRI. Since the early 1970s, when Raymond Damadian's pioneering work on animal tumor imaging and Paul Lauterbur's application of gradient magnetic fields in combination with a strong magnetic field to generate images marked the birth of MRI (1, 2), the safety implications for human subjects have been a constant preoccupation of practitioners (1, 2). This is the case even though there have been no unpreventable safety incidents for patients and others in the MRI environment (3). The safety record of scanning hundreds of millions of human subjects imaged in MR systems worldwide indicates a relative lack of inherent risk associated with MRI.</para>
      <para>Although the static magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>) is not the only source of safety concern, the other two, that is, the gradient magnetic fields (dB/dt) and the radiofrequency (RF) fields (B<subscript>1</subscript>), warrant their own safety evaluations. Considering that all three of these electromagnetic fields act simultaneously on the human body during MRI, understanding their interactions constitutes the first order of business in quantifying safety implications. In so doing, in the present chapter, there will be an exclusive focus on the task of understanding the interactions of static magnetic fields with the human body. The other two, radiofrequency fields and gradient magnetic fields, are easier to quantify since a large part of their interactions is a manifestation of Faraday's Law of Induction. These effects are functions of easily controlled characteristics of transmit RF coils and the gradient magnetic fields, such as amplitude and frequency. It is inherently easier to build a transmit RF coil operating at high frequencies greater than 300-MHz and gradients operating at greater than 50-mT/m with slew rates of higher than 200-T/m/s than to build a whole-body magnet operating at greater</para>

          <para>than 7-Tesla (T). Furthermore, computations of specific absorption rate (SAR) and concomitant RF-induced tissue heating or gradient field-induced voltage and associated neurostimulation are readily carried out. By comparison, the limiting physiological effects of static magnetic fields on biological tissues have not been sufficiently quantified because the observable effects on tissues are relatively small and it is difficult to estimate the static magnetic field strengths at which these may become substantial hazards (Table 1) (3).</para>
          <para>However, since the development and manufacturing of powerful magnets, scientists have begun to understand the mechanisms of interactions with biological tissues at different levels. To date, the strongest of these effects is the attractive force on ferromagnetic materials which demonstrates the most ominous of all safety risks to the life and wellbeing of patients and other individuals (4, 5). Notably, this effect, also known as the projectile or missile effect, is a secondary effect meaning that it is easily avoidable and is not inherent to the interaction of the static magnetic field with the human body. As far as the hazards associated with intrinsic interactions, the scientific community has yet to establish an upper limit for the static magnetic field designed for exposure of human subjects. Considering the difficulty of building whole-body magnets operating at field strengths much higher than currently recommended by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), presently standing at 8-Tesla (5), it is conceivable that there would be many opportunities and available hardware to characterize such effects. Proliferation of 7-T whole-body magnets (subsequent to the success of the 8-T scanner, designed by the team at the Ohio State University in 1998) has offered a fertile ground to study the interactions of static magnetic fields with biological tissues using all available techniques, in addition to the imaging capabilities that such scanners afford the scientists and clinicians. The safe operation of the more than eighty 7-T research and clinical MR systems around the world has encouraged scientists to dream of even higher field strengths. NeuroSpin in Orsay, France, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) now have 11.7-T, whole-body MR systems. The successful move to the ultra-high field (UHF), 11.7-T scanner was undoubtedly the result of the invaluable information that was gained from the exposure of thousands of human subjects to 7-, 8-, 9.4-, and 10.5-T static magnetic fields since 1998. To date, numerous safety investigations have been conducted on UHF MR systems (5-10). Importantly, as the number of high-field (HF) scanners (i.e., less than 3-T) increases in clinical settings and the number of UHF MR systems (higher than 4-T) increases in research and clinical facilities, the opportunity is created for more</para>

            <para>Over more than a century of recorded research on the effect of static magnetic fields on human subjects, there have been many publications (11-98). These works have shown that no verifiable harmful effect can be attributed to exposure to strong static magnetic fields. This is predominantly attributed to the diamagnetic nature of human tissues and the small number of paramagnetic elements present in the human body. Nevertheless, the fact that, following the introduction of MRI as a dominant medical imaging device, an even larger segment of the human population is being exposed to powerful magnetic fields each year, warranting additional research in this field. It is conceivable that, as MRI becomes available to more developing countries, there will come a time that most human beings will be exposed to strong magnetic fields at some point in their lives.</para>
            <para>There have been few reports of deaths associated with the MRI environment (99-101). A close examination of these fatalities reveals that they were all caused by controllable factors and involved implanted or other extraneous devices that interacted strongly with the MR system's static magnetic field. Knowing that life on our planet is formed in the magnetic field of about 0.5-Gauss indicates that the probable interaction of molecules building life with the magnetic field at this field strength is incorporated into the structure and function of biological tissues. Although the earth's magnetic field is relatively weak, it is sufficient to put a proton of hydrogen into a precession of approximately 2-kHz. Thus, the Larmor precession that takes into account the torque imparted on nuclear spins and formulates their rotational motion will allow the use of the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) of a hydrogen proton to yield its frequency of rotation. This magnetic effect is the basis of the mechanism of signal generation in MRI.</para>
            <para>Attraction by natural magnets had been discovered and cited in many ancient treatises (11). Chinese, Greek, and Persian scientists discovered the unique properties of magnets and offered various treatments for diseases more than a thousand years ago (102, 103). However, since natural ores can produce magnets with a field strength of less than 0.5-T, these materials do not have very high magnetic polarization. Furthermore, the field distributions of natural magnets are inhomogeneous, producing a strong field in small regions unsuitable for observation of any effects that would otherwise require establishing strong fields in larger areas. This is why magnets were not used in many tools before the 19<superscript>th</superscript> century. Electromagnets provided the opportunity of manufacturing magnets stronger than 1-T, but the resistive heat in these magnets placed an upper limit on their applications.</para>
            <para>At the present time, the most powerful electromagnet in the world generates a continuous magnetic field of 35-T, which is a Bitter magnet located at the U.S. National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. Such magnets allow scientists to study exotic effects exhibited by matter only under extreme conditions. The possibility that metallic hydrogen may be a superconductor at room temperature was put forward in 1968, and its potential technological applications initiated interest in even stronger magnets. Because compact high field magnets made of high temperature superconductors may offer highly</para>

            <para>efficient transportation systems and quantum leaps in the computational power of computers, research on the health implications of strong magnets go well beyond their application to MR scanners. Today, the strongest magnets used for MR systems utilize special Niobium-Titanium alloys, which are capable of producing magnetic fields up to approximately 10-Tesla at liquid helium temperatures (104). These so-called type II superconductors are only one class of alloys that reveal superconductivity at cryogenic temperatures. Other materials, such as bismuth alloys, have been used to construct test coils that can achieve 32-Tesla. While strong magnets have been built for research in charged particle accelerators and in electromagnetic ore extraction, their use has not produced a widespread exposure of human subjects to such magnetic fields. The introduction of MRI as the standard of medical diagnosis started the era of pervasive human exposure to strong magnetic fields in the early 1980s.</para>
            <para>From the time of magnetotherapy, when magnets were used for therapeutic purposes, some scientists believed in the treatment capability of magnetic effects on the body. Centuries ago, magnets were used for their presumed effectiveness in remedying headache, pain, and other conditions (105). However, in consideration of the diamagnetic property of human tissues, the interaction with magnetic fields is negligible for most tissues. Because of its iron content and different susceptibility state between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, there is a slight magnetic interaction with hemoglobin. However, this effect has not been large enough for bulk measurement other than its effect on functional MR images, or fMRI. The need for a high static magnetic field and high homogeneity in MR systems requires that these magnets be much larger to simply produce a given field strength. MR scanner magnets are designed to produce a field homogeneity on the order of 10 parts per million (ppm) over the diameter of spherical volumes (DSV) of 50-cm. Producing a highly homogeneous DSV50 with a solenoid magnet is the primary requirement of MR systems.</para>
            <para>Cylindrical superconducting geometries are the most abundant form of "closed" scanners, while permanent and hybrid magnets are often used for "open" MR systems. An account of the dates when MR systems with various magnetic fields were debuted is listed in<emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> (106-115). In this table, the timing of major increases in field strength has been presented but it is not meant to be a catalogue of improvement in all aspects of magnet technology.</para>
            <para>In assimilation of new MRI technology, three factors have dominated the introduction of new scanners: engineering innovation, safety, and an advantage in clinical diagnostics. The complexity of scientific, financial, and technical factors involved in justifying, funding, and manufacturing whole-body scanners with ever higher field strengths is indicated by the eleven years that were required from the installation of the first 4-T human scanners to the introduction of the first 8-T whole-body MR system (98).</para>
            <para>Currently, a 9.4-T whole-body MR system is located at the University of Illinois and a 10.5-T whole-body scanner exists at the University of Minnesota. The most powerful MR systems in the world, which operate at 11.7-T, have been installed at the National Institutes of Health and at NeuroSpin in Orsay, France. Thus, the increasing the range of proton frequency for the use of MR scanners in human subjects has moved towards 500-MHz. The economics of magnet technology and the scientific capabilities and image resolution of MR systems are on the opposite sides of the trend toward higher field strengths. In one analysis</para>

            <para>At this point, it is worth remembering the prediction of early MRI pioneers that declared MRI a safe modality for scanning humans. That no major, unavoidable incidents have occurred in association with MRI is a testimony to the sound basis of analyzing the interactions of static magnetic fields with human subjects (35-37). Similar studies have been conducted at UHF ranges, indicating that the magnetic interactions with biological tissues are safe up to and including 8-T (98). However, it should be noted that the consequence of taking ferromagnetic materials into the fringe fields of a UHF MR system will create more serious problems than predicted by many authors (57, 62, 63, 66, 83). Similar facts are at work regarding medical implants in patients within fringe fields of MR scanners.</para>

            <para>High magnetic fields will exert an attractive force on tissues with permanent magnetic dipoles. Tissues with higher magnetic susceptibilities than water will repel diamagnetic materials (116-117). High field regions are centers of attraction and this is a way for separating tissues with higher paramagnetic susceptibilities. But, this effect is too weak for practical use in living tissues even in high static magnetic fields. The absence of permanently magnetized tissues in the human body makes this force of lesser concern in assessing the safety of these fields, except where materials with permanent magnetic properties are present (e.g., ferromagnetic foreign bodies), because they may experience displacement forces in regions of the spatial gradient magnetic fields.</para>
            <para>Magnetic forces can produce torque on permanently magnetized materials with an elongated shape that will tend to rotate them to align their magnetic moment with the direction of the magnetic field. As such, magnetic torque will rotate magnetic materials to make the long axis of the object parallel to the applied field. Foreign bodies that are ferromagnetic may experience sizable torque, posing even a greater potential hazard than the translational forces on such materials. For materials with different paramagnetic susceptibilities in different directions with respect to the magnetizing field, the anisotropic susceptibility will lead to torque on the axis of the most positive susceptibility, tending to align it with the magnetic field. Diamagnetic susceptibility anisotropy (DSA) observed in some materials has the effect of rotating them to align the axis of least negative susceptibility with the field. Observation of DSA can only be made in vitro because the effect is too weak in vivo for quantitative measurement.</para>

          <para>In the human body, electric fields are normally produced by processes such as the depolarization of the heart tissue that produces current flow, which is the basis of the electrocardiogram (ECG). In addition to the normal static field currents producing the ECG, any motion by the tissue will produce an additional term in the expression for the current density,<emphasis role="bold">J</emphasis> = σ(<emphasis role="bold">E</emphasis> + <emphasis role="bold">v</emphasis> × <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>) where <emphasis role="bold">v</emphasis> is the velocity of the moving tissue relative to the static magnetic field. The term, <emphasis role="bold">v</emphasis> × <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>, is the consequence of motion and can be viewed as a motion-induced electric field.</para>
          <para>Motion of conductive tissues within a magnetic field will produce a force perpendicular to the direction of motion. There are many different types of motions by internal organs in the human body, including those associated with the respiration, peristalsis, the beating heart, and blood flow. The currents produced by blood flow in the presence of powerful magnetic fields are large enough that their effects on body surface potentials have been proposed to be used for a flow meter (118-119).</para>
          <para>The electromotive force (emf) induced as a result of blood flow in the heart produces a large signal during the T-wave phase of the cardiac cycle. In the 1960s, it was shown that electrocardiograms of monkey hearts in strong magnetic fields displayed a field-induced amplified T-wave (44). Subsequent studies have shown this T-wave amplification is the result of blood flow and not from a direct magnetic field effect on cardiac muscle (120-121). This effect is easily demonstrated in patients in clinical, high-field MR systems and contributes to the difficulty in obtaining acceptable electrocardiograms during MRI procedures.</para>
          <para>Dependence of the induced emf on the velocity of blood flow and the strength of the static magnetic has been visualized in humans at field strengths as high as 8-Tesla (98). Importantly, there is no evidence of flow-induced nerve or muscle stimulation for fields as high as 9.4-T because the induced emf is below the threshold levels required for such stimulations to occur (122). As the magnetic field strengths of MR scanners increase, the flow-induced currents near blood vessels could eventually reach levels capable of inducing nerve stimulation, and this may determine the upper limit of human tolerance for exposure to extremely high static magnetic fields (87-88). However, all currently planned research and clinical MR systems operate well below these levels.</para>

          <title>Interactions with Metabolic Reactions</title>
          <para>Chemical reactions are at the core of the metabolic function of tissues. The massive number of chemical reactions required for normal function indicates that any external factor, such as an applied static magnetic field capable of altering the rate of these reactions, could affect their equilibrium positions (123-130). This condition prevails, for example, in those chemical reactions in which the products are more paramagnetic than the reactants. Such reactions will respond to the presence of a magnetic field by shifting the reaction equilibrium towards an increase in the concentration of the products, thus, displacing the equilibrium position of the reaction.</para>

However, although the applied field will lower the energy barrier for the dissociation of diamagnetic molecules to paramagnetic molecules, calculations show that the free energy barrier to dissociation of oxyhemoglobin (approximately 64,000-J/mol) will only be changed by about 1-J/mol at a field strength of 4-T. Such disturbances of oxygen dissociation are comparable to a temperature change of only 0.01°C, making it unable to significantly modify the reaction equilibrium (87).</para>
          <para>Another possible magnetic field effect on a chemical reaction involves the dissociation of a binary molecule, AB (124-130). If the bond between A and B is nonmagnetic (electron-pair bond) but the dissociated radicals A and B have unpaired electrons, then the magnetic field will favor dissociation of the bound state, as the two electrons in the bond will have opposite spins and a total spin of zero, while the free spins of individual radicals will be nonzero. Precession of the A and B spins subsequent to dissociation will limit to some extent the tendency toward re-bonding. However, no significant effects on reactions of biochemical significance have been reported from this effect.</para>

          </para>
          <para>The magnitude of interaction of materials with magnetic fields is directly proportional to their magnetic susceptibility (35). The human body is diamagnetic which makes its interaction with external magnetic fields inherently weak. However, there are small amounts of tissue components that are paramagnetic, which allows them to couple more strongly with magnetic fields (131-136). There is about 3.7-grams of iron in the body of a 70-kg adult human. Fortunately, the iron in the human body is in weak paramagnetic form incorporated in various chemical compounds such as hemoglobin, ferritin and hemosiderin that are spread throughout the body, preventing strong interactions with applied fields. The small concentration of these paramagnetic substances is insufficient to make the overall susceptibility of the tissues, including blood, paramagnetic (90). Obviously, exogenous paramagnetic materials can enter the human body, causing interaction with a magnetic field. For example, studies involving coal miners exposed to rock dust have detected small amounts of particulate magnetite in their lungs (132). Other forms of the deliberate addition of iron oxide-based compounds applied to the body, such as in tattooing involving iron oxide-based pigments, will similarly increase the possibility of magnetic interactions.</para>
          <para>The presence of particles of iron oxides less than 500-angstroms in diameter has been reported in the human brain and other tissues using electron microscopy in autopsy studies (136). The source and function of such particles are unclear and determination of their origin requires further investigations. The small size of these particles makes their artifacts on MR images small to be detected at the range of field strengths used for human MR imaging. Perhaps at higher field strengths, susceptibility enhanced pulse sequences would permit visualization of these particles. However, such "artifacts" will most likely induce sub-voxel signal dropout and require rigorous quantification methods to measure their interactions with magnetic fields.</para>
          <para>MRI examinations performed in patients with tattoos or permanent eye makeup using iron oxide-based pigments have shown artifacts around those regions as well as local edema in some cases. This effect does not appear to be caused by the static magnetic field but,</para>

However, it may be possible that irregularly shaped, iron oxide particles in the implanted pigments experience torque in the magnetic field that rotates them, making their long axis move parallel to the direction of the static magnetic field. The image artifact is caused by the magnetic fields of these particles resulting in signal losses or voids, while the torque that forces their alignment with that static magnetic field may be the cause of tissue irritation, resulting in localized edema. Such tissue irritation could be exacerbated by patient movement inside the static magnetic field of the MR system (i.e., if the patient moves his/her head side-to-side).</para>

            <title>Magnetoresistance</title>
            <para>The magnitude of electrical resistance of a material will change when it is placed in an external magnetic field. This phenomenon, called magnetoresistance, is caused by the forces exerted on ions in solutions moving through strong magnetic fields. Depolarizing currents associated with the propagation of nerve and muscle action potentials could be modified by such a field-dependent effect. However, since electrical resistance is a function of dynamics of current-carrying particles, the mean free path (MFP) of these carriers and the time between their collisions plays an important role in determining the size of the magnetoresistance effect.</para>
            <para>For a sufficiently long MFP, an electric field perpendicular to the direction of current will be established, increasing the effective resistivity of the conductors when they are placed in a magnetic field. This phenomenon is called the Hall Effect and, in nerve and muscle tissues, could modify the transmission of currents. However, ions whose flow determines the action potentials of nerve and muscle tissue have an extremely short mean MFP (~ 1-angstrom) and collision times (10<superscript>-12</superscript>-seconds), drastically reducing the effect of magnetoresistance on the associated action potentials (60). Interestingly, neurocognitive studies inside magnetic fields of up to 8-T have not detected a decrease in the performance of motor, sensory, and cognitive tasks (10).</para>

            <para>Currents flowing in tissues experience a body force. The resulting pressures and forces are transmitted to the tissues. These forces can be substantial in flowing liquid metals such as mercury. However, flowing physiological fluids such as blood have much lower electrical conductivities than mercury, and MHD forces on flowing blood are relatively small compared to the naturally occurring hemodynamic forces in the vascular system. Therefore, contrary to early speculations, there is no requirement for increased heart activity to maintain the cardiac output in the presence of a strong static magnetic field. On the other hand, it may be that very small MHD forces operating on the endolymphatic tissues of the inner ear are the source of sensations of nausea and vertigo sometimes reported by human subjects in the presence of higher static magnetic fields (86, 87). Recently, the feasibility of using MHD effects at 7-T for synchronization of MRI with the cardiac cycle has been reported (137).</para>

Among the three types of magnetic properties, ferromagnetism produces by far the largest magnetostrictive forces. Therefore, in consideration of the range of susceptibility of biological tissues, their size and shape change only slightly when exposed to strong magnetic fields (138, 139). Since human tissues do not normally contain ferromagnetic materials, magnetostriction is negligible. Furthermore, compared to the naturally occurring forces (i.e., thermal expansion and mechanical stresses), any effect in human tissue would be insignificant.</para>

          <title>CALCULATION OF STATIC MAGNETIC FIELD EFFECTS</title>
          <para>Magnetic susceptibility is the term used to define the quantification of the effect of static magnetic fields on matter. Analysis of the magnetic response of tissues through the concept of magnetic susceptibility is a simple method that will be discussed in this section. This analysis will show that the large differences between the magnetic properties of biological tissues and those of ferromagnetic materials govern their different responses to magnetic fields. This difference is so profound that, in many cases, it makes their response to applied magnetic fields qualitatively different. This is why extrapolation of our daily experience with ferromagnetic materials has been the source of the many concerns with the safety of powerful static magnetic fields in predicting the response of tissues to such fields. In this section, the concept of magnetic susceptibility is discussed and the calculations of magnetic forces and torque are presented. The quantitative response of tissues to applied magnetic fields will then be formulated in these terms.</para>

          <title>Magnetic Susceptibility</title>
          <para>Magnetic susceptibility is a quantity that describes the response of materials that are not permanently magnetized to applied magnetic fields (90). The discussion will not consider permanent magnets, such as bar magnets, because their strong interaction with magnetic fields makes them extremely hazardous in the MRI environment. Thus, except in rare situations, permanent magnets are not allowed in the MR system room. Biological tissues have very small magnetic susceptibilities, so they do not interact strongly with applied magnetic fields. This fact is supported by noting the high quality of MR images due to the highly uniform magnetic field inside the human body, as it is situated within the MR scanner (i.e., due to the slight variation in susceptibility in biological tissues).</para>
          <para>Polarization of materials in an applied magnetic field is measured by a quantity called the magnetization, defined as the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume. To provide a quantitative account of the response to magnetic fields in terms of magnetization, System International (SI) units are used along with the standard mathematical convention of using bold face symbols to designate vector quantities. If matter of susceptibility, χ, is placed in magnetic field<emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>, it will develop a magnetization <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis> given by the equation <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis> = χ <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>.

          <para>In an isotropic material, χ is a scalar quantity, meaning that it has the same value in all directions. This is the case in most materials. In isotropic materials, the induced magnetization<emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis> is parallel to <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>, which makes <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis> all parallel to each other. If matter has a preferred direction in which it magnetizes more easily than in other directions, the resultant magnetization is not necessarily parallel to the magnetic field. Such materials are represented by an anisotropic χ in the form of a symmetric tensor.</para>
          <para>Aside from discussing the weak torque formed in certain biological crystals, the analysis is limited to isotropic materials. For materials with large susceptibilities, magnetization is found by taking into account the induced and applied field effects in a self-consistent way. This is due to the fact that in the definition of χ,<emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis> is the sum of the applied and induced fields. The example of ellipsoidal objects using demagnetizing coefficients is worked out in this section to demonstrate such calculations. For biological tissues with very low susceptibility, however, the fields induced by the magnetization are much smaller than the applied field, which makes them negligible. For such material, the magnetization is determined entirely by the applied field, and the more complex self-consistent method is not necessary for their calculations.</para>
          <para>In isotropic material,<emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> are parallel and, as shown in the following discussion, no torque will be formed to align the object with local fields. In reality, the negligible magnitude of torque due to the applied field compared to other biological forces acting on the tissue component allows us to ignore it in our calculations.</para>
          <para>The magnitude and sign of χ determines the extent of the interaction with the applied field. In this regard, materials are classified into three large groups: diamagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. Conservation of energy requires that only χ with values &gt; -1 are possible (140). Diamagnetic materials have negative susceptibilities (i.e., -1.0 &lt; χ &lt; 0). This property causes them to be magnetized in the opposite direction of the applied magnetic field, causing them to be repelled from regions of strong magnetic fields. All materials have diamagnetic properties if they do not possess components, such as the magnetic ions in transition elements, which make a larger positive contribution to χ. Paramagnetic materials have positive χ that makes them attracted to regions of strong magnetic fields. Materials with |χ| &lt; 0.01 do not respond to weak sources of magnetic fields such as handheld magnets and are therefore classified as nonmagnetic. Most common materials including all living beings, with the exception of magnetotactic bacteria, are in this group.</para>
          <para>Ferromagnetic materials with |χ| ≥ 0.01 constitute the third group of materials to which we will refer as ferromagnetic or magnetic. These materials exhibit a strong response to an applied magnetic field, and the large attractive force induced on them poses the biggest danger if taken into the vicinity of an MR system. Some ferromagnetic materials do not appear magnetic until they are exposed to an external field. They are called "soft magnets" to distinguish them from permanent magnets or "hard" magnetic materials.</para>

            <para>much less than 0.001, making the magnetic forces on such materials very weak and, therefore, not easily observable. Relevant to this discussion are the vast majority of biological tissues with susceptibilities very close to the susceptibility of water, χ<subscript>H2O</subscript> = -9.05 x 10<superscript>-6</superscript> in SI units. In fact, χ of most biological tissues differs from that of water by about ± 20%. This narrow range of variation of χ is the primary reason why exquisite MR images are acquired from biological tissues. In regions of the human body where large variation in susceptibility is present (e.g., the air/tissue interfaces between the sinuses and the orbitofrontal regions of the brain), high field MRI causes large position-dependent variations in the Larmor frequency that results in severe signal losses.</para>

            <para>The force of the magnetic field on matter could cause two types of motion, translational and rotational. An object, like a ferromagnetic aneurysm clip with a long blade, if placed in a strong magnetic field, experiences a magnetic force that could cause measurable translational and rotational motions. In the human body, depending on its shape, the object could experience translational attraction and torque that could cause it to move and rotate with respect to the direction of the static magnetic field. The size of the translational forces and/or torque depends on the applied field strength, the susceptibility, and the shape of the material. This could vary from no observable effect to forces large enough to produce serious injury or even lethal consequences. Typically, to understand whether these translational forces and torque will be at a level to significantly alter the structure or function of tissues, we need to develop rigorous mathematical expressions based on the physical properties of the material.</para>
            <para>The work required to move magnetic dipoles within a magnetic field is independent of its path. Therefore, a magnetic potential energy function, U, can be defined that depends on the field strength (position), magnetic dipole moment of the object, the relative angle between the direction of the field and the dipole orientation, and the magnetic properties of the medium (139-142). For magnetization, M, the total dipole moment of a volume, V, for a uniformly magnetized object is<emphasis role="bold">m</emphasis> = <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis> V.

To assess the energy of a non-permanently magnetized object, as is the case for the human body in an MR system, we have to take into account the fact that biological tissues within a static magnetic field acquire a magnetic moment that is proportional to the applied field. If biological tissues are brought within a magnetic field, <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript>, they acquire an induced moment, <emphasis role="bold">m</emphasis>, and an energy U = (1/2)<emphasis role="bold">m</emphasis> • <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript>. The reason for the presence of the factor 1/2 for the second case, with all other variables held constant, is that when biological tissues with no permanent magnetic dipole (the second case) are brought into the magnetic field, their magnetic moment increases from zero (where the magnetic field is zero) to <emphasis role="bold">m</emphasis> (where the magnetic field is <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript>).

This result can be extended to cases where <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript> is not along a principal axis by resolving it into components along these axes to find the resulting field, which is the sum of the fields along each axis. These expressions for the magnetic response of the object to an applied field work well because they take into account the interaction of <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript> with both the shape of an object, as is represented by D, and the magnetic properties, as is represented by χ.</para>
          <para>Ellipsoids of revolution, with two equivalent axes and two identical demagnetization factors, are a simpler form of the more general ellipsoids that have three independent principal axes and three different demagnetizing factors. For most cases, it is adequate to consider only ellipsoids of revolution. Deduction of important trends for the behavior of non-isotropic objects in a magnetic field is evidence to the utility of the above results. For example, it can be stated that for strongly magnetic materials with χ &gt; 1, to the first order, the internal field<emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> and the magnetization are independent of the susceptibility and only depend on the shape of the object, D. However, for materials with |χ| &lt;&lt; 1, magnetization <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis>=χ<emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript>/μ<subscript>0</subscript>, which makes it parallel to the applied field and independent of the shape of the ellipsoid. Thus, translational forcesand torque acting on ferromagnetic objects in a magnetic field critically depend on the object's shape. For biological tissues with tiny susceptibilities, these same equations predict that the force and torque associated with the magnetic field will be independent of the shape of the tissues.</para>

          <para>provide an insight in the behavior of biological tissues in magnetic fields. Expressions for demagnetization factors for a broad range of ellipsoids of revolution are available in the published literature (90).</para>
          <para>Certain metallic implants have magnetic properties that could put the patient at risk from translational force and torque in association with exposure to the powerful static magnetic field of an MR system. If the combination of the geometrical and magnetic properties produces substantial translational force, then the object could move in the presence of a strong static magnetic field. If the same combination results in torque, then the object could be rotated into alignment with the direction of the static magnetic field. The factors determining the relative strength of these two effects are magnetic susceptibility and the shape of the object as well as its position in the magnetic field that determines the magnitude and the field's spatial gradient magnetic field. Notice that the force does not just depend on the field strength but the product of field's spatial gradient by field strength, B∂B / ∂dz. Therefore, in the regions of a homogeneous magnetic field where ∂B/∂dz ≈ 0, the translational forces are negligible. This does not mean that such metallic devices are safe, because the patient has to pass through the entry region of the MR system where B∂B/∂dz is large and the object could experience a large translational force during this time. As expressions for torque reveal, even for metallic devices with low translational force, torque could pose a greater hazard than the translational force in some cases. A discussion of such cases is warranted here.</para>
          <para>A cylindrical magnet, such as that often used in a high-field MR scanner, offers an opportunity to look in more detail at the analysis of magnetic forces because regions near its central axis have a uniform magnetic field and small field spatial gradients. For spherically symmetrical objects, there is no torque acting on the object. So, the translational forces are caused by the induced magnetization, which is parallel to the applied magnetic field. In the cases of non-isotropic objects like long, thin needles or thin and flat plates, large torque may be formed on these objects. The forces will rotate elongated objects, to make the long axis of the object parallel to the direction of the magnetic field. On a flat object, however, the magnetic field will exert torque, turning it parallel to the field lines of the magnet. The following quantitative analysis is meant to support these predictions.</para>
          <para>The large disparity between demagnetizing factors along axial (a) and radial (r) axes of a needle-like object (D<subscript>a</subscript> &gt;&gt;D<subscript>a</subscript>) when placed in the magnet, with the long axis of the object parallel to the z-axis of the magnet, produces the maximum translational force when the needle is aligned with the field (θ = 0) and at a location where the product B<subscript>z</subscript> ∂B<subscript>z</subscript>/∂z is maximum. Regions at the isocenter of MR system's magnet (i.e., where MR imaging occurs) have a very homogenous magnetic field (∂B<subscript>z</subscript>/∂z≈0), although the magnitude of the magnetic field in these regions is highest.

          <para>for this magnet was 1.5/m, while for most superconducting cylindrical magnets, regardless of their field strengths, this ratio will be comparable to that of the 8-T scanner. For an ellipsoid of length L = 1-cm in this magnet the F<subscript>torque</subscript><superscript>max</superscript>/F<subscript>trans</subscript><superscript>max</superscript> = 75. Since the 8-T magnet was unshielded, for shielded magnets, the ratio, R, would be smaller because the value [B<subscript>z</subscript> ∂B<subscript>z</subscript>/∂x]<subscript>max</subscript> is larger for such magnets. The large ratio of rotational and translational force indicates that elongated ferromagnetic implants must be tightly anchored to or retained in the patient's tissues because a much larger force is required to prevent rotation as opposed to translational attraction. This is particularly true for implants such as a ferromagnetic aneurysm clip with one dimension longer than the other (i.e., an aneurysm clip with a long blade). These calculations indicate that the possibility of patient injury from aneurysm clips in magnetic fields is much higher due to rotational force than by translational motion. This is notable, because estimations of the effect of magnetic fields have traditionally been focused on translational forces.</para>
          <para>Hairpins or paper clips are occasionally lodged inside the MR system. Since the clip is being pulled out of the magnet, the small attractive translational force is at a maximum near the opening of the magnet (i.e., the opening of the bore the scanner) where the patient is inserted for the MRI exam. Torque, however, has a different positional dependence and a maximum value occurs near the center of the magnet, where the axis of the paper clip is at a direction of 45-degrees with respect to the z-axis of the magnetic field.</para>
          <para>A close examination of the behavior of biological tissues, with |χ| &lt;&lt; 1 by using the expressions listed in Table 3, demonstrates that the magnitude of the torque acting on these tissues is proportional to χ<superscript>2</superscript>. Due to the opposite signs of the susceptibilities of diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials, they are expected to point in opposite directions when lined</para>
          <para>up in a uniform magnetic field. However, the χ<superscript>2</superscript>-dependence of torque means that the direction of alignment would be the same for both types of materials. A more important consequence of the χ<superscript>2</superscript>-dependence of torque is that, for very small values of χ, the alignment torque that is caused by the shape-dependence is negligible. As shown by the above analysis, materials with high susceptibility and those of very low susceptibilities show qualitatively different responses to magnetic fields. Thus, powerful magnetic fields apply strong forces on flat ferromagnetic objects, such as magnetic washers, that could align their "face" parallel to the field. Since red blood cells basically have the same geometry as washers, they were expected to experience torque large enough to align them with their flat side parallel to the magnetic field. But, due to the small magnitude of their susceptibility, χ ≈ 10<superscript>-10</superscript>, the torque acting on red blood cells is exceedingly low and unable to cause any measurable, shape-dependent effect.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Diamagnetic Susceptibility Anisotropy</emphasis>The shape-dependence of torque due to field inhomogeneity and demagnetizing factors has been demonstrated to be negligible for biological materials due to χ<superscript>2</superscript>-dependence of the torque expression. However, another mechanism through which magnetic fields can interact with biological tissues is referred to as diamagnetic susceptibility anisotropy (DSA). This effect has been observed in the assembly of large numbers of macromolecules when they are bound together in a crystalline structure. This effect is present when all the molecules in a crystal are twisted in the same orientation by the applied magnetic field. Such conditions allow the torque on individual elements in all the molecules or cells in a volume V to add up to a measurable level. If susceptibility is anisotropic in a tissue, then we can designate its magnitude in one direction of this tissue as χ<subscript>1</subscript> and the angle between this direction and the applied field as θ. For tissues in which susceptibility in both orthogonal directions is the same and equal to χ<subscript>2</subscript>, we can assume that for diamagnetic tissues |χ<subscript>1</subscript>|, |χ<subscript>2</subscript>| &lt;&lt; 1.

The difference of susceptibility between the two axes is Δχ = χ<subscript>1</subscript> - χ<subscript>2</subscript> that is approximately 1% to 10% of the average susceptibility, (χ<subscript>1</subscript> + 2 χ<subscript>2</subscript>)/3. For biological tissues, Δχ is of the range of 10<superscript>-7</superscript> to 10<superscript>-6</superscript>, which is much larger than the shape-dependent torque that has an order of magnitude of 10<superscript>-10</superscript>. Prediction of the analysis presented here (i.e., the four order of magnitude larger value of anisotropy-dependent torque than shape-dependent torque) is confirmed by observation in biological materials (143). Another important factor governing the size of torque in the expressions derived in this chapter is the volume, V, of the tissue, which indicates that aggregation of anisotropic molecules to form larger assemblies will increase the torque that can, in turn, enhance the effect of the magnetic field on these tissues.</para>

          <title>Bioeffects of Static Magnetic Fields</title>
          <para>Among biological tissues, red blood cells of sickle cell anemia patients have received much attention, as they have been shown that they align in a field of 0.5-T,<emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> (45, 46). The lack of observation of alignment of the hemoglobin molecules in normal red blood cells is due to the fact that they are free in solution and randomly oriented. However, the hemoglobin S molecules in sickle cell red blood cells have a tendency to "stick" together. This binding tendency makes them aggregate, polymerize, form fibers and gel-like structures that are made up of similarly oriented hemoglobin molecules that are bound together. The anisotropic molecules in these structures and their binding in an aligned formation increase the anisotropy of the overall structure that have revealed anisotropy-dependent orientation in these studies (45, 46). However, this effect has only been reported based on laboratory studies. Unlike the conditions <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis>, where there is no force competing with magnetic force, the forces experienced by red blood cells in flowing blood are much larger than the magnetic forces of orientation (61, 74, 77, 85). Experiments allowing the observation of magnetic orientation in the presence of flow, however slow, would shed light on the necessary conditions for red blood cell orientation, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>.</para>
          <para>Other structures, such as retinal rod cells, nucleic acid solutions, and fibrin gels have revealed similar orientation effects,<emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> (144-149). Similar to red blood cells, we are unaware of a report of magnetic orientation effects by these structures, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>, for the same reason that flow forces overwhelm the magnetic orientation forces preventing alignment. The size of the magnetic torque, however, as is shown by our equations, depends on B<subscript>0</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>. This fact points to a rapidly growing orientation torque as the magnetic field strength increases. Since the trend in MRI is relentlessly pushing for higher static magnetic fields, studies of orientation effects at these higher field strengths are warranted to reveal them, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>, and to incorporate them into plans for safe exposure of human subjects to such high static magnetic fields. In fact, experiments have already been performed in which 16-T magnets were used to demonstrate that cleavage planes of developing frog embryos orient in powerful magnetic fields (150). Anisotropy-dependent alignment of tubulin molecules has been presented as the cause of this observation (151). Independent confirmation of these effects would validate the effect and the explanation, because many magnetic field effects on biological tissues have proven difficult to reproduce.</para>

            <para>We need to be aware of the magnetic field strength required to align water molecules,<emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>. Although not reported, the far-reaching consequence of such effect on life justifies the vigilance. The possibility of aligning of water molecules in magnetic fields and its ability to alter the biological and physiological processes in tissues are already proposed as a rationale for magnetotherapy, a commercial venture with some success in convincing its followers of its therapeutic efficacy. This is in consideration of the fact that physics allows us to estimate the extent of alignment of water molecules inside magnetic fields. The random orientation of water molecules is the cause of its small magnetic susceptibility of χ = -9.05 × 10<superscript>-6</superscript>. A variation of about one-percent in χ along the principal axes of the molecule is caused by the asymmetry of the water molecule (152). As previously discussed, susceptibility anisotropy is the basis of the development of magnetic torque. Therefore, we need to calculate the magnetic alignment energy of a water molecule. Here, we will present such calculations for an applied field of 10-Tesla as is presently close to the upper range of</para>

            <para>yields M = χH = χ/μ<subscript>o</subscript> B = -72 A/m. This is the magnetization, which is the sum of magnetic dipole moments of 3.34 x 10<superscript>7</superscript> water molecules per cubic meter. The average dipole moment per water molecule in a field of 10-Tesla is calculated to be m = -2.16 x 10<superscript>-27</superscript> J/T. The implication of 1% anisotropy of the molecular magnetization is that a maximum magnetic energy change due to change in molecular orientation is calculated to be ΔE = 2.16 x 10<superscript>-29</superscript> J. To compare this magnetic energy with thermal energy of the human body at 38°C</para>
            <para>yields kT = 4.28 x 10<superscript>-21</superscript> J and a ratio of ΔE/kT = 5.0 x 10<superscript>-9</superscript> for a 10-T magnet. This indicates that the magnetic energy is 200 million times smaller than thermal energy at 10-Tesla. Such minimal energy is unlikely to cause significant biological or physiological changes in water molecules, in vivo.</para>
            <para>These results indicate that for a 0.01% deviation from random orientation of water molecules, a static magnetic field strength of 450-Tesla is needed. This is in spite of the B<superscript>2</superscript>-dependence of the magnetic energy. By comparison, the expected alignment within the fields of even ultra-high-field-strength MR systems is negligible. To our knowledge, to date, no observation of magnetic field-induced alignment of water molecules has been reported at the static magnetic field strengths used for research or clinical scanners. This is in agreement with the model presented above for magnetic alignment of diamagnetic molecules in strong magnetic fields.</para>

            <para>Injury can be caused by the application of forces on tissues. For tissue components with large differences in magnetic properties, such forces could develop in nonuniform magnetic fields. As it was shown earlier, diamagnetic tissue components tend to move toward lower fields and paramagnetic tissue components will be forced to higher field regions. The formation of such opposing forces on components of the same tissue could interfere with the physiological function of the tissue and lead to injury. It is conceivable that under normal circumstances, biological structures have greater internal forces, such as electric forces involved in chemical reactions, than magnetic forces due to susceptibility variations (34, 87). Furthermore, gravitational forces and forces produced by acceleration and other motions during routine activities produce considerable forces on tissue components. The evolution of life under the gravitational action of Earth and routine life activities must have resulted in development of the "means" to incorporate these forces in the inner workings of living beings. These "means" will be unable to identify the source of the force and end up preventing tissue function from being substantially affected by magnetic forces.</para>

Behavior of red blood cells in the blood is affected by its higher density than plasma, making them sink in the blood in the absence of larger hemodynamic forces. This effect, called erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), is used in the laboratory to test for abnormalities of blood proteins. While gravitational forces are useful for separation of blood ingredients in test tubes, they are too small to make red blood cells sink, in vivo.</para>
          <para>The molecule, hemoglobin, has four iron atoms in each molecule that reduce the diamagnetic properties of red blood cells, making it slightly less than that of surrounding plasma. This pushes red blood cells toward regions of strong magnetic fields relative to the plasma. Using the expression for magnetic force from Table 3, the magnitude of this differential force is given by (χ<subscript>rbc</subscript> - χ<subscript>plasma</subscript>)V<subscript>rbc</subscript>/μ<subscript>o</subscript> B<subscript>o</subscript> ∂B<subscript>o</subscript>/∂z.

As is seen from these calculations, even at the highest static magnetic field strength available for MRI research, the maximum magnetic force capable of separating the red blood cells from the plasma is about 13 percent of the gravitational forces. Considering that gravitational forces have negligible effects, in vivo, the effect of magnetic forces is even smaller by almost an order of magnitude for static magnetic fields of up to 8-T.</para>
          <para>Discussions and calculations in this section show that, while finite magnetic effects act on tissues in magnetic fields, their magnitude for field strengths available for MRI examinations in human subjects is relatively small when compared to other known forces, such as gravitational and routine physical activities, and these forces are clearly incapable of causing injury to biological tissues. Importantly, forces maintaining the integrity of molecular and cellular structures of biological tissues appear to be orders of magnitude larger than the forces that magnetic fields can exert on living beings.</para>

Research in this area has revealed that motion in strong magnetic fields could induce mild sensory effects that are transient and not harmful (44, 48, 80, 86). These reports rely on a subjective description of sensory stimulations and, as such, their effects have to be interpreted with great</para>

          <para>caution because the number of studies of these effects is limited. On the issue of subjectivity of this effect, reports have documented static magnetic field-induced sensory effects experienced by staff members working around superconducting magnets, even during the time when the magnets were "off" (89). Nevertheless, comparisons of incidents at different field strengths show that human subjects exposed to higher fields (e.g., 9.4-Tesla) reported higher rates of sensory stimulation than those subjected to a 0.5-Tesla field (5, 86, 153). Field-dependence of sensory effects has been both expected and reported by workers on high field strength scanners. Particularly, sensations of nausea, vertigo, and metallic taste related to exposures to static magnetic fields operating at 4-, 8-, and 9.4-Tesla have been reported (5, 86, 153). However, effects such as headache, tinnitus, vomiting, hiccups, and numbness that have sometimes been attributed to static magnetic field exposures have not been consistently observed for the same field strengths.</para>
          <para>Magnetophosphenes, sensations of light flashing when the eyes are moved rapidly while inside the magnetic field in a dark room, have been reported at static magnetic field strengths of up to 9.4-Tesla. Computational results have confirmed the factors involved in the observation of magnetophosphenes and have provided quantitative models for this phenomenon (154).</para>
          <para>Sensory experiences in static magnetic fields from 0.5- to 9.4-Tesla have been reported and shown that avoiding rapid body movements inside these magnetic fields may reduce these sensations. In addition, lower field strengths are associated with reduced sensations of peripheral nerve stimulation. However, there is substantial evidence that magnetic field-induced sensory effects are caused by activation of highly excitable sensory systems by weak electrical currents that can be induced by moving certain body parts inside magnetic fields (154-156). Sensations such as nausea have been reported, which are probably caused by magnetic forces exciting motion sensors in the semicircular canals of the inner ear (98). This specific effect may be created due to a conflict in the position information supplied by the visual systems and vestibular position-sensing system. A possible source of vertigo could be magnetic forces caused by diamagnetic anisotropy of the inner ear receptors. Small amounts of torque acting on these receptors could induce a small level of sensory effects. Notably, the slow movement of the patient inside or around a very strong magnetic field drastically reduces sensory stimulations and provides comfort in association with the performance of an MRI examination using a UHF MR system. For this reason, the 7-Tesla MR system that is approved for clinical use (Terra, Siemens Healthineers) has a table that moves the patient slowly into the scanner, thus, avoiding the afore-mentioned issues related to rapid movements in a powerful static magnetic field.</para>

          <para>Various investigations performed using laboratory animals and human subjects exposed to high static magnetic fields have reported that there are no changes in skin or body temperatures (6, 158-160). Utilizing a fluoroptic thermometry system known to be impervious to strong magnetic fields to record temperatures in laboratory animals and human studies ensures that accurate temperature readings are achieved inside the bore of the MR system.

            <para>The safety of human exposure to MR systems is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States (U.S.) and other similar agencies outside of the U.S. The FDA provides guidelines for the limits of safe exposures to static magnetic fields as well as the other electromagnetic fields used for MRI (i.e., gradient magnetic fields and radiofrequency power deposition). The FDA's assessment of the health risks associated with exposure to static magnetic fields was last updated in 2014, with the upper limit set at 8-Tesla (4). The World Health Organization (WHO) also established health criteria for static magnetic fields within the Environmental Health Criteria Program (163). The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) reports, along with other similar documents, offers insight and regulatory guidelines pertaining to the biological effects of exposure to static magnetic fields (163-176). The regulatory body in the United Kingdom for medical device safety is the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and in the European Union, this task is carried out by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). All of these regulatory bodies evaluate the available scientific databases and develop the rationale for updated guidelines as new data and technology become available (169-179).</para>
            <para>The Medical Devices Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 1977 required MRI to demonstrate its viability as an imaging modality and safety for the first time. Subsequent to the discovery of MRI as an important medical imaging device, major manufacturers introduced their products and applied for FDA approval. Rapid success in demonstrating its safe operation led to the 1987 FDA designation of a static magnetic field strength of 2-T as the limit below which MR systems will pose a non-significant risk to human subjects. Proliferation of MR scanners and research systems helped to support an increase in the non-significant field strength risk to 4-T in 1996 and 8-T in 2003 (note, this document was updated in 2014)(4).

            <para>Exposure to strong magnetic fields is often greater from a time consideration for workers involved with manufacturing and testing magnet-based instruments and devices than it is for patients. In addition to workers involved in the manufacturing process for MR systems, MRI researchers, MRI technologists/radiographers working in research, medical center, and out-patient settings, as well as experimental high-energy physicists are among the populations with chronic exposures to strong static magnetic fields. To regulate chronic exposures, guidelines have been developed by certain countries. Proposed in Europe, a time-weighted average field exposure of 0.20-T/8-hour would limit the workers to 0.2-T field for an eight-hour day or 8-T for 12-minutes. A higher limit of 2-T/8-hour limit was proposed for the extremities by these guidelines. The lack of confirmed evidence for harmful cumulative effects of exposures to static magnetic fields has made these limits less consequential than the limit on the highest static magnetic field strength applied to human subjects. This is especially true as the fields outside the magnets are highly inhomogeneous. The strong spatial variation of the magnetic fields is not usually specified for MR systems, and because of this (i.e., the fringe field), workers are not constantly exposed to the magnetic field, making it difficult to measure the effect over a workday period. For these workers, the most ominous potential hazard remains to be the inadvertent introduction of ferromagnetic tools or other objects into areas with high fringe fields.</para>

            <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
            <para>According to health data published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2009, the average number of MRI examinations performed per 1,000-population per year for the thirty countries of the OECD was forty-one. Considering the population of the OECD to be 1.2 billion means that approximately 54 million MRI exams were performed in the thirty OECD countries each year (180). In the United States, 91.2 MRI procedures per 1,000-population equates to about 28 million examinations annually. Nevertheless, no unpreventable harm to the patients from exposure to the static magnetic field has been reported. As previously indicated, all serious accidents associated with MR systems, to date, have been caused by the involuntary introduction of ferromagnetic materials or medical devices into the magnetic field. In addition to clinical scanners, research scanners operating at fields of up to 11.7-Tesla for human subjects and over 20-T for animals have shown no major safety incidents, which has laid the foundation for clinical scanners to be designed for operation at higher field strengths. There is still considerable fertile</para>
            <para>ground for research in studying the interaction of biological tissues with stronger magnetic fields, regardless of how safe the record of operation at high static magnetic fields is at the present time.</para>
            <para>Keeping in mind that the spatial gradient magnetic field will be larger for higher field strength magnets, more stringent measures to exclude the presence of ferromagnetic objects from MRI suites will be needed. In spite of the existence of more than eighty 7-T research and clinical MR systems around the world, a number of technological issues such as RF inhomogeneity, susceptibility artifacts, and RF power deposition (i.e., SAR) issues will continue to present challenges (178). Nevertheless, the relentless drive for higher fields is achieving new milestones, such as the 21.1-T, 105-mm magnet located at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida (which currently is the strongest MR system in the world used for small animal imaging). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) devices operating at 23.5-T with a hydrogen proton Larmor frequency of 1-GHz and a bore size of 54-mm are now commercially available. This trend will continue and the safety investigations involving small animals will add valuable information for our understanding of the interactions of these fields with living beings.</para>
            <para>Research on the effect of strong magnetic fields on tissues, cells, and molecules has not produced evidence for its harm to human life. The magnetic forces analyzed in many publications have proven to be insignificant compared to the natural forces that maintain the structural integrity of the tissues and the routine forces to which the human body is exposed to during everyday activities.</para>
            <para>Regulatory bodies have justifiably taken the attitude of requiring verification of any claim of adverse effects to static magnetic fields before limits are incorporated into safety guidelines. This is a reasonable approach that has demonstrated attention to scientific findings, while preventing unnecessary impediments to research and exploration of benefits of magnetic fields for the good of society.</para>
            <para>Fortunately, the physics of such interactions are straightforward and simple calculations provide insight into the order of magnitude of magnetic field effects. To date, such calculations have indicated that forces exerted on diamagnetic materials, of which biological tissue are overwhelmingly made, are insignificant compared to other forces involved in maintaining their structure and function. It seems that all of the major revisions in the FDA guidelines for assessing non-significant risk involved in the exposure of human subjects to static magnetic fields have followed this course of action. The present FDA guidelines recommend 8-T as the strongest magnetic field with non-significant risk. As the field strengths are increasing for whole body scanners, it is conceivable that sensory effects such as vertigo, metallic taste, magnetophosphenes, and possibly other responses may become more prevalent. However, no permanent harm from these effects has been presented. Transient effects caused by movement inside the magnetic field can be minimized through MRI operator training. Notably, the long-term, cumulative effect of exposures to static magnetic fields is a topic requiring additional research.</para>
            <para>As the field strength of MR systems increases, it is conceivable that eventually, one of the forces of interaction will become large enough to require limiting its effect on human life. Diamagnetic susceptibility is unlikely to be the limiting factor. However, the effect of</para>
            <para>field inhomogeneity and the magnetic effect on blood flow could limit the persistent drive towards higher fields. For now, even research magnets seem to be far from that limit and we are fortunate to be able to safely explore the benefits of higher static magnetic fields in order to visualize the structure and function of the human body. If more complex safety studies continue to confirm that there are no substantial adverse effects, then much higher magnetic fields could become available for human MR imaging to continuously enhance our ability to observe otherwise opaque biological structures and functions. Such observations may lead to better healthcare for future generations and offer an understanding of the mysteries of life.</para>

          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
          <para>During magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the patient is exposed to the static magnetic field, which produces the nuclear magnetization in tissues, radiofrequency (RF) pulses, which manipulate the magnetization in order to detect an MRI signal, and low frequency pulsed magnetic field gradients, which are used for localization of the signal in image formation. This chapter concerns the physiological effects of exposure to time-varying magnetic fields from the imaging gradients, hereafter simply referred to as the "gradients" or "gradient magnetic fields".</para>
          <para>The principal known biological effect from exposure to gradient magnetic fields is peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). Other types of magnetically-induced stimulation (e.g., of the heart, retina or brain) do not occur at exposure levels currently encountered during MRI but will be considered briefly. Another important effect of the gradients is the generation of acoustic noise resulting from the Lorentz force. This is considered elsewhere in this textbook. In this chapter, the basic physical and physiological processes of magnetic stimulation, the properties of magnetic stimulation, human PNS associated with MRI, models of induced electric fields, and the relevant patient exposure limits will be considered.</para>

            <para>The imaging gradients are defined as linear spatial variations in the z-component of the static magnetic field B<subscript>z</subscript>, that is, along the axis of the MR system's bore, as follows:</para>

            <para>and are specified in millitesla per meter (mT/m). Within the imaging field-of-view (FOV), the gradients produce static magnetic fields whose z-axis components are additive to B<subscript>0</subscript>:</para>
            <para>B<subscript>z</subscript>(x,y,z) = B<subscript>0</subscript> + x G<subscript>x</subscript> + y G<subscript>y</subscript> + z G<subscript>z</subscript>    (2)</para>
            <para>The gradients alter the Larmor frequency of the MR signal depending upon its source location. For example, with G<subscript>x</subscript> = 10-mT/m at 0.2-m along the x-axis from the isocenter, the additional field from the x-gradient is 2-mT. The maximum field experienced by the patient will depend upon the patient's size and the linearity of the gradients. Figure 1 illustrates how the magnitude of the gradient fields varies across the patient in the scanner's field-of-view (FOV). Note that the gradient field will be negative over half the FOV.</para>
            <para>Gradient pulses are commonly applied as trapezoidal waveforms with durations of a few milliseconds, ramp times of typically 0.1- to 1.0-ms and amplitudes of up to, and in excess of, 50-mT/m (Figure 2). The gradient slew rate (SR), defined in T/m/s, is given by</para>

In modern scanners SR may reach 200-T/m/s. In the example above, if the slew rate is 100-T/m/s, the minimum ramp time for one gradient lobe is 0.1-ms and the rate of change of field (dB/dt) is 20-T/s.

          <para>In order to acquire an image, the gradient and RF pulses are arranged as a pulse sequence that is repeated with the repetition time TR (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). In the pulse sequence, the gradient pulses are denoted by their function in the image formation process (i.e., slice selection, phase or frequency encoding). Depending on the anatomical orientation of the image section location, these may or may not correspond to the magnet axes x, y, and z, and thus, frequently the patient may be exposed to the simultaneous action of all three physical gradients G<subscript>x</subscript>, G<subscript>y</subscript>, G<subscript>z</subscript>.</para>

          <title>Strength-Duration Curve</title>
          <para>The physiology of electrical stimulation of nerves has been known for a long time and is characterized by the strength-duration (SD) curve. Two basic forms of SD curves have been used: the earliest is the hyperbolic form of Weiss (5):</para>
          <para>I<subscript>thresh</subscript>(t) = I<subscript>Rb</subscript>[1 + c/t]                                    (12)</para>
          <para>where I<subscript>thresh</subscript> is the threshold generator current (applied via electrodes) to cause stimulation and t is the stimulus duration (for a rectangular pulse). The constant c is the chronaxie and is the stimulus duration required to double the threshold from its minimum value. This minimum value I<subscript>Rb</subscript> is known as the rheobase and is asymptotic for long stimulus durations. The SD curve may also be described in terms of the more physiologically relevant electric field E in tissue or, in magnetic stimulation, by dB/dt/dt (see dashed line in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>).</para>
          <para>The other common form of the SD curve is the exponential or Lapicque form (6):</para>
          <para>I<subscript>thresh</subscript>(t) = I<subscript>Rb</subscript>/(1 - e<superscript>-t/τ</superscript>)                                    (13)</para>
          <para>where τ is the tissue time constant, shown for dB/dt as the solid line in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>.</para>
          <para>Electrophysiologists currently do not agree on the more appropriate form of the SD curve and magnetic stimulation studies provide evidence for both forms. One theoretical advantage of the exponential form is that it produces the predicted response of a simple equivalent circuit of the nerve under the action of a rectangular current stimulus (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>). Moreover, the tissue time constants can be theoretically derived from the fiber diameters (7). Time constants vary according to tissue type. Peripheral motor nerves have time constants of the order of 0.1-ms, while cardiac muscle has τ in the region 2- to 3-ms and synapses up to 25-ms. Based upon this equivalent circuit, the Spatially Extended Non-linear Node (SENN) model has been used extensively in electro-stimulation studies, and forms the theoretical basis for some patient exposure limits during MRI (8).</para>
          <para>The specific agent of stimulation is usually considered to be the spatial gradient of the induced electric field. Nerve discontinuities such as bends or synaptic terminations (e.g., in muscle) effectively produce E-field spatial gradients, rendering them common stimulation sites. In magnetic stimulation, the stimulus is usually considered to be dB/dt, which is directly proportional to the induced E in tissue. However, just as for electrical stimulation where the SD curve can be derived in terms of electrical charge Q (I = dQ/dt), one can con-</para>

          <para>One of the most sensitive and earliest observed forms of magnetic stimulation was that of magnetophosphenes, as reported in 1896 by d'Arsonval (11) (Figure 9), perceived by the subject as faint flashes of light, and which are thought to originate from stimulation of the retina or the optic nerve. Kavet, et al. (12) provided a review of the magnetophosphene literature, but from these only two or three publications present sufficient dosimetric information to deduce accurate thresholds and frequency response. Losvund (13) conducted the most extensive of these studies, reporting a minimum threshold of 12-mT root mean square (RMS) in the frequency range 20- to 45-Hz, depending upon the ambient light conditions and dark-adaption of the subjects. Figure 10 summarizes the available quantitative data on magnetophosphenes.</para>
          <para>Direct magnetic stimulation of nerves was first demonstrated in vitro by Oberg (14) in 1973, resulting in a measurable twitch of the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog suspended in Ringer's solution. In 1982, Polson, et al. (15) were the first to demonstrate human peripheral nerve stimulation in vivo using a small diameter topical solenoidal coil powered by a capacitance discharge system. They estimated an induced current density of 20-A/m<superscript>2</superscript> and demonstrated the stimulus-response curve from threshold to supra-maximal (when all the fibers in the bundle have been recruited). The topical magnetic stimulation technique was subsequently applied by Barker, et al. (16) to the motor cortex of the brain, and forms the basis of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is a common tool in neuroscience research and therapy used in the treatment of depression and psychiatric conditions (17,18).</para>

            <para>McRobbie and Foster (19) first demonstrated the strength-duration curve from topical stimulation of the median nerve in 1984 using electromyography (EMG) to determine reproducible thresholds (Figure 7). They fitted an exponential form of the SD curve with a time constant of 0.47-ms and an estimated J rheobase of 3.6-A/m<superscript>2</superscript>, corresponding to an estimated E<subscript>rh</subscript> of 12-V/m. They also demonstrated that, contrary to expectations of the SENN, the biphasic damped sinusoidal pulse produced by their capacitance discharge system was a more effective stimulus than mono-phasic pulses (Figure 11). This is supported by further evidence from the TMS literature (20, 21) and the recent ultra-high slew rate studies (22).</para>

            <para>In the SENN model, a 20-um nerve fiber is predicted to have a theoretical time constant of 0.12-ms (7). Despite SENN apologists' appeal to magnetic stimulation for validation of the theory (8), most magnetic stimulation results contradict the predictions of the SENN model. In carefully devised experiments, Rescoskie, et al. (23, 24) demonstrated large discrepancies in chronaxies from electrical and topical magnetic stimulation of the ulnar nerve for both perception and EMG thresholds. Perception chronaxies were 0.024 ± 0.02-ms for electrical stimulation, against 0.67 ± 0.18-ms for magnetic stimulation. A confounding factor is the huge variation (i.e., thirty times) in reported electrical stimulation chronaxies. This raises issues about the validity of applying electrical stimulation data to formulate limits for time-varying magnetic fields.</para>
            <para>Weinberg, et al. (22) investigated ultra-high dB/dt, high frequency (&gt; 100 kHz) pulses, using a topical coil, and reported a significantly reduced probability for stimulation at these frequencies (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 12</emphasis>). They concluded that ultra-short pulses (were the technology available) in whole-body gradient systems are unlikely to cause PNS despite very high dB/dt. Using results from Magnetic Particle Imaging (25) and MRI studies (26), a modified SD curve has been proposed (27). Shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>, the threshold is seen to rise for very short (&lt;20 μs) stimuli above 25 kHz. Also shown are SENN predictions.</para>

          <para>Direct cardiac stimulation is more difficult to achieve due to the longer time constants of cardiac muscle and the smaller induction paths around the organ. Early attempts with small coil systems produced violent muscular contractions and estimated current densities in the range 5 to 20-A/m<superscript>2</superscript> but without any detected cardiac arrhythmias in rats (29, 30). Nevertheless, Bourland, et al. (31) achieved trans-chest magnetic stimulation of the dog heart, producing ectopic beats but not ventricular fibrillation, with an estimated induced electric field of 50-V/m and a median threshold dB/dt of 2,700-T/s. for a 0.53-ms pulse. Using a tissue time constant of 3-ms, a rheobase of 400-T/s can be extrapolated. Yamaguchi, et al. (32) showed similar results with an estimated E<subscript>Rh</subscript> of 55- to 340-V/m. Cohen, et al. (33) did not detect any changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) of canines exposed to up to 66-T/s. using a human whole-body gradient system. The cardiac stimulation dB/dt rheobase for the most sensitive percentile of the population has been theoretically estimated as 62-T/s. (34). It is thought that at least 50 times the electrical stimulus for cardiac stimulation is required to cause ventricular fibrillation (35).</para>

          </para>
          <para>PNS associated with MRI-related gradient magnetic fields was first reported by Cohen, et al. (33) and Budinger, et al. (36). Initially, the possibility of PNS was limited to high slew rate specialist gradient systems, based upon capacitance discharge technology, for echo planar imaging (EPI). The advent of improved linear amplifiers for the MRI-related gradients has resulted in a much greater likelihood of patients experiencing stimulation. For example, Vogt, et al. (37) exposed 210 patients to gradient slew rates of 120% of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) limit for PNS (38) using a rapid gradient echo (FLASH) sequence. For this study group, 16.7% reported PNS with 2.9% reporting very uncomfortable stimulation.</para>
          <para>The Purdue University group (39, 40) has published extensive studies of MRI-related gradient stimulation using y- (anatomically aligned anterior-posterior) and z-gradient coil systems external to the bore of the MR system.<emphasis role="bold">Figure 14</emphasis> shows SD curves for an individual subject's subjective reporting of three levels of stimulation (1 = threshold, 5 = uncomfortable, 10 = intolerable) fitted to the hyperbolic form. The subjects (n = 84) reported uncomfortable stimulation at about 50% higher exposure than for the threshold, and about 100% higher than threshold for intolerable. Pooling these data, one can calculate a stimulus or dose response curve and a population SD curve (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15</emphasis>). For perception, the median dB/dt rheobases were 15-T/s for the y-gradient and 26-T/s for x with similar chronaxies (0.37-ms, 0.38-ms). The stimulus was a train of 64 trapezoidal gradient lobes, resulting in 128 rectangular dB/dt pulses of duration 0.05 to 1.0-ms. Using dB/dt pulse lengths of 0.2- and 0.5-ms, there was no correlation between subject height, sex or age on stimulation</para>

            <para>Many other authors have investigated PNS perception thresholds for various combinations of axes on whole-body, MRI-related gradient systems (9, 39, 42-44). Rheobases and chronaxies from these studies are shown in Table 1. Given the range of combinations of waveforms, axes and coil designs, there is a striking consistency across these results. Taking the weighted mean from these studies, we arrive at an average dB/dt rheobase of 19.4-T/s. and a chronaxie of 0.42-ms - in agreement with topical stimulation studies (19, 22-24). Using Equations (9), (10) and (14) with a=0.4-m, b=0.2-m and σ=0.2-S/m one can deduce the rheobase for E, and J to be in the region of 3.1-V/m and 0.62-A/m<superscript>2</superscript> with a ΔB<subscript>min</subscript> of 8.1-mT.</para>

          <para>Table 2 shows a summary of PNS studies using this alternative gradient formulation of the SD curve (44, 46-50). Excluding the results from Feldman, et al. (49) who used planar coils, the weighted average minimum stimulating slew rate was 59.3-T/m/s, the minimum gradient amplitude (at infinite slew rate) for stimulation was 35.4-mT/m with a mean chronaxie of 0.69-ms. A notable observation is that there appears to be a dependence of the chronaxie on the coil dimension (44). The results from Feldman, et al. (49) show that significant increases in gradient coil performance without causing PNS are achievable, and secondly, that the chronaxie appears to have some dependence upon the coil design, and not just physiologic factors. As with earlier experiments, the linear SD formulation found no convincing correlation with anatomical measurements, including weight, height, girth, and average body fat percentage (48) although a weak correlation between ΔG<subscript>min</subscript> and the effective radius was reported (Figure 17).</para>

Computational modeling of the field interactions using realistic anatomical models and gradient coil specifications have shown that the induced E-field and current densities are highly inhomogeneous for various body geometries. Both quasi-static finite difference or finite integration numerical techniques have been applied (51-54).<emphasis role="bold">Figure 18</emphasis> shows the pattern of induced E-field arising from a planar y-gradient coil with dB/dt of 100-T/m/s.

Strong correlations between peak induced electric field in a human model in a head/neck gradient coil and subjects' reported stimulation sites, predominantly in the front of the head, in the vicinity of the sinuses, forehead, and teeth, has been demonstrated (55). Peak induced E-fields were estimated as 40-V/m.</para>

Notwithstanding these issues, computational modeling has provided various insights into the induced electric fields and current densities and their role in peripheral nerve stimulation.</para>

            <title>AVOIDING PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATION (PNS) DURING MRI</title>
            <para>Although PNS is not harmful, and rarely intolerable, its avoidance is desirable for maximum patient cooperation and comfort. The strength duration behaviour in MR systems is well categorized and hence the scanner's software is able to predict the likely onset of stimulation. This is related to the type of pulse sequence. Sequences with high dB/dt include echo planar imaging (EPI) and balanced steady state free precession (SSFP) gradient echo (e.g., TruFISP, b-FFE, FIESTA). Echo planar imaging has the additional feature of the rapid train of opposed polarity readout lobes, resulting in a longer stimulus duration and greater ΔB, which is more likely to cause PNS. Notably, PNS is more likely to occur in the following instances:</para>

          <para>diction algorithms of clinical MR systems. These studies consistently show dB/dt rheobases for perception of around 20-T/s, with a ΔB<subscript>min</subscript> of around 8-mT. The y-gradient (anterior-posterior) is the most effective for stimulation with a rheobase in the range 15 to 19-T/s, and measured chronaxies are remarkably similar across many different experiments. The threshold for discomfort or pain from PNS is approximately 50 to 100% higher than the perception threshold, and not generally achievable using clinical MR systems. The longer time constant for cardiac muscle and the smaller conduction loops around the heart make direct cardiac stimulation extremely unlikely.</para>

    <para>During the operation of the magnetic resonance (MR) system, various types of acoustic noises are produced. The problems associated with acoustic noise for patients and healthcare workers are wide ranging, from simple annoyance and difficulties in verbal communication between staff and patients, to heightened anxiety or discomfort, and even potentially permanent hearing impairment (1-9). Acoustic noise may pose a particular problem for specific patient groups that may be at increased risk. For example, patients with head injuries or psychiatric disorders, the elderly, young children, and infants may be confused or suffer from heightened anxiety during MRI procedures (2). Patients taking medications may experience increased hearing sensitivity (3). Additionally, neonates with immature anatomical development may be at increased risk for adverse effects associated with acoustic noise. For example, significant fluctuations in vital signs of newborns have been reported during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, which may partly be attributable to acoustic noise (4). High levels of acoustic noise may also impact the quality of the MRI procedure by causing distress in the patient.</para>
    <para>Due to several of the issues listed above and the more specific issues discussed below, acoustic noise levels also pose a significant problem for one particular area of MRI: the increasing amount of research in functional MRI (fMRI) studies of brain activation. Typically, patients and volunteer subjects will be provided earplugs to wear during fMRI. However, these may impair vocal communication with staff members and also the perception of study stimuli. The acoustic noise associated with fMRI procedures can often be comparatively loud, as the use of fast acquisition sequences (e.g., echo planar imaging, EPI) are normally used. Acoustic noise can often lead to motion-related artifacts and degraded image quality. Furthermore, acoustic noise has been reported to interfere with auditory functional studies,</para>

    <para>and more broadly, with cross modal neural activity (10-14). A summary of the potential issues related to the acoustic noise that is associated with MRI is shown in Table 1.</para>
    <para>MR system-related acoustic noise will interfere with the communication of activation task instructions that often must be provided during scanning. One area of particular interest is the study of auditory and language function (13). In this work, the response to pure tone stimuli is analyzed. Therefore, any background levels of unwanted or uncontrolled acoustic noise can interfere with the delivery of these sound stimuli and affect experimental integrity. Solutions specific to controlling acoustic noise exposure during fMRI are generally sequence-related and a full discussion of this topic is presented later in this chapter.</para>
    <para>Acoustic noise levels during echo planar imaging have been reported to significantly increase pure tone hearing thresholds in the optimal frequency hearing range (0- to 8-kHz) (15). These effects vary across the frequency range and the threshold changes depend on the characteristics of the sequence-generated acoustic noise. It may be possible to take into account, or adjust for, the MR system-induced auditory activation by using a control series</para>

    <para>of scans during task paradigms. Results have been reported on mapping auditory activation induced by MR system-induced acoustic noise (16).</para>
    <para>The problem of acoustic noise may also have implications for the operational costs of an MRI facility. Notably, there can be a potential decrease in image quality due to patient movement resulting from the patient being startled or uncomfortable in association with acoustic noise. This may add to the need to repeat scans or to interrupt studies that can adversely impact the efficiency of an MRI facility. For all the above reasons, it is important that the MRI-related acoustic noise is quantified and characterized as part of a safety and quality assurance program. Furthermore, any exposure to acoustic noise that is excessive must be controlled or alleviated.</para>
    <para>Acoustic noise experienced during routine clinical MRI examinations can generally be confined to levels within permissible limits with relatively little effort by using passive hearing protection (e.g., disposable earplugs). Several more sophisticated methods are also under investigation by researchers, offering more comprehensive and elegant solutions without the disadvantages of passive methods. This chapter will discuss acoustic noise and hearing, describe the common characteristics of MRI-related acoustic noise, explain the current permissible levels for acoustic noise, and present the main methods used for measurement and control of this potential hazard.</para>

        <title>ACOUSTIC NOISE AND HEARING</title>
    <para>The ear is a highly sensitive wide-band receiver, with the typical frequency range of 2-Hz to 20-kHz for normal hearing (17). The arrival of sound waves at the ear sets up a fluctuating pressure just outside the entrance to the external auditory canal. These fluctuations are then transmitted as pressure waves along the auditory canal. Normally under slight tension, the eardrum, or tympanic membrane, is physically moved by these pressure waves.</para>
    <para>On the other side of the membrane, three tiny bones known as the ossicles, transmit this movement across the middle ear cavity to another membrane, the oval window, which forms the end of the spiral-shaped, fluid-filled cochlea. The vibration of the membrane and hair cells in the cochlea is transformed, via the auditory nerve, to give a sense of hearing. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> shows the main components of the hearing mechanism.</para>
    <para>At high sound intensities, the muscles that control the motion of the ossicles alter their tension creating the acoustic reflex to protect the ear from damage. However, this reflex occurs approximately 0.5-milliseconds after the insult, such that the ear is particularly vulnerable to impact noise of high intensity. The human ear does not tend to discern sound powers in absolute terms, but assesses how much greater one power is than another. Reflecting the very wide range of powers that exist, the logarithmic decibel scale, dB, is used when referring to sound power.</para>
    <para>The sound level that is measured depends not only on the source, but also the environment (e.g., the proximity of surfaces that may reflect sound). Thus, sound levels are usually quoted in terms of sound pressure level (SPL), which accounts for the environment of the measurement. <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> displays a range of sound pressure levels for some typical sources of acoustic noise.</para>

    <para>The sensitivity of the ear is also frequency dependent, as shown is <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> (18). Peak hearing sensitivity occurs in the region of 4-kHz. This is also the region where potential maximum hearing loss will occur, with damage spreading into neighboring frequencies. Since the ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies, measured data may be weighted using the DBA measurement or "A-weighted" scale, which biases the meter to respond similarly to the human ear. The quality, or efficiency of hearing, is defined by the audible threshold, which is the SPL at which one can just begin to detect a sound. This is normally defined as 0 (zero)-dB.</para>
    <para>Acoustic noise is defined in terms of frequency spectrum (measured and indicated in Hz), intensity (indicated in decibels or dB), and duration (or time). Additionally, noise may be steady state, intermittent, impulsive, or explosive. Time-varying noise is reported in terms of L<subscript>eq</subscript>, which is defined as the continuous SPL that contains the same sound energy as the time-varying sound over the measurement period. This can be considered as the average noise level. Stimulation of the ear by acoustic noise has three potential effects: 1) Adaptation, 2) Temporary threshold shift (TTS) (post-stimulation fatigue), and 3) Permanent threshold shift (PTS) (permanent impairment).</para>
    <para>In hearing adaptation, loud sounds cause a small muscle attached to one of the bones of the inner ear to contract. This attenuates the transmission of sound vibration to the inner ear, which is a protective mechanism that does not work well for short duration, very intense sounds. Transient hearing loss may occur following loud noise (&gt;100-dBA), resulting in a temporary threshold shift (i.e., a shift in audible threshold). With a TTS, subjects may experience a dulling in hearing at the end of the noise and tinnitus in some cases. Recovery typically occurs quickly (1). However, full recovery can take up to several weeks if the noise insult is particularly severe. Intense impulsive noises at 650-Hz with cut-offs at 300- and 1-kHz have also been shown to generate substantial TTS (19). Noise above 100-dBA can cause disturbances of the microcirculation in the cortical organ and short impulsive noise at levels of 120- to 130-dBA can lead to mechanical damage in this organ.</para>
    <para>If the noise is sufficiently severe, this may result in a permanent threshold shift at specific frequencies (20, 21). Hearing damage from steady-state noise usually takes the form</para>

    <para>of inner ear damage. That is, destruction of the hair cells that convert acoustic energy to electrical impulses transmitted via the nervous system to the brain. These cells cannot regenerate and, therefore, the damage is irreversible. This damage is similar to age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) in that it progresses slowly, with the affected hearing threshold rising. Mean hearing loss is a function of noise frequency and duration (20). Permanent damage is primarily a risk for prolonged daily exposure to loud (&gt;85-dB) occupational noise or short impulsive noise around 140-dB. Excessive noise is known to be one of the most common causes of hearing loss (20). The risk of hearing damage increases with the noise level, duration of the noise, the number of exposures to the noise, and the susceptibility of the individual (20, 21). Along with sensitive groups, children have a lower threshold for hearing damage and, therefore, restricting exposure levels to around 120-dB or lower is recommended (22). It is generally accepted that exposure to noise levels up to a maximum of 75-dBA will not result in PTS irrespective of the duration of exposure (22). Over the years, several instances of noise-related incidents have been reported in the literature (see below).</para>

        <title>Noise That Is Not Perceived By the Ear Canal</title>
    <para>The ear canal is not the only path for transmission of sound to the cochlea. Sound may be conducted via air and bone conduction, through the ear canal, head, and body. Protection of the ear canal via earplugs will, thus, never lead to silence, due to the remaining sound conduction via the other paths. Sound can be conducted directly to the cochlea, to the middle ear and then to the cochlea, or through the walls of the middle ear, along the ear canal to the middle ear, and then to the cochlea (23). When the ear canal is relatively unprotected, this path will be the dominant one for perception of sound. However, as noise is attenuated along the ear canal, the other paths become increasingly dominant and further hearing protection measures will have little effect on the residual noise. Using a helmet in addition to conventional earplugs and "defenders", Ravicz and Melcher, (24) studied the impact of isolating the head and ear canal from sound. Isolating the head enabled the original noise attenuation of 39- to 41-dB to increase to 55- to 63-dB.</para>

        <title>Prenatal and Neonatal Hearing and Acoustic Noise</title>
    <para>By around the twentieth week of gestation, the outer, middle, and inner ear of the fetus appear to be fully formed. The fetus can then begin to detect sounds (25). Indeed, Hepper and Shahidullah, (26) reported that the responsiveness of the fetus to audio stimuli occurs between 19 to 35 weeks, with initial responses being to sounds at low frequencies. They measured an initial response at 20 weeks to a 500-Hz pure tone. As the pregnancy progressed, there was a significant reduction (20- to 30-dB) in the intensity of sound required to elicit a response. Studies report that maternal tissues and fluid surrounding the fetal head act as efficient low-pass filters for sound (27-31).</para>
    <para>Acoustic noise is known to be a concern for neonates who generally have sensitive hearing. Aside from artifacts introduced from involuntary motion related to startle reflexes, the noise can provoke adverse responses such as autonomic instability (32-36). Neonatal intensive care unit guidelines often suggest minimizing the risk of physiological stress by adhering to a limit for exposure to acoustic noise (see below).</para>

        <title>CHARACTERISTICS OF MRI-RELATED ACOUSTIC NOISE</title>
    <para>Early measurements of MRI-related acoustic noise offered little more than an assessment of intensity levels. Over time, researchers began to investigate the noise in more detail and to characterize it in terms of frequency components, variability with pulse sequences, and the contribution of individual gradients.</para>
    <para>The gradient magnetic field of the MR system is the primary source of acoustic noise associated with MRI. This noise occurs during the rapid alterations of currents within the gradient coils. These currents, in the presence of the strong static magnetic field of the MR system, produce significant (Lorentz) forces that act upon the gradient coils. From basic physics, a conductor element dl carrying a current I = I <emphasis role="bold">j</emphasis> placed into a magnetic uniform field <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> = B <emphasis role="bold">k</emphasis>, will experience a Lorentz force F per unit length given by,</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis> = <emphasis role="italics">I</emphasis> × <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis> = <emphasis role="italics">jBI</emphasis> sin <emphasis role="italics">θ</emphasis>                    (1)</para>
    <para>where θ is the angle between the conductor and the field direction and <emphasis role="italics">i</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">j</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">k</emphasis> are unit vectors along the conductor, force, and magnetic field direction, respectively. Therefore, simplistically we would expect acoustic noise to be theoretically linear with the static magnetic field of the MR system (37). In fact, Moelker, et al. (38) reported on a measured nonlinearity, with noise levels measured at high field being lower than that expected with a linear dependence The noise from these mechanical forces is then transformed into airborne acoustic noise or sound pressure, due to an acoustic noise transfer function (38).</para>
    <para>Acoustic noise, manifested as loud tapping, knocking, and other sounds is produced when the forces cause motion or vibration of the gradient coils as they impact against their mountings, which then also flex and vibrate. All structures have intrinsic resonance frequencies and these frequencies have their own modal shapes. In fact, there are several pathways of noise generation associated with MRI (40).</para>
    <para>If the gradient coil modal shape due to deformation corresponds to the shape of the exciting Lorentz force distribution, then large gradient coil displacements occur and result in the generation of significant acoustic noise. Current designs of gradient coils are often manufactured to have a high stiffness, which minimizes coil motion and, thus, the structural resonances of the coils.</para>
    <para>Various factors have been shown to affect the acoustic noise generated during MRI, including the strength of the static magnetic field (mentioned above) and alteration of the gradient output (i.e., rise time and amplitude). Interestingly, Price, et al. (39) reported that there is greater impact on acoustic noise levels generated from imaging parameters than the field strength. Acoustic noise is enhanced by decreases in section thickness, field of view, repetition time, and echo time. The physical features of the MR system and its environment as well as the material and construction of the gradient coils and support structures also affect the transmission of the acoustic noise and its perception by the patient and MR system operators.</para>

        <title>Acoustic Noise Associated With MRI Procedures</title>
    <para>Gradient magnetic field-induced noise levels have been measured during a variety of pulse sequences for clinical and research MR systems with static magnetic field strengths ranging from 0.35- to 4-T, with acoustic noise levels of over 130-dB reported (39-54). Obviously, since the gradient magnetic field is primarily responsible for acoustic noise, the ability of the MR system to produce noise is dependent upon the specifications for the gradients (amplitudes and slew rates) as well as the types of imaging parameters that are available on the scanner.</para>
    <para>Not surprisingly, fast gradient echo pulse sequences produce, comparatively, louder noise during MRI than spin echo sequences. Three-dimensional and diffusion MR pulse sequences, where multiple gradients are applied simultaneously, are among the loudest. Many studies have focused on assessing the maximum MR system acoustic noise, which is usually related to using EPI methods, due to the associated high gradient performance inherent in these ultrafast sequences. Echo planar sequences, in collecting a complete image in one radiofrequency (RF) excitation of the spin system, require extremely fast gradient switching times and high gradient amplitudes. The increased interest in diffusion imaging and fMRI has meant a heightened interest in using high field strength MR systems (i.e., mostly 3-, 4-, and 7-T) with fast gradient capability (switching rates and high amplitudes) to acquire multi-slice, EPI images of high quality (see below for more on high field issues).</para>
    <para>Shellock, et al. (43) reported relatively high levels of acoustic noise, up to 102- to 103-dBA on the two 1.5-T MR systems tested when running EPI sequences with parameters selected to represent a "worst-case" protocol. Nevertheless, these acoustic noise levels were within current permissible limits for MR systems. Miyati, et al. (50) conducted an extensive survey of EPI sequences performed on eleven MR systems. The results of the sound level measurements reported to be at levels within permissible limits.</para>
    <para>Price, et al. (39) surveyed fifteen MR scanners, with static magnetic field strengths from 0.2-T to 3-T, reporting worst case noise levels in the range 82.5- to 118.3-dBA, but for two-dimensional MRI techniques, only. They reported the lowest noise levels for the lowest static field strength scanner and the highest noise recorded for the highest field strength scanner, but noted low levels of acoustic noise recorded for a 1.5-T scanner fitted with vacuum-encased gradient coils. Higher acoustic noise levels have been reported by Ravicz, et al. (52) (up to 138-dB for 3-T) and More, et al. (53) (130-dB for 4-T).</para>
    <para>Foster, et al. (54) reported EPI-related acoustic noise levels of 123- to 132-dBA for a 3-T research scanner. Since EPI sequences are significantly shorter in duration than conventional sequences, in terms of acoustic noise exposure, higher sound exposure levels are possible for the shorter times involved. However, these levels, when converted to eight hour equivalent values (L<subscript>eq</subscript> = 108-dBA), are higher than the limits for occupational acoustic noise exposure used in the United Kingdom (UK) and in the United States (U.S.). Therefore, hearing protection must be used for patients undergoing MRI procedures under these circumstances. Conventional EPI sequences generally comprise constant readout gradients and a train of very short high level trapezoidal phase encode gradient 'blips'. It is not surprising that the blipped gradient contributes the larger proportion of the sequence-related acoustic noise (55). As the gradient blips are at higher frequency than the readout gradient, the resultant acoustic noise will have a larger proportion of high frequencies.</para>

    <para>Measurements of sound pressure levels offer a limited amount of information with regard to the quality of the noise and its impact on hearing. In addition to measurements of noise level, several groups have recorded and analyzed the acoustic noise. Similar noise levels and characteristics are found when comparing different clinical MR systems. Frequency analysis of the noise shows that noise is pseudo-periodic, with variations in the degree of periodicity depending on the pulse sequence used and the vibrational characteristics of the gradient coils (46).</para>
    <para>For conventional pulse sequences used for MRI, peak noise levels are found at the low frequency region of the spectra. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis> shows an example of the octave band spectra for a 1.0-T and 1.5-T MR systems (44, 45). Spectral peaks in the sound levels were found in the range of 0.2- to 1.5-kHz (22). Cho, et al. (48) have also reported that pre-scan noise generated high levels (100-dB, C-weighted scale) across a wide spectral range up to 4-kHz with peaks around 2.4-kHz.</para>
    <para>More, et al. (53) noted that repetition time (TR) had a minimal impact on overall SPL, while increasing the echo time (TE) increased attenuation, in agreement with Price, et al. (39). Unlike the use of conventional sequences, EPI-related sound levels have been reported to contain a larger fraction of high frequency noise (around 4-kHz) with most noise comprising the fundamental frequency and harmonics in the frequency range of 0.5- to 4-kHz (52). For EPI sequences, More, et al. (53) also noted considerable non-harmonic noise flanking the harmonics. The acoustic noise was also noted to contain a higher proportion of broad frequency spectrum noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). For their pulse sequence, More, et al. (53) found the even harmonics to be associated with the phase-encoding gradient, the frequency encoding gradient generated the odd harmonics and non-harmonic acoustic noise, while the slice-selective gradients generated the broad spectrum noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>).</para>

    <para>In addition to the dependence on pulse sequence parameters, MR system hardware and construction, acoustic noise is dependent on the immediate environment. Spatially, the acoustic noise will vary along the bore of the scanner. However, how it varies will depend on the MR system's structure and design. Price, et al. (39) presents acoustic noise measurements across a range of scanner geometries and designs, systems ranging from static magnetic field strengths of 0.2 to 3-T. Reports providing values of acoustic noise tend to disagree because of differences related to whether the maximum acoustic noise levels were measured at the isocenter of the bore or not (39, 47, 49). The noise distributions along radial and axial directions are also likely to be asymmetric, due to standing wave effects in the scanner's bore (53).</para>
    <para>Furthermore, noise levels have been found to vary by as much as 10-dB as a function of the patient's position inside the MR system (47) such that the presence and size of the patient affects the level of acoustic noise. For example, an increase of 1- to 3-dB has been measured with a patient present inside of the MR system (47), which may be due to pressure doubling (i.e., the increase in sound pressure close to a solid object, caused when sound waves reflect and undergo in-phase enhancement).</para>

    <para>increase significantly for UHF scanners. When increasing the static magnetic field strength from 1.5-T to 11.7-T, a simple linear model predicts an increase in the acoustic noise level by approximately 22-dB. But, in fact, in line with earlier results (38), this has not been observed in practice (57). Applying a logarithmic scale, changing from 7-T to 20-T, a 9-dB increase in acoustic noise level would be predicted. However, building in additional effects such as Lorentz damping (58), results in increases in acoustic noise levels that are actually lower than expected, and in some cases very similar to reported noise levels at 3-T (59-60).</para>
    <para>Notably, one practical difference (61) is that head coils at 7-T are generally more tightly fitting that those used at 3-T because they are comprise of a multi-channel insert. This makes using double passive hearing protection (earplugs and earmuffs) impractical and, thus, the acoustic noise is only attenuated by earplugs alone.</para>
    <para>Presently, findings obtained at 7-T remain sparse (61-64). Costagli, et al. (62) reported acoustic noise levels of 89.9 -/+ 0.7-dBA for conventional T<subscript>1</subscript>-weighted, fast spoiled gradient recalled (FSPGR) pulse sequences at 7-T. Speck, et al.

    <para>74). In 2002, Mechefske, et al. (67) developed the simulation of a cylindrical whole-body gradient coil housed in a 4-T MR scanner and driven by triangular and trapezoidal gradient pulses. The simulation was based on finite element (FE) analysis. Acoustic frequency responses predicted by the simulation were compared to experimental measures, showing broad agreement. Further reports investigated experiments and simulation of purpose-built gradient coils, including vibration and acoustic noise measurements (68, 69). In their finite element model, Lorentz forces were used as the system load, with acoustic radiation modeled using the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz equation. These researchers performed the analysis for a small head geometry gradient coil and achieved reasonable agreement of theory and experiment (68, 69).</para>

Shao and Mechefske (70) reported on the development of a predictive analytical model, allowing for inclusion of acoustic liners inside the gradient coil inner wall. They also compared analytic and boundary element models. The analytical model was comparative in terms of results, but computationally more efficient. Additional papers investigated the dynamic behavior of gradient coils of varying wall thickness (71-74) and by applying shell theory (76). Investigators have also investigated the coupling of gradient coils to other associated structures, reporting on structural analyses (77). Recently (and mentioned above), Winkler, et al.

        <title>ACOUSTIC NOISE LEVELS AND PERMISSIBLE LIMITS</title>
    <para>Several of the available guidance documents discussed below adopt a similar framework, referring back to the same source for action levels and permissible limits. Much of the international guidance is based on occupational exposure limits that assume chronic exposures. These are not entirely satisfactory for application to patient exposures associated with MRI, which can be short but with potentially intense noise, causing discomfort. When time-averaged, these types of exposures can fall below action levels but still present a hazard. For normal individuals, the typical threshold for discomfort related to acoustic noise is approximately 120-dB in the 1- to 5-kHz range (78), however, those with particular sensitivity can experience discomfort at much lower acoustic noise levels (79).</para>
    <para>For acoustic noise exposure involving <emphasis role="bold">staff members</emphasis>, the current UK occupational guidelines are based on the Control of Noise at Work legislation, published in 2005 (80). This document sets out the responsibilities of the employer and makes a number of recommendations based on a small set of action levels. Acoustic noise is graded to that which is below 80-dBA, a lower action level at 80-dBA daily or weekly exposure (peak 135-dBC), and upper action level at 85-dBA daily or weekly exposure (peak 135-dBC). It should be noted that values for lower and upper action levels have been reduced by 5-dBA, compared to previous Noise at Work action levels published in 1989. This document also recommends that hearing protection should be available for all staff members, and that its use be mandatory for noise above the upper action level. For MRI healthcare workers, there is generally little need to be in the MR system room during scanning. Because the acoustic noise levels that exist outside the scanner's bore are relatively low, the risks are similarly low.</para>

    <para>The management of exposure to acoustic noise for the <emphasis role="bold">general public</emphasis> is covered by the Management of Health and Safety at Work (1999) (81), but, since the general public does not have access to the controlled area or MR system room, again, the risks are low. European guidance is published as directive 2013/35/EU (82) and has similar limits and action levels to those in the U.K.</para>
    <para>In the United States (U.S.), occupational limits are mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA) (83) and have also been adopted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (84). OSHA guidance is geared towards traditional 'heavy' industries where there are very noisy environments and medium-to-high risk to hearing. Their list of affected industries does not include MRI/Healthcare. Now somewhat outdated, the OSHA guidelines apply to a slightly raised action level of 90-dBA (daily or eight-hour average) in line with the older UK guidance (85).</para>
    <para>Current UK guidance on noise exposure limits for MRI <emphasis role="bold">patients and volunteer subjects</emphasis> (including staff members) is presented in the MHRA guidelines (86). For patients and volunteer subjects, it suggests hearing protection should always be offered unless noise levels are proven to be below 80-dBA. Hearing protection should reduce levels at the ear to below 85-dBA. The recommended action levels are based on the noise at work regulations (72) and are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis>. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) (87, 88) notes the range of guidance from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) (89), but accepts the need for a conservative approach to protect vulnerable patient groups, also recommending the MHRA action levels. The MHRA document shows the relationship between the acoustic noise level and time necessary to reach the daily action level (86) (<emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis>). Recommendations for acoustic noise and hearing protection are, as follows (86):</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>The use of hearing protection is highly recommended. Protection should be available and all patients and volunteers should be encouraged to use it. Protection should always be worn by vulnerable patients.</para>

    <para>In the U.S., various patient exposure guidelines related to the MRI environment were initially recommended in a document issued by the American College of Radiology in 2002 (90) and this was updated in 2013 (91). The ACR document makes little mention of the risks associated with acoustic noise, however, it does recommend that all patients should be offered hearing protection and that this is mandatory for those undergoing MRI procedures using research pulse sequences.</para>
    <para>While the acoustic noise levels suggested for patients exposed during MRI examinations on an infrequent and short-term temporal basis are considered to be highly conservative, they may not be appropriate for individuals with underlying health problems who may be sensitive to noise at certain levels or at particular frequencies.</para>
    <para>Overall, the acoustic noise produced during MRI on a modern-day scanner should represent a minimal risk to patients if good quality hearing protection is used. However, the possibility exists that substantial gradient magnetic field-induced noise may represent a heightened risk in certain patients who are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of loud noises or for those with poorly fitting hearing protection. In fact, there have been unconfirmed claims of permanent hearing loss associated with MRI examinations (9). Therefore, vigilance and care is essential when controlling noise levels associated with MR procedures.</para>

        <title>Limits During Pregnancy and Neonatal Imaging</title>
    <para>Due to lack of data and a full understanding of response, UK guidance (86) suggests a cautious approach to scanning the fetus and pregnant patients. Scanning during the first trimester is discouraged unless justified by a critical risk assessment. Because acoustic noise is known to be a concern for neonates who have sensitive hearing, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) guidelines suggest minimizing the risk of physiological stress by adhering to a limit for noise exposure to 65-dBA (92).</para>
    <para>Fetal MRI has become increasingly important, particularly in diagnosis of fetal abnormalities and for the management of the mother. Although discouraged, if necessary MRI procedures may be performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. In a survey conducted by De Wilde, et al. (93), 83% of the clinics that responded suggested that they would scan patients during the first trimester in cases of clinical need. While the mother may wear hearing protection, the fetus is protected only by the attenuation provided by the intra-uterine fluid and the maternal abdomen. Thus acoustic noise has the ability to impact the fetus (94). To minimize motion-related artifacts, fast imaging techniques are required for fetal MRI examinations, which results in the potential for exposures to comparatively high levels of acoustic noise. Glover, et al. (95) investigated acoustic noise absorption through the ab-</para>
    <para>domen using a hydrophone in the stomach of a (male) volunteer. For scans performed at 0.5-T, these researchers reported a reduction of approximately 30-dB in acoustic noise levels. However, this study was a very limited approximation to scanning a pregnant patient and the associated sound absorption. The strength of the static magnetic field of the MR system, which directly affects acoustic noise levels generated, was also low (0.5-T) compared to the majority of clinical scanners in current use. Certain research has reported high frequency hearing loss, shortened gestation, and decreased birth weight following exposure to high levels of acoustic noise (&gt;99-dBA) (96).</para>
    <para>To investigate this particular safety issue, there have been a number of follow-up studies (97-106). For example, Reeves, et al. (97) investigated the rates of cochlear impairment for a cohort of second and third trimester neonates who had been exposed to acoustic noise during 1.5-T MRI examinations. Their data showed no association between exposure to noise and an increased risk of hearing impairment. General guidelines for managing exposure to acoustic noise produced by the United Kingdom (UK), Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (86) and based on evidence in several reports (98-100) suggest that the data on the effects of noise on the health of the fetus is inconclusive.</para>
    <para>Bouissant-Kobar, et al. (101) followed-up (i.e., at approximately 24 months) on a cohort of 72 pre-school children scanned at 1.5-T during their mothers' pregnancies (mean gestational age at scanning, 30 weeks). All children were born at term and achieved age-appropriate scores in the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS) tests. In addition, all study subjects passed their new-born otoacoustic tests and demonstrated normal hearing at preschool age. These findings confirmed a lack of MRI-related impact on functional outcomes or hearing impairment at pre-school age. De vita, et al. (102) and Jaimes, et al. (103) investigated the effects of higher field strength scanning on pre-terms (4.7-T and 3-T, respectiv). Both groups noted no increase in risks in moving to a higher field strength MR system. Clements, et al. (104) report similar normal findings, in this case for a smaller cohort (20 cases) whose mothers had been exposed to echo planar imaging (EPI) at 0.5-T four times between 20 weeks and term. Thus, the current data appears to provide general reassurance in that there is low risk present when applying MRI in prenatal and neonatal patients (101-106). An optimized solution for neonatal imaging with clear benefits was reported by Tkach, et al. (107, 108). This group scanned 15 non-sedated neonates in an adapted small-bore (diameter 22- cm) 1.5 -T orthopedic MR system. Although the scanner has approximately twice the gradient strength (70-mT/m) and slew rate (300-mT/m/s) of conventional fullsize MR systems, the gradient coil was smaller and shorter, leading to lower levels of acoustic noise or equivalent pulse sequences (107). Using specifically designed hearing protection, high quality images were obtained for and all MRI examinations that were completed successfully, suggesting minimal impact of the acoustic noise. Of further note is that De Vita, et al. (102) reported successful imaging of nine ventilated neonates at 4.7-T without any acute adverse effects.</para>
    <para>Overall, the use of a combination of hearing protection (e.g., earplugs and earmuffs or headphones) and the additional attenuation of having the neonate placed inside the transmit RF coil, mean that the acoustic noise at the ear is likely to be lower for neonates than for adults, which may explain why no adverse effects have been reported, to date. The anatom-</para>
    <para>ical attenuation afforded to fetuses also seems to be sufficiently effective to enable safe scanning with current clinical static magnetic field strengths and protocols.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Adverse Incidents Associated with Exposure to MRI-Related Acoustic Noise</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(A) Temporary Threshold Shifts (TTS)</emphasis></para>
    <para>As mentioned above, short-term exposure to intense noise (&gt;100-dBA) can induce a temporary shift in the hearing threshold. Brummett, et al. (1) reported temporary shifts in hearing thresholds in 43% of the patients scanned without hearing protection or with improperly fitted earplugs. Normal hearing returned after 15-minutes. Notably, noise levels during scanning were not measured as part of their study. However, Hurwitz, et al. (42) made measurements using the same scanner, reporting values for gradient echo sequences (likely to be some of the loudest sequences on this system) of around 93-dBA. Of the 14 patients scanned without hearing protection in their study, six suffered TTS with threshold loss greater than 15-dB. For those using hearing protection, only one experienced a TTS. It should be noted that these data were associated with scans performed on a comparatively low field strength MR system (0.35-T). A study by Wagner, et al. (109), found conflicting results.</para>
    <para>Ulmer, et al. (16) measured changes in pure tone thresholds in volunteer subjects wearing hearing protection exposed to EPI pulse sequences. Intense impulse noise at 0.65-kHz with cut-offs at 0.3-kHz and 1.0-kHz were also shown to generate substantial hearing threshold shifts. In 2011, Govindaraju, et al. (110) reported a possible incidence of TTS for a man scanned while wearing earplugs on a 3-T scanner. The patient experienced unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus immediately following the MRI examination. The hearing loss resolved completely within 24-hours but the tinnitus persisted. Acoustic noise levels were checked for the conventional sequences that were performed and found to be in the range of L<subscript>eq</subscript> 101- to 112-dBA (L<subscript>peak</subscript> 115- to 124-dB).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(B) Permanent Threshold Shifts (PTS)</emphasis></para>
    <para>If the noise exposure at intense levels is prolonged, or repeated in close time intervals, threshold shifts can be permanent. The threshold for permanent hearing damage is approximately 140-dB for short impulsive noise and around 85-dB for chronic exposure. Commercial MR systems that are designed to be compliant with IEC standards are not able to generate noise in excess of 140-dB (89). De Wilde, et al. (9) reported one case of excessive acoustic noise that occurred in the United Kingdom. The patient reported severe headaches, dizziness, and ear pain following the MRI examination. Importantly, this patient was not provided hearing protection because the manager of the MRI site was confident that the noise levels generated by the 0.5-T MR system were not at a level of concern.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">ACOUSTIC NOISE CONTROL TECHNIQUES</emphasis></para>
    <para>Controlling acoustic noise is generally accomplished in one of three simple ways: control of noise at the receiver (e.g., using earplugs, or anti-noise interference), control along the path of the noise, or control of the noise at the source (e.g., redesigned gradients, or</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Passive Hearing Protection</emphasis></para>
    <para>The simplest, most convenient, and least expensive means of preventing problems associated with acoustic noise during MRI procedures is to use disposable earplugs and/or headphones. Earplugs, when properly fitted can abate noise by 10- to 30-dB (depending on the frequency), which is usually an adequate amount of sound attenuation for the MRI environment. Figure 8 shows examples of the octave band spectra of some commercially available earplugs and other hearing protection devices, demonstrating typical noise attenuation values. The use of earmuffs, headphones, or disposable earplugs has been shown to provide a sufficient decrease in acoustic noise that, in turn, would be capable of preventing the potential temporary hearing loss associated with MRI procedures (1).</para>
    <para>The level and frequency range of noise attenuation will vary with the type and design of hearing protection that is utilized. If data is unavailable for the noise abatement device, the protector should be tested. Since the designs of hearing protectors do vary, care should be taken when offering these to patients. Additionally, proper fitting instructions must be provided. A patient who may be confused, young, or have difficulty in correctly fitting the hearing protection may need additional assistance to prevent poorly fitting the device and having compromised noise attenuation. If using earmuffs or headphones, these should be</para>
    <para>regularly assessed for wear to the seals and replaced, as needed. Current guidelines suggest staff members should have training in the selection and fitting of hearing protection (86).</para>
    <para>Unfortunately, earplugs, earmuffs, and headphones suffer from a number of problems. These devices tend to hamper verbal communication with the patient during the operation of the MR system. In certain circumstances, these devices can also create discomfort or impair immobilization of the patient's head, which is problematic when optimal immobilization is required for certain studies that are particularly sensitive to patient movement (e.g., diffusion and phase-sensitive studies).</para>
    <para>Standard foam-based earplugs are often too large for the ear canal of infants. Some small sizes are available from certain MRI accessory companies, although snug fit is essential if acoustic noise is to be efficiently attenuated. Neonates present a particular challenge when trying to use conventional earplugs or other similar devices. Nordell, et al. (111) reported on a patient-independent device constructed from absorbent padding, which can be placed over the neonate during the MRI examination. Reductions in peak noise levels of 16- to 22-dBA averaged over the hearing spectrum of 4- to 13-dBA were reported. Specially-designed small earplugs or earmuffs (e.g. MiniMuffs Neonatal Noise Attenuators, Natus Newborn Care, www.newborncare.natus.com) can be used in these cases.</para>
    <para>Passive devices used for hearing protection may attenuate noise non-uniformly over the hearing range. While high frequency sound may be well attenuated, attenuation can be poor at low frequency. This is unfortunate because the low frequency range is also where the peak in MRI-related acoustic noise is often generated, however, this may be balanced by the lower hearing sensitivity also in this frequency range (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>Passive protection devices will also offer poor attenuation of noise transmitted to the patient through bone conduction (112). The effect of vibration being conducted during MRI and affecting noise has been reported by Glover, et al. (95). The presence of an insulating foam mattress on the patient couch has been found to reduce vibrational coupling to the patient and noise levels by around 10-dB. This underlying bone conduction transmission path puts a practical attenuation limit for passive protection at around 40-dB (113). As previously indicated, Ravicz and Melcher (24) studied the potential for isolating the body from the MR system using a helmet to minimize acoustic noise transmission via bone conduction. They used passive hearing protection in combination with the helmet system. Adding protection, they reported a total noise attenuation of 55- to 63-dB, by using a combination of earplugs (25- to 28-dB alone), ear defenders (i.e., headphones) (39- to 41-dB alone), and an isolating helmet. While the use of a helmet may suit research studies with volunteer subjects, it may not be clinically acceptable for use in patients. However, in general, earplugs and ear defenders can also be used effectively, offering added hearing protection for patients undergoing MRI examinations.</para>

    <para>The loudspeaker producing this anti-phase noise can be built into the scanner bore or built into a pair of headphones for the patient (thus, harnessing passive protection as well). A major disadvantage of this technique is that, if it performs poorly at certain frequencies or in some spatial regions, noise levels may be enhanced rather than attenuated by the superposition of the additional anti-noise.</para>
    <para>Controlling acoustic noise from a particular source by introducing anti-phase noise to interfere destructively with the noise source is by no means a new idea (116, 117) (Figure 9). For use in the MRI environment, conventional active-noise control (ANC) systems require some modification. Notably, loudspeakers and microphones designed to be utilized in the MRI setting must be used to acquire scanner noise and to transmit control anti-noise and, secondly, the ANC controller must be optimized and synchronized to the scanner.</para>
    <para>The initial results for the use of anti-noise applied to MRI achieved only modest noise attenuation. Goldman, et al. (41) acquired MR system noise with a microphone, performed a Fourier transform (FT) of the noise, and generated control noise by inverting the phase of the major components of the FT, and then transmitted this anti-noise through a loudspeaker built into a set of headphones (i.e., a combination active-passive system), achieving an average noise reduction of around 14-dB. The performance of this system was not much better than that of some standard passive headphones, alone, in the low frequency region of the hearing range. The control sound was delivered using long tubes, introducing a time delay, which limited control efficiency.</para>

Thus, it is possible to attenuate the pseudo-periodic MR system-related noise while allowing the transmission of vocal communication or music to be maintained. The feedback loop uses a sampling microphone placed close to the ear, where noise reduction is required. It will attempt to attenuate all noise propagating into the ear. A feed-forward algorithm uses a sampling microphone close to the problematic noise source, offering a potentially more selective cancellation of noise source. Frequently, time limitations in anti-noise getting from the loudspeaker to the subject as well as stability requirements set a practical upper frequency limit for ANC systems. This problem of poorer high frequency attenuation performance is mitigated by building the systems into complementary passive ear defenders, resulting in a better broad frequency noise reduction.</para>
    <para>Similar to Goldman, et al. (41), commercial manufacturers have offered ANC systems based on delivering anti-noise to patient headphones (42), however, the long tubing imposes a time delay in getting noise to the ear, limiting the performance of such a system. In 1995, Pla, et al. (119) reported improved results using a system based on an x-filtered least mean squares (LMS) algorithm, driving piezoelectric speakers near the patient's ears. These researchers achieved noise attenuation up to 25-dB for frequencies below 1.2-kHz and for the first few harmonics only. In 1997, McJury, et al. (114) reported on the performance of a multichannel filtered U-least mean squares algorithm for acoustic noise control. Acoustic noise was recorded digitally from a series of typical clinical MRI protocols performed on a 1.0-T Siemens Impact. This noise was then replayed through a bench-top adaptive realtime DSP ANC system (Motorola DSP 56001). A typical peak sound attenuation of approximately 30-dB was achieved over the frequency range from 0- to 700-Hz (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>In 1999, Chen, et al. (115) published results using an ANC system based on a modified feedback method with a second order cascaded neural network architecture, with loudspeaker mounted in a headset. For acoustic noise up to 3-kHz, they achieved an average attenuation of 19-dB. This study was also based on recorded scanner noise attenuated with a lab-based ANC system.</para>
    <para>More recently, Chambers, et al. (120) demonstrated improved results over a wide frequency range using an ANC system that was based on an LMS feed-forward algorithm and built into a set of ear defenders (i.e., headphones). From 600-Hz to 4-kHz, peak attenuation of around 40-dB was measured for scanner noise. Importantly, the use of feed-forward methodology allows cancellation of scanner noise with less attenuation of any noise stimuli introduced during the use of fMRI protocols. However, this system did not acquire its reference noise in real-time, but required a recording phase to obtain reference data.</para>
    <para>To date, some of the most successful solutions for acoustic noise reductions were the results from Li, et al. (121) and Lee, et al. (122). Li, et al. (121) reported results with a patented, ANC system based on a feed-forward, x-LMS algorithm that uses multiple reference signals. The ANC system was built into a headset to also benefit from the passive attenuation of noise at higher frequencies. Impressive acoustic noise reductions of up to 55-dB</para>

Their methods of using active vibration control are also transferrable, however, until more recently (40, 125), they received little attention from the MRI community.

    <para>Because the dominant effect of acoustic noise levels is associated with the signal details of a particular MRI protocol rather than the structure of the MR system (47), it follows that it should be possible to reduce the noise level by optimizing the choice of pulse sequence parameters. Simply using a spin echo (SE) sequence rather than a gradient echo (GE) pulse sequence and running the sequence with reduced gradient parameters (i.e., rise-time and amplitude) can significantly reduce the levels of acoustic noise. Skare, et al. (128) designed so-called "quiet" sequences in this way and defined a simple "quietness factor" (QF) as,</para>
    <para>QF = RT<subscript>m</subscript>/RT<subscript>s</subscript>                    (3)</para>
    <para>where the RT<subscript>m</subscript> is the rise-time of the modified sequence and RT<subscript>s</subscript>, the original/default rise-time. On a 1.5-T MR system, a QF of six resulted in a noise attenuation of 20-dB. This procedure, however, lengthens the echo time (TE), reduces the number of acquisition slices, and results in a longer examination time.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(B) Minimizing the Number of Gradient Echoes</emphasis></para>
    <para>A reduction of acoustic noise levels may also be achieved by reducing the level of gradient pulsing in a pulse sequence (129, 130). A rapid, single-shot, multi-slice imaging technique (i.e., STEAM-Burst) is based on stimulated-echoes without the rapid gradient switching necessary in other single-shot techniques such as echo planar (130). The STEAM-Burst sequence uses a combination of the "Burst" technique (131), involving the application of multiple RF pulses under a constant gradient and subsequent refocusing of the resultant set of echoes, and the STEAM-stimulated echo acquisition mode (132). Limited data on acoustic noise measurements shows peak noise attenuation of 15-dB compared with a similar EPI sequence (130).</para>
    <para>This pulse sequence offers the potential for rapid acquisition of MR images, but it is sensitive to artifacts due to static magnetic field inhomogeneities while generating reduced levels of acoustic noise. The sequence suffers from two main problems. First, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low compared with other rapid imaging techniques. Second, the images acquired at 3-T have an SNR of approximately of 20:1. Thus, these pulse sequences remain more suited to specific research applications than routine use in the clinical MRI setting.</para>

The efficiency of soft gradient pulses.</emphasis> Magnitude spectra are shown (with an arbitrary linear scale) for the sound generated by the readout gradient of a FLASH (i.e., fast gradient echo) pulse sequence. Data was acquired with a linear ramp, 0.5-msec duration (top plot) and sinusoidal ramp duration 4-msec (lower plot). With the sinusoidal ramping, high frequency acoustic components above 500-Hz are severely attenuated (133). Reproduced by permission, Wiley - John Wiley and Son Publishers, NY.</para>
  <para>used in modern reduced acoustic noise sequence optimization and was first suggested by Hennel, (133). Notably, this technique may be applied to minimize the acoustic noise generated by a range of conventional MRI pulse sequences. As mentioned above, it has been shown that the acoustic response of the gradient system to current pulses is linear (47). Thus, the sound generated by a gradient waveform can be derived from a product of the FT of the source input and the frequency response function (FRF) of the gradient system (see Equation 2). If gradient pulses are designed such that their current waveforms contain no frequencies for which the amplitude of the FRF is high, then resultant acoustic noise levels should be minimized (133). The FRF of the gradient system in a 3-T MR system was measured and a very low response noted at low frequencies (below 200-Hz). Frequency components below this threshold should be attenuated in the acoustic spectrum of any pulse sequences.</para>
    <para>In minimizing high frequency components in the gradient pulses, it is possible to avoid or reduce sharp transitions, such as step functions in the waveform, and to replace these with more slowly varying sinusoidal transitions. This may be accomplished by following three simple rules:</para>

    <para>The use and efficiency of soft pulses are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 12</emphasis>. With the sinusoidal ramping, high frequency acoustic components above 500-Hz are severely attenuated. Acoustic noise levels, averaged over 1-second, were measured for spin echo and gradient echo sequences as a function of echo time (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>). Good quality MR images may be acquired with sound levels dropping as echo time (TE) increases. At echo times of 30- to 50-msec, good quality images are still possible and acoustic noise levels are below the ambient room noise (i.e., with the air-conditioning running, room sound levels approach 45-dBA). Three main limitations were identified with the initial implementation of this technique, as follows: 1) there was an increased sensitivity of the pulse sequences to vascular flow, 2) the high-speed MRI pulse sequences tended to be unsuitable for clinical applications, and 3) increased voltages by factor of two were needed to produce sinusoidal ramps instead of linear ramps.</para>
    <para>The pulse sequence strategy was extended to fast imaging sequences (FLASH and RARE) in 2001 (134). Noise reductions of 20- to 40-dBA were reported compared to standard sequences (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 14</emphasis>).

In this case, the limitation due to long acquisition times was minimized using interleaved spiral gradient, read-out trajectories. Using</para>
    <para>this pulse sequence with optimized sampling scheme on a 2-T MR system, an average noise reduction of 22-dBA was achieved. The use of sinusoidal gradient waveforms continues to be common (137 - 139).</para>
    <para>An algorithmic approach to sequence optimization involving gradient reshaping has been reported by Heismann, et al. (140). Here, gradient waveforms are smoothed (spline interpolation) and optimized, with the algorithm adapting some sections of the pulse sequence, and leaving others unchanged. This can be successfully applied to conventional imaging sequences (141).</para>
    <para>Rather than re-shaping the waveform, a further method is to revise the sampling of k-space. Spiral scanning was used successfully to substantially reduce acoustic noise (136). Initially, this was used to counteract the long acquisition times resulting from increased (and lower) gradient durations to reduce acoustic noise. Later, this method has been incorporated into highly successful "silent" ultrashort TE methods, and techniques for diffusion-weighted MRI (see below).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(D) Using Parallel Imaging</emphasis></para>
    <para>Similar to the slew rate reduction associated with a soft gradient pulse technique, De Zwart, et al. (142) used SENSE parallel imaging techniques to obtain significant reductions in gradient slew rates and achieved reductions in acoustic noise. The use of sensitivity encoding in combination with multi-channel detector arrays allows reduced gradient switching through reduced k-space sampling. Using anther type of MRI sequence (i.e., SENSE), a gradient slew rate reduction was achieved at constant image acquisition time and image spatial resolution. For two-fold SENSE under sampling, the gradient amplitude was reduced to 50% (13-mT/m), and ramp time doubled (360-microseconds), resulting in a slew rate of 37-T/m/sec (a 4-fold reduction in the maximum slew rate). SPL reductions for two scanners were reported: 14-dBA (1.5-T) and 12-dB (3-T).</para>
    <para>Moelker, et al. (143) reported an interesting variant of this approach. This group built a manual controller to reduce gradient slew rates and the associated acoustic noise for use during interventional MRI, where acoustic noise may be particularly unpleasant for staff members, while small degradations to image quality can be tolerated. Their controller allowed a 16-fold reduction in slew rate, with acoustic noise reduced by up to 21-dBA.</para>
    <para>In several more recent optimized sequences, parallel imaging forms a part of the optimization, especially in challenging areas such as fast imaging and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (139, 144).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(E) Minimizing the MR System Acoustic Response Function</emphasis></para>
    <para>For each separate gradient (x-, y-, and z-gradient), Tomasi, et al. (145) compared the current waveforms and resulting vibrational response. This group demonstrated, that by altering the read-out frequency of the EPI gradient (and, hence, the bandwidth) to avoid known vibrational resonances, significant reductions in acoustic noise could be achieved. Altering the read-out frequency from 720-Hz to 920-Hz resulted in a noise reduction of 12-dB.</para>
    <para>A similar approach was reported by Schmitter, et al. in 2008 (138). These researchers devised the so-called "sEPI" technique, which is a low noise EPI pulse sequence for use with fMRI. This sequence produces a narrow acoustic frequency spectrum by using a sinusoidal read-out gradient waveform with smooth ramps and constant phase encode gradient. By varying the switching frequency of the read-out gradient, this narrow band can be shifted in frequency to match the minima of the scanner frequency response function, avoiding major resonance modes and minimizing acoustic noise. These researchers reported that the average SPL of the standard EPI, 82.5-dBA, was reduced to 61.7-dBA. This sequence did not include optimization of the slice selection gradient, and so this work was extended in 2010 with the introduction of noise-optimized "VERSE" pulses, and a parallel imaging approach.(139). Zapp, et al. (139) further expanded sEPI with the use of parallel imaging. Segbers, et al. (146) and Ott, et al. (147) have also used a combination of methodologies, including frequency-shifting, to avoid acoustic noise resonance modes.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">(F) Ultrashort and Zero TE methods</emphasis></para>
    <para>In recent years, imaging tissues with very short T2 (for example cortical bone or lung) has been improved by the emergence of ultrashort TE (UTE) or zero TE sequences (ZTE) (148, 149). UTE sequences offer effective TE reductions of 10-200 times that offered by more conventional sequences. In ZTE sequences, the readout gradient starts simultaneously with signal excitation (ramping up prior to the excitation pulse), producing an effective TE of zero. Measurement times are short, but acquisition is inherently three dimensional.</para>
    <para>Both these techniques generally involve (non-Cartesian) radial imaging of k-space. TRs are also very short, so there is no need to switch off gradients between excitations, and this lowering of gradient activity results in almost silent sequences. ZTE methods require high-bandwidth excitation, so the specific absorption ratio (SAR) can become an issue, particularly at high field. The wide bandwidth excitation can be achieved either using short hard RF pulses, or by sweeping the frequency of an arbitrary length pulse, the so-called SWIFT technique (150, 151).</para>
    <para>These methods are highly successful in reducing acoustic noise, producing almost silent MR sequences, with sequence noise at the level of ambient levels. Hence, they have generated significant commercial interest, and form the basis of solutions implemented by GE and Siemens.</para>
    <para>GE were early implementers of UTE methods, basing their Silenz<superscript>TM</superscript> product on the RUFIS sequence (152). A prototype Silenz implementation on a 3-T scanner and running neuro sequences, produced acoustic noise levels which were similar to room ambient noise (68.8-dB) (153). Ohlmann-Knaufo, et al. (154) reported on a comparison of the image quality of Silenz T<subscript>1</subscript>-w and T<subscript>2</subscript>-w scans versus non-Silenz versions at 3-T for neuro patients. The Silenz scan quality compared well, with the main drawback being the significantly longer scan times for the T<subscript>1</subscript>-w sequences. Others reported on UTE variants for quiet MR, for fast imaging applications (155, 156).</para>
    <para>Due to the acquisition of signal from free induction decays (FIDs) rather echoes, UTE/ZTE methods are less sensitive to motion. The long readout time can also cause image blurring. Holdsworth, et al. (157) compared Silenz-based and conventional MR angiography</para>
    <para>(MRA) sequences. Silenz-based sequences scored poorly, with only 40% being rated as diagnostic quality.</para>
    <para>A further variant of these methods, is pointwise encoding time reduction with radial acquisition (PETRA) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15</emphasis>)(158). This forms the basis of sequences in the Quiet Suite™ product from Siemens. Reports have assessed silent PETRA sequences for neurological (159) and pediatric applications (160).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">(G) Using Gradient Cancellation Pulses</emphasis></para>
    <para>Some researchers proposed a technique involving additional "follow-up" gradient pulses, to cancel the initial pulses that would generate unwanted acoustic noise. This is effectively a type of an anti-noise approach, using anti-phase gradients instead of anti-phase acoustic noise (161, 162). There is, in effect, a change to the gradient input function, such that initial impulsive forces generated by the gradients are cancelled by subsequent counter impulsive forces, minimizing the potential for the generation of acoustic noise. These ideas can be seen as an extension of the initial observations of the acoustic noise characteristics of trapezoidal gradient pulses as reported by Wu, et al. (163). Shou, et al. (162) demonstrated that follow-on trapezoidal gradient pulses can cancel two frequencies and their harmonics. The initial studies from this group showed that a significant noise reduction was possible (around 13-dB) when cancelling at least three of the dominant acoustic noise spectral peaks.</para>

The gradient coil had a maximum gradient strength of 21-mT/m and slew rate of 200-mT/m/ms. Using a combination of single and double follow-on trapezoidal gradient pulses, Segbers, et al. (146) managed to suppress several of the main acoustic noise spectral frequencies and achieved a maximum noise reduction of 12-dB.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">(H) Application-Specific Methods</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">1) fMRI Methods.</emphasis> As mentioned above, MRI-related acoustic noise can interfere with the presentation and processing of functional stimuli and generate blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)-related contrast in the auditory cortex. Passive hearing protection may not offer sufficiently quiet conditions for psychological studies of hearing (164). Unfortunately, residual noise can often be loud enough to mask the perception of experimental sound stimuli (11). Due the inherent requirement for ultrafast image acquisition, quiet MRI sequences employing shallow gradient ramps or soft gradient pulses frequently cannot easily be applied to fMRI without compromising data quality. Marcar, et al. (165) modified a fMRI acquisition using soft gradient pulses (133 ) at 2-T. In achieving a silent sequence, the time penalty results in a 24 sec acquisition time for a set of 4 slices. Rather than using the approach of Hennel, et al. (133), using sinusoidal readout gradient switching and continuous phase gradients is popular and effective (139, 166). It is common to manage these issues using different types of sequence-related solutions: (1) sparse imaging (167-169) and (2) using event-related strategies (170).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">i) Modified Block Designs for fMRI.</emphasis> These sequences (also called clustered volume acquisition, flat ear design, sparse, and behavior interleaved gradients), involve using a TR that is longer that the acquisition time, allowing time for interleaving short (1- to 4-seconds) silent gaps within fMRI sequences. In the brain, the peak hemodynamic response to noise occurs after a time delay of around 5-seconds following stimulation. Knowing this, it is possible to present stimuli in these silent gaps where the scanner is silent and then to acquire the subsequent images when the peak response will occur. This cycle is then repeated for the entire block. The duration of the gap is dependent on the number of slices acquired and the repetition time (TR) used. Therefore, care is needed to avoid extending the sequence length, which can have penalties in terms of patient motion and image quality. An underlying assumption is also made with simple modified block designs, that any BOLD response to scanner noise during acquisition will apply equally when stimulus is on and when it is off. Optimization of the block design involves two additional criteria. If the silent gap is extended to 9- to 10-seconds, enough time will have elapsed to allow any hemodynamic response produced by the previous acquisition to return to baseline. Sampling of any BOLD signal relating to acoustic noise from the previous acquisition will then be minimized. Lastly, keeping the acquisition time under 2-seconds will prevent measurement of any hemodynamic response (HR) from the current acquisition.</para>
    <para>Interleaved silent steady-state imaging (ISSSS) (171) is a popular variation of sparse imaging. This sequence uses continuous excitation pulses (which maintain a steady state longitudinal magnetization) and variable readout gradients. Like sparse imaging, stimuli are presented in the quiet gaps, but longer data acquisition is used for multiple volumes, improving the sequence temporal resolution. As the data sampling rate is not consistent, it can be challenging to analyze ISSSS data. Andoh, et al. (172) reported encouraging results with a comparison of a resting-state version of ISSSS and conventional resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI).</para>

    <para>Arguably the best, if not the most technically challenging, solution to minimize acoustic noise is to eliminate the noise at the source by designing a "quiet" gradient coil which generates no acoustic noise or vibration. Acoustic noise and vibration arises due to physical buckling and resonance of the gradient coil (and former), as well as coupling to other structures. Noise control may be achieved by special designs taking into consideration the construction and materials of the gradient coil formers, coupling with other structures, use of noise insulation materials, and finally the design of the coil windings themselves. This however, represents (for existing scanners) probably the most inconvenient and expensive solution. This section discusses each of these aspects in more detail.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="italics">Stiffness and Damping.</emphasis> As suggested above, greater gradient coil stiffness should reduce mechanical vibration and associated noise. Stiffness is dependent on material properties and geometrical factors. Altering gradient coil dimensions or materials to increase Young's modulus will help reduce acoustic noise due to vibration. Lin, et al. (181) reported on the use of a variety of reinforcements to increase the gradient coil stiffness, reduce vibration, and the associated acoustic noise. These investigators found that increasing the stiffness of the gradient coil former reduced the amplitude of the forced vibration response of the gradient coil at low frequencies and the noise generated by the coil. In addition, the gradient coil demonstrated a reduced number of resonance modes in the low and medium frequency ranges, in turn, reducing the chance of the system being excited into resonance and generating high levels of acoustic noise.</para>
    <para>Damping the gradient coil may also attenuate the mechanical vibration. This can be achieved by using particular materials for construction or by mounting the coil in such a way that an acoustic absorber surrounds it. Damping is most efficient at or near resonance and, unfortunately, will reduce the overall stiffness of the coil structure. Several commercial manufacturers use damping techniques for their gradient coil systems (46, 51). A reduction of around 3-dBA due to the use of acoustically damped commercial gradient systems have been reported (46). Mechefske, et al. (182) reported improved results by mounting an acoustic liner inside the bore of a 4-Tesla research scanner, with damping material applied to the back. The bore of this MR system was also fitted with an "endcap". Running an EPI sequence, acoustic attenuation of around 20-dB was possible, however the scanner did not</para>

    <para>In 2005, Shao, et al. (70) reported on the development of an analytic model that predicted the acoustic noise generated by an MRI gradient coil with finite acoustic impedance, which was based on initial work by Kuijpers, et al. (75). This group modeled the use of an absorptive liner inside the gradient coils and tested predictions with measurements made in a 4-Tesla MR system. They found that an acoustic noise reduction of the order of 10-dB at the low frequency end of the spectrum was possible, but the practicality of using thick materials in limited space is doubtful.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Isolation/Evacuation/Enclosure.</emphasis> Some groups tried to isolate the gradient coil to prevent the transmission of vibrations to other structures (183-5). As acoustic waves can only travel in a medium, mounting or encasing the gradient coil in a vacuum should avoid transmission of any generated noise (183-186). Edelstein, et al. (185) controlled acoustic noise by using a combination of evacuating the gradient coil structure and using a magnet with a non-conducting inner cryostat bore. They achieved total reduction in acoustic noise of around 20-dB (peak). Their results showed that eddy currents caused by gradient shielding leakage can generate significant Lorentz forces on the inner cryostat bore. These forces contribute a significant level of the total scanner acoustic noise. Edelstein, et al. (185) reported that is</para>

    <para>it important to provide electromagnetic isolation. In 2005, based on finite element modeling, they redesigned standard active gradient shielding to include an additional passive copper layer (187). This added passive shield prevented power deposition in the warm bore, which resulted in an efficient hybrid active-passive shielding system. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 16</emphasis> shows examples of typical configurations for such a strategy. The modeled power reductions associated with the system predicted a reduction in acoustic noise of approximately 25-dB.</para>
    <para>Tkach, et al. (108) reported on the acoustic noise levels generated by a purpose-designed neonatal 1.5-T MR system. One of the design features was a cantilevered patient couch. The couch effectively suspends the patient inside the scanner bore, isolating or decoupling the patient from vibration from the gradient coils and bore panels. For a range of 6 clinical sequences, they recorded noise levels of 77.3- to 88.0-dB, representing an average reduction of 11-dB for this system compared to typical adult scanners running similar clinical sequences.</para>
    <para>Katsunuma, et al. (183), evacuated the area surrounding the gradient coil system so that insulation would prevent propagation of sound and a separate mount (i.e., floor mounting the gradient coil former) that prevented transmission of vibration from other structures. Acoustic noise reduction levels of around 30-dB (peak) were possible, but this is an expensive solution and not suited for retrofit. "Enclosure" is a traditional technique used in noise control, which involves enclosing the noise source in an airtight skin, damping the source side of the enclosure, and decoupling the enclosure from the source (51).</para>
    <para>Perforating a noise-generating surface has been found to significantly reduce the levels of acoustic noise generated (188). Systems involving the use of micro-perforated panels (MPPs), first suggested by Maa (189), are typically used with an air-filled backing cavity and rigid back wall. These methods can also be difficult to implement efficiently in MR systems due to additional space requirements. More recently, Li and Mechefske (190) investigated the implementation of an MPP system for use in MRI. Their basic expansion modeling showed that the MPP systems can be particularly efficient at low frequencies. However, optimized parameters also allow good efficiency over a wider band. As with poorly designed ANC systems, noise levels have been found to increase with poorly designed perforation systems (190).</para>
    <para>Insulation has also been successful in increasing noise attenuation when applied to transmit RF coils. For example Ireland, et al. (191) reported on the results of additional insulation built into a head RF coil (18-cm inner diameter) for neonatal imaging. The insulation achieved an average additional attenuation of 9-dBA across a range of six different clinical imaging sequences at 1.5-T, resulting in noise levels of approximately 82-dBA, that were then further attenuated with passive hearing protection.</para>

    <para>In theory, it is possible to design gradient coil windings such that all Lorentz forces generated by current pulsing are balanced (i.e., each force is effectively cancelled by one of equal magnitude at a conjugate position relative to the coil center) (37, 192-195). This is, in essence, similar to using anti-phase noise to cancel a noise source. For example, ac-</para>

They are designed to have a secondary coil operate in opposition to the main primary to minimize Lorentz forces on the primary. The combination of coil design and a consideration of construction methods and materials are essential for efficient results.</para>
    <para>Rather than trying to mount a vibrating gradient coil to a heavy and immovable former or somehow damp the coil, if the coil is considered as a harmonic oscillator and coupled to another, back-to-back, and if masses and spring constants are equal, the center of mass of the system will be constant without the need for a heavy mount (192, 193). This is the principle of active force balancing which may be applied to gradient coil design (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 17</emphasis>).</para>

Knowing that wave velocity and frequency are related by v = f λ, a slow wave velocity will result in low frequency, above which progressive phase effects will be expected which will interfere with noise cancellation.</para>
    <para>For optimal acoustic noise cancellation, strut material should have a large value for E and small value for ρ, resulting in a high compressional wave velocity. Thus, a light coupling structure of high strength may perform as well as a heavier structure. Composite materials have been tested and found to perform well with a frequency response up to 20-kHz (single loop coil of dimensions 30-cm × 20-cm) (125). Using a bench-top prototype 2-coil system (a square coil design measuring 40-cm along each size, powered by a 10-A sinusoidal current), the reported noise attenuation, when powered in balanced mode, was approximately 40-dB at 100-Hz, dropping to 0-dB at 3.5-Hz (Figure 18). The results of attenuation levels agree reasonably well with a theoretical prediction (curve D) (192).</para>
    <para>Designs have also been extended and tailored to include the capability of current balancing, acoustic screening and magnetic field screening in one coil (195). A head gradient coil has been designed analytically using co-axial return paths to minimize localized Lorentz forces and acoustic noise. When performing EPI (3-mm slice thickness, gradient switching frequency 830-Hz, current 207-A) in a 3-T MR system, noise levels of 102-dB (root mean square) have been reported (192).</para>
    <para>The implications for gradient coil characteristics of the acoustic screening design mean a loss of gradient strength and an increase in coil inductance, thus, reducing high-speed performance. Estimates of the increase in inductance for a three-cylinder coil system (i.e., fully force shielded as well as acoustically and magnetically shielded) over a gradient coil with only active magnetic shielding is a factor of approximately eight.</para>
    <para>To counteract this in keeping performance constant, an increase in driver current of the square root of 8 is required that will, in turn, increase the acoustic noise output of the coil. Throughout the data on sound generation in relatively simple gradient structures (37), the highest sound pressure levels were noted to come from spurious resonances, thought to be due to bending and buckling of the coil structures (Chladni resonances). Designing coil systems that completely cancel acoustic noise including contributions from these sources is a considerable challenge.</para>

    <para>Reduced acoustic noise levels have been reported for asymmetric gradient coils (199-200). To address the impact of claustrophobia associated with standard cylindrical scanner geometry, one solution is to move the imaging isocenter towards one end of the scanner (201). This involves asymmetric magnet design, and associated changes to hardware such as the gradient coils (202, 203). Wang, et al.

They also reported lower levels of acoustic noise, however they don't report absolute noise levels or comparisons to similar conventional systems.</para>
    <para>The development of MRI-guided linear accelerator (MRI-LINAC) technology has driven a variety of changes, one of which is gradient coils with split designs (199). Split designs allow for asymmetric acoustic design solutions and there have been several studies in this area assessing the benefits of designs incorporating asymmetric acoustic tunnels, as well as liners (204-207). Studies also include the optimization of the structure of the scanner bore exit, to act as an acoustic horn and potentially redirect acoustic noise away from the patient (208-210). Nan, et al.

This acoustic phenomenon is referred to as "RF hearing", "RF sound" or "microwave hearing". Thermoelastic expansion is believed to be the mechanism responsible for the production of RF hearing, whereby there is absorption of RF energy that produces a minute temperature elevation (i.e., approximately 1 x 10<superscript>-6</superscript> °C) over a brief time period (i.e., approximately 10-microseconds) in the tissue of the head (212-214). Subsequently, a pressure wave is induced that is sensed by the hair cells of the cochlea via bone conduction. In this manner, the pulse of RF energy is transferred into an acoustic wave within the human head and sensed by the hearing organs.</para>
    <para>The sounds that occur with RF hearing appear to originate from within or near the back of the human head, regardless of the orientation of the head in the RF field. The actual type of noise that is heard varies with the RF pulse width and repetition rate. The relative loudness is dependent on the total energy per pulse. RF energy-related acoustic noise has been observed at frequencies ranging from 216 to 7500-MHz (212-214).</para>
    <para>RF hearing is mathematically predictable from classical physics and has been studied and characterized in laboratory animals and human subjects. Individuals involved with the use of microwaves in industrial and military settings commonly experience RF hearing. With specific reference to the operation of MR systems, RF hearing has been found to be associated with frequencies ranging from 2.4- to 170-MHz (212).</para>
    <para>The gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise that occurs during MRI procedures is significantly louder than the sounds associated with RF hearing. Therefore, noises produced by the RF auditory phenomenon are effectively masked and not perceived by patients or MR system operators (212). Furthermore, there is no evidence of any detrimental health effects related to the presence of RF hearing. However, Roschmann, et al. (212) recommends an upper level limit of 30-kW applied peak pulse power of RF energy for head coils and 6-kW for surface coils used during MR imaging or spectroscopy to avoid RF-evoked sound pressure levels in the head increasing above the discomfort threshold of 110-dB.</para>

        <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <para>MRI procedures can generate significant levels of acoustic noise under certain conditions (41, 54). This noise can be an annoyance, hinder communication with staff members and, at high levels, presents a potential safety hazard to patients that must be managed and controlled.</para>
    <para>Many groups have measured and analyzed the acoustic noise associated with MRI. Acoustic noise levels increase with changes in imaging parameters including a decrease in section thickness, field-of-view, gradient ramp time, and an increase in the gradient amplitude. The environment, hardware design, and the presence of the patient in the MR system will also affect noise levels.</para>
    <para>Although many options are available for noise control, the use of simple passive protection in the form of earplugs is generally sufficient to decrease noise to levels within permissible limits for the great majority of patients. However, care must be taken to ensure passive protection is properly fitted and in good condition (1). Noise measurements or data for the scanner should also be acquired and checked in association with the attenuation of the passive protection to ensure resultant noise levels at the ear will be within safe limits.</para>
    <para>Current documents regarding permissible limits vary, but a general consensus appears to set a permissible average noise level at the patients ear of 85-dBA (80, 88, 96). Noise levels outside the MR system's bore are lower and present reduced risks for an MRI healthcare worker present during the MRI examination.</para>
    <para>Of course, passive methods have limitations and more elegant and effective solutions are possible. These methods range from optimizing the MRI pulse sequences in terms of minimizing gradient activity, to the utilization of active noise control and active vibration control systems, or entirely redesigning the gradient coils.</para>
    <para>As with many aspects of MRI, the specifications for achieving high noise attenuation often run counter to fast acquisition of high quality diagnostic images and compromises must be made. Optimizing procedures to lengthen gradient ramp times, lower amplitudes, or minimize pulsing can result in sequences with reduced performance (133-135). Designing gradient coils that are force-balanced to minimize acoustic resonances will compromise performance in terms of increasing inductance and loss of gradient strength (37, 192-195).</para>
    <para>A solution that presents a minimal impact on the performance of the MR system is active noise control using anti-noise (114-122). This is a promising technique but an optimal system has yet to be fully implemented on clinical scanners.</para>
    <para>Over the last decade, the most effective solutions reported, are those involving sequence optimization. UTE-type sequences which incorporate spiral k-space trajectory acquisition, and very low gradient activity produce almost silent MR scanning (148-160). Gradient fil-</para>
    <para>tering or re-shaping has also been proven to be very effective. It is no coincidence that two commercial solutions (Silenz<superscript>TM</superscript>, and Quiet Suite<superscript>TM</superscript>) are based on these approaches.</para>
    <para>These solutions (UTE methods in particular) have not been applied to every MR sequence, and are not suited to certain applications, such as ultrafast MR. However, given the comparative low cost and ease of install for these acoustic noise solutions, coupled with their efficiency, it seems likely that ongoing research in these directions will prove fruitful and silent MR sequences will multiply on clinical scanners over time.</para>
    <para>Current trends in MRI include increasing static magnetic field strengths and improved gradient performance for rapid clinical imaging applications. The need for ultrafast sequences for fMRI and other advanced techniques continues. These developments will result in increases in MRI-generated acoustic noise levels. This will mean a continuing interest and evolution in acoustic noise control methods that warrant continued investigation, development, and commercial implementation of these techniques.</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Radiofrequency (RF) energy is defined as nonionizing electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range of 3-kHz to 300-GHz, as distinguished from the very high photon energies and frequencies associated with ionizing electromagnetic radiation (e.g., gamma and X-rays). The RF spectrum includes radar, ultra-high frequency (UHF), and very high frequency (VHF) television, AM and FM radio, and microwave communication frequencies. Resonant radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields are used in magnetic resonance (MR) for imaging and spectroscopy procedures (1).</para>
    <para>This chapter will present and discuss various important aspects of RF power deposition associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures with an emphasis on nonclinical, physical factors, calculations, and measurements used to characterize this electromagnetic field.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="ch0007s0000s0002">
        <title>RADIO FREQUENCY MAGNETIC FIELDS AND MRI PROCEDURES</title>
    <para>During an MRI procedure, the patient absorbs a portion of the transmitted RF energy, which may result in tissue heating (2-16). Thus, whole-body and localized heating are the primary safety concerns associated with the absorption of RF energy. Notably, the elevation of core body temperatures to sufficiently high levels may be life-threatening (2, 17, 18). With local transmit RF coils, the primary safety concern is to prevent burns by limiting localized heating.</para>
    <para>The specific absorption rate, or SAR, is the RF power absorbed per unit mass of tissue and is the metric for RF power deposition typically reported in W/kg. SAR is believed to serve as a crude measure of heating potential. It is essential for patient safety to limit whole-</para>
    <para>body-averaged and localized temperatures to appropriate SAR levels (2, 18-23). Therefore, national and international safety standards (2, 19-21) appropriately limit or recommend SAR levels for clinical MRI examinations. Heating experienced by the patient during an MRI examination depends on the RF power deposited per unit mass (or SAR), ambient temperature, relative humidity, airflow rate, blood flow, sweating rate, and patient insulation.</para>
    <para>Resonant frequency scales with the static magnetic field strength and nuclei of interest. For hydrogen protons, the resonant RF frequency is 42-MHz/Tesla (1). The tip angle is proportional to the area under the envelope of the RF waveform. Typically, the amplitude of the RF pulse (i.e., the tip angle) is adjusted to maximize the received signal. For a given waveform, RF energy is proportional to the square of the tip angle. Only the magnetic component of the RF field is useful in MRI. Designs usually reduce electric field coupling to patients. Since RF power deposition is mostly through magnetic induction, the distribution of the RF power deposition associated with an MRI procedure tends to be mostly peripheral or on the surface of the subject's body (9-11). Plane wave exposures (in non-MRI applications) may lead to higher heating at greater depths (18, 24).</para>
    <para>The average RF power (and SAR) is proportional to the number of images per unit time and peak RF power. Peak RF power depends on patient dimensions, the RF waveform, flip angle, and whether the MR system's transmit RF coil is operating in a linear or quadrature (i.e., has a circularly polarized magnetic field vector) mode during the transmission of RF energy. Notably, quadrature excitation lowers RF peak power requirements and SAR by a factor of two and "stirs" any field inhomogeneities (10). For a given static magnetic field strength and RF waveform, SAR is independent of the type of nucleus.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">MR SAFETY STANDARDS</emphasis>The United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published "Non-Significant Risk Criteria" for MR systems (22). These criteria state that clinical MRI examinations need Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) if the SAR exceeds the following levels:</para>

    <para>Notably, the FDA's significant risk criteria also include limits that are unrelated to RF power deposition.</para>
    <para>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) developed the international MRI safety standard IEC 60601-2-33 (23). The IEC MRI safety standard is three-tiered. The first tier is referred to as the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> and is for routine scanning of patients. The second tier is designated as the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>. The MR system operator must take a deliberate action (usually using an "accept" button on the MR system console) to enter the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>. This mode provides higher MR system performance, but requires the MRI healthcare worker to closely monitor the patient during the MRI examination. Finally, the third tier is the <emphasis role="italics">Second Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>, which is used only for research purposes under limits controlled by an Investigational Review Board (IRB).</para>

    <para>Note that the third edition of IEC 60601-2-33 is current as this is written. Work is continuing on improving the scientific basis for local SAR limits or some equivalent criterion.</para>
    <para>The IEC 60601-2-33 does not require local SAR limits for volume transmit RF coils, but does require local SAR limits for local transmit RF coils that may produce inhomogeneous RF electromagnetic fields. For 3-Tesla MR systems and higher, MR image "shading" can be a concern. This issue is apparently associated with the standing waves interfering at field strengths where electrical lengths in the body that approach, or are less than, the dimensions of the body. There are now efforts (known as dual drive, parallel transmit, elliptical drive, or RF shimming; parallel transmit will be used here to represent these techniques) to minimize shading by adjusting excitations on two or more RF channels to improve the quadrature uniformity in the body (not necessarily in air) for a particular field of view. These techniques are intended to improve quadrature uniformity in the body and reduce or</para>
    <para>at least not increase the local SAR over that caused by conventional quadrature (in air) excitation. The local SAR level could increase if the excitation is not properly controlled. Since there is a long safety record associated with conventional quadrature excitation, there is generally no concern provided that parallel transmit does not generate a local SAR higher than conventional quadrature imaging for similar tissues. However, the scientific basis for local SAR limits (i.e., RF power averaged over the worst case 10 grams) is currently unclear.</para>
    <para>Moritz and Henriques (25, 26) found that the thresholds for local thermal damage to skin depended non-linearly on local tissue temperature and its duration. Comparisons of the effectiveness of microwave hyperthermia protocols for cancer therapy with various temperature-time courses have been modeled in terms of the equivalent cumulative exposure minutes at 43 degrees C (27). These values are known as CEM43. A proposal has been made to use CEM43-derived limits to replace existing SAR safety limits (28). The proposed CEM43 estimates tissue viability through Arrhenius equations based on temperature due to local SAR from numerical simulations, duration, mass blood flow, and most sensitive exposed tissue type (29, 30). It is not yet certain whether approximations made in deriving CEM43 limits to determine thermal safety for MRI and spectroscopy are accurate. Safety based on whole-body, head, and local SAR limits has been effective for the approximately 35-year history of MRI (30, 31). In addition, a vast array of implants and devices potentially used in patients undergoing MRI examinations are classified as "MR Conditional" meaning that they are safe for patients as long as certain specified conditions are followed, which typically include a particular whole-body-averaged SAR level (32). It is of interest that in 2011 the Health Council of the Netherlands decided there was no need to change their electromagnetic field exposure limits from SAR to time-temperature (33). Perhaps CEM43 or something similar might find at least indirect use in studying appropriate RF safety limits for local SAR values.</para>
    <para>Another IEC safety standard, IEC 60601-1, establishes additional safety criteria for medical devices including electrical, mechanical, and thermal safety (34). Surface contact temperatures are limited to 41.0°C (34). Note that during an MRI examination using a high SAR, the average skin temperature of a human subject approaches 37.0°C (for a 4.0°C margin for temperature rise). During an MRI examination using very low SAR, the average skin temperature is typically 33.0°C (for a temperature rise margin of 8.0°C).</para>
    <para>In 2013, the American College of Radiology published a useful paper for MRI safety guidance (35). This paper is not a regulatory document but, instead, it has various recommendations and suggestions for safety procedures for MRI facilities, some of which pertain to the topic of this chapter.</para>
    <para>The Technical Specification, ISO/TS 10974:2011 (36), is a trial standard available for active medical implants to aid in determining whether they are MR Conditional devices. MR Conditional devices are acceptable for patients undergoing MRI examinations only if certain conditions apply. There are also several American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International test standards used to determine safe conditions for use for MR Conditional implants and devices (32, 37-41). Note that the ASTM International heating test implicitly assumes quadrature excitation for the RF energy. Importantly, parallel transmit excitation might produce different heating results.</para>

    <para>The patient's RF power absorption during an MRI procedure can be approximated from quasi static analysis for homogeneous objects, assuming that electric field coupling to the patient can be neglected as well as the RF phase (42, 43). In practice, quasi-static approximations for whole-body SAR in homogeneous spheres appear to be adequate for MR systems operating up to 1.5-T/64-MHz. Calculation of actual SAR levels at 3-T/128-MHz and above, and for local SAR at all static magnetic field strengths and frequencies, requires numerical techniques.

    <para>power absorption during an MRI examination can be approximated from quasi static analysis assuming electric field coupling to patients can be neglected (15, 43, 44). Consider a homogeneous, tissue sphere of radius R. Assume that this sphere is placed in a uniform RF electromagnetic field of strength B<subscript>1</subscript>. The total average RF power, P<subscript>total</subscript>, deposited in the sphere may be expressed as:</para>

    <para>RF energy-induced heating during an MRI procedure is by magnetic induction. Power deposition in homogeneous spheres immersed in uniform RF electromagnetic fields, increases with the fifth power of the radius, R [see Equation (6)]. Because heating is largely peripheral and little deep body heating occurs in a human subject, the body may more easily dissipate the additional heat load. The RF power, P, deposited between a smaller radius, r = α * R (where α&lt;1), and the outer radius, R, normalized to the total power deposited is n:</para>
    <para>n = (P(R) - P(r))/P(R) = (R<superscript>5</superscript> - r<superscript>5</superscript>)/R<superscript>5</superscript> = 1 - α<superscript>5</superscript>                                    (9)</para>
    <para>Equation (8) shows that peak power deposition for homogeneous spheres is 2.5 times the average (15), consistent with the peripheral nature of RF deposition during the MRI examination.

Only that portion of the RF that is circularly polarized in the same sense as the nuclear precession influences the nuclei (Figure 2).

During the MRI examination, transmit RF coils may be driven linearly (linearly polarized RF electromagnetic vector) or they may be driven in quadrature (circularly polarized RF electromagnetic vector).

          <title>SAR "HOT-SPOTS"</title>
    <para>Next, consider localized regions of RF power deposition that might lead to heating, commonly referred to as SAR "hot spots". Inhomogeneities in the electrical properties of tissue may result in high local SAR levels. RF-induced biological effects appear to depend upon temperature rather than on RF power deposition. A region of high local SAR may not be a region of high temperature due to blood flow or diffusion or other cooling mechanisms. The distinction between temperature hot spots and SAR hot spots is often ignored or misunderstood.</para>
    <para>What effect do inhomogeneities have on the distribution of RF power deposition? Using spherical models, Schenck and Hussain (45) demonstrated that production of power deposition "hot spots" depends upon both the dielectric constants and the conductivities of the media. The model was later reformulated and used to investigate several problems involving worst-case conditions and magnitudes of local power deposition (10). Assume that there is a small, homogeneous sphere (sphere 1) with permittivity ε<subscript>1</subscript> and conductivity σ<subscript>1</subscript> (Figure 3). Let sphere 2 be a much larger, homogeneous sphere of "standard tissue" representing the body. Sphere 2 has a permittivity ε<subscript>2</subscript> and conductivity σ<subscript>2</subscript>. Sphere 1 may be placed outside sphere 2 at the pole (tangential electric field location) or at the equator (normal electric field location). In addition, sphere 1 may be placed inside sphere 2. When sphere 1 is placed near the pole of sphere 2, the local power deposition is amplified by a factor, A<subscript>p</subscript>, which may be expressed as:</para>
    <para>A<subscript>p</subscript> = 9(σ<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>ε<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>) / (σ<subscript>1</subscript> + 2σ<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>(ε<subscript>1</subscript> + 2ε<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript>     (11)</para>
    <para>When sphere 1 is placed near the equator of sphere 2, the local power deposition amplification factor, A<subscript>e</subscript>, may be expressed as:</para>
    <para>A<subscript>e</subscript> = 9(σ<subscript>2</subscript><superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>ε<subscript>2</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>) / (σ<subscript>1</subscript> + 2σ<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>(ε<subscript>1</subscript> + 2ε<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript>.     (12)</para>
    <para>Finally, if sphere 1 is placed inside sphere 2, the local power deposition amplification factor, A<subscript>s</subscript>, may be represented as:</para>
    <para>A<subscript>s</subscript> = 9σ<subscript>1</subscript>(σ<subscript>2</subscript><superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>ε<subscript>2</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>) / σ<subscript>2</subscript>((σ<subscript>1</subscript> + 2σ<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>(ε<subscript>1</subscript> + 2ε<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript>) = (σ<subscript>1</subscript>/σ<subscript>2</subscript>)A<subscript>e</subscript>     (13)</para>
    <para>All the terms in equations (11), (12), and (13) are positive. The electrical properties of sphere 1 are treated as variables so conditions for maximum amplification of local power deposition may be determined.</para>
    <para>When sphere 1 is near the pole, amplification of local power deposition, A<subscript>p</subscript>, is greatest when sphere 1 is a perfect conductor (σ<subscript>1</subscript> ≈ ∞). A perfectly conducting small sphere at the pole will result in a local amplification factor of A<subscript>p</subscript> = 9. Recall that the spatial peak SAR in a homogeneous sphere is already 2.5 times average SAR for the sphere. Combining these results, the peak SAR at the pole is 22.5 times the SAR averaged over sphere 2. Conductive leads (e.g., used with electrocardiogram monitoring equipment) placed in contact with the skin of patients may simulate this situation. Note that there is almost no amplification of local power deposition if sphere 1 is a radius or more from sphere 2. Spacing conductors well away from patients can dramatically reduce the local heating potential.</para>
    <para>Assume sphere 1 is placed near the equator of sphere 2. Then the greatest amplification of local power deposition takes place when sphere 1 electrical properties are minimal; i.e., σ<subscript>1</subscript> = 0 and ε<subscript>1</subscript> = ε<subscript>0</subscript> (free space value). So for a void, such as an air bubble, A<subscript>e</subscript> = 2.25. Fat or bone at the equator produces slightly smaller amplifications (10, 37). When a low conductivity sphere is located near the outer edge of the equator of a large (conductive) sphere, the local SAR is highest and is limited to 5.625 times the average SAR.</para>
    <para>Finally, assume sphere 1 is placed inside the large sphere. This situation may simulate an implanted prostheses. While local SAR is amplified the most when σ<subscript>1</subscript> = 2σ<subscript>2</subscript> and ε<subscript>1</subscript> = 2ε<subscript>2</subscript> (not a likely situation), the amplification factor is only A<subscript>s</subscript> = 1.125. The highest local SAR works out to 2.8125 times the local average SAR.</para>

Note that the electric fields reach their maximum magnitude at the coil and fall to zero along the coil axis. Capacitors along the coil wall also give rise to high electric fields, locally. Any conductors should be routed along regions of the low electric field or orthogonal to the electric field to prevent problems or issues.</para>
  <para>The analyses above assume linearly polarized RF magnetic fields. Notably, if the transmit RF coil produces quadrature excitation, then the amplification of local power deposition is reduced. The reduction in local power deposition results from rotating eddy current loops during quadrature excitation. Sphere 1 alternates between the equator and the pole of the larger sphere during quadrature excitation. So, worst-case quadrature local SAR amplification (assuming inhomogeneous biology) is 0.5 * (2.5 + 2.8125) = 2.66. For maximum SAR amplification at the equator, the electrical properties of sphere 1 approach those of a void.</para>
    <para>Similarly, for an infinitely conducting sphere 1, during quadrature RF excitation, the worst-case local power deposition amplification would be 0.5 * (2.5 + 22.5) = 12.5. However, the presence of a conductor may complicate the production of a perfect quadrature RF field by setting up difficult boundary conditions.</para>
    <para>Currently, many useful electromagnetic simulation packages are commercially available that can calculate whole-body average, head average, partial body average, and local SAR (averaged over the worst-case contiguous 10-grams).

    <para>Receive-only RF coils, including most surface coils, typically use transmit body RF coils to transmit RF excitation pulses. Receive-only coils are resonant during RF reception. However, if these RF coils were resonant during transmission of RF energy, then large currents may be produced in the receive-only coils. These large currents would, by Lenz's law, induce opposing RF magnetic fields. Flip angle profiles could be altered by the opposing RF magnetic fields, degrading image quality. The opposing RF magnetic fields may induce large electric fields in the body leading to large local SAR levels. Manufacturers use high impedance blocking networks to detune surface coils and limit surface coil current during body coil transmit (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>If conductive loops (e.g., associated with the use of monitoring equipment or even a coiled transmission line) are introduced into the MR system, high local SAR levels may result (39, 40) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>).

    <para>The SAR required for a 1°C temperature rise in various organs may be estimated using Equation (14). Blood flow rates per unit mass vary from 128-ml/kg/min for the cutaneous circulation to 4200-ml/kg/min for the kidneys. Table 1 lists local SAR levels required to produce a local temperature rise of one degree C for various organs (23). Table 1 demonstrates the homogenizing property of blood flow to limit temperature "hot-spots" in the body. Resulting steady-state (maximum) temperature rises for each organ exposed locally to 4-W/kg is also presented in Table 1. Athey (53) has shown similar theoretical results demonstrating that significant thermal "hot spots" are not probable for typical head exposures.</para>

        <title>TRANSMIT/RECEIVE SURFACE COILS AND LOCAL SAR</title>
    <para>Planar, surface transmit RF coils are often used in MR spectroscopy studies. The primary safety concern with transmit/receive surface coils involves local SAR issues. While it is straightforward to calculate local RF power deposition in volume transmit RF coils, estimation of spatial peak specific absorption rate (SAR) for planar transmit surface coils is complex. To prevent excessive local RF power deposition, it is imperative to at least estimate an upper bound for the local SAR. The local SAR is highest near the coil conductors. For such cases, simplifying assumptions may be made to calculate appropriate design limits (55). Assume there is an anti-parallel pair of infinitely long conductors of width, d, with a return a distance 2 * a<subscript>1</subscript> apart. Schenck, et al. (56) showed that the in-plane magnetic vector potential at a distance r from one conductor for the case where d &lt;&lt; a<subscript>1</subscript> (and where quasi-static conditions apply) may be expressed as:</para>
    <para>A<subscript>z</subscript> = (μ<subscript>0</subscript>I/4πd)[4π(a<subscript>1</subscript> - r) + 4r tan<superscript>-1</superscript>(2r/d) - 4(2a<subscript>1</subscript> - r)tan<superscript>-1</superscript>(2(2a<subscript>1</subscript> - r)/d) + d ln(4(2a<subscript>1</subscript> - r)<superscript>2</superscript> + d<superscript>2</superscript>/4r<superscript>2</superscript> + d<superscript>2</superscript>)]  (22)</para>
    <para>The local SAR may be calculated by inserting A<subscript>z</subscript> from Equation (22) into Equation (5). It is necessary to scale current to levels that produce the desired B<subscript>1</subscript> at the desired location. Equations (2) and (22) may be used to find B<subscript>1</subscript>:</para>
  <para>Figure 9. Normalized local SAR and B<subscript>1</subscript> versus distance for a circular RF coil. B<subscript>1</subscript> is calculated along the coil axis. The local SAR is calculated from under the coil conductor.</para>

In Figure 9, normalized B<subscript>1</subscript> and normalized local SAR are plotted against the normalized distance from a planar, circular coil. A seven-fold reduction in local SAR may be achieved at the expense of a 5% reduction in B<subscript>1</subscript>. Equations (5), (22), and (23) should permit coil designers to theoretically estimate the local SAR. Quasi-static calculations could also be done using Equations (1) through (5).</para>

        <title>MEASUREMENT OF LOCAL SAR IN PHANTOMS</title>
    <para>It is possible to experimentally measure local SAR in phantoms using materials with electrical properties and density similar to muscle (24, 57-59). To accomplish this, it is useful to use fiber-optic (non-conductive) temperature probes under the transmit RF coil conductors in contact with the tissue-phantom and thermally isolated from the RF coil. The local SAR may be calculated from the early (linear) portion of the heating curve:</para>
    <para>SAR = C dT/dt     (24)</para>
    <para>In the equation above, C is the specific heat of the tissue and T is the temperature. Equation (24) is expressed in MKS units. Other loss mechanisms (convection, radiation, and conduction) must be minimized during the experiment. Convection may be limited by using a gel-filled phantom (49). Conduction losses may be minimized by keeping materials insulated and by starting with the coil and the "tissue/phantom" at room temperature.</para>

        <title>SAFETY CONSIDERATION OF RECEIVE-ONLY RF SURFACE COILS</title>
    <para>Exceptionally large surface coil currents may flow if receive-only RF surface coils were resonant while RF excitation pulses are played out on the transmit body RF coil (59-61). These currents may result in extremely high local SAR levels near the surface coil. In addition, the surface coil reaction currents would destroy B<subscript>1</subscript> homogeneity, by generating opposing magnetic fields. To prevent such problems, a blocking network in the surface coil presents a high impedance to limit surface coil currents during RF excitation (Figure 5). The blocking impedance required depends on the area of the RF coil, frequency, and how large an opposing field is to be allowed. Typical blocking impedances are a few hundred ohms. Note that in the case of phased array receive coils, special care must be exercised to avoid the development of high local electric fields from differential voltages on adjacent conductors.</para>
    <para>Unfortunately, surface coil blocking networks may become warm. IEC 60601-1 sets a surface temperature limit (T<subscript>limit</subscript> = 41°C) for objects that may touch human subjects (34). Skin temperature under normal, non-MRI or low SAR conditions is approximately 33.0°C. However, during an MRI procedure involving a high SAR level, skin blood vessels dilate, the cutaneous circulation increases, and skin temperatures may approach the level of the core temperature. In tests with phantoms initially at ambient temperature, a 4.0°C rise should be the limit for systems capable of high SAR. For low SAR systems, the surface coil temperature rise may be limited to 8.0°C above ambient temperature.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">POTENTIAL MECHANISMS FOR RF BIOEFFECTS</emphasis></para>
    <para>Thermal effects arise from the temperature dependence of most biological functions. Chemical reaction rates approximately double with each 10°C rise in temperature (62). Protein denaturation takes place at temperatures of approximately 45°C (18). The fluidity of cell membranes is also affected by temperature. Thermal effects may be caused by whole body heating of the organism or by localized heating of tissues. During an MRI examination, while only the body parts inside of the transmit RF coil are exposed to RF power deposition, the entire body may be affected by thermal reactions.</para>
    <para>The mechanisms behind non thermal effects are unclear. The energy of a single photon at 85-MHz or 2-Tesla is 5.304 x 10<superscript>26</superscript> Joules (63). The energy of chemical bonds is much larger. In fact, even relatively weak hydrogen bonds between groups in protein structures have energies of 3.125 x 10<superscript>20</superscript> Joules (62). Notably, thermal energy at body temperature is 4.28 x 10<superscript>21</superscript> Joules, five orders of magnitude greater than the energy of RF photons at 2-Tesla (85-MHz).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">LITERATURE REVIEW: THERMAL PHYSICS AND PHYSIOLOGY</emphasis></para>
    <para>RF fields are too high in frequency to electrically stimulate excitable tissues (64). Thus, as previously mentioned, the only well-established mechanism for RF energy-related bioeffects is heating (18). Guy, et al. (65) showed that the SAR threshold for cataractogenesis is 100-W/kg. The highest safe core temperature for workers is considered to be 39.4°C (24, 66, 67). The threshold core temperature for teratogenic effects in pregnant women is 38.9°C (60). During the day, core temperature fluctuates approximately 1°C or more (17, 68). Skin temperature fluctuates over a range of 15°C (17). The skin pain threshold is 43°C (69). Finally, the resting metabolic rate is 1.3-W/kg, while during vigorous exercise, in highly trained athletes, may be as high as 18-W/kg (24).</para>
    <para>Consider an insulated tissue section. In one hour, the insulated tissue will, when exposed to an SAR of 1.0-W/kg, rise approximately 1.0°C. Insulated tissue would rise to infinite temperature in infinite time at any finite SAR. In use, physiologic heat dissipation mechanisms of the human body limit temperature rise to a steady-state value. A body, whose outer surface temperature, T<subscript>os</subscript>, is warmer than the ambient temperature, T<subscript>a</subscript>, will radiate to the surroundings (17). When exposed to RF power deposition, the body temperature will increase until steady-state conditions prevail. In a steady state, the body dissipates energy to the environment at the same rate that it gains energy from RF power deposition. Temperature in-</para>

    <para>In equation (25), τ is a constant, ΔT, is the temperature rise at any time, t, and ΔT<subscript>0</subscript> , is the steady state temperature rise.

    <para>Consider a hypothetical, uninsulated human subject (70-kg) who is constrained to lose energy to the environment only by radiation. Assume that the ambient temperature is 25°C</para>
    <para>and the thermal neutral (steady state) temperature of the skin is 33 °C. In a steady state, the hypothetical human would radiate about 1.4-W/kg, which is replaced by his own metabolic energy at the same rate. The result is no change in deep body or core temperature.</para>
    <para>Next consider the same hypothetical human, but this time the skin temperature has risen to 38°C (vasodilatation of skin blood vessels may permit the skin to reach core temperature). Now the hypothetical human radiates energy at a rate of 2.4-W/kg, 1-W/kg above his metabolic rate. This hypothetical human might experience a 1.0°C rise in temperature in one hour when exposed to 2-W/kg, demonstrating the importance of ambient temperature to the core temperature rise.</para>
    <para>Adair and Berglund (70, 71) utilized a mathematical thermal model of the body, based on the Gagge model (72), to predict the effects of SAR, ambient temperature, impairment of blood flow, relative humidity, clothing, and scan time on core temperature rise. Their summarized results can be approximated with a simple program (71). The Adair program was used to predict the effect of ambient temperature on core temperature rise (10) (Figure 10). For the plot, it was assumed that clothing = 0.2 clo, relative humidity was 50%, blood flow impairment was 40%, and the scan duration was 60 minutes. A 40% reduction in cardiac output is life threatening (73). From the plot, it is evident that an exposure to 4-W/kg for an hour should result in only a 1°C core temperature rise when T<subscript>a</subscript> = 19°C. However, if T<subscript>a</subscript> = 25°C, then 3-W/kg is needed. A one hour exposure to 1 W/kg even at T<subscript>a</subscript> = 27°C should result in no temperature rise. Of course, ambient temperature plays an important role in core temperature rise.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</emphasis>A variety of physical factors affect the manner in which the RF fields used for MRI examinations impact patients. Both whole body and localized depositions of RF energy may result in tissue heating. In consideration of this primary safety concern, regulatory agencies have provided guidelines based on whole-body-averaged and/or peak SARs to ensure the safe operation of MR systems. In this chapter, various techniques of calculating and estimating SARs associated with MRI procedures have been described. Additionally, there has been a discussion of the possible mechanisms responsible for observed RF bioeffects and a review of the thermal physics and mathematical models used to predict human thermal responses to absorption of RF energy. This work served as the basis for characterizing the RF fields used during MRI examinations and helps to estimate the thermophysiologic alterations in patients.</para>

    <para>Radiofrequency (RF) energy is nonionizing, electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range of 20-kHz to 3,000-GHz (1-7). The RF spectrum includes radar, ultra high frequency (UHF), and very high frequency (VHF) television, AM and FM radio, and microwave communication frequencies. During magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), most of the transmitted radiofrequency (RF) power is transformed into heat within the patient's tissue as a result the induction of eddy currents due to the nonzero conductivity of tissue via Faraday's law. Not surprisingly, the primary health effects and safety concerns associated with RF energy-induced heating are directly related to the thermogenic qualities of this electromagnetic field (1-58). The deposition of thermalizing energy in the human body by exposure to RF fields provides a unique exception to the energy flows normally encountered by human subjects.</para>
    <para>Research investigations conducted over the last several decades have indicated that exposure to RF radiation may produce a variety of physiologic effects including those associated with alterations in visual, auditory, endocrine, neural, cardiovascular, immune, reproductive, and developmental function (1-50). In general, these biological changes occur due to RF-induced heating. Exposure to RF energy may also cause athermal, field-specific changes in biological systems that are produced without an increase in temperature (59-62). However, athermal effects associated with RF radiation are not well understood and, to date, have not been systematically studied with respect to MRI.</para>

        <title>Radiofrequency-Energy Induced Heating During MRI</title>
    <para>Prior to 1985, there were no published reports pertaining to the effects of exposing human subjects to RF energy during MRI examinations. In fact, there was a general paucity of quantitative data on thermal and other physiological responses of human subjects exposed to RF radiation from any source. The previous investigations that were conducted on this topic typically examined responses to therapeutic applications of diathermy or thermal sensations related to exposure to RF radiation (38-45). Because localized or limited exposures to RF energy were unlike the conditions that occur during MRI, the information gained from the prior studies could not be used to derive an understanding or prediction of what to expect with respect to the use of MRI technology. Therefore, to properly characterize the thermophysiological aspects of RF energy, investigations were conducted using laboratory animals, volunteer subjects, and patients (8, 9, 12-19, 24, 25, 27-37, 51-54). The resulting research yielded extremely useful and important data with regard to thermoregulatory responses to RF radiation-induced heating associated with MRI.</para>
    <para>This chapter will review and discuss the various aspects of RF energy-induced heating during MRI with an emphasis on the studies performed in human subjects to assess thermal and other physiologic responses.

          <title>MRI PROCEDURES AND SPECIFIC ABSORPTION RATE</title>
    <para>The thermoregulatory and other physiologic changes that a laboratory animal or human subject exhibits in response to exposure to RF radiation are directly dependent on the amount of energy that is absorbed (1-7, 22-26, 29, 31, 37, 49). The basic dosimetric term used to describe the absorption of RF radiation is the specific absorption rate, or SAR. The SAR is the mass normalized rate at which RF power is coupled to biological tissue and is typically indicated in units of watts per kilogram (W/kg).</para>
    <para>The relative amount of RF radiation that an organism encounters during an MRI examination is usually characterized with respect to the whole-body averaged and peak SAR levels (i.e., the SAR averaged in one-gram of tissue). In some instances, other values may also be reported by the MR system, including the "local" body SAR. Importantly, SAR information is used by regulatory agencies with regard to safety guidelines for the exposure to RF energy during MRI and has particular relevance with respect to scanning patients with medical implants.</para>
    <para>Notably, measurements or estimates of SAR are not trivial, particularly in human subjects (1-3, 6, 10, 49, 63). Several methods exist to determine this parameter for the purpose of RF energy dosimetry in association with the use of MRI. The SAR that is produced during MRI is a complex function of numerous variables including the frequency (i.e., determined by the strength of the static magnetic field, with resonant frequencies producing the greatest effects), the type of RF pulse used (e.g., 90° vs. 180° pulse), the repetition time, the type of transmit RF coil used (e.g., linear vs. circularly-polarized or quadrature transmission, transmit whole body vs. local RF coil, etc.), the volume of tissue contained within the RF coil, the shape of the anatomical region exposed, the orientation of the body to the field vectors, as well as other factors (1-3, 6, 10, 49, 63). Therefore, SAR, being a critical parameter that</para>

Interestingly, MR system manufacturers appear to apply various safety or modeling factors to the SAR values reported by their scanners. Thus, manufacturers err on the side of safety when estimating SAR values for clinical MRI (10, 49).</para>

        <title>RF ENERGY-INDUCED HEATING AND MRI: EVALUATION OF LABORATORY ANIMALS</title>
    <para>Although there have been several studies performed using laboratory animals to assess thermoregulatory reactions to tissue heating associated with exposure to RF radiation, these experiments do not directly apply to the specific conditions that occur with MRI. Furthermore, the results of these investigations cannot be easily extrapolated to provide useful information for human subjects (1-5, 38, 47, 64). For example, the pattern of RF coupling and resulting absorption of RF energy to biological tissues is primarily dependent on the organism's size, anatomical features, the duration of exposure, the sensitivity of the involved tissues, and a myriad of other variables (1-5, 38, 47, 64).</para>
    <para>Importantly, it is well known that there is no laboratory animal that sufficiently mimics or simulates the thermoregulatory responses with respect to the dimensions, anatomical features, and specific responses that occur in human subjects. Therefore, experimental results obtained in laboratory animals cannot be simply "scaled" or extrapolated to predict thermoregulatory or other physiologic changes in human subjects exposed to RF radiation-induced heating during MRI. Nevertheless, experiments have been conducted in the MRI environment using laboratory animals as an initial step to determine the effects of RF energy-induced heating associated with exposures to high SAR levels (19, 27, 51-54).</para>
    <para>Shuman, et al. (19) studied laboratory dogs undergoing MRI at relatively high levels of RF energy. Superficial- and deep-tissue temperatures were measured in five animals before, during, and after exposure to RF energy determine whether significant temperature changes could be produced in association with operation of a 1.5-T/64-MHz MR system (19). The RF power output that was applied in this investigation was 6.3 times that required for routine MRI exams, with calculated SARs that averaged 7.9-W/kg (19). Shuman, et al. (19) reported that there was a linear temperature increase of several degrees, with a maximal average temperature rise of 4.6°C that was measured in the urinary bladder (i.e., a "deep" body site). Overall, the temperature elevations were slightly greater in deeper tissues compared to those recorded in superficial tissues. Shuman, et al. (19) stated that these findings suggested continued caution in the design and operation of MR systems that were capable of depositing high SAR levels, particularly when the scanners were used to image infants or patients with altered thermoregulatory capabilities.</para>
    <para>While the results of Shuman, et al. (19) are intriguing, it should be noted that this study was conducted in anesthetized laboratory animals. As such, the findings do not pertain to conscious, adult human subjects because of the previously discussed factors related to the physical dimensions of the animals and the fact that anesthetic agents substantially impact thermoregulation (65, 66). Additionally, the thermoregulatory systems of these two species are quite dissimilar (e.g., the dog pants to dissipate heat while human subjects sweat). Nev-</para>
    <para>ertheless, data obtained by Shuman, et al. (19) may have implications for the use of MRI in pediatric patients because this patient population is typically sedated or anesthetized and the physical dimensions of the laboratory dog are somewhat comparable to a pediatric patient.</para>
    <para>Barber, et al. (27) also conducted a study to determine the effects of heating related to MRI. The objective of their investigation was to provide a worst-case estimate of the thermal effects of MRI by subjecting anesthetized, unshorn sheep to RF power deposition at SAR levels well above approved standards for periods of time in excess of normal clinical imaging protocols (27). The sheep underwent MRI using a 1.5-Tesla, 64-MHz MR system. A control period with no RF power was followed by experiments using 20- to 105-minutes of RF power applications. Afterward, there was a 20-minute or longer recovery period with no RF energy applied to the sheep. Eight sheep were scanned at whole-body averaged SARs that ranged from 1.5- to 4.0-W/kg while rectal and skin temperatures were monitored. In addition to the whole-body RF exposures, Barber, et al. (27) subjected four sheep to MRI exams involving the head to determine the effects of RF energy-induced heating of the brain. The average scan time was 75-minutes and temperatures of the cornea, vitreous humor, scalp skin, jugular vein, and rectum were measured during the experiment.</para>
    <para>In the whole-body exposure experiments, elevation of rectal temperature was correlated with RF energy deposition. Deep body temperature rises in excess of 2°C were attained for the whole-body averaged SAR level of 4.0-W/kg during exposure periods greater than 82-minutes. In the head scanning experiments, skin and eye temperatures increased approximately 1.5°C. Additionally, jugular vein temperature increased a maximum of 0.4°C after an average exposure time of 75-minutes. Sheep exposed for 40-minutes to an SAR of 4.0-W/kg in either the transmit body RF coil (three sheep) or transmit head RF coil (two sheep) were recovered and observed to be in good health after 10 weeks. Importantly, no cataracts were found in the sheep (27). Thus, using this animal model, Barber, et al. (27) concluded that RF power deposition at SAR levels well above typical clinical MRI protocols caused various tissue temperatures to increase. Furthermore, for exposure periods in excess of standard clinical MRI protocols, the temperature increases were insufficient to cause adverse thermal effects (27).</para>
    <para>Shrivastava, et al. (51) investigated RF field-induced heating of the head at 9.4-Tesla in anesthetized swine. Temperatures were measured at three depths: inside the brain, in the rectum, and at the scalp skin of the swine. A 400-MHz, continuous wave RF power was deposited to the head using a volume coil. The whole-head averaged SAR values were varied between 2.7- to 5.8-W/kg. The RF power exposure durations were varied between 1.4 to 3.7 hours. In order to differentiate the temperature response caused by the RF energy from that associated with the anesthesia, temperatures were recorded in four "unheated" swine. The findings demonstrated that in vivo brain temperatures correlated well with the average SAR values. Furthermore, the skin temperature changes were not the maximum temperature alterations that were recorded, the RF energy heating caused an inhomogeneous brain temperature distribution, and the maximum temperature occurred inside the brain (51). While interesting, these findings only have relevance to MRI-related heating at 9.4-Tesla/400-MHz.</para>
    <para>In another study by Shrivastava, et al. (52) that was also conducted in swine at 9.4-Tesla/400-MHz, temperatures were measured in the scalp skin, brain, and rectum. "Sham RF" was delivered to three swine to understand the thermal effects of anesthesia. Continuous wave RF energy was delivered to six animals for 2.5 to 3.4 hours. The whole-head averaged SAR varied between 2.71-W/kg and 3.20-W/kg. Anesthesia caused the brain and rectal temperatures to decrease in a linear manner. Altered thermoregulatory responses were detected by comparing the differences in the temperature slopes before and after the delivery of RF energy. RF-induced heating significantly altered the rate of cooling down of the animal. The temperature slope changes correlated well with the RF energy per unit head weight and the duration of heating, as well as the maximum rectal temperature change during heating. Again, these results apply only to MRI-related heating at 9.4-Tesla/400-MHz.</para>
    <para>Shrivastava, et al. (53) also investigated RF heating in a porcine model at 7-Tesla/298-MHz. Temperatures were measured in the scalp skin, brain, and rectum in four pigs exposed to continuous wave RF. The RF power was delivered to the pig's head for approximately 3 hours at a whole-head averaged SAR of approximately 3-W/kg. Simple bioheat transfer models were used to simulate the RF power induced temperature changes. The results indicated that the RF power produced uniform temperature changes in the heads of the pigs with no plateau achieved during heating. The researchers concluded that validated bioheat models may predict accurate temperature changes related to RF energy-induced heating of the head. Since 7-Tesla MR systems are presently used in research and clinical settings, this information is of interest to the MRI community.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CHARACTERISTICS OF RF ENERGY-INDUCED HEATING: IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN SUBJECTS</emphasis>The physical dimensions and anatomic configurations of biologic tissues in relation to the incident wavelength are important factors that determine the relative amount and pattern of RF energy that is absorbed by the human body (1-5, 38, 47, 64). For example, if the size of the tissue is large in relation to the incident wavelength, RF energy is predominantly absorbed on the surface. If it is small relative to the wavelength, there is little absorption of RF power and, thus, the effects of heating are minimized (1-5, 38, 47, 64).</para>
    <para>As previously mentioned, tissue heating that results from the RF energy used during MRI is primarily caused by magnetic induction, with a negligible contribution from the electric fields (10, 49). Because of the RF frequencies used for MRI, this ohmic tissue heating is greatest at the surface or periphery and minimal at the center of a human subject's body. Predictive calculations and measurements obtained in phantoms, laboratory animals, and human subjects exposed to various MRI conditions support this pattern of temperature distribution (14-36, 50, 51).</para>
    <para>The actual increase in tissue temperature caused by exposure to RF energy is dependent on a variety of factors related to the thermoregulatory system of the individual and the surrounding environment (1-5, 8-38, 44-55). In regards to the thermoregulatory system, when subjected to a thermal challenge, the human body loses heat by means of convection, conduction, radiation, and evaporation (38, 67-70). Each mechanism is responsible to a varying degree for heat dissipation, as the body attempts to maintain thermal homeostasis. If the</para>
    <para>thermoregulatory effectors are not capable of totally dissipating the heat load, heat accumulates and is stored, resulting in an elevation in local and/or overall tissue temperatures (38, 67-70).</para>
    <para>Underlying health conditions may seriously impact an individual's ability to tolerate a thermal challenge. These conditions include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, fever, old age, and obesity (71-78). Various medications (e.g., diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium blockers, vasodilators, amphetamines, muscle relaxers, sedatives, anesthetic agents, etc.) can also greatly alter thermoregulatory responses to a heat load (65, 66). In fact, certain medications may have a synergistic effect with respect to tissue heating if the thermal load is specifically caused by exposure to RF radiation (65).</para>
    <para>The environmental conditions that exist in and around the MR system will also affect temperature elevations associated with RF energy-induced heating. Thus, during MRI, the amount of tissue heating that occurs is dependent upon environmental factors that include the ambient temperature, relative humidity, and airflow within and through the bore of the scanner.</para>
    <para>With further regard to the environmental conditions of the MR system, it has been proposed that, in order to counterbalance excessive tissue heating that may occur during exposure to high levels of RF energy, patients should be "pre-cooled" before their MRI exams. However, the subjective perception to the environmental temperature depends on the gradient of temperature that is sensed by the individual's peripheral thermoreceptors such as those located throughout the skin and superficial tissues. Therefore, a patient going from a cooler (i.e., using a "pre-cooled" room) to a warmer environment (i.e., the MR system) would very likely be uncomfortable.</para>

        <title>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE EVALUATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES DURING RF ENERGY-INDUCED HEATING</title>
    <para>Acquiring measurements of temperature and other physiologic parameters in human subjects within the harsh electromagnetic environment of the MR system is not a simple task. The static magnetic field of the MR system can easily create missiles out of conventional monitoring devices because they usually contain ferromagnetic components (79-82). Furthermore, the static, time-varying gradient, and RF electromagnetic fields may adversely interfere with the proper operation of monitoring equipment. In turn, the measurement devices may produce subtle or substantial artifacts by generating electromagnetic interference that can impact the quality of the MR images. Therefore, temperature recording devices and physiologic monitors must be specially designed or modified and then rigorously tested prior to use in the MRI setting. Otherwise, the data pertaining to thermal and other physiologic responses may be erroneous and misleading. Another solution to this important matter is to simply use MR Conditional monitoring equipment that has been thoroughly tested and demonstrated to work appropriately in the MR system room.</para>
    <para>Currently, MR Conditional temperature recording devices and physiologic monitors, as well as other patient support devices are commercially available for use in the MRI environment. Every physiologic parameter that is typically recorded in the critical care area</para>

    <para>or operating room setting may be obtained during MRI, including heart rate, oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, respiratory rate, blood pressure, cutaneous blood flow and, most importantly, body and skin temperatures (79-83).</para>
    <para>For the assessment of thermal responses during MRI, volunteer subjects and patients have been monitored throughout the experimental procedures using several different types of devices (9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 24-36, 79-84). For example, sublingual pocket or tympanic membrane temperatures have been obtained immediately before and after MRI using sensitive electronic thermometry or infrared devices. Notably, there is a good relationship between temperatures measured in the sublingual pocket or tympanic membrane and esophageal temperature, which is an indicator of core or "deep" temperature.</para>
    <para>Skin temperatures have been measured immediately before and after MRI examinations using highly sensitive and accurate infrared thermometry or digital thermographic equipment (9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 24, 25, 31). Body and skin temperatures measured at multiple sites have been recorded before, during, and after MRI using a fluoroptic (i.e., fiber-optic) thermometry system that is unperturbed by electromagnetic radiation of all types, including static magnetic fields of up to 9.0-Tesla (9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 24, 25, 31, 83). Heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and cutaneous blood flow, which are important physiological variables that change in human subjects in response to a thermal load, have been monitored before, during, and after MRI to assess the reaction of the thermoregulatory system to exposures to RF energy-induced heating. All of these parameters may be assessed using devices that have been extensively tested and demonstrated to provide sensitive and accurate data in the MRI environment.</para>

          <title>RF ENERGY-INDUCED HEATING AND MRI: ASSESSMENT OF VOLUNTEER SUBJECTS AND PATIENTS</title>
    <para>As previously described in this chapter, the increase in tissue temperature caused by exposure to RF energy during MRI depends on multiple physical, physiological, and environmental factors. These include the rate at which RF energy is deposited, the status of the patient's thermoregulatory system, the presence of an underlying health condition or medications, and the ambient conditions within the MR system.</para>
    <para>Although the main cause of tissue heating associated with MRI is attributed to RF radiation, reports have suggested that exposure to powerful static magnetic fields may also cause temperature changes (85, 86). However, the mechanism responsible for such an effect remains unclear. Nevertheless, the results of these previously published studies warranted investigations in human subjects to determine the possible contribution of the static magnetic field to temperature changes that may be observed during MRI (87-89).</para>
    <para>Studies have been performed in human subjects exposed to a 1.5-Tesla static magnetic field to evaluate thermal alterations produced in body and/or skin temperatures (87, 88). The data revealed that there were no statistically significant alterations in any of the recorded tissue temperature or other physiologic parameter. Chakeres, et al.

    <para>dents exposed to static magnetic fields of as high as 7.55-Tesla and also reported no thermal effect. Accordingly, static magnetic fields used for clinical and research applications do not cause an elevation in body temperature. As far as the potential for the production of heat by time-varying gradient magnetic fields is concerned, an elevation in tissue temperature is not believed to occur due to MRI (15, 19, 20, 22).</para>
    <para>With respect to the effects of RF energy-induced heating, Schaefer, et al. (8) conducted the first study of human thermal responses associated with MRI in 1985. It should be realized that, during this time, the whole-body averaged SAR recommended by the United Kingdom, National Radiological Protection Board and the United States, Food and Drug Administration for clinical MRI was 0.4-W/kg (91, 92), which is an order of magnitude lower than what it is today (93, 94). Temperature changes and other physiologic parameters were assessed in volunteer subjects exposed to relatively high, whole-body averaged SAR levels (approximately 4.0-W/kg). The findings indicated that there were no excessive temperature elevations or other deleterious physiologic consequences related to exposure to RF radiation (8).</para>
    <para>Several studies were subsequently conducted involving volunteer subjects and patients undergoing MRI at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz with the intent of obtaining information that would be applicable to the patient population typically encountered in the MRI setting (12, 13, 15-18, 24, 25, 28, 30-36). The whole-body averaged SAR levels ranged from approximately 0.05-W/kg (e.g., for MRI exams involving the use of a transmit/receive head RF coil) to 6.0-W/kg (e.g., for MRI exams involving the spine or abdomen with a transmit/receive body RF coil), which greatly exceeds the limit for the whole-body averaged SAR of 4.0-W/kg (12, 13, 15-18, 24, 25, 28, 30-36, 93, 94). By way of example, Figure 1 shows the body and skin temperature changes related to MRI performed at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz and a whole-body averaged SAR of 2.8-W/kg.</para>
    <para>Boss, et al. (32) conducted one of the few investigations that addressed heating at 3-Tesla/128-MHz in human subjects. Eighteen volunteers were divided into three groups: those that underwent MRI of the (1) head, (2) pelvis, or (3) knee. MRI was performed up to the First Level Controlled Operating Mode, allowing RF radiation up to the legal limit for the whole-body averaged SAR (i.e., 4.0-W/kg). Temperature changes were measured using a fiber-optic thermometer and an infrared camera. Temperature rises were highest for the scans involving the pelvis compared to the head and knee. There were no significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure. The authors concluded that MRI at 3-Tesla/128-MHz resulted in measurable and perceptible thermal energy deposition. However, under the conditions of the study, the physiological changes were regarded as safe concerning thermoregulatory and cardiovascular stress.</para>
    <para>Isaacson, et al. (33) determined core body temperature (i.e., temporal artery temperature) variations in a large group of pediatric patients (N = 400) that underwent MRI on 1.5-Tesla or 3-Tesla scanners, with and without propofol sedation. For patients with complete pre- and post-MRI temperature data, mean temperatures did not significantly change. However, temperature changes differed significantly between propofol-sedated and non-sedated patients (i.e., non-sedated patients had slightly higher temperatures). Patients scanned at 3-Tesla had statistically higher temperature changes compared to those scanned at 1.5-Tesla.</para>

After MRI, some skin temperatures returned to the baseline level, whereas others remained elevated during the 20-min post-MRI evaluation period.</para>
  <para>In another investigation involving pediatric patients imaged at 3-Tesla, Cawley, et al. (34) recorded rectal temperatures in 25 neonates that underwent MRI of the brain and reported no significant "hyperthermic threat".</para>

Rectal and skin temperatures, oxygen saturation and heart rate were recorded before, during, and after the scans. There was a statistically significant increase in skin temperature, while there was no significant change in rectal temperature, heart rate or oxygen saturation. The investigators concluded that core temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation in newborns were not affected by 3-T MRI of the brain.</para>
    <para>Kim, et al. (35) investigated the relationship between the increase in body temperature and the RF power deposited during routine clinical MRI exams of the head at 1.5-Tesla and 3-Tesla. Tympanic membrane temperature was recorded in 69 patients immediately before and after MRI. The findings indicated a link between increasing age and body temperature, as well as an influence of the field strength of the MRI exam. Thus, a higher increase in body temperature was observed in older patients after a 3-Tesla MRI procedure compared to a 1.5-Tesla scan.</para>
    <para>To date, the studies performed in human subjects demonstrated that changes in body temperatures were physiologically inconsequential (i.e., less than 1.0°C). While there was a tendency for statistically significant increases in skin temperatures to occur, these were not physiologically deleterious or otherwise problematic. Furthermore, there were no sub-</para>
    <para>stantial alterations in the hemodynamic parameters that were assessed during these investigations (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, and cutaneous blood flow).</para>
    <para>Interestingly, research has indicated that there is a poor correlation between changes in body and skin temperatures versus whole-body averaged SARs for clinical MRI exams <emphasis role="bold">(Figure 2)</emphasis>. This finding is not surprising considering the previously mentioned myriad of variables that may alter thermal responses in a patient population. Therefore, the thermal responses to a given whole-body averaged SAR may be extremely variable depending on the individual's thermoregulatory system and the presence of one or more underlying condition(s) that can alter or impair the ability to dissipate heat, as well as the environmental conditions of the MR system room.</para>
    <para>Presently, the highest level of exposure to RF energy that has been reported for human subjects undergoing MRI is a whole-body averaged SAR of 6.0-W/kg (31). In this investigation, Shellock, et al. (31) conducted experiments involving volunteer subjects to characterize thermal and other physiologic responses to this high level of RF energy. The motivation for this study coincided with the advent of pulse sequences that had relatively high SAR levels associated with their use.</para>
    <para>The temperature of the tympanic membrane (i.e., an index of deep body temperature) and seven different skin temperatures were monitored along with blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and cutaneous blood flow <emphasis role="bold">(Figure 3)</emphasis>(31). Measurements were obtained immediately before, during, and after exposure to RF energy. Statistically significant increases in the temperatures of the tympanic membrane and the skin of the chest, abdomen, upper arm, hand, and thigh occurred. In addition, there were statistically significant increases in heart rate and cutaneous blood flow associated with exposure to the high SAR level. Importantly, the tissue temperature increases were within acceptable, safe levels and none of the other physiological changes were considered to be deleterious to human subjects. Of particular note is that these data indicated that an MRI exam performed at a whole-body averaged SAR of 6.0-W/kg can be tolerated by an individual with normal thermoregulatory function (31).</para>
    <para>While the data obtained so far are encouraging regarding the lack of substantial health effects from exposure to high SAR levels associated with MRI, it must be remembered that patients may have compromised thermoregulatory systems that could substantially alter their ability to handle a heat load (65, 66, 72-78). Certainly, thermal stress is likely to pose a problem for some patient groups exposed to relatively high whole-body averaged SAR levels. Therefore, additional investigations are warranted to specifically address this important safety issue.</para>

          <title>The Testes</title>
    <para>Laboratory investigations have demonstrated that RF energy-induced heating may have detrimental effects on testicular function. The temperature of the testes correlates directly with the temperature of the scrotal skin (96). This temperature level exists because the scrotum has little or no subcutaneous fat or connective tissue and, as such, there is no tissue mediated temperature gradient present. If the exposure level to RF energy increases scrotal and/or testicular temperatures to between 38°C to 42°C (41), this heating can cause a reduction or cessation of spermatogenesis, impaired sperm motility, degeneration of seminiferous tubules, as well as other abnormal conditions (41, 96). Notably, there is a direct relationship between temperature and sperm motility and viability.</para>
    <para>In 1990, Shellock, et al. (28) conducted an investigation to examine the thermal effects of MRI performed at 1.5-Tesla on the scrotum to determine if excessive heating of this body part occurred. A non-contact infrared thermometer was used to measure scrotal skin tem-</para>
    <para>perature (i.e., an indicator of testicular temperature) immediately before and after MRI performed at relatively high SAR levels (28). A statistically significant increase in scrotal skin temperature was associated with MRI. The highest temperature that was recorded was 34.2°C (28), which is well below the threshold known to alter or adversely affect the function of the testes (41, 96).</para>
    <para>Excessive heating of the scrotum associated with MRI could exacerbate a pre-existing disorder associated with increased testicular temperature (e.g., febrile illnesses, varicocele, etc.) in patients who are already oligospermic, leading to temporary or permanent sterility. Therefore, additional investigations designed to investigate this issue with regard to the testes are warranted, particularly if patients are subjected to MRI using RF energy levels that are greater than those previously evaluated. This scenario is entirely possible considering the widespread use of pulse sequences that utilize high levels of RF energy (e.g., fast or turbo spin echo sequences) and MR systems operating at higher static magnetic field strengths, including clinical 3-Tesla and 7-Tesla scanners that inherently use higher whole-body averaged specific absorption rates.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The Eye</emphasis></para>
    <para>Dissipation of heat from the eye is a slow and inefficient process due to its relative lack of vascularization (39, 95). Exposure to RF energy has been reported to cause a variety of ocular effects, primarily cataracts but also effects on the retina, cornea, and other ocular systems (39, 94). Cataracts have been observed in experimental animals when one eye was exposed to a localized, very high RF field and the other eye was the unexposed control. In the rabbit eye, cataracts developed secondary to RF exposures that generated temperatures greater than or equal to 41°C (39, 95). However, cataracts were not observed in the monkey eye subjected to similar exposure conditions, reflecting the different patterns of energy absorption due to anatomical differences (39, 95). Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that an SAR level that would induce temperatures of 41°C or higher in or near the lens in the human eye could produce cataracts by the same mechanism (i.e., heating) that caused cataracts in the rabbit lens (39, 95).</para>
    <para>Other ocular effects including corneal lesions, retinal effects, and changes in vascular permeability have been observed after localized exposure of the eyes of laboratory animals to both continuous wave and pulsed wave exposures of RF energy, but the inconsistencies in these results, the failure to independently confirm corneal lesions after continuous wave exposure, the failure to independently confirm retinal effects after pulsed wave exposure, and the absence of functional changes in vision are reasons why these ocular effects are not useful in defining a particular adverse effect level for RF energy (95). The results from long term studies involving nonhuman primates support the conclusion that clinically significant ocular effects, including cataracts, have not been confirmed in human subjects exposed to low level RF energy (95).</para>
    <para>An investigation conducted by Sacks, et al. (14) in 1986 which utilized a spectrometer operating at 2.7-Tesla/29-MHz revealed that there were no discernible effects on the eyes of laboratory rats at RF energy and exposure levels (6 hours) that far exceeded levels used in the clinical MRI setting. However, as previously indicated, when it comes to the effects of RF radiation, it is unacceptable to extrapolate data from laboratory animals to human</para>

    <para>subjects because, in this case, the coupling of RF radiation to the eye of a rat is markedly different compared to a human subject (i.e., with respect to size, shape, and anatomic position).</para>
    <para>Shellock, et al. (17, 30) performed two clinical studies to evaluate the thermal effects of RF energy-induced heating of the eye associated with MRI. In both investigations, corneal temperatures were measured using a non-contact infrared thermometer immediately before and after MRI. Notably, corneal temperature is a representative site of the average temperature of the human eye (97).</para>
    <para>In the first study, corneal temperatures were measured in patients undergoing MRI of the brain using a transmit/receive head RF coil at peak SARs ranged from 2.5- to 3.1-W/kg (17). The greatest change in corneal temperature change was 1.8°C and the highest temperature measured was 34.4°C. The second study examined corneal temperatures in patients with suspected ocular pathology who underwent MRI using the transmit body RF coil and a special eye coil for RF reception (30). Fast spin echo pulse sequences were used to examine the eye. The peak SARs for these sequences ranged from 3.3- to 8.4-W/kg. The greatest temperature change was 1.8°C and the highest corneal temperature measured was 35.1°C (30).</para>
    <para>Therefore, the findings from these two clinical investigations indicated that corneal temperatures did not exceed the upper limit of normal for the human cornea, which is 36°C (95, 97). Thus, it does not appear that clinical MRI under the conditions studied has the potential to cause thermal damage to ocular tissue. However, with higher RF energy used for research and clinical MRI applications, such as those involving ultra-high-field scanners, the thermal effects on ocular tissue requires further assessment.</para>

          <title>MRI AND "HOT SPOTS"</title>
    <para>Theoretically, during exposure to RF energy, "hot spots" (i.e., an excessive concentration of RF energy) may develop due to an uneven distribution of RF power in human subjects in association with restrictive conductive patterns (3, 5, 8, 9). Obviously, an unwanted result of RF energy-induced hot spots would be thermal hot spots, or localized elevations in tissue temperature.</para>
    <para>Because RF radiation is mainly absorbed by peripheral tissues during MRI, surface thermography was used to study the heating pattern in volunteer subjects exposed to relatively high whole-body averaged SARs at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz (8, 9). The findings of this research demonstrated that there was no evidence of surface thermal "hot spots" (8, 9). Apparently, the thermoregulatory system responds to any RF radiation-related "hot spot" by evenly distributing the thermal load via cutaneous circulation.</para>
    <para>There is the possibility that thermal "hot spots" may develop internally during MRI. For example, Shuman, et al. (19) reported that significant temperature increases occurred in the internal organs of laboratory dogs as a result of MRI performed at high SAR levels. These findings suggested that internal thermal "hot spots" may occur in association with MRI. Therefore, the presence of possible internal "hot spots" needs to be thoroughly examined in human subjects undergoing MRI, with the addition of investigations performed</para>
    <para>using higher field strengths, clinical scanners operating 3-Tesla/128-MHz and 7-Tesla/298-MHz. This could be accomplished noninvasively using MRI thermometry, which is based on temperature-sensitive MRI parameters such as the proton resonance frequency, the diffusion coefficient, T1 and T2 relaxation times, magnetization transfer, as well as temperature-sensitive contrast agents (98, 99).</para>

          <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <para>The characteristics of RF energy-induced heating associated with MRI have been presented with an emphasis on research pertaining to laboratory animals and human subjects. These investigations began in the mid-1980s and continue to the present day. Of note is that the majority of the studies were conducted at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz. Many of the investigations performed after the mid-1990s involved attempts to predict or study the heating aspects of RF energy by using modeling-based investigations, temperatures obtained in phantoms or, in a few instances, temperatures recorded in laboratory animals (40-54, 100-121). Without validation in human subjects, including patient populations, the safety of exposures to high levels of RF energy remains unknown.</para>
    <para>Because MR systems operating at higher field strengths and frequencies are used for research and clinical applications (3-, 4-, 7-, 9.4-, 10.5-Tesla) (51-55, 100, 101, 122, 123), and there are new clinical applications (e.g., advanced pulse sequences, specialized transmit RF coils, etc.) with associated greater levels of RF radiation, additional investigations are necessary to assess the effects of heating. Importantly, studies are particularly needed to evaluate patients with conditions that impair heat dissipation.</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is itself one of the best examples that electromagnetic fields interact with biological tissue, providing a wide variety of soft-tissue contrasts that can be generated by the subtle interplay between radiofrequency (RF) pulse amplitudes and timing. Unfortunately, RF energy not only subtly disturbs the Boltzmann equilibrium of the nuclear spins, it also produces heat as it drives rapid molecular reorientation in cells and induces currents in the human body. Strain and friction might not functionally impair cellular and enzymatic processes, but will definitely lead to dissipation and local, non-uniform tissue heating. Such thermal effects are used therapeutically to kill tumors (i.e., RF field-induced hyperthermia) and applied in the food processing industry to sterilize at relatively low temperatures (50 to 60°C).</para>
    <para>The aim of this chapter is to present an overview of experimental data and modeling studies for core and local tissue temperature rises in clinical MRI, which mostly operates at 1.5 T (64 MHz) or 3 T (128 MHz). Safe temperatures must be maintained at all times during the MRI examination. Health effects related to mild hyperthermia will be used to explain necessary restrictions for temperature increase and thermal dose, expressed as temperature exposure of tissue at cumulative equivalent minutes at 43°C (CEM43) (1), and the derived exposure limits for whole-body averaged and head RF power deposition, expressed as specific absorption rate (SAR in W/kg) in the MRI product safety standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 60601-2-33 (2). A simplified version of the applicable limits is shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Basic restrictions for temperature and thermal dose apply equally at ultra-high field MRI (7 T and higher), but SAR management requirements may be different due to the more localized exposure to RF energy from parallel-transmit arrays (3). Considerations related to partial-body and localized exposures using such arrays, and analyses of RF field-related implant heating are beyond the scope of this chapter.</para>

        <title>POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS FROM RF EXPOSURE</title>
    <para>Potential risks associated with exposure to RF fields are actively monitored by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) (4) and the International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety (ICES, part of IEEE) (5). After decades of research related to RF exposures in wireless communication, the general consensus of these scientific expert groups is that prevention of adverse health effects from exposure to RF fields can be based on avoidance of acute thermal effects (during or within minutes after exposure). It should be noted, however, that a few recent, well-designed studies comparing RF and non-RF field-induced hyperthermia in food safety (6) and humans (7) indicate that induced cross-membrane electric fields enhance thermal damage at moderately elevated temperatures.</para>
    <para>While the energy of RF photons is too low to dissociate chemical bonds, for example in DNA, coupling to vibrational modes in proteins may alter reaction kinetics. Reported proliferation effects in cell lines, in vitro and in animals, caused the International Agency of Research of Cancer (8) to classify RF radiation in 2011 as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2B). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed evidence for tumorigenesis and concluded that "a lack of clear dose response relationship, a lack of consistent findings or specificity, and a lack of biological mechanistic plausibility" (9).

        <title>Thermal Effects Associated with RF Exposures During Clinical MRI</title>
    <para>ditional studies published in 2018 by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) and from Italy (10) indicated that the risk may increase in laboratory animals as a result of prolonged exposure at high SAR levels. Potential biochemical mechanisms relate to thermal vulnerability of routine DNA repair pathways: exposure to heat (stress) leads to accumulation of DNA double-strand break (DSB) recognition proteins such as γH2AX and micronucleation (11) and references cited therein (12, 13). The latter paper shows that heat stress affects the DNA integrity in a cell cycle phase-dependent manner (i.e., DSBs in G1/G2 phase) and stalling DNA replication forks in synthesis (S) phase (14). Additionally, Takahashi A. et al. (15) reported that γH2AX foci formation is rapid and shows similar Arrhenius kinetics as cell killing by temperature.</para>
    <para>Notably, no epidemiological indications exist from over 35 years of the use of MRI, with more than 150 million examinations being performed annually, to suggest an increased cancer incidence. Alleged excess DNA damage caused by MRI was excluded in a well-designed study (16). Similarly, no oncological concerns are known for the (local) thermal burden in diagnostic ultrasound (17-20), taking into account that clinical practice guidelines nevertheless strongly recommend "as low as reasonably possible" thermal exposure levels. Exposure to RF fields during MRI examinations can also lead to substantial thermal load, and only slightly-higher power levels are used in RF field-induced hyperthermia or focused ultrasound to ablate tumors (1, 21).</para>
        <sect3 id="ch0009s0000s0003s0001">
          <title>Thermal Thresholds and Basic Restrictions</title>
    <para>The recent update of RF exposure guidelines by ICNIRP (4) defines the concepts for establishing exposure restrictions to prevent harmful effects to human health. This committee has performed an extensive literature review (see Appendix B of their guidelines) to identify substantiated effects with adequate scientific evidence. This includes independent reproduction of reported effects and adequate study design and dosimetry, but allows for inclusion of known biological mechanisms from which adverse effects can reasonably be hypothesized. A relevant discussion topic, which has not been closed to satisfaction, is whether excessive sweating and strong recruitment of thermoregulation would constitute adverse health effects, at least in some groups of human subjects. For now, it is assumed that this is not the case.</para>
    <para>Thresholds for health effects were determined from the RF field exposure literature or from other sources (e.g., burns, hyperthermia, etc.). The latter are called "operational thresholds". The ICNIRP applies reduction factors to derive the restriction values. These reduction factors are chosen to account for biological variation, variation of the baseline physiological and environmental conditions, and dosimetric uncertainty. The threshold value combined with the reduction factor results in the "basic restrictions". Relative to earlier publications, three notable changes were introduced in the 2020 Guidelines:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>The averaging time for whole-body averaged SAR (4 W/kg) has been increased from 6 minutes to 30 minutes, which is the assumed time to reach steady-state temperature in the adult. For reference, metabolic rates are approximately 1 W/kg at rest (22), 2 W/kg standing, and 12 W/kg when running (23, 24). Note that the local SAR averaging time is retained at 6 minutes, based on numerical simulations in the GHz range (25). The basic restrictions also remain unchanged at 10 W/kg and 20 W/kg for 10 gram averaged local</para>

The newly introduced formula leads to (not explicitly disclosed) allowance for short-term high local SAR. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> provides an overview of the time dependence of this restriction, where the exposure of groups of pulses must satisfy the restrictions at all time scales.</para>
    <para>The ICNIRP's methodological approach provides a concise overview of the available evidence for health effects to identify adverse health effects and their thresholds. A similarly structured review concerning thermal effects associated with RF exposures in diagnostic MRI is available in (27). In clinical settings, a benefit to risk assessment may justify application of higher exposure levels than those applicable in daily life. IEC 60601-2-33 therefore adopted local SAR restrictions of 20 W/kg and 40 W/kg for 10 gram (10g) averaged local SAR in head/torso and limb, respectively.

    <para>(28-32) to evaluate if higher allowed exposures can be justified based on CEM43 analyses and their allowable safe values (20, 33).</para>
    <para>No thermal risk is assumed to result if the Basic Safety Restriction for thermal dose is set to the lowest CEM43 level, at which no apoptotic (i.e., the process of programmed cell death) effects have been reported. The diagnostic ultrasound community has evaluated the usefulness of CEM43 to provide user feedback on potential thermal risks (17, 18) and has established that 1 CEM43 is a conservative safety threshold for fetal, neonatal and adult exposure (19, 20). Higher thresholds have been proposed for MRI (33), taking into consideration the type of tissue and patient's health status, with 2 CEM43 proposed as a conservative safety threshold for MRI examinations under all conditions. In addition to this proposal, higher allowable local SAR values have been proposed based on a limited set of RF field-induced hyperthermia exposures and reported complaints (34).</para>
    <para>Derivation of temperature-based local SAR limits needs to account for whole-body averaged RF deposition, equilibration of core temperature towards the legs, thermoregulatory responses and capabilities, and patient variability. Temperature effects from MRI exposures were established in the late 1980s using animal and human volunteer experiments (35), and thermophysiological modeling. The allowed maximum temperature increases postulated by the ICNIRP include such global and systemic effects, but (reversely) cannot be directly related to the temperature increase from the local SAR, alone: especially in whole-body averaged MRI, effects of the whole-body averaged specific absorption must be included when controlling RF power deposition.</para>
    <para>This chapter will first addresses the available systemic temperature data from MRI exposures, both experimental and simulated. It then presents an analysis of health effects to determine thermal thresholds, corroborating those presented by the ICNIRP. The potential role of CEM43 as a control measure will also be discussed in relation to local SAR simulations and their accuracy, reproducibility and representativeness.</para>

          <title>TEMPERATURE DATA FROM MRI EXPOSURES: SYSTEMIC BURDEN</title>
    <para>MR systems intentionally expose patients to high RF power, generally for a single episode (examination) of short duration, typically less than one hour. RF deposition is expressed as SAR in W/kg and accumulated as specific absorption in J/kg. First generation MR scanners operated at relatively low SARs and initially exposed the head with local transmit RF coils. Such exposures are nowadays common for 7 T MR systems (localized, small coverage transmit RF coils) and deposit relatively little energy in the body of adult patients. With the advent of whole-body averaged transmit (quadrature birdcage) RF coils for 1.5 T systems, increases in SAR levels to 2 to 4 W/kg were deemed necessary to ensure adequate image quality and scan efficiency for spine and body imaging, with total exposure durations of 20 to 40 minutes. In current clinical practice, even longer examinations with continuous high-SAR scanning are not uncommon.</para>
    <para>The generally-accepted upper limit to the whole-body averaged SAR is 4 W/kg (36), established from observed behavioral changes in animal studies. Such exposures are reported to induce strong heat sensations in healthy human subjects. A reduced whole-body</para>
    <para>averaged SAR of 2 W/kg already falls within the normal temperature variation due to metabolic activity and exercise: the average metabolic rate, as a conversion of chemical into mechanical and thermal energy in the human body, is estimated to be 80 W at rest and 270 W for moderate physical activity (24). Thus, 2 W/kg for a 100 kg person represents a situation of homeostasis without undue stress, and is chosen as an acceptable exposure for the Normal Operating Mode for MR systems, which all individuals, regardless of health status, should be able to tolerate.</para>
    <para>Several investigations have evaluated the physiological implications of such exposures on healthy volunteers and patients, studying heart rate, blood pressure, sweating and skin or core temperature. Profound sweating and mild cardiovascular challenge at a higher SA have not been considered a potential reason for concern. <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> provides an overview of identified reports of temperature increase related to MRI exposures, including an example</para>

        <title>Thermal Effects Associated with RF Exposures During Clinical MRI</title>
    <para>of a large whole-body averaged study on RF field-induced hyperthermia. Unfortunately, most identified studies lack appropriate dosimetric information to confirm SAR and SA values. This may explain the anomaly of the reported mean temperature increase in (37), although measurement approach and volunteer characteristics may explain a low core temperature increase. Notably, however, a recent investigation of 15 volunteers in an MRI setup without RF exposure showed (repeatable) increasing and decreasing temperatures (ranging from +0.5 °C to −0.5 °C; Nicolas Boulant, Caroline Le Ster and Alexandre Vignaud, <emphasis role="italics">private communication</emphasis>). This casts additional doubt on the quality of the data used as reference for the core temperature predictions as discussed in the next section. The high temperature increase reported by Wust, et al. (38) indicates that patients may experience a higher core temperature elevation than normal volunteers. A confounding factor may be that thermal insulation is applied in the hyperthermia setup and, thus, thermoregulation may be compromised while high SAR levels are applied. In previous assessments, reported mean core temperature increases were used to argue that effects are marginal. A more appropriate parameter to consider when establishing exposure limit values is the maximum reported core temperature increase, for which esophageal measurements are the most accurate, but tympanic membrane temperatures can also provide representative data (39-44).</para>
    <para>Total energy absorbed, or SA, provides an easy estimate for systemic thermal burden. Actual temperatures reached depend on many factors such as initial temperature distribution in the body, thermoregulatory capability, and dissipation options (clothing and blankets), see (44) and the section in this chapter discussing core temperature predictions from simulation models. An additional confounding factor not accounted for in these studies is the psychological response to the MRI exposure: are people feeling at rest or stressed? A careful analysis of sham exposure has also not been performed but recent data suggests significant inter-subject variability. Irrespectively, the data suggests that an SA of approximately 4 kJ/kg is sufficient to raise core temperature by 1 °C, which corresponds to a continuous high whole-body averaged SAR (&gt; 3 W/kg) applied for 15 to 20 minutes.</para>
    <para>Predicted SA values in the tens of millions of MRI examinations performed annually can be assessed from scanner utilization data. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> shows a representative distribution obtained from 367,000 examinations at 1.5 T systems. Resulting core temperature values of examinations with (predicted) SA values &gt; 7 kJ/kg are not known, and will depend on the length of the examination (long term RF duty cycle) and the thermoregulatory and heat loss capabilities of the patient. In general, high SA levels can be expected, and have been reported as being uncomfortable, and MRI scanner manufacturers recommend not to exceed the value of 7 kJ/kg unless a clinical benefit-risk assessment is made and patient surveillance is in place. On the other hand, no evidence exists that the 0.01% of examinations with SA &gt; 10 kJ/kg correlate significantly with adverse events. The lack of large-scale data for core temperature increase in patients associated with MRI examinations warrants additional and well-controlled measurements in routine clinical settings. Such data should include tympanic membrane (pre and post) temperature, patient weight, gender, age, body part examined, ambient temperature, and appropriate dosimetry for SA and SAR values. Beyond core temperature, several studies report rapidly-developing profound sweating, whereas heart rate and blood pressure effects were generally negligible (45, 46). Significant but highly variable skin temperature increases have also been reported (37, 46-50) (<emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>), but that data is not considered to constitute an indicator of potential health concerns.</para>

        <title>Core Temperature Predictions</title>
    <para>Thermophysiological models can be used to estimate RF-induced core temperature increase as function of SAR and exposure duration. Heat accumulation in the human body mostly depends on ambient temperature and insulation (clothing), as well as thermoregulatory capabilities. In their pioneering work, Adair and Berglund (48, 49, 51) used a two-node model (70 kg man) based on the Stolwijk approach to evaluate core temperature increase as a function of whole-body averaged SAR, skin blood flow impairment, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and insulation. Predicted core temperature increases correlate well with experimental data, and a sensitivity analysis provided strong indications that the ambient temperature should not exceed 21°C, air humidity should be kept around 50%, and only light clothing can be tolerated (i.e., avoid the use of blankets). Under these circumstances, and limiting SA to 10 kJ/kg, moderate cardiovascular impairment effects will not seriously enhance core temperature elevations to levels &gt; 1°C. Adair and Berglund also recommended keeping the SAR to &lt; 3 W/kg, and to limit examination time to 20 min. Their modeling showed that cool down and recovery time is at least 30 minutes under optimal patient health conditions.</para>

          <title>262    Thermal Effects Associated with RF Exposures During Clinical MRI</title>
    <para>The Stolwijk approach used by Adair and Berglund has been superseded by advanced multi-node human models in the context of heat exposure in buildings, cars, and under (occupational) activity (52, 53). Application of such advanced models to the context of MRI (i.e., the supine patient in an enclosed space) may be of future interest, once more experimental data is available for core temperature and dosimetry over a large number of patients, including analysis of sham exposures.</para>
    <para>In the current situation, the rationale for exposure limits and guidance relies on the Adair and Berglund model. This can be done with confidence, since more recent and more detailed RF exposure modeling studies have confirmed their thermal predictions (54-59). These studies indicated that the effect of aging requires additional conservativeness when establishing exposure limits, but pediatric exposure is of lesser concern. Children have a greater surface-to-volume ratio than adults, and can tolerate approximately 30% higher whole-body averaged SAR than adults for the same core temperature increase (60).</para>
    <para>A simplified parametric approach is suggested by Adair, et al. (48) to enable a sensitivity analysis of core temperature increase as a function of SAR, skin blood flow impairment, clothing/insulation, ambient temperature and air humidity. Temperature rise correlates with total deposited energy (SAR) and restriction of the allowable SAR value was suggested by Barber, et al. (61). Some scenarios of this linearized parametric approach are provided in Figure 3 to illustrate the relative importance of the model parameters. For further detailed analyses, refer to the work by Adair, et al. (48-49). Notably, the effect of room humidity is not a major</para>

These predictions are at relatively high room temperature but with the MR system operating in the Normal Operating Mode. The light-grey and mid-grey lines in (b) were derived at the upper limit of the First Level Controlled Operating Mode (continuous 4 W/kg) but at lower ambient temperatures than those used in (a).

Each graph represents an iso-SA line, and the corresponding SA value (e.g., 200 W.min/kg for the lowest dashed blue line) divided by the scan or examination duration provides the whole-body average SAR.

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>The increasing availability and capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve medical diagnosis and prognosis has dramatically increased the number of MRI procedures performed worldwide. Thus, many more first-time and repeat patients are undergoing these MRI examinations for an ever-widening spectrum of medical indications. Notably, increasing proportions of these procedures are performed on patients suffering from unstable medical and psychological illnesses. For many of the millions of patients who undergo MRI examinations every year, the experience may cause great emotional distress. The referring physicians, radiologists, and technologists are best prepared to manage affected patients if they understand the etiology of the problem and know the appropriate maneuver or intervention to implement for treatment of the condition (1).</para>
    <para>This chapter discusses the prevalence of claustrophobia in association with the use of MRI, how emotional distress affects outcomes for the MRI procedure, factors contributing to patient distress, and techniques to help minimize anxiety and distress in patients with claustrophobia while undergoing MR imaging. Recent investigations involving emerging MRI applications are also taken into consideration.</para>

        <title>INCIDENCE OF DISTRESS IN THE MRI ENVIRONMENT</title>
    <para>Psychological distress in the MRI environment includes all subjectively unpleasant experiences that are directly attributable to MRI. Distress for the patient undergoing an MRI procedure can range from mild anxiety that can be managed simply with minimal reassurance to a full-blown panic attack that requires psychiatric intervention. Severe psychological</para>

          <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     285</title>
    <para>distress reactions to MRI examinations, namely severe anxiety and panic attacks, are typically characterized by the rapid onset of at least four of the following clinical signs: fear of losing control or dying, nausea, paresthesias, palpitations, chest pain, faintness, dyspnea, feeling of choking, sweating, trembling, vertigo, or depersonalization (2).</para>
    <para>Many symptoms of panic attack mimic over activity of the sympathetic nervous system (3), prompting concern that catecholamine responses may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias and/or ischemia in susceptible patients during the MRI examination (4). However, this has not been reported in a clinical MRI setting or any other similar situation. Nevertheless, it is advisable that, in a medically unstable patient, the use of physiologic monitoring be a routine component of the MRI examination. Pre-emptive efforts to minimize patient distress are the most important factors in preventing or containing a panic attack in susceptible patients.</para>
    <para>In the mildest form, distress is the normal amount of anxiety any reasonable person will experience when undergoing a diagnostic procedure. Moderate distress severe enough to be described as a dysphoric psychological reaction has been reported by as many as 65% of the patients examined by MRI (5-8). The most severe forms of psychological distress described by patients are claustrophobia, panic attacks, and anxiety (3, 5-12), the latter of which occurs in moderate to severe forms in up to 37% of patients undergoing MRI (13, 14).</para>
    <para>Claustrophobia is a disorder characterized by the marked, persistent and excessive fear of enclosed spaces (2). In such affected individuals, exposure to enclosed spaces such as the MR system, but no other situations or stimuli, almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response that in its most extreme form is indistinguishable from a panic attack as described above.</para>
    <para>The reported incidence of distress in the MRI setting is highly variable across studies in part reflecting differences in outcome measures used to characterize distress. Some studies indicated that as many as 20% of individuals attempting to undergo MRI can't complete it secondary to serious distress such as claustrophobia or other similar sensation (15, 16). In contrast, others have reported that as few as 0.7% of individuals have incomplete or failed MRI examinations due to distress (8, 17). In a study of over 55,000 patients undergoing MRI, claustrophobia was present in 1.8% of cases, and a review of previous literature indicated that 2.3% of patients experienced claustrophobia requiring sedation or termination of the procedure (18). A reasonable estimate of the number of patients that experience distress that compromises either their own well-being or the diagnostic utility MRI is 3 to 5% of all studies. For patients with pre-existing anxiety or claustrophobia, however, the termination rate can be as high as 39% (19, 20).</para>
    <para>Notably, there are no perfect predictors of distress in the MRI environment. In fact, different studies cite opposing results such as which gender has greater difficulty tolerating MRI (17, 18, 21). A cohort study of over 55,000 patients in an outpatient setting in Germany reported that females (2.3%) had a significantly higher rate of claustrophobia than males (1.3%) (18). This is in contrast to an earlier study conducted in Malaysia where the rate of MRI termination was found to be 0.54%, and of those, 67% of the patients who terminated their scans were male (17). Obviously, these differences may reflect cultural, socioeconomic or other influences.</para>

        <title>THE IMPACT OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS IN THE MRI ENVIRONMENT</title>
    <para>Patient distress can contribute to adverse outcomes for the MRI procedure. These adverse outcomes include unintentional exacerbation of patient distress, a compromise in the diagnostic power of the MRI examination due to poor image quality, and decreased efficiency of the imaging facility due to delayed, cancelled or prematurely terminated studies. Patient compliance during MRI, such as the ability to remain in the MR system and hold still long enough to complete the study is of paramount importance to achieving a high quality, diagnostic examination.</para>
    <para>If a good quality study can't be obtained, the patient may require an invasive diagnostic examination in place of the safer, less painful and risky MRI exam. Thus, for the distressed patient unable to undergo MRI, there are potential clinical, medico-legal, and economic related considerations implications.</para>
    <para>Patient distress due to MRI may also impact regional brain activity as indicated by functional neuroimaging measurements. Elevated endocrine levels have been observed in association with scanning procedures compared to baseline, particularly in stress hormones such as cortisol (22-24). Studies have indicated that elevated salivary cortisol levels are associated with MRI examinations in both adolescents and healthy adults (23, 24). In contrast, Muehlhan, et al. (25) found changes in salivary alpha amylase but not in cortisol prior to MRI. This evidence, while inconclusive, points towards increased activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and the sympatho-adrenal-medullary axes which are, in turn, associated with regionally specific neural activation and deactivation (26, 27). Fluctuating endocrine levels have been implicated in the modulation of regional brain activity, a suggestion that has broad implications for interpreting functional neuroimaging results. Functional MRI (fMRI) is at the forefront of neuroimaging research. Because fMRI is increasingly introduced into clinical practice a variety of critical applications the effects of hormone levels on brain activity related to anxiety and emotional distress could impact this procedure.</para>
    <para>Increasing pressure to use scanner time efficiently to cover the costs of this expensive diagnostic imaging equipment puts greater stress on both staff members and patients. The ability of referring physicians, radiologists, and MRI technologists to detect patient distress at the earliest possible time, to discover the source of the distress, and then provide appropriate intervention can greatly improve patient comfort, the quality of the imaging studies, and the efficiency of the MRI facility (1).</para>
    <para>Motion artifact disrupting image quality is frequently the result of patient distress. That is, the distressed patient becomes agitated and finds it difficult to remain motionless during MRI. Obviously, motion artifacts can compromise the diagnostic power of an MRI exam. One investigation in 297 first-time outpatients undergoing MRI indicated that approximately 13% of the MRI studies showed motion artifacts (i.e., unrelated to normal body pulsations) and about half of these impaired the diagnostic quality of the examination (8). Subsequent studies have confirmed these estimates (20, 28). One of these investigations reported an even higher proportion of scans with motion artifacts (18%) in a sample of patients with pre-existing anxiety conditions and non-anxious controls (20).</para>
        <sect3 id="ch0010s0000s0003s0001">
          <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management    287</title>
    <para>Excessive anxiety with accompanying tremors, trembling, jaw clenching and other related body movements have been presumed to contribute to motion artifacts in MR images. Dantendorfer, et al. (8) attempted to investigate this directly and found that, while specific measures of anxiety do not predict motion artifacts, reported concerns about the scanner did predict motion artifacts. Tournquist, et al. (28) designed an experiment to test whether increased awareness about the procedure prior to initiating the scan would reduce motion related artifacts. The investigators found nearly a three-fold reduction in the number of scans with artifacts in the intervention group (4%) compared to the control condition (15.4%). The patients in the intervention group received additional written information that included details about what the procedure would entail, as well as sensory and temporal information related to the procedure (28). These results support the interpretation that adequate patient education about the MRI procedure is one of the most important aspects of minimizing distress and the associated adverse outcomes.</para>
    <para>The emotional distress that comes with claustrophobia and anxiety may lead to a compromise in MR image quality due to motion artifacts related to the patient's inability to remain motionless. While this is undoubtedly crucial to achieving a diagnostically acceptable examination, Klaming L, et al. (66) reported that there was little evidence to support the assumption that anxiety increases patient motion and decreases image quality during MRI. However, the evidence supporting the benefits of patient education prior to MRI still remains relevant and critical to ensuring the best possible outcomes in patients with claustrophobia, anxiety, and emotional distress.</para>

    <para>Many factors contribute to distress experienced by certain patients undergoing MRI. Most commonly cited are concerns about the physical environment of the scanner. Also well documented are the anxieties associated with the underlying medical problem necessitating the MRI exam Notably, certain individuals, such as those with psychiatric illnesses, may be predisposed to suffer greater distress related to the MRI procedure.</para>
    <para>The physical environment of the scanner is clearly one important source of distress to patients. Sensations of apprehension, tension, worry, claustrophobia, anxiety, fear, and even panic attacks have been directly attributed to the confining dimensions of the interior of the MR system. For example, for certain types of scanners, the patient's face may be three to ten inches from the inner portion of the scanner, prompting feelings of uncontrolled confinement and detachment (3, 5-12, 15, 16, 29-34). In one study, confinement was reported by 22.9% of patients as the most unpleasant feature of the MRI experience (34). This factor, combined with other physical aspects of the MRI environment may contribute to the high levels of distress observed in patients undergoing MRI.</para>
    <para>Similar distressing sensations have been attributed to the other aspects of the MRI setting including the prolonged duration of the MRI examination, the gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise, the temperature and humidity within the MR system, and the distress related to the restriction of movement (3-12, 15, 16, 29-33, 35, 36). Other studies have reported stress related to the administration of an intravenous MRI contrast agent (3, 5-7, 9-</para>
    <para>12, 15, 16, 29-33, 35-37). Additionally, the scanner may produce feelings of sensory deprivation, restriction, and suffocation, which are also known to be precursors of severe anxiety states (10, 38). Investigations have indicated that phobias related to specific aspects of the MRI environment can predict claustrophobic fears and psychological outcomes in the scanner (14, 34, 39, 40). Using pre-scan questionnaires, clinicians may be able to identify patients who are at risk for terminating the scan due to claustrophobia (20, 34, 39, 40).</para>
    <para>One of the more overwhelming features of the MRI procedure is the acoustic noise generated by the MR system. Gradient magnetic field-induced noise may be sufficiently intense to cause transient hearing threshold shifts in as many as 43% of patients undergoing MRI (41). Obviously, acoustic noise in and of itself can be a source of stress and, thus, particularly troublesome to certain patients in association with MRI. In one study, noise alone was considered the most unpleasant feature of MRI by 19.5% of patients (34). This information suggests that the noise reduction achieved in the new generation of scanners may be an important factor in reducing distress. The use of newer scanners demonstrated up to a 97% reduction in acoustic noise compared to older scanners. Dewey, et al. (18) observed a threefold reduction in reports of claustrophobia using the newer short- and wide-bore scanners that have noise emission levels below 99-dB compared to conventional, older scanners.</para>
    <para>MR systems that have an architecture that utilizes a vertical magnetic field offer a more open design that is presumed to reduce the frequency of distress associated with MRI. The latest versions of these so-called "open" scanners, despite having static magnetic field strengths of 0.35-Tesla or lower have improved technology (i.e., faster gradient fields, optimized surface coils, etc.) that permit acceptable image quality for virtually all types of standard, diagnostic imaging procedures. Also, the latest generation of high-field-strength (1.5-Tesla and 3-Tesla) MR systems have shorter and wider bore configurations such that these newer scanners tend to be more acceptable to patients with feelings of distress related to close confinement.</para>
    <para>After the release of the first commercially available open MR systems, Datendorfer, et al. (8) designed a study to compare an open system to a standard scanner. This report indicated that there was no difference between a conventional 1.5-T MR system (Siemens Magnetom SP-65, Siemens Medical Solutions) and a more open 0.5-Tesla scanner (Philips Gyroscan P-5, Philips Medical Systems) with regard to the incidence of adverse reactions (i.e., pre- or post-scan anxiety, claustrophobia, motion artifacts, or aborted exams).</para>
    <para>MRI scanner design has been postulated to be a key factor that contributes to patient distress, and it's known that "open" configured scanners with shorter and wider bore configurations have increased examination success rate. However, Enders, et al. (19) reported that there wasn't a substantial difference in claustrophobia experienced by patients undergoing MRI in an open versus a short-bore MR system. A subsequent study by Enders, et al. (75), further examined the use of a high-field open scanner (1.0-Tesla) and a short-bore, high field MR system (1.5-T) used for MRI of the spine. In this randomized controlled comparison of spinal MR imaging with an open versus a short-bore scanner, short-bore MR imaging revealed considerably higher image quality with shorter scanning times. Interestingly, patients reported claustrophobia in both types of MR scanners.</para>
    <para>In contrast to the aforementioned investigations, two non-randomized studies of claustrophobic patients demonstrated a decreased rate of claustrophobic events in open MR systems compared to closed scanners (42, 43). Decreases of similar magnitude have been observed in newer generations of short- and wide-bore scanners compared to conventional MR systems (44). In one study of claustrophobic patients who previously failed completing an MRI procedure, Hunt, et al. (44) observed an 89% success rate for patients scanned in a short- and wide-bore 1.5-Tesla MR system compared to their previously unsuccessful procedure in a conventional 1.5-Tesla scanner.</para>
    <para>In another study, Dewey, et al. (18) compared the rate of claustrophobia between short- and wide-bore configured 1.5-Tesla MR systems (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions) and conventional 1.0-Tesla scanners (Magnetom Impact Expert Plus, Siemens Medical Solutions) in an outpatient setting. Data from this study collected over the course of eight years demonstrated significantly lower rates of claustrophobic reactions among patients scanned on newer 1.5-Tesla scanners (0.7%) compared to conventional 1.0-Tesla MR systems (2.1%) (18). Considered together, these data suggest that although the patient-centered design of MR scanners has evolved in the past 20 or so years, even the most state-of-the-art systems do not prevent claustrophobia, indicating that there are other factors besides the physical aspects of the MR system that are related to claustrophobic events.</para>
    <para>In the early 1990s, a specially-designed, low-field-strength (0.2-Tesla) MR system (Artoscan, Lunar Corporation/General Electric Medical Systems and Esaote) first became commercially available for MR imaging of extremities. The use of dedicated extremity scanners such as these provides an accurate, reliable, and relatively inexpensive means (i.e., in comparison to the use of a whole-body MR system) of evaluating various types of musculoskeletal abnormalities. Therefore, utilization of the extremity scanner to assess musculoskeletal pathology is a viable and acceptable alternative to the use of whole-body scanners (45). This is particularly the case since the image quality and diagnostic capabilities for the evaluation of the knee and other extremities has been reported to be comparable to mid- or high-field strength MR systems for certain musculoskeletal applications (45).</para>
    <para>The architecture of the extremity MR system has no confining features or other aspects that would typically create patient-related problems. This is because only the body part that requires imaging is placed inside the magnet bore during the MR examination. One study reported that 100% of the MRI examinations that were initiated were completed without being interrupted or canceled for patient-related problems (Shellock FG, Unpublished Data, 2011). The unique design of the extremity scanner likely contributed to the totally successful completion of MRI examinations in the patients of this study. Furthermore, these findings represent a dramatic improvement compared with the published incidence of patient distress that tends to interrupt or prevent the completion of MRI examinations using whole-body MR systems.</para>
    <para>Currently, there are no reports available on the topic of "upright" or "standing" MR systems and patients with claustrophobia. Anecdotally, the ability to stand or sit for the MRI exam and, thus, avoid having the scanner in close proximity to the face often proves helpful for individuals who may otherwise experience claustrophobia (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 1a and 1b</emphasis>).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 1.</emphasis> Examples of an "upright" or "standing" MR system. Anecdotally, the ability to stand (a) (G-Scan Brio, Esaote, www.esaote.com) or sit (b) (Upright MRI Fonar, www.fonar.com) during an MRI exam and avoid having the scanner in close proximity to the face often proves helpful for individuals who may experience claustrophobia.</para>
  <para>Adverse psychological reactions are sometimes associated with MRI simply because the examination may be perceived by the patient as a "dramatic" medical test that has an associated uncertainty of outcome, such that there may be a fear of the presence of disease or other abnormality (5, 10). In fact, any type of diagnostic imaging procedure may produce a certain amount of anxiety for the patient (30). For example, Thorp, et al. (16) found that, with the exception of the MR system environment issue (i.e., the confined space), patients undergoing computed tomography compared to those undergoing MRI had similar feelings that the procedure was unpleasant. Patients finding the experience difficult tended to be those with high initial levels of anxiety, little experience with diagnostic procedures, and those that believed they had cancer (16). This study underscores the need for direct professional interaction to prepare and educate the patient prior to any form of diagnostic imaging examination. Improved patient compliance was reported in a study that investigated the impact of more detailed patient education on adverse outcomes from MR mammography, a procedure known to have an atypically high rate of noncompliance (46). Likewise, in a study designed to test the noncompliance rate before and after hospital radiology staff were trained in nonpharmacological analgesia, one multi-site practice observed a significant decrease in noncompliance rates during the period of time following the training. This particular training program involved two components: advanced rapport training and self-hypnotic relaxation, both highlighting the importance of individualized care and interpersonal interactions in patient care (47).</para>
    <para>Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders may be at greater risk for experiencing distress in the MRI environment. One problem that arises more often in this population is the refusal of the prescribed MRI exam by the patient. Frequently, the cause for refusal is an inadequate understanding of why the procedure was ordered and what the actual procedure involves.</para>
    <para>For patients with pre-existing anxiety disorders who agree to undergo MRI, it is prudent for hospital radiology staff to use augmented methods to minimize additional anxiety or distress. Grey, et al. (48) reported the efficacy of an anxiety reduction protocol in patients with moderate to high trait anxiety. Prior to MRI, patients in the intervention group were given detailed information regarding scanning procedures including descriptions of the acoustic noise, equipment and the procedure room, the timing of scans and degree of interaction with the MRI technologist, as well as coping strategies for anxiety in the scanner such as increasing the audio volume and paying attention to a clock on the wall. Patients in the intervention group were significantly less anxious during the procedure and retrospectively when asked about the whole procedure compared to those patients in the control condition, indicating that the extra time and effort spent preparing the patients in the intervention group made a positive impact on patients with pre-existing anxiety (48).</para>
    <para>In a small study of older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) the rate of unsuccessful MRI examinations in patients with pre-existing anxiety was assessed and compared to a control group. In this study, an unsuccessful scan was defined as one in which there was excessive movement or premature termination of the scan. There was no significant difference in the rate of successful MRI outcome in this group of GAD patients and non-anxious controls (20). To date, this study is the only report of the differential frequency of distress or adverse outcomes for MRI exams in such patients compared to non-psychiatrically impaired patients. Although these findings fail to find a difference between cohorts, future studies are still warranted and specific inquiry should be made to identify patients with pre-existing anxiety disorders including claustrophobia, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in order to increase anxiety minimizing efforts in these patients.</para>
    <para>Patients with other psychiatric illnesses such as depression and any illness complicated by thought disorder such as schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder may also be at increased risk for distress in the MRI environment. Patients with psychiatric illnesses may, under normal circumstances, be able to tolerate the MRI setting without a problem, as is clear from the thousands who participate in clinical neuroimaging research studies each year (49). However, the increased stress due to their medical illness or fear of medical illness may exacerbate their psychiatric symptoms to such an extent that they may have difficulty complying with MRI procedures. At the very least, patients with psychiatric illnesses may require more time and patience to provide the appropriate level of preparatory information.</para>

    <para>aminations. A number of other measures will be required if the patient is experiencing significant distress due to factors as described above. Finally, other distress-alleviation techniques will only be necessary for patients with co-existing psychiatric illness or other special problems. Coordination of these efforts among the referring physician, the radiologist, the MRI technologist and the facility support staff is crucial. Most of these methods have been described in the peer-reviewed literature and are summarized in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> (3-5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 21, 33, 35, 36, 46, 50-54, 67, 69, 72).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">For All Patients Undergoing MRI Procedures</emphasis></para>
    <para>Referring clinicians should take the time to explain the rationale for the MRI examination and what he/she expects to learn from the results with respect to the implications for treatment and prognosis. Importantly, the clinician should schedule time with the patient to communicate the results of the MRI procedure.</para>
    <para>The single most important step is to educate the patient about the specific aspects of the MRI examination that are known to be particularly difficult. This includes conveying in terms that are understandable to the patient the internal dimensions of the MR system, the level of gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise to expect, and the estimated time duration of the examination.</para>
    <para>Studies have documented a decrease in the incidence of premature termination of MRI when patients are provided with more detailed information regarding the examination (46-48, 67, 68, 72). This may be effectively accomplished by means of providing the patient time to view an educational videotape or written brochure supplemented by a question and</para>
    <para>answer session with an MRI-trained healthcare worker prior to MRI. An investigation by Tazegul G, et al. (72) also supports the use of information and communication as a method for preventing and reducing anxiety in patients, encouraging the continued use of this method by radiology technologists.</para>
    <para>Some authors have proposed adding a pre-scan "fear assessment" to help predict patients who will experience psychological problems related to MRI (15, 20, 29, 30, 34, 39, 40). Such a brief questionnaire could be used to help elicit questions and concerns from patients and to provide guidance to staff about which distress minimization strategies are most likely to be effective for the patient.</para>
    <para>One study on anxiety and MRI exams conducted by Van Minde, et al. (76) specifically looked at patients who were highly anxious before MRI. The study measured stress and anxiety throughout the exam by monitoring the patient's heart rate. The data showed that patient anxiety levels were highest at the very beginning of the procedure, particularly when the MRI table was moving into the scanner. However, anxiety and stress decreased over the course of the examination. This information not only proves helpful to radiology professionals working with patients but may also aid in the development of more effective anxiety-reduction strategies in the future.</para>
    <para>Upon entering the MRI facility, patients who are treated with respect and are welcomed into a calm environment will report less distress. Many details of patient positioning in the MR system can increase comfort and minimize distress. Taking time to ensure comfortable positioning with adequate padding and blankets to alleviate undue discomfort or pain from positioning is also important. Adequate hearing protection should be provided routinely to decrease acoustic noise generated by the MR system. Demonstration of the two-way intercom system to reassure to patients that the MRI staff members can hear them when they speak and can speak to them during the examination can also be reassuring.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">For Mildly to Moderately Distressed Patients</emphasis>If a patient that continues to experience distress after the afore-mentioned measures are implemented, additional interventions are required. Frequently, all that is necessary to successfully complete an MRI examination is to allow an appropriately-screened relative or friend to remain with the patient during the procedure. A familiar person in the MR system room often helps the patient who is anxious to develop an increased sense of security (12, 35). If a supportive companion is not present, then simply having an MRI staff member maintain verbal contact via the intercom system or physical contact by having a staff person remain in the MR system room with the patient during the examination will frequently decrease psychological distress (7, 12, 35).</para>
    <para>Placing the patient in a prone position inside the MR system so that the patient can visualize the opening of the bore provides a sensation of being inside a device that is more spacious and alleviates the "closed-in" feeling associated with the supine position (35, 55, 67). Prone positioning of the patient may not be a practical alternative if MRI requires the use of certain types of radiofrequency (RF) coils or if the patient has underlying medical conditions (e.g., shortness of breath, the presence of chest tubes, etc.) that preclude lying in</para>
    <para>this position. Another method of positioning the patient that may help is to place the individual feet-first instead of head-first into the scanner.</para>
    <para>An MR system, head-coil mounted mirror (Figure 2) or prism glasses (Figure 3) can be used to permit the patient to maintain a vertical view of the outside of the scanner in order to minimize claustrophobic responses. Using a blindfold so that the patient is not aware of the close surroundings has also been suggested to be an effective technique for enabling anxious patients to successfully undergo MRI (12, 35).</para>
    <para>The internal environment of the MR system may be changed to optimize the management of apprehensive patients (12). For example, the presence of higher lighting levels tends to make most individuals feel less anxious. Therefore, the use of bright lights at either end and inside of the MR system can produce a less imposing environment for the patient. In addition, using a fan inside of the scanner to provide more air movement will help reduce the sensation of confinement and lessen any tissue heating that may result when high levels of RF power absorption are used for MRI (12). Some MRI staff members have reported that placing a cotton pad moistened with a few drops of lemon, vanilla, cucumber oil or other similar form of aromatherapy in the MR system for the patient to receive olfactory stimulation can also reduce distress. Reports by Munn, et al. (67, 68) found that cognitive behavioral strategies, MRI design features, team training, fragrance administration, information, and prone positioning all have a positive impact on outcomes in reducing fear, anxiety, and claustrophobia. Not only do these measures increase patient comfort, but they also reduce the need for sedation.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 4.</emphasis> Example of audio device specially designed for use in the MR system room. MR Conditional audio devices that transmit music and/or provide audio communication through headphones have been developed for use with scanners and are available from several vendors.</para>
  <para>Audio devices that transmit music and/or provide audio communication through headphones have been developed specifically for use with MR systems (51, 52, 56, 57). These MR Conditional music/audio systems may be acquired from commercial vendors. This equipment can be used to provide calming music to the patient and, with the proper design, help to minimize exposure to gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). Reports have indicated that the use of these devices has been successful in reducing symptoms of anxiety in patients during MRI (52, 56, 58). Furthermore, one study suggested that having a live musician play music that matches the rhythm of the gradient magnetic fields improves patient perceptions of the MRI examination (58). This improved perception may also be due in part to the perceived increase in the social interaction that the patient has during MRI. Obviously, that particular means of helping an anxious patient to get through a clinical MRI exam tends to be impractical.</para>
    <para>Another technique investigated for reducing anxiety during MRI exams is foot massage or touch therapy, both of which may be beneficial due to the increase in social interaction during the procedure. Not only was foot massage or touch therapy found acceptable and feasible by both patients and MRI technologists, Parmar, et al. (69) reported that these interventions were associated with lower levels of anxiety during MRI.</para>
    <para>It is also possible to provide visual stimulation to the patient via special goggles or a headset (57). Use of visual stimuli to distract patients may also reduce distress. Finally, a specialized system has been developed to provide a virtual reality environment for the patient that may likewise serve as an acceptable means of audio and visual distraction from the MRI exam (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 5a and 5b</emphasis>). A case study of two patients with claustrophobia demonstrated that virtual reality distraction decreased subjective anxiety ratings when compared to no distraction (59).</para>
    <para>The use of a virtual reality tool that simulates the MRI experience may also be effective at helping to prepare patients with claustrophobia and anxiety for MRI exams. Previous studies have shown that desensitization therapy via the use of virtual reality (VR) offers an effective method of treating anxiety (74, 77). A VR app has been developed that helps to educate the patient about the MRI exam by simulating the experience (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). The app incorporates both visual and auditory sensations normally encountered by patients during MRI. Developers believe that this tool has potential similar to desensitization therapy, reducing patient anxiety prior to MRI and lowering the incidence of claustrophobia-related issues. Importantly, when used in pediatric patients, this VR app reduces the need for the use of sedation or anesthesia (80).</para>

    <para>Patients who are at high risk for severe distress in the MRI setting and can be identified as such by their referring clinician or by the scheduling MRI staff could be offered the opportunity to have pre-MRI behavioral therapy. MRI examinations that were conducted in patients that previously refused or were unable to tolerate the MRI environment have been reported to be successful as a result of treatment with relaxation techniques (9, 54), systematic desensitization (11), and medical hypnosis (33, 36, 53). Quirk, et al. (9) reported that psychological preparation that included information about MRI and the use of relaxation strategies (i.e., breathing relaxation techniques, visualization of pleasant images, perform-</para>

    <para>Klonoff, et al. (11) provided a detailed example of one successful systematic desensitization protocol. This was conducted prior to MRI and involved having the patient lie on the floor at home with her head in a box. The size of the box was incrementally decreased until it approximated the internal dimensions of the MR system. Additionally, the patient was required to gradually increase the amount of time that she could tolerate spending with the box over her head, until it equaled 50 to 60 minutes, to approximate the maximum time needed for MRI. The patient also wore prism glasses that permitted her to have a direct view in the vertical plane during MRI. After four treatment sessions, the patient was able to successfully undergo MRI (11). Notably, because of the time involved with systematic desensitization, this technique of preparing the distressed patient for MRI is impractical for clinical MRI facilities.</para>
    <para>Medical hypnosis has been demonstrated to be a successful means of treating phobias (50) and, not surprisingly, has been used as an effective intervention to enable a claustrophobic or anxious patient to complete MRI (33, 36, 53). Successful hypnotherapy requires a trained medical hypnotist and a willing, trance-susceptible patient. Therefore, identifying the appropriate patient that would benefit from being hypnotized before and during MRI and having a hypnosis therapist available for treatment are prerequisites for instituting this technique of patient management. There is a secondary effect of using hypnosis for patients with psychological disorders undergoing MRI insofar as patients have reported feeling a general reduction in anxiety in their everyday lives after undergoing hypnosis (33).</para>
    <para>In the majority of MRI facilities, patients that are severely affected by claustrophobia, anxiety, or panic attacks in response to MRI are usually pharmacologically sedated when other attempts to counteract their distress fail. Using short-acting sedatives such as lorazepam, diazepam, alprazolam, or intranasal midazolam or one of the other anxiolytic medications may be the only means of managing patients with a high degree of anxiety related to MRI. Published reports of the rate of pharmacological sedation for patients undergoing MRI range from 2 to 14% (8, 21).</para>
    <para>A study conducted by Avrahami (3) in patients with panic attacks who were unable to undergo MRI reported that treatment with intravenous diazepam caused the symptoms to disappear rapidly and permitted completion of the examination in every case. However, the use of sedatives in patients prior to and during MRI may not be required in all instances nor is it always practical (1).</para>
    <para>Of special note is that anxious patients with a history of substance abuse who are in recovery programs may not be willing to take mind-altering medications because this is typically contraindicated during their treatment. These patients should be referred for behavioral therapy before MRI. In all cases, one or more of the recommended, non-medication-related techniques indicated in Table I should be attempted for these patients before electing to use a sedative.</para>

  <para>been reported in response to relatively modest doses of commonly employed sedatives (6, 9). If a sedative or other similar drug is used in a patient in preparation for MRI, it should be understood that the use of this medication involves several important patient management considerations (31). For example, the time when the patient should be administered the medication for optimal effect prior to the examination should be considered along with the possibility that there may be an adverse reaction to the drug (31). The use of proper physiologic monitoring equipment during the MRI examination is essential. Additionally, provisions should be available for an area to permit adequate recovery of the patient after MRI</para>
    <para>and the patient should have someone available to provide transportation from the MRI facility after receiving a sedative.</para>
    <para>According to Rotunda (70), patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and who may also have severe claustrophobia frequently are unable to successfully complete MRI exams, which may greatly affect their health outcomes. Research studies comparing the brains of patients with PTSD versus people who do not have PTSD have shown diffuse decreases in white and gray matter in patients who developed PTSD after various traumas. The areas in which these types of white and gray matter changes occur might provide some insight into the anatomical and physiological reasons for PTSD symptoms (71). For healthcare professionals, it is important to be aware of the potential differences in the brain of a patient with PTSD and the effects that these differences may have on behavior. Therefore, educated MRI technologists who can adapt to the specific needs of their patients, such as those with PTSD, are more likely to provide the best experiences which leads to better patient outcomes. This includes being proactive with respect to preparing and managing patients with PTSD for MRI exams.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">For Pediatric Patients</emphasis>Careful consideration of methods for reducing distress in pediatric patients is extremely important as the implications of imaging procedures have both short- and long-term effects in this population. In addition to the short-term effects of distress, anxiety and pain, resulting in crying and lack of cooperation, there may be long-term psychological effects into adulthood such as medical fears, less perceived control over health, and in some cases, post-traumatic stress responses and claustrophobic feelings (60, 61). Some of the methods for minimizing distress and discomfort in the scanner are similar to those used in adults, however, important differences should be highlighted. Similar to adults, pediatric patients can also benefit from preparation prior to the procedure, hypnosis, music and sedation. Other pediatric specific methods such as visual and audio distraction, positive reinforcement and parental involvement have also been shown to be effective (60).</para>
    <para>Parental involvement can be a particularly useful technique as it engages the parents, which in turn reduces the parents' own anxiety and ensures that the child is in close proximity to them. Techniques with parental involvement include comforting and distracting the child while holding the child in a comforting position, educating and preparing the child for the procedure, and providing positive reinforcement. Parents must be careful in these interactions with their children, as any anxiety or stress they express can induce anxiety and stress in the child (60).</para>
    <para>Educational materials and procedural preparation can be helpful for both the parents and the child. Parents and pediatric patients can watch educational videos together, practice positioning for the procedure, and observe other children modeling various coping skills. With the assistance of radiology staff members, parents can help their children practice breathing techniques and engage in positive imagery (60).</para>
    <para>Some radiology teams also employ child-life specialists who are specifically trained to teach pediatric patients and their parents various coping skills that they can employ during MRI. These skills include visual, auditory and tactile distraction and breathing exercises</para>
    <para>(60). In addition to reducing stress and anxiety in pediatric patients, child-life specialists have been shown to contribute to the reduction of sedation rates associated with pediatric MRI procedures (62).</para>
    <para>Just as there are risks associated with using sedatives in adult patients, there are risks for sedating pediatric patients. Unlike for adult patients, however, the process of inducing sedation can be equally as traumatizing to the child as the MRI exam, itself. Under certain circumstances, sedation is the only way to achieve the quality of scans required for diagnosis, particularly in young children under the age of eight (63). In this case, radiology teams should follow established sedation programs that are safe and effective (64).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</emphasis>With the increasing proportion of patients taking greater responsibility for their own health, there is a rise in the number of patients using these web-based portals for information on their own health as well as information about the procedures they will undergo. With more than 60% of patients using web-based systems (65) such as Medline Plus, WebMD, and other online sources to find healthcare information, it is important for hospital radiology teams to provide their patients with specific and up-to-date information regarding their procedures. An increased focus on patient-centered medicine and improved patient education has prompted hospitals and other medical imaging facilities to provide detailed information to patients and their families.</para>
    <para>From the referring physicians and radiologists to the technologists and support staff, each member of the team has a specific role in providing care for their patients. Primary care physicians and specialists who order the procedures have a responsibility to engage their patients in the medical process and explain the rationale for the MRI procedure. The healthcare support staff that schedule, greet, and provide the patients with pamphlets of information are an extremely valuable resource for the patients as they are the most visible members of the team.</para>
    <para>The radiology technologists who perform the diagnostic procedures have the most direct impact on the care of the patients during potentially distressing procedures. They are highly trained professionals who not only conduct a wide range of diagnostic tests but also provide educational information and prepare patients for the procedures prior to conducting tests. As always, the radiologists and physicians who interpret the results of the tests and discuss the diagnoses with their patients have the responsibility of establishing good lines of communication with the patients and understanding their mental state following potentially distressing procedures.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis>The advances in MRI technology combined with the advances in clinical applications to aid in the diagnosis and management of an ever-increasing number of medical conditions will ensure that the number of patients undergoing MRI will continue to increase every year. Thus, Thus, the number of patients at risk for experiencing claustrophobia, anxiety, or emotional distress may likewise increase. As such, the implementation of techniques to</para>

    <para>Simple and effective strategies for reducing and perhaps eliminating this distress for patients have been presented in this chapter. Patient education and preparation pertaining to MRI is perhaps the single most important measure to reduce distress and the associated adverse outcomes. Importantly, adherence to the outlined measures will greatly improve patient comfort, reduce the need for sedation and, thereby, greatly decrease the number of repeat or nondiagnostic MRI exams.</para>

    <para>INTRODUCTION</para>
    <para>Medical imaging remains a common requirement in pregnant patients. Because of the increased scrutiny for possible radiation effects associated with pregnancy (1-4), it is not surprising that the question of whether a patient should undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination during pregnancy frequently arises. While a 1988 survey by Kanal, et al. (5) showed that 36% of sites did not perform MRI procedures in pregnant patients, a subsequent publication by De Wilde, et al. (6) indicated that 91% of 352 MRI facilities in the United Kingdom performed MRI examinations in second and third trimester patients, and 8% had protocols for selective fetal imaging (6). Of further note is that Kwan, et al. (7) reported that "magnetic resonance imaging rates increased steadily from 1.0/1,000 pregnancies in 1996 to 11.9/1,000 pregnancies in 2016 in the United States and from 0.5/1,000 pregnancies in 1996 to 9.8/1,000 pregnancies in 2016 in Ontario, surpassing CT rates in 2013 in the United States and in 2007 in Ontario."</para>

    <para>MRI exposes the patient and fetus to a powerful static magnetic field, rapidly changing, gradient magnetic fields, acoustic noise, and radiofrequency (RF) radiation. The effects of these electromagnetic fields on the human fetus are not easily determined. Consider the following:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>The strength of the static magnetic field is well known (e.g., 1.5-Tesla, 3-Tesla, etc.).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The gradient amplitude (e.g., 20-mT/m) and slew rate, dB/dt (i.e., 3-T/s) can be determined at the location of the fetus for a given pulse sequence.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>RF energy power deposition or the specific absorption rate (SAR) level (e.g., whole body averaged SAR, 2.0-W/kg with the MR system operating in the Normal Operating Mode) will vary considerably with the type of transmit RF coil that is used and system configuration, as well as the pulse sequences that are selected for the procedure. Popular sequences for fast fetal imaging, such as fast spin echo, employ multiple rapid RF pulses, and would be expected to deposit more RF energy compared to gradient echo techniques.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Using computer modeling, Murbach, et al. (15) described the potential risks associated with the use of two-port radiofrequency (RF) shimming when examining a pregnant woman at 3-T. They stated: "Although RF shimmed configurations may lower the local RF exposure for the mother, they can increase the thermal load on the fetus. In worst-case configurations, whole-body exposure and local peak temperatures-up to 40.8°C-are equal in fetus and mother". Of course, this finding has not been verified in human subjects undergoing MRI and there are well-known issues when using modeling to predict temperature elevations in patients in association with MRI.</para>

      <listitem><para>RF power deposition varies considerably with the body part undergoing MRI. While Schaefer (16) concluded that approximately 87% of the RF energy would likely be deposited in the outer 1/3 of the body (16), Hand, et al. (17) predicted that the fetus would be exposed to a peak of approximately 40 to 60% of the maternal peak value at 64-MHz (1.5-Tesla), increasing to approximately 50 to 70% at 128-MHz (3-Tesla). Thus, in most instances, the embryo or fetus would receive relatively small RF exposures (18-20).</para>

Interestingly, the fetus may be heat energy tolerant due to a large fetal surface area-to-volume ratio.

          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been used in clinical practice since the 1980s. Over the years, nine GBCAs have been approved for intravenous or intra-articular use in various countries throughout the world: Ablavar (gadofosveset), Dotarem (gadoterate meglumine), Eovist/Primovist (gadoxetate disodium), Gadavist/Gadovist (gadobutrol), Magnevist (gadopentetate dimeglumine), MultiHance (gadobenate dimeglumine), ProHance (gadoteridol), Omniscan (gadodiamide), and OptiMARK (gadoversetamide).</para>
    <para>"Adverse reactions" are defined by all regulatory authorities as noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product (1). The phrase "responses to a medicinal product" means that a causal relationship between exposure to a medicinal product and an untoward medical occurrence is at least a reasonable possibility. All medicinal products can produce an adverse reaction in someone who has been exposed to them. GBCAs, though generally safe and well tolerated, are no exception: adverse reactions can occur after their administration, particularly in patients with underlying risk factors.</para>
    <para>"Acute adverse reactions" to GBCAs are defined as undesirable side effects that occur within the first 60 minutes after administration of a GBCA (2). According to the approved prescribing information of the GBCAs that are currently commercially available in the United States (U.S.), the most frequent acute reactions to these imaging agents are headache, nausea with or without vomiting, injection site reactions, dizziness, localized rash, and pruritus (incidence rate, 1 to 5%) (3-7). Importantly, reactions like coldness, warmth, or pain at the injection site or headache probably depend on the physicochemical characteristics of the GBCAs, while all other types of immediate reactions fall into the category of hypersensitivity reactions and are either allergic or pseudoallergic (allergy-like) in nature (8, 9).</para>

          <title>Acute Reactions to Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents</title>
    <para>These latter two reactions are clinically indistinguishable due to their symptomatic similarities. However, they vastly differ mechanistically. Allergy-like reactions lack immunological specificity and do not require previous exposure to the triggering antigen to elicit a response (10). Conversely, allergic reactions are characterized by immunological specificity and transferability. In cases of an allergic reaction, the patient's immune system is able to recognize and mount an immune response against an antigen, particularly due to subsequent exposures to the same antigen (10). Allergy-like reactions are not associated with immunological specificity but with direct release of histamine and other mediators from activated mast cells and circulating basophils and eosinophils, activation of the contact and complement systems, conversion of L-arginine into nitric oxide, and activation of the XII clotting system leading to the production of bradykinin (11). Current clinical evidence shows that most acute reactions to GBCAs are allergy-like in nature (8). However, cases of true allergic reactions to GBCAs have been reported (9, 12-14).</para>
    <para>The severity of immediate GBCA reactions can range from non-serious and mild in intensity (i.e., transient and self-resolving symptoms), to life-threatening events, as shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>. Most acute reactions to GBCAs are mild, self-limiting, and do not require specific treatment. However, serious immediate reactions, such as anaphylactic or anaphylactic-like</para>

    <para>events, may rarely occur (less than 1 in every 10,000 administered doses) (15-25). Serious adverse reactions may result in patient hospitalizations, prolongation of hospitalization, permanent morbidity, or even have a fatal outcome, especially if they are not promptly recognized and properly managed (15, 26).</para>
    <para>This chapter aims to provide information on the following: (1) how to identify patients who may be at risk for developing serious acute reactions; (2) how to properly assess the risks and benefits of using GBCAs in individual patients; (3) the preventative measures that should be adopted; (4) when and how to promptly recognize the type of acute reaction; and (5) the treatments that are recommended for patients experiencing serious adverse reactions. These recommendations are based on guidance documents developed and published by leading scientific societies (2, 15, 27).</para>

          <title>WHAT TO DO BEFORE THE EXAM</title>
    <para>To prevent or minimize the risk of complications following administration of GBCAs, the following five steps should be adhered to before any contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam: (1) be aware of possible complications; (2) know your patient; (3) assess risk/benefit of GBCA administration; (4) adopt preventative measures, if and when necessary; and (5) be prepared to manage any adverse reaction.</para>
          <sect4 id="ch0012s0000s0001s0003s0001">
            <title>(1) Be Aware of Possible Complications</title>
    <para>Before proceeding with a contrast-enhanced MRI exam, all personnel should be familiar with all of the possible risk factors and be knowledgeable about the entire spectrum of adverse events that may occur after the administration of the GBCA to be used. This can be achieved by carefully reading the prescribing information, being fluent with the relevant literature and, if needed, requesting specific safety information from the manufacturer. Documentation of continuing medical education of all involved healthcare professionals related to the use of GBCAs should be maintained.</para>
    <para>Also, healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential for acute reactions to drugs administered concomitantly for the sake of the MRI procedure, such as drugs used to reduce anxiety, to sedate the patient, for analgesia or anesthesia, antihistamines, or pharmacologic stressors.</para>
          </sect4>
          <sect4 id="ch0012s0000s0001s0003s0002">
            <title>(2) Know Your Patient</title>
    <para>Risk factors associated with the development of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to GBCAs are well known. However, the occurrence of acute adverse reactions is substantially unpredictable, and allergic or allergy-like acute reactions, including serious ones, are frequently observed in the absence of risk factors.</para>
    <para>Patients at risk for developing acute reactions include those who have experienced prior reactions to a GBCA (2, 15, 20, 27, 28). These patients are eight times more likely to experience subsequent reactions, the severity of which may be greater than that of previous reactions (29). Patients with underlying asthma or allergic diathesis, including hypersensitivity to food, chemicals, or other medications, are also considered to be at increased risk. Al-</para>
    <para>though there is no cross-reactivity, patients with known hypersensitivity to other types of medical imaging agents (e.g., radiocontrast iodinated agents) should be considered at higher risk for the development of hypersensitivity reactions to GBCAs (2, 15, 20, 28).</para>
    <para>Patients receiving treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers have been reported to be at increased risk for experiencing hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated agents due to an increase in the release of mediators involved in anaphylaxis (30). Importantly, in the event that a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, beta-blocking agents may decrease the cardiovascular compensatory changes to the anaphylactic shock, and epinephrine (adrenaline) may be ineffective or promote paradoxical reflex vagotonic effects when used to resolve the reaction (31-34).</para>
    <para>Therefore, before administering a GBCA, the healthcare professionals responsible for the procedure should be aware of the patient's pre-existing conditions, including the main known or suspected diseases and any potential co-morbidities, identify any possible risk factors, and ensure all medications the patient is taking have been identified. It is recommended to use a questionnaire to in order to ensure possible risk factors are identified and to best assess the risk of GBCA use in individual patients. Finally, attention should be also given to the emotional state of patients. Anxiety may cause panic attacks with symptoms that may mimic hypersensitivity reactions. Also, under high stress situations, vasovagal reactions may occur as well and it may be difficult to distinguish them from real hypersensitivity reactions. Severe acute reactions to GBCAs can be mitigated at least in part by having a calm, relaxing atmosphere, and experienced personnel familiar with the GBCAs being utilized and able to reduce anxiety (28).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">(3) Assess Risk-Benefit of GBCA Administration</emphasis></para>
    <para>Patient risk versus potential benefit of the GBCA-enhanced MRI examination should be evaluated and possibly documented on an individual basis by the referring physician and the radiologist for each patient. The radiologist should also consider the risk-benefit ratio of imaging alternatives. If a GBCA-enhanced exam is based on a valid clinical indication, patients should be properly informed about its risks and benefits and provided written informed consent.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">(4) Adopt Preventative Measures, If And When Necessary</emphasis></para>
    <para>There are no widely accepted policies for dealing with patients who have experienced prior reactions to GBCAs and the need for subsequent exposure to the same or other GBCAs. However, even in the absence of supportive evidence, it is suggested that in the case of a patient who experiences an acute reaction to a GBCA and requires a future contrast-enhanced MRI, every effort should be made to determine if a GBCA is absolutely necessary, and if so, identify the specific GBCA that elicited the initial reaction so that a different agent may be selected for use (2, 15, 27).</para>
    <para>Premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines is recommended for patients with a history of previous hypersensitivity reactions to GBCAs, allergies or known hypersensitivity to drugs or chemicals (2, 15). Two premedication regimens (Table 2) have been recommended (15, 35, 36), of which the adults dosing regimens are summarized as follows:</para>

    <para>events, have been observed after GBCA administration in pre-medicated patients, and radiology teams must be prepared to treat breakthrough reactions when they occur (37-42).</para>
    <para>Oral corticosteroids should be used with caution in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, active tuberculosis, systemic fungal infections, active peptic ulcer, or diverticulitis. Antihistamines may cause drowsiness and should not be taken shortly before operating a vehicle. Some patients have experienced allergies to the individual medications used in premedication (15). Also, premedication may cause a delay in diagnosis imparted by the multi-hour duration of premedication, increase hospital length of stay, increase time to imaging exam, increase hospital-acquired infection risk, and increase costs compared to non-premedicated controls (43). The indirect harms of premedication likely overshadow the benefits of premedication in some vulnerable populations (15).</para>
    <para>Pretreatment may create a false sense of security, so that healthcare providers may neglect appropriate measures to monitor patients and to treat adverse reactions. It is important to note that no premedication strategy is a substitute for preparedness to treat adverse reactions.</para>

            <title>(5) Be Prepared to Manage Any Adverse Reaction</title>
    <para>Prerequisites to managing acute reactions include properly trained personnel and well-designed treatment plans. Personnel should be periodically and effectively trained to rapidly recognize and assess acute adverse reactions and take all the necessary steps to initiate appropriate treatment, with properly documented review sessions and assessments. Periodic training of onsite health care providers in cardiopulmonary resuscitation techniques, including basic life support or advanced cardiac life support, is recommended. Staff should be also aware of how to activate the emergency response system to elevate the level of care if needed in extreme cases. The contact phone number of the cardiopulmonary arrest emergency response team (i.e., the Code Blue team) should be clearly posted within or near any room in which a GBCA is to be injected.</para>
    <para>All MRI facilities should have readily available, basic equipment and medications needed to assess and treat acute reactions. As shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis>, this list includes but is not limited to equipment to assess a patient, such as stethoscope, blood pressure and pulse monitor, pulse oximeter, as well as medications and equipment needed to treat a patient, such as sterile saline for intravenous injection, epinephrine, atropine, diphenhydramine, beta-agonist inhalers, oxygen, intubation equipment, and a cardiac defibrillator (2, 15). MRI facilities should institute periodic monitoring programs to ensure functionality of equipment and confirm all medications are within expiration date limits (2, 15). The equipment to assess and treat acute reactions must be readily available and within or nearby any room in which a GBCA is to be injected. The number and distribution of carts designed to treat acute adverse reactions should be tailored to the size of the imaging facility.</para>

    <para>Finally, at-risk patients should be scheduled during daytime hours when more personnel are available to assist in the event of an adverse reaction, preferably at a hospital-based MRI facility, wherein a code team is readily available to help manage life-threatening reactions.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">WHAT TO DO DURING THE MRI EXAM</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">(1) Monitor Patients During the Procedure</emphasis>The vast majority of patients undergoing a contrast-enhanced MR exam do not experience any adverse event. However, even if rare, serious complications may occur. Therefore, it is imperative that practitioners monitor all patients receiving a GBCA closely during the procedure and remain in the immediate vicinity for at least 30 to 45 minutes following the contrast injection. If there is an increased risk of an adverse reaction, venous access should be left in place (8). Some patients are quick to report minor symptoms, while others may wait until symptoms are more severe before alerting health care personnel. Thus, patients should be instructed to call for help as soon as they experience any symptoms.</para>
    <para>Patients with concomitant impaired vision or hearing, neurologic disease, psychiatric illness, such as depression, substance abuse, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or cognitive disorders, may have diminished awareness of hypersensitivity triggers and symptoms. At any age, concurrent use of central nervous system-active medications such as sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants, and first generation sedating H1-antihistamines can interfere with the recognition of symptoms and with the patient's ability to describe symptoms.</para>
    <para>Most severe reactions (94 to 100%) occur within 20 minutes of the GBCA injection; therefore, it is imperative that equipment and medications be immediately available, but positioned for use outside the MR system room (8). Patients requiring treatment should be quickly moved from the scanner room to a safe area away from the influence of the powerful static magnetic, using an MR Conditional transport stretcher or other suitable device so that none of the resuscitative equipment becomes a projectile hazard (15). Assessment of reaction severity is somewhat subjective and, thus, it is difficult to succinctly describe all possible degrees of reaction severity. Sound clinical judgment should be used to determine when and how aggressively an acute reaction should be treated (15).</para>
    <para>Mild reactions are usually self-limiting and do not require treatment (2, 15). Patients who experience mild reactions should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after the first symptoms are reported and longer, if necessary, to ensure there is no progression to a more severe event (15).</para>
    <para>Moderate reactions can be more pronounced and persistent, requiring specific treatment, and may progress if left untreated. Patients experiencing a moderate reaction should have their vital signs closely monitored to make certain that progression to a more serious event is avoided.</para>
    <para>Severe reactions are rare but of utmost concern since they may be life-threatening. While they rarely occur, immediate recognition and treatment is necessary. In many cases,</para>
    <para>life-threatening events begin with mild signs and symptoms, and then rapidly evolve to a severe reaction. As a result, it is imperative that practitioners monitor all patients experiencing minor or moderate adverse reactions until their complete resolution.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">(2) Prompt Recognition of the Type and Severity of Adverse Reactions</emphasis></para>
    <para>In the event of acute reactions, assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, and mentation are necessary before proceeding to management steps. The American College of Radiology (ACR) Manual on Contrast Media recommends that the following assessments be immediately made (15):</para>

    </orderedlist>
    <para>The level of consciousness, appearance of the skin, quality of phonation, lung auscultation, blood pressure and heart rate assessment will allow the responding physician to quickly determine not only the severity of a reaction but also allow for the proper diagnosis of the reaction (15). Once the type and severity of a reaction have been identified, the appropriate treatment should be initiated. In cases of severe reactions, such as cardiopulmonary arrest, it may be necessary to seek additional assistance to obtain access to specialized life-support equipment and the expertise of appropriately trained personnel. The ACR and the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) both publish guidelines for practitioners to use as references. These guidelines, summarized in <emphasis role="bold">Table 4</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Table 5</emphasis>, include information concerning the latest approaches to treatment for various signs and symptoms of acute reactions (2, 15). Patients should be monitored continuously to facilitate prompt detection of any clinical changes or progression to more severe symptoms.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Distinguishing Vasovagal Episodes From Hypersensitivity Reactions.</emphasis> Distinguishing between vagal reactions and hypersensitivity reactions is critical since the approach to treatment is markedly different. Also known as neurally-mediated syncope, vasovagal reactions are characterized by abrupt peripheral vasodilation and hypotension, along with bradycardia. Patients can also experience pallor, nausea, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, but no cutaneous rash, bronchospasm, tachycardia, or angioedema are observed. The exact cause of vagal reactions is unknown, but triggers such as anxiety and fear are known to elicit the response (44, 45).</para>
    <para>In anaphylactic or anaphylactic-like reactions, the most common areas affected include the skin (flushing, itching, urticaria, angioedema in 80 to 90% of cases), respiratory tract (throat itching and tightness, dyspnonia, hoarseness, stridor, dry staccato cough, wheezing/bronchospasm in 70% of cases), gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea in 30 to 45% of cases), heart and vasculature (hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, cardiac arrest in 10 to 45% of cases), and central nervous system (altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, loss of consciousness in 10 to 15% of cases) (46).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Distinguishing Anxiety or Panic Attacks From Hypersensitivity Reactions.</emphasis> An anxiety or panic attack can cause diagnostic confusion because a sense of impending doom, breathlessness, flushing, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal symptoms can occur in both anxiety/panic attacks and in hypersensitivity events. However, urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, and hypotension are unlikely to occur during an anxiety/panic attack (45, 46).</para>
    <para>Be aware of possible difficulties in timely detection of hypersensitivity reactions. In patients with concomitant medical conditions, for example, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, or pre-existing myocardial infarction, signs and symptoms of these diseases can cause confusion in the differential diagnosis of anaphylactic or anaphylactic-type reactions (46).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">(3) Timely and Appropriate Treatment of the Adverse Reaction</emphasis></para>
    <para>The vast majority of patients with moderate-to-severe reactions recover if they are treated quickly and appropriately.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Treatment of Vasovagal Reactions.</emphasis> The pathophysiology of vasovagal syncope is characterized by an activation of the parasympathetic nervous system triggering a rapid decrease in heartbeat (bradycardia), accompanied by an acute loss of sympathetic stimulation causing a reduction of vascular tone and drop of blood pressure (hypotension) (47). Vasovagal reactions are effectively treated by elevating the patient's legs, increasing intravascular fluid volume, and administering atropine to reverse bradycardia (2, 15).</para>
    <para>Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for severe hypersensitivity reactions. Anaphylactic and anaphylactic-like reactions are rapid onset, multisystem, and potentially lethal events that develop very quickly as a result of mast cells and basophils systemically and abruptly releasing mediators of inflammation. Different from vagal reactions, anaphylactic and anaphylactic-like reactions are most effectively treated with rapid infusion of large volumes of fluids, along with epinephrine (2, 15, 48-50). If administered properly and promptly, epinephrine can prevent or reverse the life-threatening symptoms of anaphylactic shock. Patients are at risk for death in as little as five minutes following exposure to GBCAs. Epinephrine is life-saving because it is a mixed alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist with rapid onset of action (48, 49). The alpha-adrenergic vasoconstricting effect reverses vasodilation, thus alleviating hypotension and reducing erythema, urticaria, and angioedema (49-50). Beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity acts to dilate bronchial airways, increase the force of myocardial muscle contraction (inotropy) and heart rate (chronotropy), which increases cardiac output, and attenuates the severity of histamine-induced symptoms via beta-2 receptors on mast cells (48-52). Fatality studies provide the most compelling evidence for prompt epinephrine injection (53-56).</para>
    <para>While epinephrine is recommended as first-line therapy, antihistamines and corticosteroids can be considered as adjunctive therapies and may be tried after epinephrine is administered to help control cutaneous and cardiovascular manifestations such as itching, flushing, urticaria, angioedema, and nasal and eye symptoms, as well as to prevent secondary reactions. There is no evidence that either antihistamines or corticosteroids provide life-saving treatment (i.e., they do not prevent or relieve upper airway obstruction, hypotension, or shock) (49). Besides, antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, have a significantly</para>
    <para>longer onset of action and longer time to peak activity compared with epinephrine (57). Similarly, corticosteroids have the potential to prevent recurrent or protracted episodes, but should not be used in place of, or prior to, epinephrine, as they are not helpful for acute symptoms (49). Of note, administering one or more second-line medications potentially delays prompt injection of epinephrine, the first-line treatment (58-60).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Issues Related to the Use of Epinephrine in the Management of Serious Hypersensitivity.</emphasis> Despite the knowledge that epinephrine can save lives, it may be underused by physicians, health care professionals, and even emergency medical services. Rates of epinephrine use in the emergency department (ED) as first-line treatment of anaphylaxis are generally low, even in patients who have been clearly diagnosed with anaphylaxis (60). In a small 2013 cross-sectional survey of emergency medical health professionals (N = 207) in EDs in the United States, only 42% of healthcare professionals reported using epinephrine for most anaphylactic episodes (61). In a retrospective study analyzing anaphylaxis-related International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes in a large health maintenance organization from 2008 to 2012 (N &gt; 150,000), epinephrine was only used in 16.2% of total anaphylaxis cases (62). In a study of pediatric patients treated in the emergency department for anaphylaxis, high proportions were inappropriately treated with antihistamines (92%) or corticosteroids (78%), while only 54% of patients in this study received epinephrine initially to treat the event (63).</para>
    <para>No use, use of inadequate doses, or delayed use of epinephrine is associated with poor outcomes: fatality, encephalopathy because of hypoxia and/or ischemia, and protracted or biphasic reactions (that is, reactions lasting several hours or a second phase occurring an hour or more after the onset of the first phase, respectively) (60). A patient may still experience serious complications or die in the instance of using epinephrine that has passed its expiration date (48).</para>
    <para>If a patient does not respond to timely and appropriate treatment with epinephrine, positioning on the back with the lower extremities elevated, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and rapid transfer to the care of a team specialized in emergency medicine, critical care medicine, or anesthesiology is recommended (46). Even if it is critical for effectively resolving anaphylactic or anaphylactic-like reactions, the use of epinephrine is not devoid of risk and, therefore, caution should be exercised when using it.</para>
    <para>Common side effects that occur at recommended doses of epinephrine via any route of administration include agitation, anxiety, tremulousness, headache, dizziness, pallor, or palpitations (48). Rarely, and usually associated with overdosage or overly rapid rate of intravenous infusion, epinephrine administration might contribute to or cause myocardial ischemia, pulmonary edema, prolonged ventricular repolarization and arrhythmias, accelerated hypertension, and intracranial hemorrhage in adults and children alike (48). Particularly vulnerable populations are those individuals at the extremes of age and those with hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart disease, or untreated hyperthyroidism (i.e., due to an increased number of beta-adrenergic receptors in the vasculature of these individuals, rendering the myocardium more sensitive to the beta-adrenergic effects of epinephrine) (48).</para>
    <para>Concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blockers decreases the effectiveness of exogenously administered epinephrine. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and possibly angiotensin II receptor blockers may interfere with intrinsic compensatory responses to hypotension. Tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors may impede epinephrine metabolism and lead to increased plasma and tissue concentrations. Cocaine and amphetamines sensitize the myocardium to the effects of epinephrine, thus increasing the risk of toxicity (48).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">WHAT TO DO AFTER THE MRI EXAM</emphasis>If no adverse reaction occurred during the MRI exam, it is advisable to observe patients for 30 minutes after the GBCA administration and those at risk for hypersensitivity reactions may be kept under monitoring for a longer period of time (2, 15). Patients experiencing non–life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions may be observed for four to six hours after successful treatment and then discharged. Patients who experience serious acute reactions (with cardiovascular and/or severe respiratory symptoms) should be admitted or treated and observed for a longer time period in the ED or an observation area.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS</emphasis>GBCAs are, in general, very safe. Serious adverse reactions to GBCAs are fortunately uncommon and fatal reactions are extremely rare. Proper patient evaluation and adequate prophylactic measures can prevent some of these complications. Knowledge, training, and preparation are crucial for appropriate and effective management of these events. Prompt recognition and treatment are invaluable in attenuating an adverse reaction of a patient to GBCAs, and may prevent a reaction from becoming severe or even life threatening.</para>

          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a rare, systemic fibrosing disorder reminiscent, but distinct from scleroderma or scleromyxedema. Its most prominent and visible effects are observed in the skin, which led to the disease originally being named "nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy", or NFD (1). The first cases of NSF were identified in 1997 and the first published report of 14 cases appeared in 2000 (2). "Nephrogenic" does not mean that the disease is caused by factors originating in the kidney, but that NSF has been observed only in patients with acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>), end-stage renal disease, or with acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to hepatorenal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period. "Systemic Fibrosis" emphasizes the systemic nature of this fibrosing disorder. Along with thickening and hardening of the skin, it may involve nerves and skeletal muscles, and it has also been linked with myocardial, pericardial, and pleural fibrosis (2, 3, 4, 5).</para>
    <para>In some patients, NSF may be fatal; however, the disease by itself is not a cause of death. Rather, NSF may contribute to death by restricting effective ventilation, or by restricting mobility to the point of causing an accidental fall that may lead to fractures and clotting complications (4).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Epidemiology</emphasis></para>
    <para>Two extensive, systematic literature reviews provided information on the epidemiology of NSF. The first systematic review was conducted in 2013 and focused on 815 distinct</para>
    <para>cases of NSF with clinical and/or histological confirmation of the condition reported in 200 articles in peer-reviewed literature from 2000 until December 2012 (6). These 200 papers were obtained by performing a literature search of the PubMed database using the following key words: "nephrogenic systemic fibrosis", "nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy", "scleromyxedema-like", and "scleroderma and gadolinium". The second and more recent literature review was based on a search of the same database (PubMed) using the terms "nephrogenic systemic fibrosis," "nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy," and "NSF" from January 2000 until February 2019 and was able to detect 639 distinct cases of NSF in 173 peer-reviewed articles (7). Differently from the previous systematic review, cases without histological confirmation were discarded. Cases from abstracts, letters-to-the-editor, or other correspondence were not included in either of the two systematic reviews if they lacked sufficient information, and duplicates were removed. In several cases, authors were contacted in order to obtain additional information or confirm information reported in the article.</para>
    <para>Results of both systematic reviews showed that NSF affected males and females in approximately equal numbers and was identified in patients from a large variety of ethnic backgrounds and from North America, Europe, and Asia. The disease tends to affect middle-aged adults most commonly (6, 7). No cases of NSF were reported in neonates or toddlers; however, NSF has been confirmed in pediatric patients and elderly adults, with 6 years as the youngest age reported (6), and 87 years the oldest (6, 7).</para>
    <para>In both reviews, almost all the cases of NSF were observed in patients with severe acute or chronic renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>), with acute renal insufficiency due to hepatorenal syndrome, or in the perioperative liver transplantation period (6, 7). The vast majority of patients with NSF (&gt;75%) were on dialysis (6, 7). The few reports of patients developing NSF with eGFR values greater than 29 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript> were actually cases of acute renal failure resulting in eGFR overestimation or errors in the proper estimation of GFR (6).</para>
    <para>In summary, systematic reviews of published reports of NSF indicate that NSF is a rare disease that may occur in patients of either gender and any age or race with severe chronic or acute renal insufficiency or, mostly, end-stage renal disease.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Etiology</emphasis>Despite considerable effort, no case of NSF could be identified before 1997 (8). This truly new disease entity should therefore have resulted from exposure of patients with advanced renal failure to one or more new exogenous agents—that is, a new medication, toxin, or infectious agent—or to new ways of using previously existing medications (9). The first suspect was high-dose erythropoietin (8-10) in the presence of co-factors such as hypercoagulable states, various forms of vascular injury, vascular surgical procedures, and liver failure (in particular, hepatorenal syndrome and liver transplantation) (11). Erythropoietin is the principal therapy for anemia in both dialysis and pre-dialysis patients. Its use and doses dramatically increased after the publication of the Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines for anemia management in 1997, i.e., in the same year that the first case of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy was reported.</para>

            <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     353</title>
    <para>In 2006 Grobner, et al. (12) reported 5 cases of NSF in patients previously exposed to high doses of a GBCA (Omniscan™, active ingredient: gadodiamide) and suggested a possible association between exposure to GBCAs and the development of the condition in patients with severe impairment of renal function. Since that report, GBCAs have been the prime suspect, even though GBCAs had already been widely available for clinical use since the late 1980's, i.e., at least 10 years before the first cases of NSF were identified.</para>
    <para>NSF cases have been observed weeks, months or even years after the administration of certain GBCAs (13). It has been suggested that cumulative lifetime GBCA exposure increases the risk of NSF (4). However, GBCA exposure and renal insufficiency cannot be the sole effectors of NSF. The vast majority of patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic dialysis do not acquire the disease, even following multiple exposures to the GBCAs that have been associated with the highest number of NSF cases. Also, cases of NSF have been reported in patients with no history of GBCA exposure (7, 14-16).</para>
    <para>As for the pathogenesis of NSF, the working hypothesis is that Gd complexes may stay for weeks, months or even years within the skin and other tissues. In the skin of susceptible patients with advanced renal failure, the retained Gd complexes may potentially attract and/or activate circulating fibrocytes, bone marrow-derived cells that participate in normal wound healing and fibrosis. These activated fibroblasts are believed to underlie the aberrant fibrosis seen in NSF (4, 17). These cells are distinct from other fibrocytes in that they have a specific immunophenotype, i.e., the CD34<superscript>-</superscript>/ procollagen I dual positive profile (4, 18). Histology of the skin of patients with NSF reveals increased cellularity, with CD34- and procollagen I-expressing spindle cells, occasional histiocytes, and factor XIIIa+ dendritic cells. Higher levels of retained Gd have been observed in areas of increased cellularity (4, 17). As of today, however, the pathogenesis of NSF is largely unknown, as well as the role that GBCAs might play. (5, 18)</para>
    <para>NSF cases occurring after the sole administration of one GBCA are defined as "single-agent" or "unconfounded." If a case of NSF follows the administration of two or more GBCAs, it is impossible to determine which agent is associated with the development of the disorder, and the case is reported as "multiple-agent" or "confounded" (4).</para>
    <para>Almost all unconfounded NSF cases occurred after single or repeated exposure to three GBCAs: gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist® and generic equivalents), gadoversatamide (OptiMark®), and gadodiamide (Omniscan™) (18). No or very few unconfounded cases were reported following exposure to any of the other GBCAs, i.e., gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance®), gadobutrol (Gadovist®/Gadavist®), gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem and generic equivalents), gadoteridol (ProHance), gadoxetate disodium (Primovist/Eovist) (18).</para>
    <para>Regulatory Authority intervention, culminating in 2009-2010 with the contraindication of these three GBCAs for use in patients with an eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript> due to chronic kidney disease or an acute deterioration of the renal function, dramatically reduced the risk of NSF. The estimated rate of NSF per million exposures up to 2008 (2.07; 95% confidence interval: 1.90, 2.26) fell significantly (p&lt;0.001) to only 0.028 (95% confidence interval: 0.012, 0.060) after 2008. (5, 18)</para>
    <para>Of note, monitoring of NSF based on spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions and literature case reports may lead to underreporting of NSF cases. Missing or inconclusive information in spontaneously reported cases is also a limitation of NSF monitoring (19), as for some reports it may not be possible to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of NSF using the clinicopathological criteria developed by Girardi et al (20). On the other hand, clinical data from large-scale studies of individual GBCAs in high-risk patients, with prolonged and extensive follow-up and systematic collection of all the clinical and pathology information needed for a reliable, accurate diagnosis of NSF, may provide better, more precise information on NSF risk deriving from exposure to individual GBCAs, assuming the patient population is large enough to draw meaningful conclusions.</para>
    <para>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Woolen et al (21) looked at 16 unique studies published between May 2008 and April 2019 that involved 4931 patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD (eGFR, &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m<superscript>2</superscript>) and/or receiving dialysis who underwent MRI with one of four low-risk GBCAs (gadobenate dimeglumine, gadoterate meglumine, gadobutrol, gadoteridol). The outcome measure required for inclusion was assessment of unconfounded incidence of NSF. The pooled incidence of NSF across these 4931 patients was 0 (0%; upper boundary of 95% CI, 0.07%). The upper bounds of the 95% CIs varied on a study-specific basis owing to differences in study-specific eligible sample sizes. Nevertheless, the greatest safety margin (i.e., largest sample size) was for gadobenate dimeglumine (upper bound 95% CI, 0.12% [0 of 3167]), followed by gadoterate meglumine (0.31% [0 of 1204]) gadobutrol (1.11% [0 of 330]), and gadoteridol (1.59% [0 of 230]). Consistent with these findings, recent updates to the guidelines released by the American College of Radiology, ACR (3), the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (22), and the Canadian Association of Radiologists (23) support use of indicated low-risk GBCAs in patients with eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m<superscript>2</superscript>. These conclusions have been echoed in a consensus statement from the ACR and National Kidney Foundation (24). The findings reported by Woolen, et al. (21) have since been substantiated in a recent systematic review by Lunyera, et al (25). Recent results from a retrospective study also showed no cases of NSF following administration of gadoxetic acid (Primovist/Eovist) to 153 patients with severely impaired renal function (26).</para>
    <para>Although the risk of NSF from administration of low-risk GBCAs in patients with severely impaired renal function is very low, likely less than 0.07%, it is important to note that there have been rare reports of clinically and histologically confirmed cases of NSF following exposure to these safer agents. Therefore, guidelines aimed at minimizing risk should nevertheless still be followed.</para>

          <title>DIAGNOSIS</title>
    <para>NSF is different from adverse events usually encountered by radiologists because it does not occur at the time of the imaging study. Instead, NSF typically occurs days to months later. Individually, the clinical and pathological features of NSF are not unique to that disease, so that no single test or other finding can be relied on to be 100% sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of NSF (20, 27). A confident diagnosis may be reached only through the combination of clinical history, a physical examination, and compelling histologic features of a biopsy specimen of involved skin (20, 27). A clinicopathological defini-</para>

    <para>tion of NSF developed by a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced clinicians and dermatopathologists is the universally accepted reference to diagnose NSF (20). This definition relies upon a combination of clinical and pathological findings derived from the study of numerous patients, the relevant medical literature, and histological slides and data contained within the Yale NSF Registry to create a reproducible diagnostic and workup scheme for putative cases of NSF. As mentioned previously, to date, NSF has been observed only in patients either with acute or chronic renal insufficiency or, mostly end-stage renal disease. Therefore, the main elements that should guide physicians in the diagnostic process are clinical presentation and confirmatory cutaneous histopathologic findings in the setting of decreased or absent glomerular filtration, either acutely or chronically (4, 20, 27).</para>

    <para>The skin changes caused by NSF can mimic progressive systemic sclerosis with a predilection for extremity involvement that can extend to the torso (4, 14, 20, 21). Unlike scleroderma, NSF usually spares the face (4, 20, 27). Skin lesions typically begin with swelling, progressing to erythematous papules and coalescing violaceous to hyperpigmented, brawny plaques with follicular dimpling (peau d'orange) changes (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>) (4, 20, 27, 28). Peripheral irregular fingerlike or ameboid projections may be present along with islands of sparing (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>) (20, 28, 29). The involved skin and subcutis can become markedly thickened and hardened, unpinchable, with a wooden consistency to palpation (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>) (4, 20, 26, 27). The indurations characteristically involve the distal extremities first, gradually proceeding to involve the proximal extremities to the level of the mid-thigh and mid-upper arms where they may show a pattern of bumpiness ("cobblestoning") (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>) (4, 20, 26, 27).

    <para>sufficient findings to make a more confident diagnosis in cases of superficial lesions. However, it is always better to obtain deeper biopsy specimens because the disease characteristically extends along fibrous septa into subcutaneous fat and fascia and sometimes into underlying skeletal muscle (20). For lesions of differing morphologies and/or locations, multiple cutaneous biopsy specimens are recommended (20). Histologically, NSF is characterized by dermal fibrosis and may be indistinguishable from scleromyxedema (20, 27, 28). Preserved elastic tissue is a finding that allows dermatopathologists to distinguish NSF from morphea and scleroderma (20). In NSF, there is always an increased number of fibroblasts that are CD34-positive and procollagen I–positive when stained immunohistochemically (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). This dual positivity is characteristic of so-called "circulating fibroblasts," mesenchymal stem cells of bone marrow origin that participate in wound repair (29). Other features that, if present, help make a more confident diagnosis of NSF are: increased numbers of spindled and/or epithelioid cells (i.e., activated macrophages resembling epithelial cells) with few other inflammatory cells in the dermis; thin, especially in early lesions, and thick collagen bundles that generally maintain clefts of separation between their neighbors; involvement of subcutaneous septa which are markedly widened and collagenized as described above; osseous metaplasia, with foci of osteoid deposition, or calcified bone spicules around elastic fibers, which are considered a highly specific feature of NSF (20, 27, 28, 30).</para>

    <para>The risk of NSF from administration of the safer GBCAs gadobenate dimeglumine, gadoteridol, gadobutrol, and gadoterate meglumine in patients with severely impaired renal function is very low, likely less than 0.07%. Therefore, the identification of patients at risk using a questionnaire or laboratory testing prior to exposure to these agents can be considered optional (3). On the contrary, it is highly recommended before intravenous administration of any other GBCA.</para>
    <para>Clinical laboratories now routinely report eGFR based on filtration markers. The most common filtration marker used is creatinine, for which laboratory assays have been standardized since 2003 (33). The preferred estimating equation in the United States and much of the world is the CKD-EPI 2009 creatinine equation, which is more accurate than the earlier MDRD equation, particularly for eGFR values greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript> (33). Anyway, neither equation is suitable if renal function is in an unstable condition, that is, in patients with acute renal failure or on dialysis. Results may also deviate from true values in patients with exceptional dietary intake (e.g., vegetarian diet, high protein diet, creatine supplements), extreme body composition (e.g., very lean, obese, paraplegia), or severe liver disease. In view of this latter limitation, patients with hepatorenal syndrome and those with reduced renal function who have had or are awaiting liver transplantation should be considered at risk of NSF if they have any level of GFR below 60-mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>.</para>

    <para>There is no evidence to guide the time interval within which eGFR should be obtained prior to GBCA injection on patients identified by screening to have one or more risk factor for compromised renal function. However, it is recommended to measure renal function within two to seven days before the date of the contrast-enhanced procedure.</para>
    <para>A single normal eGFR measurement usually does not rule out acute renal insufficiency since there is a delay between a change in renal function and the corresponding change in serum creatinine (4). The patient's clinical condition should, therefore, also be assessed close to the time of the procedure and, if factors that could cause acute renal failure are detected, the renal function should be measured again before the GBCA is given (4). In practice all patients with suspected acute renal failure should be considered at risk of developing NSF, regardless of measured serum creatinine or calculated GFR values (4).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 2. Assess Risk–Benefit of Contrast-Enhanced MRI in Patients at Risk</emphasis></para>
    <para>A patient at risk of NSF should receive a GBCA only when no suitable diagnostic alternatives are available and a thorough risk–benefit assessment for that patient indicates that the benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk of NSF (3, 4, 22, 23). The risk–benefit evaluation should be made by the radiologist in conjunction with the referring physician and should be properly and prospectively documented. History of previous exposures to GBCAs, especially if recent, or if other factors that are thought to act as possible co-triggers of the disease, such as metabolic acidosis, vascular surgery, thrombotic events, and so on, should be taken into account during the risk–benefit assessment of each individual at-risk patient. Patients or parents or guardians (in the case of minors) should be properly informed of the benefits, risks, and diagnostic alternatives based on all the information available at that time and should provide their consent in writing (3, 4, 22, 23).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 3. Perform Any Unenhanced MRI Sequence That May Be Helpful Before Injecting the MRI Contrast Agent</emphasis></para>
    <para>Even after the decision is made to perform a contrast-enhanced MR examination, and the patient has consented to receive a GBCA, the prescribing information for individual GBCAs all indicate that the use of GBCAs should be avoided unless the diagnostic information from the use of contrast is essential and not available with unenhanced MRI. Therefore, all unenhanced MRI pulse sequences that may help to make a diagnosis should be performed and the MR images should be evaluated by an experienced radiologist to ensure that the administration of a GBCA is still deemed necessary.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 4. Choice of the GBCA and Dose</emphasis></para>
    <para>To minimize risk of NSF development, no GBCA containing gadodiamide, gadoversetamide, or gadopentetate dimeglumine should ever be used in patients with severely impaired renal function. Any of the low-risk GBCAs (gadobenate dimeglumine, gadoxetate</para>
    <para>disodium, gadoteridol, gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine) can be used instead when clinically indicated (3, 22, 23).</para>
    <para>The recommendations for use in at-risk patients are to use the lowest dose of a low-risk GBCA required to obtain the needed clinical information and to not exceed the recommended single dose. Moreover, a sufficient period of time is required to allow elimination of the drug from the body prior to re-administration. Note that the lowest diagnostic dose has not been thoroughly investigated for many indications or all the low-risk GBCAs and therefore, caution should be exercised so as not to administer a dose that is too low to provide the diagnostic information sought from the examination.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 5. What to Do After the MRI Examination</emphasis></para>
    <para>The GBCA and dose used should be accurately recorded. Patients at risk of NSF should be followed up for at least twelve months following the contrast-enhanced MRI examination in order to detect any sign or symptom suggestive of the disease. It is recommended to notify the local regulatory authorities immediately of any putative case of NSF and to keep them informed until the diagnosis of NSF is confirmed or ruled out.</para>
    <para>The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown. However, it is recommended that elective GBCA-enhanced MRI examinations be performed as closely before hemodialysis as is possible, as prompt postprocedural hemodialysis, although unproven to date, may reduce the likelihood that NSF will develop (3). Because it may be difficult for a dialysis center to alter dialysis schedules at the request of imaging departments, it may be more feasible for elective imaging studies to be timed to precede a scheduled dialysis session. Some experts recommend multiple dialysis sessions following GBCA administration, with use of prolonged dialysis times and increased flow rates and volumes to facilitate GBCA clearance, but the incremental benefits remain speculative (3). It has been estimated that three consecutive hemodialysis treatments over a six-day period would be needed to remove 97% of the administered extracellular GBCA (36). Peritoneal dialysis probably provides less potential NSF risk reduction compared to hemodialysis and should not be considered protective (4).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis></para>
    <para>NSF is a rare, serious, systemic, fibrosing disorder observed almost only in patients with acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (GFR &lt;30-mL/min/1.73-m<superscript>2</superscript>), or with acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to hepatorenal syndrome, or in the perioperative liver transplantation period. Most patients with NSF had a GFR &lt;15- mL/min/1.73-m<superscript>2</superscript> and were undergoing (or had undergone) either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or both.</para>
    <para>It is unclear if GBCAs can trigger NSF. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to assume that a potential association might exist for all GBCAs. Use of the preventive measures discussed in this chapter may minimize the risk of developing NSF.</para>
    <para>Notably, altered patterns of use of GBCAs in susceptible populations in response to restrictive measures taken by regulatory authorities for some GBCAs and guidelines released</para>
    <para>by professional societies to minimize risk have resulted in the incidence of NSF dropping close to zero (5, 18, 24).</para>

          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>More than 8 years after the first report of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), incidental retention of gadolinium (Gd) was reported to occur in the brain following exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) (1). The main finding was increased T1-weighted signal intensity (SI) on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images in certain portions of the brain (e.g., dentate nuclei and globi pallidi), particularly in instances where patients had undergone multiple contrast-enhanced MRI examinations. Following studies also implied Gd retention in brain tissues by determining change in SI or R1 relaxation rate on unenhanced MR images of the brain (2,3). Confirmation that those imaging findings were indeed related to retention of Gd in the brain required direct determination of Gd presence by means of analytical chemistry methods, such as inductively coupled plasma combined with mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). ICP-MS is a highly sensitive but destructive technique that reports only on the elemental composition and not on form of the Gd, i.e., whether it is still present as intact contrast agent molecule or other chemical forms (3). A large body of studies has clearly shown that indeed traces of Gd remain in the brain following exposure to GBCAs including in people with normal kidney function (3). The magnitude of observed retention is always in the order of few micrograms per gram of wet tissue. In animal studies, the highest levels of retained Gd have been observed after intravenous administration of gadodiamide (Omniscan™), followed by gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist® and generic equivalents). Lower levels have been reported after administration gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance®) and gadoxetate disodium (Primovist®/Eovist®). The lowest levels were found after exposure to gadobutrol (Gadovist®/Gadavist®), gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem® and generic equivalents, e.g., Clariscan™), and gadoteridol (ProHance®).</para>

          <title>Gadolinium Retention in Brain and Body Tissues – Safety Considerations</title>
    <para>Although it had been known for decades that Gd is retained in other tissues, such as in skin, bone and liver tissues, and Gd retention is lower in the brain than in other organs (2, 3), the discovery of possible Gd retention in brain tissues raised a number of questions related to the safety of GBCAs, that is, chronic retention of traces of residual Gd species from GBCAs associated with damage of involved tissues? Is there evidence of clinically relevant harm to patients? Does the available evidence change the benefit/risk balance of GBCAs? This chapter is aimed at providing evidence to address these fundamental questions.</para>
          <sect4 id="ch0014s0000s0001s0002s0001">
            <title>Long-term Gd retention in the brain: any evidence of chronic neurotoxicity?</title>
    <para>Data in the context of possible neurotoxicity after exposure of cells and tissues to Gd exist within a hierarchy that is not always acknowledged and considered throughout experimentation, discussion of results and especially when drawing conclusions. At the bottom of the hierarchy are data obtained <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> under extreme experimental conditions, which usually do not occur <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> in any biological system. For instance, several <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> experiments aimed at assessing the potential for neurotoxic effects of GBCAs investigated the effect of direct and prolonged exposure of Purkinje cells, astrocytes, or cortical neurons to Gd ions from the dissociation of Gd chloride (GdCl<subscript>3</subscript>) (4-6). However, free Gd ions cannot survive in biological fluids or tissues because they have a high affinity for abundantly present anions like phosphates, carbonates and citrates, and, to a lesser extent, macromolecules. As a matter of fact, preliminary speciation analysis showed that Gd appears to be retained in insoluble forms (most likely bound to anions), soluble high-molecular-weight complexes (Gd bound to macromolecules), or low-molecular-weight molecules (most likely intact GBCA molecules) (7, 8). Therefore, the concept of direct toxicity of Gd ions, acting as calcium antagonists and blocking voltage-gated calcium channels in the human brain and other tissues following the release of the metal from GBCAs is a pure myth, which, however, appears pretty difficult to debunk.</para>
    <para>Data more predictive of possible neurotoxic effects in humans may be provided by <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> studies in animals. Several studies in different animal species have confirmed longterm brain retention of traces of Gd-containing species following doses of GBCAs exceeding clinical doses by several orders of magnitude but always failed to demonstrate any evidence of injury to neurons, glial cells, or the brain interstitium from retained Gd (3, 811). Some of these studies also found no adverse effects of long-term retention of the metal on cognitive or motor function in neonatal, juvenile and adult animals (12-14). These results are consistent with those of a recent investigation aimed at assessing the adverse central nervous system effect of Gd deposition by using a rotarod performance test (15). The authors concluded that Gd deposition did not lead to alterations in locomotor abilities in healthy mice, although their mouse model was obtained by long-term (90 weeks) oral administration of GdCl<subscript>3</subscript>.</para>
    <para>Some evidence of potential neurotoxicity was reported by Khairinisa, et al. (16) in pregnant BALB/c mice. Prenatal exposure (embryonic days 15 to 19) to intravenous gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem®) or gadodiamide (Omniscan™) was associated with abnormal behaviors and decreased muscle strength of offspring. Of note, the sponsor Bracco had already conducted two perinatal/postnatal studies the effects of the macrocyclic GBCA gadoteridol (ProHance®) and of the linear GBCA gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance®) on the off-</para>
    <para>spring of female mice exposed to intravenous bolus injections up to 4 times the clinical dose for 12 consecutive days during gestation (17,18). The evaluation went from implantation throughout the fetal period and continued through sexual maturity of the offspring until day 70 postpartum. Among the observations performed during the two studies, the Functional Observational Battery (FOB) included sensorimotor responses to visual, acoustic, tactile and painful stimuli (reactivity and sensitivity). These two studies did not show any effect of the two GBCAs on the cognitive or motor function of the offspring, nor decreased muscle strength. Anyway, the study by Khairinisa, et al. (16) drew the attention to a possible effect of exposure to GBCAs during pregnancy on brain development of the fetus, despite existing data and even if the transferability to humans of the results from the mouse model used in that small animal study could not be properly assessed due to significant limitations of the study. That led the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request all marketing authorization holders to carry out additional, large juvenile and perinatal/postnatal mice studies with all the GBCAs in clinical use. As expected, the preliminary results of these regulatory safety animal studies do not confirm the findings reported by Khairinisa, et al. (16)</para>
    <para>In conclusion, in vivo studies in several animal species have not yet provided evidence of chronic toxicity arising from retained Gd in brain tissues.</para>
    <para>At the pinnacle of the hierarchy of scientific evidence are data obtained from human subjects. Several post-mortem studies assessed potential signs of neurotoxicity using structural histopathology assessments and transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX) to identify possible ultrastructural changes (18-23). Histologic examination of brain tissues did not show gross histologic changes between contrast and control groups in hematoxylin-eosin–stained tissue samples examined with visual light microscopy. In one study of pediatric patients, dentate tissue from two patients, one with pontine glioma and one with neuroblastoma who received high cumulative doses of gadodiamide (Omniscan™), had mildly to severely gliotic regions with prominent axonal spheroids (22). It is likely, however, that these changes were associated with prior external beam radiation therapy. TEM-EDX DID not show ultrastructural abnormalities.</para>
    <para>In vivo studies in humans also showed a substantial absence of clinical neurological and neuropsychological worsening related to cumulative GBCA doses. Cao, et al. (24) conducted a retrospective study aimed at comparing brain T1 signal changes in patients exposed to GBCAs while on chronic hemodialysis to matched control patients with near-normal renal function (eGFR &gt;60 mL/min per 1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>). Because dialysis patients were regularly evaluated by nurses and physicians, typically 3 times per week, there was also an opportunity to search for patterns of clinical events that might be occurring after each exposure to GBCAs in these patients. An electronic medical records search of 2 large medical centers identified 25 patients who received linear GBCAs while on hemodialysis and had unenhanced T1-weighted images of the brain before and after. T1-weighted SI analysis was performed to detect abnormal T1 shortening in the dentate nucleus (DN) and globus pallidus (GP) in the patients on hemodialysis compared with 25 age/sex/GBCA exposure–matched control patients with normal or near-normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt;60 mL/min per 1.73m<superscript>2</superscript>). Two additional control groups included 13 patients on hemodialysis without GBCA exposure and 13 age/sex-matched patients with estimated</para>
    <para>glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>. The 25 dialysis patients received 44 administrations of linear GBCAs. A greater T1 SI change in the dentate nucleus (but not in the globus pallidus) was observed in dialysis patients receiving GBCA compared to matched patients with normal or near-normal renal function. Despite evidence of abnormal T1 shortening and Gd retention, there was no increase or unique pattern of clinical events occurring within 30 days after any of the 44 GBCA exposures in this cohort. In particular, 7 neurological issues described during the 30 days following GBCA doses (migraine headache, loss of consciousness, memory loss, falling, lightheadedness, and ataxia) were also present before GBCA exposure.</para>
    <para>Welk, et al. (25) conducted a population-based study to assess the association between Gd exposure and parkinsonism using multiple and linked administrative databases from Ontario, Canada. Patients who were exposed to GBCA-enhanced MRIs, modeled as a time-varying, cumulative count variable, were compared with patients who received unenhanced MRIs and were never exposed to GBCAs. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of parkinsonism based on a validated definition (sensitivity, 81.7%; specificity, 99.7%; positive predictive value, 78.0%; negative predictive value, 99.8%; accuracy, 99.5%; and disease prevalence, 1.4%) using diagnosis codes from hospital admissions and physician visits or a dispensed Parkinson disease–specific medication (24). Since medication coverage is provided in Ontario, Canada for those older than 65 years, only patients of 66 years of age or older were included in the study. At the same time, to avoid confounding factors, patients who underwent MRI of the central nervous system (CNS), neurosurgery or had pre-existing Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism were excluded. Of the 246,557 patients undergoing at least 1 non-CNS MRI during the study period, 146,818 (59.5%) underwent 1 or more unenhanced MRI and 99,739 (40.5%) received at least 1 GBCA dose. Among patients who underwent contrast-enhanced MRIs, 81,827 (81.5%) were exposed to a single GBCA injection, 11,278 (15.8%) to 2-3 injections, and 6,634 to 4 or more injections. Incident parkinsonism developed in 1.16% of unexposed patients and in 1.17% of those exposed to GBCAs. In adjusted analysis, there was no significantly increased hazard of parkinsonism among patients with cumulative exposure to GBCAs compared with those never exposed to the agents. Of note, the incidence rate of parkinsonism was lower (0.70%) in the cohort of patients exposed 4 or more times to GBCAs.</para>
    <para>McDonald, et al. (27, 28) reported findings from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA), a large study of the incidence and natural history of normal and abnormal (mild cognitive impairment and dementia) cognitive decline over time. While this study was not initially conceived to identify the neurologic effects of GBCA exposure, it remained an ideal dataset for such an investigation as it was a prospectively enrolled, population-based cohort with unique linkage to demographic, clinical and vital records data provided from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), a large population-based study of human health (29). The MCSA continuously enrolled patients in a prospective manner since study initiation on October 1, 2004. After enrollment, all patients underwent extensive longitudinal clinical (neurologic evaluation, neuropsychological testing) and imaging (unenhanced MRI and PET/CT) assessment at baseline and 15-month follow-up intervals. After searching the electronic medical record and REP data, patients were segregated into those with no history of prior GBCA exposure (control group) and those who underwent prior GBCA-enhanced MRI examinations.

Of note, GBCA exposure was independent of MCSA participation and, as a result of MCSA inclusion and exclusion criteria, was not related to an underlying neuropathologic process that could confound the results of the analysis. All study subjects underwent a large battery of neurologic and neurocognitive tests. Among 4261 cognitively normal study participants aged 50-89 (mean age at enrollment: 72 years), 1092 patients (25.6%) received one or more GBCA doses (range: 1-28 doses) unrelated to their participation in the MCSA. The GBCA exposed group was followed prospectively for a total of 7,104 person years and had a total of 83,119 person-years of retrospective clinical data available from the REP. Similarly, the control group was followed prospectively for a total of 16,078 person years with a total of 236,384 person years of retrospective clinical data available from the REP. After adjusting for over 20 demographic and clinical variables including age, sex, education level, baseline neurocognitive performance, Charlson comorbidity index, and ApoE4 status, exposure to the least stable GBCA, gadodiamide (Omniscan™), did not turn out to be a significant predictor of excess decline in cognitive function or motor performance. A total of 670 (16%) of the 4261 participants who were initially cognitively normal at the time of enrollment progressed to mild cognitive impairment during the study timeframe. The incidence of progression to cognitive decline in the GBCA-exposed group, standardized by age, sex, and education level to the Olmsted County population, was 29.1 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 25.7-31.2) while the control group was 27.6 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 24.9-30.4). After adjusting for age, sex, education level, and other covariates, neither GBCA exposure nor cumulative lifetime GBCA dose was associated with significant excess risk of conversion to cognitive impairment in the study population.</para>
    <para>The previous studies, showing no effect of exposure to GBCAs on cognitive function or motor skills in special and vulnerable populations, such as elderly subjects and patients with impaired renal function, specifically excluded patients with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system, to avoid any confounding bias. So, what about possible additional neurological damage in patients with neurological disorders, especially those requiring multiple GBCA-enhanced MRI exams? Forslin, et al. (30) conducted a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study aimed at investigating the relationship of multiple GBCA administrations with SI increase in the DN and GP, and any possible effect on cognitive function in 23 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who had undergone physical disability assessments and neurological and neuropsychological evaluations at 3 time points during 18-years of follow-up. A cohort of 23 healthy, age-/gender-matched subjects were used as single time-point controls. All control subjects underwent one unenhanced MRI scan. An increase in SI in the dentate nucleus was observed in the MS cohort and was associated with lower verbal fluency scores, which remained significant after correction for several aspects of disease severity. The same group reported cross-sectional cohort study of 85 patients with MS and 23 age- and sex-matched healthy controls without exposure to GBCAs (31). Single time-point physical disability assessments and neurological and neuropsychological evaluations were carried out in MS patients and controls. Longitudinal (T1) and transversal (T2) relaxation rates relaxometry of dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and thalamus was used to assess possible Gd retention in those brain areas. Higher relaxation was associated with lower information-processing speed (dentate nucleus, thalamus) and verbal fluency (caudate nucleus, thalamus). No associations were found with physical disability</para>

    <para>or fatigue. Because a decrease in verbal fluency and information-processing speed are the cognitive domains most commonly affected in MS, and the controls in both studies were just matched for age and sex, the authors of these two studies were not able to separate the effects of the disease itself from a possible toxicity of the GBCAs. A more recent retrospective study of 74 relapsing-remitting MS patients investigated the relationship between changes in the expanded disability status scale, T1-weighted hyperintensity and higher longitudinal relaxation rate in the dentate nucleus and (R1) maps, and confirmed the absence of association between imaging findings suggestive of Gd retention and progression of physical disability (32). Another retrospective study evaluated the association between lifetime cumulative doses of the least stable, linear agent gadodiamide (Omniscan™), increased SI within the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, and thalamus, and disease progression in patients with early MS (33). A total of 203 patients with MS (107) with baseline and followup MRI assessments) and 262 age- and sex-matched controls were included in this study. Patients with MS had disease duration &lt;2 years at baseline and received exclusively gadodiamide (Omniscan™) at all MRI time points. The mean follow-up time was 55.4 months, and the mean number of gadolinium-based contrast agents administrations was 9.2. No significant association was observed between imaging signs of Gd retention and outcomes of disease severity, i.e., accumulation of lesion burden, development of brain atrophy, occurrence of relapses, or increase in disability over the years of follow-up. Finally, two studies assessed possible structural damage to the dentate nuclei in patients with MS exposed to multiple administrations of either linear or macrocyclic GBCAs. Despite visible, abnormal T1 hyperintensity, interpreted as a sign of Gd retention, either diffusion-weighted MRI or sodium (<superscript>23</superscript>Na) MRI at 3T indicated no changes of tissue integrity of the dentate nuclei in any the MS patients in the two studies (34, 35).</para>
    <para>In conclusion, although there is data that all GBCAs leave trace amounts of residual Gd in brain tissues after intravenous GBCA administration, there is no convincing evidence indicating chronic neurotoxicity arising from long-term Gd retention, harmful effects, and potential interaction with neurological disease processes. (36).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Long-term Gd retention in non-CNS tissue: any clinically meaningful effects?</emphasis></para>
    <para>It is clear that Gd retention in a number of non-CNS tissues, including bone, skin, and liver, may occur with all types of GBCAs (3). While most <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> studies in different animal species and models focused on Gd retention in tissues, a few reports describe the results of histologic assessment of potential toxicity of retained Gd, with emphasis on the skin, to assess the possible association of exposure to GBCAs with the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). In healthy rat, histologic evidence of skin lesions was observed only in animals administered the linear GBCAs associated with the highest levels of Gd retention, i.e., gadodiamide (Omniscan™) and gadoversetamide (OptiMARK®) (37-41). Similar findings were reported using animal models of renal impairment (42-44). Fretellier, et al. (44) demonstrated that hyperphosphatemia induced in partially nephrectomized rats by a high phosphate diet increased the frequency and severity of gadodiamide-induced skin lesions. The observed skin changes were characterized by dermal fibrosis and infiltration of different cells, including mononuclear cells and CD34-positive cells (43, 45). One study (41) showed elevation of several proinflammatory cytokines in the serum of gadodiamidetreated rats, suggesting the involvement of inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of</para>
    <para>skin damage. However, the skin lesions observed in rats following exposure to gadodiamide (Omniscan™) were not completely consistent with histopathology of NSF in humans. Some of the difference between the cutaneous changes described in the gadodiamide (Omniscan™)-treated rats and human NSF are possibly due to anatomical differences, such as the presence of the panniculus carnosus in rats, a structure that separates the dermis from the subcutis and explains the fact that the observed skin lesions were restricted to the dermis in this animal species (46). All in all, these results of studies in animals might provide clues about the possible pathogenesis of NSF in humans. However, it should be noted that signs of possible toxicity in skin tissues from retained Gd were only observed following exposure to gadodiamide (Omniscan™) and gadoversetamide (OptiMARK™, not available for clinical use). Also, one study showed that marked skin lesions, characterized by epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, crusting and ulceration, and dermal infiltration by acute and chronic inflammatory cells, mast cells and mineralization, were observed after exposure to the active ingredient of Omniscan™, gadodiamide, and not after exposure to another GBCA or even to Gd salts, showing a possible role of the intact GBCA and not of retained Gd (47).</para>
    <para>NSF is a serious clinical syndrome associated with Gd retention in body tissues. It has been observed only in patients with acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>), end-stage renal disease, or with acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to hepatorenal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period (48). NSF cases occurring after the sole administration of one GBCA are defined as "single-agent" or "unconfounded." If a case of NSF follows the administration of two or more GBCAs, it is impossible to determine which agent is associated with the development of the disorder, and the case is reported as "multiple-agent" or "confounded" (48). Almost all unconfounded NSF cases occurred after single or repeated exposure to three GBCAs: gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist® and generic equivalents), gadoversetamide (OptiMark®), and gadodiamide (Omniscan™) (49). No or very few unconfounded cases were reported following exposure to any of the other GBCAs available for clinical use, that is, gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem® and generic equivalents(Dotarem® and generic equivalents, e.g., Clariscan™), gadoteridol (ProHance® ), gadoxetate disodium (Primovist® /Eovist® ) (49). The available evidence on NSF with the individual GBCAs is provided and discussed in Chapter 13 of this book.</para>
    <para>Other entities that have been reported as possibly associated with residual Gd following exposure to GBCAs are the "gadolinium-associated plaques" and the "gadolinium deposition disease". "Gadolinium-associated plaques" is the proposed name of a condition observed in a total of 4 cases between the first report in 2013 and the last in 2019 (50-52). Three patients presented with 0.5-2.5 cm plaques that resembled dermal infiltrative processes such as granuloma annulare or cutaneous sarcoidosis in two cases (51); in one case, it was an accidental finding in excisional specimens obtained during surgical removal of squamous cell carcinoma (50). One patient showed ill-defined, hyperpigmented and violaceous macules coalescing into ill-defined nummular patches with fine scale on the upper back, right forearm and right lower leg (52). Eosinophilic, collagenous, round, or ovoid sclerotic bodies in various stages of calcification were the pathognomonic histopathologic feature of the condition. Renal function was impaired in three patients and normal in the remaining one. In one case, the patient could not recall exposure to any GBCA (52). Two cases have been reported after administration of gadodiamide (Omniscan™, total cumulative</para>
    <para>volume: 90 mL in one case, 100 mL in the other), one following exposure to an unknown dose of an unknown GBCA (50, 51). When exposure to GBCAs was ascertained, the interval between last exposure and onset of the skin lesions ranged between 3.5 and 5 years. Plaques were asymptomatic in three cases, and pruritic and burning in one. The association between the observed skin lesions and exposure to GBCAs was suggested because sclerotic bodies and osseous metaplasia have been described as a late finding in the course of NSF, and the observed plaques were seen in two patients exposed to a GBCA (gadodiamide, Omniscan), a GBCA known to be associated with NSF. The diagnosis of NSF was always ruled out, however, as no other clinical or pathological sign of the disease was observed.</para>
    <para>First reported by Semelka, et al. in 2016 (53, 54), "gadolinium deposition disease" (GDD) is still only a proposed disease process with no clear proof of its true existence. GDD describes a condition in which a patient with normal or near-normal kidney function develops long-lasting symptoms reportedly after exposure to one or more GBCAs, assuming that alternative conditions and causes have been excluded (55). All the publications about GDD cases came from the same small group of investigators, who very recently acknowledged that this entity had been met with skepticism among physicians because their papers describing the disease had been criticized for flaws in their methodology (55). Over the years, those investigators provided several definitions of GDD. The most recent definition (55) indicates that a diagnosis of GDD requires that: i) the patient has to be exposed to a GBCA in the last month prior to onset of symptoms; ii) the symptoms should be new to the patient, i.e., not reflecting any pre-existing disease or symptoms observed before exposure to GBCAs; iii) symptoms include brain fog, pins and needles sensations, glove and stocking distribution of symptomatology, skin discoloration, pain (including bone pain and a burning sensation), and/or subcutaneous tissue thickening; iv) whenever possible, evidence should be obtained that Gd remained in the patient's system for more than 30 days after exposure to GBCAs; v) the patient should have had normal or near-normal renal function at the time of the exposure to GBCAs. Symptoms reportedly may arise within the first 24 hours after exposure to any of the GBCAs in clinical use and may last for weeks, months or even years (55). The group of investigators reporting these cases indicated that GDD is a rare encounter, and that this presumed disease process might initially resemble an acute hypersensitivity reaction to the GBCAs; therefore it may not be related to Gd deposition but rather involve the immune system in the presence of host factors such as genetic susceptibility and/or adaptive immune response (53-55). However, possible predisposing conditions or risk factors were never reported. The same group of investigators also reported that chelation therapy with Ca-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid increased urine Gd content and serum levels of some cytokines in patients with presumed GDD and caused an exacerbation of symptoms (flare) within the first 24 hours (56-57). All in all, the published literature to date failed to validate the existence of a novel condition characterized by the development of long-lasting symptoms following exposure to GBCAs and possibly maintained by Gd retained in tissues. The very few reports always came from the same group of investigators, showed significant selection bias, lacked clinical information to exclude alternative medical diagnoses and/or to substantiate findings, and sample sizes were always so small to render the results difficult to interpret. In the absence of evidence from well-designed clinical studies that could validate the existence of GDD and its pathogenesis, the use of chelation therapy in patients</para>
    <para>with no clear evidence-based indication potentially increases the risk of clinically significant harm from the well-known adverse effects of chelation (58).</para>
    <para>In September 2017, during a meeting of the Medical Imaging Drugs Advisory Committee (MIDAC), the FDA presented a series of patients reporting symptoms potentially related to GBCA exposure. A total of 132 case reports were identified, with various symptoms often centering around pain; most were self-reported and lacked significant and validated clinical information. The MIDAC concluded that no association between exposure to GBCAs, Gd retention and patient symptoms could be established (59). From January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020, Bracco, the marketing authorization holder of two GBCAs, gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance®) and gadoteridol (ProHance®) received a total number of 14 cases of symptoms (7 with gadobenate dimeglumine and 7 with gadoteridol) persisting for more than 4 weeks, with or without evidence of Gd retention in hair or urine. The majority (10) of these cases were not confirmed by any healthcare professional. Also, most of them reportedly followed exposure to multiple GBCAs. The interval between last exposure to a GBCA and onset of symptoms ranged from 2 hours to years. In one case, symptoms were pre-existing the exposure to gadobenate dimeglumine. Overall, the reporting rate of patients with persisting symptoms was lower than 1 case over more than 238,000 exposures to GBCAs. Overall, the reports received by Bracco referred to heterogeneous clusters of symptoms, without any common suggestive clinical pattern. Relatedness of the reported symptoms to GBCAs could not be established due to the scarce quality of the available information, together with the multifactorial nature of the reported events and/or the presence of underlying co-morbidities which could explain the reported symptoms (60).</para>
    <para>In conclusion, besides NSF, there is no evidence suggesting that retention of Gd in non-CNS tissues may be associated with harmful effects and potential interaction with disease processes.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Does the available evidence on Gd retention in tissues change the benefit-risk balance of GBCAs?</emphasis></para>
    <para>While the effectiveness and benefit provided by GBCAs has been properly demonstrated before and after their approval by all regulatory authorities in the world, there is no evidence of new, additional risk resulting from Gd retention in brain and body tissues. To date, NSF is the most significant clinical syndrome associated with retention of Gd in body tissues, and important and effective risk minimization measures for NSF have been introduced since 2010, virtually eradicating the disease.</para>

    <para>GBCA-enhanced MRI or MRA study is considered, it is important to consider its clinical benefit against the potential risk deriving from its use.</para>
    <para>Known risks associated with exposure to GBCAs include the possible occurrence of immediate-type reactions and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Immediate-type adverse reactions are those occurring within 1 hour of injection of a GBCA, and most of them are hypersensitivity reactions and are unpredictable. Patients at risk for acute hypersensitivity reactions are those with a history of a previous acute reaction to a GBCA, asthma, or other allergic disorders. To minimize the occurrence and severity of hypersensitivity reactions, warnings and precautions specifically related to the risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions are given in the prescribing information of all approved GBCAs (please see Chapter 10 of this book for more detailed information on how to minimize the risk of immediate-type reactions to GBCAs).</para>
    <para>NSF is the most serious clinical syndrome associated with Gd retention in body tissues to date. It has been observed only in patients with acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>), end-stage renal disease, or with acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to hepatorenal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period ("high-risk patients"). Notably, important and effective risk minimization measures for NSF have been introduced since 2010, virtually eradicating the disease (please see Chapter 13 of this book for more detailed information on how to minimize the risk of NSF).</para>
    <para>Although it had been known for decades that Gd is retained in other tissues, such as in skin, bone and liver tissues, the observation of traces of residual Gd in brain tissues of patients exposed to GBCAs raised a number of questions related to the safety of GBCAs. However, besides NSF, the available evidence failed to demonstrate an association between Gd retention in brain or body tissues and harm to patients. Notably, following extensive assessments, all regulatory authorities around the world agreed on the absence of evidence of any harmful effect of Gd retention in humans following exposure to any of the approved GBCAs; however, even if based on the same amount of preclinical and clinical evidence available in adults and children, regulatory authorities used different approaches resulting in different actions and decisions regarding the labeling and market authorizations of individual GBCAs (61).</para>
    <para>Of note, lack of evidence is not conclusive evidence of absence. If Gd retention is associated with clinical harm, the harm is likely rare or occult for the vast majority of exposed patients. Future studies should be appropriately powered to enable detection of rare or subtle adverse effects; however, it should be recognized that it is not possible to scientifically prove the absence of harm, and that the specific signs, symptoms, and diseases to investigate are unclear (3).</para>
    <para>Until new evidence may become available, the most practical approach may be to treat GBCAs like ionizing radiation, i.e., to follow an ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) approach (2). Exposure to GBCAs should be minimized as much as is reasonable while remembering that the diagnostic benefits generally still greatly exceed the risks for indicated contrast-enhanced MR examinations. GBCAs should not be administered freely regardless of medical appropriateness, but instead should be used when clinically indicated, like any other medication. To this purpose, the prescribing information for all GBCAs has been up-</para>
    <para>dated to contain clear, unambiguous wording to make the health care professionals utilizing the products aware of Gd retention and minimize exposure (61).</para>

          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>The clinical applications of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have expanded rapidly in recent years, resulting in a greater percentage of the patient population undergoing diagnostic imaging using this modality. In addition, the number of patients and individuals possessing implantable devices continues to grow, as does the variation and complexity of these devices. Non-medical implants and materials such as body piercings, tattoos, and permanent cosmetics (e.g., eyeliner) have also increased in popularity. This progressive array of implanted patients and individuals, combined with the implementation of scanners with higher static magnetic fields (i.e., 3- and 7-Tesla) presents particular challenges for screening in the MRI environment. Indeed, accidents and injuries have increased over the years along with the increased use of MRI. Accordingly, this has captured the attention of various organizations and entities including the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Joint Commission, and the American College of Radiology (ACR). Public awareness of MRI-related hazards has heightened as well, particularly due to the fatality of a young boy in 2001. The majority of accidents and injuries that have occurred in the MRI setting have been the result of insufficient or no screening procedures. Unfortunately, considerable subjectivity remains among the policies and procedures implemented by MRI fa-</para>

    <para>cilities, despite screening recommendations presented as far back as 1987 and periodically revised and updated to the present day (1-23).</para>
    <para>This chapter presents the purpose of comprehensive MRI screening concepts and discusses proper procedures. The recommended written screening forms to be used for individuals and patients are displayed and reviewed. Each section of these forms is explained, and justifications are given for the questions asked. Verbal MRI screening procedures are also reviewed, and the use of ferromagnetic detection systems as part of the screening process is discussed. Finally, secondary purposes and advantages of MRI screening are presented.</para>

            <title>MRI SCREENING PROCEDURES</title>
    <para>All patients undergoing MRI examinations must be screened prior to entering the MRI environment. Any other individual that needs to enter the MRI environment for any reason, even if just momentarily, must also be screened. This would include family members, friends, staff, visitors, field engineers, and emergency or security personnel such as firemen, police, and first responders. The screening process must include the completion of an MRI screening form by the patient or individual, followed by verbal MRI screening procedure conducted by the MRI technologist or other MRI safety-trained healthcare worker. Currently, many healthcare facilities have moved to electronic records that include MRI screening forms, while others still use paper forms. All MRI facilities (clinical or research) should embrace a specific MRI screening process that is both consistent and thorough. This should be part of the MRI center's formal written policy, to be followed without exception. To stay current, MRI facilities need to revise and update the screening protocol, on an ongoing and consistent basis.</para>

            <title>SCREENING FORM AND PROCEDURES FOR PATIENTS</title>
    <para>A variety of MRI screening forms are available from different sources, however, all variations of screening forms strive to achieve the same goal of 100% safety. A standard, two-page MRI screening form for patients developed by Frank G. Shellock, Ph.D. and available on www.MRIsafety.com is presented in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> (the Spanish and Arabic language versions are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figures 3 to 6</emphasis>). The ACR (American College of Radiology, www.ACR.org) also offers an MRI screening form (13, 15, 23). Before each MRI examination, proper MRI screening must be conducted for each patient. By way of example, this chapter will focus on the written screening forms provided on www.MRIsafety.com, which are in widespread use.</para>
          </sect4>
          <sect4 id="ch0015s0000s0001s0002s0003">
            <title>SAFETY QUESTIONS AND INFORMATION</title>
    <para>The upper section on the first page of the screening form (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>) asks for patient identification (ID) and demographics. This section must be completed and double checked for correct patient ID and MRI order or request. An incorrect patient or examination problem can easily occur during the fervor of an over-booked clinical schedule. The referring physician's name and telephone number should also be filled out, but this information may</para>
    <para>also be available at different information systems and may be different than the "ordering" physician. The rest of the first page of the screening form lists various medical and surgical history questions for the patient (note: certain questions pertain to female patients, only). Explanations of the questions and their importance to MRI screening are provided below.</para>
    <para>Question #1 asks about previous surgeries or procedures. Many patient safety concerns in MRI are impacted by the response to this question, so it cannot be left unanswered. If the answer to Question #1 is "yes", additional information must be given on types and dates of all surgeries and/or related procedures. Accuracy is paramount here, since information on potential implants, devices, and materials can be discovered. If the patient is a minor or is not fully aware of this information, a parent, guardian or other knowledgeable caregiver must assist in providing and verifying this information. Further review of the patient's chart or medical records may be necessary. If previous surgery or other procedural information is not available at the time of the MRI examination, as with an outpatient who has arrived with a limited history, MRI must be postponed or rescheduled until this information can be captured and verified.</para>
    <para>Question #2 asks about previous diagnostic imaging studies (MRI, computed tomography or CT, X-ray, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, etc.). The results of these examinations can help verify the patient's surgical or other procedural history and assist in identifying the presence of an implant, device, or foreign body that may be of concern.</para>
    <para>Question #3 asks the patient about problems related to a prior MRI examination. If the answer to this question is "yes", the patient is asked to describe the problem, prompting the MRI technologist to investigate and otherwise consider this matter further. Notably, if the answer to this question is "no", the patient cannot simply bypass the MRI screening process. A written screening form must still be completed, in case the patient that had a previous MRI exam performed had the placement of an implant, device, material, or encountered a foreign body. Assumptions should not be made that non-incidental; previous MRI examinations permit subsequent incident-free MRI procedures. Factors related to the MRI examination such as the orientation (i.e., vertical versus horizontal) and strength of the static magnetic field, maximum spatial gradient magnetic field, time-varying gradient magnetic fields, type of RF coil used, amount of RF power (specific absorption rate, SAR) and pulse sequence parameters can vary significantly among different MR systems. Careful investigation is required for implants or devices assumed to be "MR Safe" for a previous scanner, because this can change to "MR Conditional" or even "MR Unsafe" based on the MR system-related factors indicated above (15). The MRI technologist or radiologist can refer to the latest version of the <emphasis role="italics">Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices</emphasis> (16), or visit the website, www.MRIsafety.com, for specific information pertaining to information for implants and devices. Notably, it may be necessary to consult the manufacturer of the implant or device for more information, especially if an electronically-activated implant is encountered (16).</para>
    <para>Questions #4 and #5 ask the patient about personal injury involving a metallic object or foreign body. If the answer to either question is "yes", further questioning must be conducted as to whether the object was removed entirely, and if not, the location and composition of the object must be investigated further. In the case of injuries involving the eyes,</para>

  <para>it is important to negate the presence of any remaining metal. If the patient answers that an orbital metal foreign body (e.g., fragment, sliver, bullet, BB, shrapnel, welding slag, etc.) does remain or is unsure, the MRI exam must be postponed or rescheduled, and the patient is not allowed to enter the MRI environment. If the patient cannot recount with confidence that all metallic foreign bodies within the orbit(s) have been removed, an X-ray is indicated to determine the presence of metal. If the X-ray is unremarkable, and MRI screening is otherwise complete, the examination can be performed. If the X-ray identifies the presence of any non-surgical orbital metal, the MRI examination must be cancelled. Under certain circumstances, the radiologist may allow the MRI procedure to proceed if the X-rays show the metal is of relatively low mass, located in an extra-orbital, non-threatening position, or it has been determined that the metal is non-ferrous.</para>
    <para>Questions #6 and #7 ask the patient about current medications and allergies to medications. These questions may not be directly related to MRI safety, but if the patient needs to receive emergency medical attention, such information could be vital. Some patients may complain of problems such as vertigo, headache, or memory loss immediately following MRI, or days after the exam. In such cases, it can be helpful to the radiologist or clinician to check the written screening form for medications the patient listed, as these may help explain the patient's symptoms. Many radiologists can attest to incidents where patients mistakenly associated medical problems with an MRI procedure or other imaging modality.</para>
    <para>Question #8 asks about asthma, allergic reaction, or respiratory disease, but also specifically asks about prior reaction to contrast medium used in MRI, CT, or X-ray. It is not uncommon for patients to cite previous episodes of transient flushing, metallic taste, or nausea immediately following an injection. Unpleasant as it is for the patients, such transient symptoms are usually harmless. Notably, adverse reactions to MRI contrast agents can occur, although serious reactions such as anaphylactic responses to a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) are extremely rare. If the patient indicates a previous reaction to what they perceive as "dye", further questioning will be needed to clarify this matter. The patient may not make the distinction between CT and MRI, nor between GBCAs and iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray and CT. A polite but thorough interview with the patient should be able to determine the severity of a previous adverse event and which contrast agent was administered. If available, a review of the patient's chart or medical records should be done for clarification.</para>
    <para>Question #9 asks about anemia or other blood diseases, renal or hepatic disease, diabetes, and seizures. Importantly, MRI contrast agents may be contraindicated for some of these conditions. For example, the use of GBCAs has emerged as an MRI safety concern in patients with renal insufficiency because certain GBCAs have been implicated in causing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) and some gadolinium may be retained in the patient's body (16). Hence, the results of a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test must be obtained prior to a GBCA administration in patients with suspected renal insufficiency. This important topic is discussed in considerable detail in another chapter of this textbook.</para>
    <para>Questions #10 through #14 pertain to female patients, asking about possible pregnancy, menstrual cycle, and breastfeeding. Prior to entering the MRI environment, any patient who is unsure about pregnancy must undergo a pregnancy test. If the patient is pregnant, a con-</para>

    <para>sultation between the patient, radiologist and referring clinician is required in assessing the risk versus benefit of performing the MRI examination. The ACR recommends the use of MRI in pregnant patients if other non-ionizing imaging modalities are diagnostically inadequate, or ionizing procedures would otherwise have to be performed to answer critical clinical questions about the patient or fetus (15, 23). Furthermore, MRI may be performed without written or verbal informed consent in pregnant patients (15, 23).</para>
    <para>Non-pregnant patients should still answer questions #10 through #14 to the best of their ability, especially if they are scheduled for a breast or pelvic MRI. This information can aid the radiologist to interpret the results of the MRI procedure since hormonal changes induced by menstrual cycle, fertility treatments, and breastfeeding can alter tissue contrast on MR images. In particular, hormonal changes directly impact the timing and rate of breast tissue enhancement following the administration of a GBCA. Also, breastfeeding patients (Question #14) will be instructed to refrain from breastfeeding for 24-hours following administration of a GBCA (while continuing to express and discard the breast milk). This will help ensure that suckling infants ingest negligible amounts of gadolinium chelates.</para>
    <para>The top of the second page of the screening form for patients is intended to capture the attention of the patient or individual filling out the form (Figure 2). A "bold" warning statement is issued that certain implants, devices, or objects may be hazardous, and/or interfere with the MRI procedure. Thus, the patient is instructed not to enter the MRI environment if he or she has any question concerning an implant, device or object, and to consult the radiologist or MRI technologist before entering the MR system room. The patient or individual is also reminded that the "MR system magnet is ALWAYS on!" This warning statement is not intended to frighten patients or individuals who may already be anxious about their ensuing exam, but rather to discourage those who otherwise might wander into restricted areas in the MRI environment.</para>
    <para>The middle section of the second page, the screening form lists thirty-five implant or device categories of potential concern. The patient or individual filling out the form is asked to indicate whether he or she possesses any implant or device by checking a "Yes" or "No" box. By doing so, the patient or individual may recall previous forgotten surgeries or procedures that involved the implants or devices listed. If the patient has an implant or device not listed, the patient is asked to write it down at the bottom of the list. If the patient or individual does possess an implant, device, object, or metal on or in the body, he or she is instructed to indicate the location(s) on the diagrams of the human body (anterior and posterior views) provided on the form.</para>
    <para>Below the body sketch diagrams, the patient or individual is reminded to remove all metal objects such as hearing aids, dentures, jewelry, eyeglasses, keys, cell phones, belts, and other objects before entering the MR system room. Articles of clothing containing metal such as buttons, zippers and wires should also be removed. Some clothing manufacturers have recently been incorporating anti-microbial silver, copper microfibers, or other metallic components in sportswear and undergarments. These metallic fibers are often not detectable in the fabric and product labeling is often unreliable. The metal in the clothing may be nonferromagnetic but can still degrade image quality if located proximal to the region being scanned. More importantly, the metallic components found in fabric are conductive and,</para>
    <para>thus, may excessively heat during certain MRI conditions, causing burn injuries in patients. As a critical policy, MRI facilities should require patients to remove all clothing and change into a gown or scrubs that have no pockets as part of the screening process. Lockers must be provided to secure the belongings of patients and other individuals. Without harsh interrogation or inappropriate searching, the MRI technologist must always check the patient or individual to verify that all metal of concern has been removed prior to entering the MR system room. Some facilities refer to this second check as the "Full Stop and Final Check" (22, 23).</para>
    <para>During the screening process, questions may be asked about breathing problems, movement disorders, or claustrophobia. These questions are used to assess the patient's general ability to hold still and tolerate the MRI procedure. These issues are not too critical for safety, but may determine whether the patient needs extra attention or sedation, which will dictate scheduling times and different MRI facility staffing needs.</para>
    <para>Hearing protection for the patient or individual is also recommended on the MRI screening form, which reflects many early guidelines pertaining to this matter as well as current ACR recommendations (15, 23). In the distribution of hearing protection such as disposable earplugs, the MRI technologist or trained healthcare worker should assist the patient or individual in placement of the disposable earplugs. Some individuals will have difficulty in properly positioning the earplugs, especially if the ear canal is curved. At times, it may be necessary to immobilize the earplugs in place by using hypoallergenic tape to prevent them from loosening during the exam. The ear canals of small infants often will not accommodate conventional foam earplugs, but the earplugs can easily be cut to fit (any cutting with tools such as scissors or knives must of course be done outside the MRI environment) or alternative hearing protection devices can be used in these cases.</para>
    <para>The last section on the second page of the MRI screening form provides a place for the person completing the form to sign, print name, and date the form. When signing, the patient attests that the information provided on the form is correct. For a minor, a parent or legal guardian should print their name and sign the form. If the patient is unable to sign the form, an authorized relative or knowledgeable healthcare professional may need to sign (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>). The MRI technologist, or other appropriately trained staff who reviewed the form and conducted the verbal interview must also print their name and sign this document (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). If the completed form is handed off to another MRI technologist to perform the MRI examination, care must be taken that the scanning MRI technologist checks the form to be sure that it was reviewed and signed. This final step must be done prior to escorting the patient or individual into the MR system room (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>In the event that the patient is comatose or for whatever reason unable to verbally communicate, the written screening form should be completed by the most qualified individual (e.g., physician, family member, etc.) that has knowledge about the patient's medical history and present condition. If the screening information is inadequate, it is advisable to look for surgical scars on the patient and/or to obtain plain films of the skull and/or chest to search for implants that may be particularly hazardous in the MRI environment (e.g., aneurysm clips, cardiac pacemakers, neuromodulation systems, etc.) (15, 16, 23).</para>

            <title>WRITTEN SCREENING FORM AND PROCEDURES FOR INDIVIDUALS</title>
    <para>As stated previously, any individual other than the patient that needs to enter the MRI environment for any reason must also complete a written screening form (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>). This form is basically an abbreviated version of the patient MRI screening form. Whether the MRI facility is in a hospital, clinic, or free-standing imaging center, a certain amount of employee turnover is inevitable. New physicians or house staff, MRI technologists, nurses, anesthesia staff, medical assistants, students, and other staff members will rotate through the MRI center, some of which will need to enter the MRI environment. MRI screening is also required for caregivers, security personnel, fire fighters, and others. No one is exempt from completing the screening form and going through the screening process prior to entering the MRI environment. For individuals that must frequently enter the MRI environment as part of their duty, such as an MRI technologist, the screening form can be completed initially and kept on file. Any subsequent changes to an individual's medical or physical history such as a surgical procedure with placement of an implant, pregnancy, exposure to shrapnel or other similar matter will void the prior MRI clearance on file. It is the individual's responsibility to make this known so that the re-screening and/or updating of screening history can take place.</para>
    <para>Importantly, if for any reason the individual other than the patient, need to enter the MR system itself (e.g., moving partially into the bore of the scanner to help manage the patient) and, thus, become exposed to the electromagnetic fields used for the MRI procedure, this person must be screened prior to entry using the detailed form for patient screening.</para>

          <title>VERBAL SCREENING PROCEDURES</title>
    <para>Equally important to the completion of the MRI screening forms for both patients and other individuals is the verbal screening procedure or interview (Figure 9). Additional information or clarification of information about prior surgeries, procedures, or incidents is often obtained during this time. The interview provides a mechanism for clarification or confirmation of the answers to the questions posed to the patient so that there is no miscommunication regarding important MRI safety issues. In addition, because the patient may not be fully aware of the medical terminology used for a particular implant or device, it is imperative that this particular information on the form be discussed during the verbal interview. Additionally, a patient might be reluctant to indicate a pregnancy or foreign body on the written form in the presence of family or friends, but honesty might prevail in a private interview with the MRI technologist or MRI safety-trained healthcare worker. Due to cultural or religious reasons, some patients may ask for a male or female MRI technologist to conduct the interview. Questions, misconceptions, and fears that the patient might harbor can also be discussed and answered. Both the stress of the patient and the difficulty of the MRI examination can be reduced as a result of a satisfactorily performed, verbal screening procedure.</para>
    <para>With the use of any type of written questionnaire, limitations exist related to incomplete or incorrect answers provided by the patient or individual. For example, there may be difficulties associated with patients that are impaired with respect to their vision, language flu-</para>

    <para>The use of conventional metal detectors as a MRI screening tool has not been recommended in the past mainly as a result of false positive and false negative alarms, resulting in "alarm fatigue". Such detectors have exhibited inconsistent sensitivities, operator error, and the inability to distinguish between ferrous and non-ferrous metals. In recent years, many new designs of ferromagnetic detection systems have emerged that have proven helpful in the screening process. These ferromagnetic detection systems are typically installed prior to the entrance into the scanner room (or Zone III, according to the zone scheme described by the ACR) (Figure 11).</para>
    <para>Ferromagnetic detection systems may be utilized immediate area outside of the scanner room (i.e., the patient dressing room) to facilitate screening. Notably, the ACR recommends the use of ferromagnetic detection systems, but only as an adjunct to a thorough and competent MRI screening process (15, 23). At least one type of ferromagnetic detection system has been used to identify ferromagnetic implants or foreign bodies (e.g., armor-piercing bullets)(18-20).</para>

The 7-Tesla MRI environment warrants attention for MRI screening and exposing patients and others to this ultra-high-field setting (21, 23). Some concerns and considerations are, as follows:</para>

At the writing of this chapter, little more than 300 of implants and devices have been tested under 7-Tesla conditions. Because of this limited information, scanning patients with implants and devices at 7-Tesla is far more challenging. As always, the decision to scan a patient with an untested device or implant should be based on a careful assessment of risk verses benefit which is conducted by the supervising physician.</para>

In MRI environment, Faraday's law of induction and related Lenz's law may play an important role for metallic implants, as well. An increase in Lenz's forces at 7-T is worth</para>
    <para>noting. A brief explanation is, as follows: when an electrical conductor moves through a changing magnetic field such as the spatial gradient magnetic field at the entrance of the scanner, an electrical current will be generated that induces an additional magnetic field that opposes the spatial gradient magnetic field and the static magnetic field. Thus, the motion of any metallic implant, device, or object (made from ferromagnetic or nonferromagnetic material), will be opposed. This phenomenon may be manifested as a "tugging" sensation that patients with large metallic implants or devices may experience as they move into the bore of the MR system. Although this sensation is transient and harmless, it can be unsettling to patients, compelling them to bring it to the attention of the MRI technologist. Fortunately, Lenz's forces can be markedly reduced by slowly moving the patient into a 7-T scanner. With further regard to Lenz's forces at 7-T, it is a good practice to explain to a patient with a larger metallic implant that there is the possibility of a tugging sensation prior to the MRI exam to avoid undue issues (21-23).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">SECONDARY PURPOSES AND ADVANTAGES OF MRI SCREENING</emphasis></para>
    <para>Obviously, the primary purpose of MRI screening is safety, but screening serves secondary purposes and advantages, as presented below.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Optimizing the Diagnostic Value of the MRI Examination</emphasis></para>
    <para>Many implants and devices do not pose safety issues, but some can significantly degrade image quality, especially when in or near to the anatomical region of interest. Information gathered during MRI screening regarding the type and location of a metallic implant or foreign body can allow for strategies and/or adjustments in the MRI protocol to minimize signal loss and/or distortion. For example, an adolescent with extensive orthodontic work who is scheduled for a pituitary study might be scanned on a 1.5-Tesla MR system rather than a 3-Tesla or 7-Tesla scanner in an effort to reduce susceptibility artifacts. Alternatively, the optimization of imaging parameters that are known to reduce artifacts related to metallic objects may be necessary in order to maintain the diagnostic aspects of the MRI examination.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Appropriate Patient Management Aided by MRI Screening</emphasis></para>
    <para>A physician ordering a clinical MRI examination must state a "reason for exam". Based on this information, the attending MRI-trained physician will then select an appropriate protocol (i.e., with consideration given to the type of transmit/receive RF coil to be used, pulse sequences, etc.), which is unique for the desired outcome for that specific patient. Additional communication between the ordering/referring physician and the radiologist may be necessary if this information and justification for the MRI procedure is vague.</para>
    <para>If the patient arrives for the MRI appointment with a limited history, and the ordering physician is not available for consultation, the screening information that is obtained may be helpful to the radiologist. For instance, if the reason for the examination simply indicates "headache", and the screening procedure reveals that the patient has not had a prior MRI procedure, the radiologist may optimize the scan protocol with more diagnostic emphasis. Conversely, if MRI screening reveals previous MRI studies, and the present MRI exam is for surgical planning, the radiologist may optimize the scan protocol with this in mind. Oth-</para>

Once the physician has seen the patient and has decided that an MRI procedure is indicated, the patient can be given the MRI screening form to fill out, or at a minimum, answer key MRI screening questions. This information can then be returned to the MRI facility prior to the appointment date. Such a practice has multiple purposes and advantages, including:</para>

          <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <para>The process of MRI screening is absolutely critical to avoid MRI-related accidents and injuries, as well as to ensure safety for staff members and others. MRI screening must never be performed in haste, but rather, in a consistent and thorough manner. If a reduction in MRI incidents is to be realized, adhering to comprehensive MRI screening protocols and revising screening criteria must be an integral part of MRI policies and procedures. As emphasized throughout this chapter, MRI screening of patients and individuals must, at a minimum, include completion of an MRI screening form and a subsequent verbal interview, and have the form signed-off by the MRI technologist or other MRI safety-trained healthcare worker. The MRI screening process may start in advance, but only safety-trained personnel should perform the final screening procedure and just before exposing patients or other individuals to the strong electromagnetic fields of the MR system. Beyond MRI safety, screening proves efficacious by providing information that allows proper scheduling of the patient and preparation of the MRI facility to accommodate the patient's needs for effective customer service standards, improved business, and optimal patient-care outcomes.</para>

          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important diagnostic modality that utilizes a powerful static magnetic field that may pose serious hazards to patients and other individuals. The potentially violent attraction of ferromagnetic objects into the bore of a magnetic resonance (MR) system is referred to as the missile (or projectile) effect. Magnetic field interactions acting on a highly ferromagnetic object brought too close to the magnet of the scanner can become so substantial as to be unstoppable by human effort. Items such as steel gas cylinders (e.g., an oxygen tank) and fire extinguishers can enter the MR system at 30- to 40-mph, the same speed they would reach if dropped from a 40-foot building to the ground. The kinetic energy gained by a steel cylinder that becomes a missile as it rapidly moves towards the scanner is dissipated on impact. A 15-lb cylinder acting as a projectile can seriously injure an individual and/or severely damage the MR system.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="italics">A device that passively detects the presence of a ferromagnetic object by means of the object's naturally surrounding magnetic field, and issues an alert to indicate that the object has been detected.</emphasis></para>
    <para>Various versions of FMDS currently exist. These devices are specially designed to only detect ferromagnetic items. Other materials, such as aluminum and copper, are nonferromagnetic and, therefore, are not detected by an FMD device. There are many ferromagnetic metals but, by far, the most common is martensitic, which is magnetic, steel. An FMD device will detect a steel gas cylinder and indicate a positive alarm, but it will not detect or alarm on an aluminum one. Thus, the FMD device will only alarm on potentially dangerous objects relative to issues related to magnetic field interactions. Utilizing an FMD device in the MRI environment is recommended or required by various influential organizations concerned with MRI safety, including the American College of Radiology (ACR) and The Joint Commission (1-5).</para>
    <para>This chapter discusses the missile effect, its causes, and consequences. The unique detection technology utilized by FMDS is then presented. Included in this chapter is a practical guide to working with an FMD device in the MRI environment. The potential application of an FMD device for screening patients to identify ferromagnetic implants and foreign bodies using an FMD device is also discussed, followed by a perspective on the future of these devices.</para>

            <title>The Fringe Field Associated with an MR System</title>
    <para>A properly functioning MR system has a powerful and highly uniform static magnetic field (6). The vast majority of scanners use superconducting electromagnets because these provide substantially higher static magnetic fields and considerably lower power consumption than electromagnets. Superconducting electromagnets have the interesting property such that the massive electrical currents in their coils will flow perpetually without the need for a power supply as long as they are kept cold enough to remain superconducting. A superconducting magnet does need high power to establish the field while the magnet is being "ramped up". The energy that is used during this time is stored in the magnetic field. This stored energy will only be released when the magnet is "ramped-down" or quenched.</para>
    <para>From a safety consideration, it is important to understand that a magnetic field is an "energy store". An analogy might be a gas cylinder insofar as it requires energy to compress a gas into the cylinder. Once there (and with the valve closed), no power or energy is required to maintain it. The stored energy is only released when the gas is let out. With the gas cylinder, the energy is stored safely within the walls of the cylinder. However, with a magnet used by an MR system, the energy is stored in the magnetic field on the <emphasis role="italics">outside</emphasis>, through which staff members, patients, and other individuals walk through and work in every day. It is a common misconception that the energy in an MR system's magnet is stored in the electrical current in the windings, safely within the scanner. However, that is not the case. Inside the bore of the magnet and in the area surrounding the magnet there is an energy</para>

    <para>During the planning of an MRI facility, a plot showing the magnetic contours surrounding the MR system is typically provided by the manufacturer, an example of which is shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>. Normally, MR system rooms are designed such that, where there are walls adjacent to areas occupied by individuals, the fringe field is less than 5-Gauss (7). This is considered to be the generally permissible magnetic field level that ensures safety for individuals with electronically-activated devices, such as cardiac pacemakers. Frequently, the 5-Gauss line is contained well within the MRI environment, usually at or within a controlled area.</para>
    <para>The fringe field associated with the magnet of the MR system falls away in all directions, getting weaker as the distance increases. The rate of change of the magnetic field with distance is called the spatial gradient magnetic field. If the magnetic field is B, then the gradient is ∂B/∂x where x is the distance in the x-direction. An illustration of the fringe field and gradient profiles are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2 (a)</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2 (b)</emphasis>.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Linear Force</emphasis></para>
    <para>Linear force is the mechanism that causes the missile or projectile effect. It occurs because an object, having been magnetized by the magnetization effect, or by its previous magnetization state (or both) becomes attracted to the magnet of the scanner. The spatial gradient of the magnetic field is responsible for linear force. The position at which the magnetic field is highly uniform, such as in the middle of the bore of the MR system, the linear force is close to zero. This is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.</para>

            <title>Torque</title>
    <para>Torque is when a ferromagnetic object, in the presence of a magnetic field, experiences a torque to rotate or align it with respect to the direction of the magnetic field. Once in the preferred direction, there is no further rotation. However, torque will oppose any attempt to orient the object in another direction. This is the principle that magnetic compasses use to indicate the direction of the Earth's magnetic poles. An elongated ferromagnetic object (e.g., a steel oxygen cylinder, pen, etc.) becomes magnetized along its long axis in preference to another direction. Unless the object is spherical, it will usually experience torque.</para>

            <title>Magnetization Effects</title>
    <para>Magnetization effects only occurs in ferromagnetic objects. The magnetization of a ferromagnetic object increases with the applied magnetic field. This means that the closer a ferromagnetic object approaches to the magnet of the MR system, the more magnetized it becomes.</para>

          <sect4 id="ch0016s0000s0001s0002s0004">
            <title>Motion Damping</title>
    <para>Motion damping is the only main effect that all metallic objects experience whether or not they are ferromagnetic. It is a mechanism that is a function of the electrical conductivity of the metallic object and its shape. If a metallic object moves through a magnetic field gradient so that the field it experiences changes with time, then eddy currents are generated within the metal, obeying Faraday's Law of Induction, also known as the dynamo effect. The eddy currents circulate, according to Lenz's Law in a manner that generates their own magnetic field that opposes the movement (i.e., the objects resist motion)(8). The reason this is discussed here is because a ferromagnetic missile accelerating toward the bore of the magnet is slowed down by this effect. Without this effect, missile incidents would be even more damaging.</para>
    <para>When an individual approaches the magnetic field of the MR system with a ferromagnetic object, the object will typically first encounter torque as the first effect to be noticed. The linear force acting on the object is often felt closer to the scanner. The motion damping effect is not that noticeable but can be experienced if an aluminum sheet is taken into close to the origin of the magnetic field and moved around. A favorite trick MRI physicists like to display is to take a half-inch thick aluminum object, such as a pizza pan, stand it edgewise on the patient table near the opening of bore of the MR system, and then tip it over. The object falls in a surprisingly slow manner.</para>

            <title>The Missile Effect</title>
    <para>Although the missile effect is predominantly caused by the linear force acting on a ferromagnetic object, each of the four interactions described above plays a part. Let's begin by considering the linear force in more detail. As a ferromagnetic object approaches the magnet, the force it experiences dramatically increases. Thus, every time the distance to the magnet is reduced by 10%, the force doubles. Therefore, small changes in distance equate to large changes in the force acting on the ferromagnetic object. Decreasing the distance to the magnet by half increases the force by approximately 130 times.</para>
    <para>This highly non-linear distance dependence on the force causes problems for individuals carrying ferromagnetic objects close to the MR system. When the forces begin to increase, muscle control typically cannot cope with the non-linearity. Thus, there is a point at which the ferromagnetic object can no longer be restrained. The force is so highly non-linear that it is rare for individuals to experience or encounter similar forces under other circumstances because we are naturally more accustomed to sensations involving constant or linear forces. It is often an unconscious assumption by people who deliberately take ferromagnetic objects into the MR system room that the force will increase more smoothly than it actually does, as the ferromagnetic object gets close to the scanner. This incorrect assumption has led to many missile-related accidents. In various videos posted on the Internet of individuals deliberately demonstrating the missile effect, one can see the sudden attraction of a ferromagnetic object into the bore of the MR system. Additional information on this topic directed towards the interests of the MRI physicist is presented in the comprehensive publication by Bleaney and Bleaney (9).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">TERMINOLOGY USED FOR IMPLANTS AND DEVICES</emphasis></para>
    <para>Descriptions of the current terminology and classifications used for implants and devices, including patient support equipment, have been presented by Shellock, et al. (10). One important aspect of these classifications is the item's susceptibility to becoming a missile-related hazard. For example, MR Safe items are those defined as, amongst other things, "nonmetallic, nonmagnetic, and nonconducting" objects (10). MR Unsafe items are "known to pose hazards in all MR environments" (10). Objects made from martensitic stainless steel or iron may be MR Unsafe. MR Conditional items have, "been demonstrated to pose no known hazards in a specified MR environment with specified conditions of use. Field conditions that define the MR environment include static magnetic field strength...." (10). As far as missile-related hazards are concerned, this classification refers to items that are either very weakly magnetic or composite items that have small amounts of ferromagnetic materials. For implants, the counterforces present for certain MR Conditional items must be taken into consideration because these can prevent risks related to movement or displacement relative to the use of MRI.</para>
    <para>An important area to consider is composite equipment that is classified as MR Conditional, where the majority of the materials that are used are nonferromagnetic but there may be ferromagnetic components, as well. Most MR Conditional gurneys, wheelchairs, and removable MR system patient tables are in this category. The ferromagnetic materials found in composite equipment always experiences forces of attraction in association with scanner, so an interesting question is, when does an object become too magnetic and in danger of becoming a missile? On one level the answer is simple. It is when the attractive force of the magnet overcomes the restraining or counterforce holding the object back. For a piece of patient support equipment, such as a wheelchair, there are two primary forces that can prevent it from becoming a missile: the weight which acts in a downward direction and the friction due to contact with the ground, which acts along the floor in the opposite direction of the force, as illustrated in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>. This force of attraction is generally toward the nearest edge of the bore of the MR system. In <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>, the magnetic force is shown resolved into</para>

          <title>Using Ferromagnetic Detection Systems in the MRI Environment</title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 3.</emphasis> An illustration of the forces acting on an object in the fringe field of an MR system's magnet. The magnetic attraction force is shown resolved into vertical and horizontal components that oppose gravity and friction.</para>
  <para>its horizontal and vertical components. The forces of gravity and friction are in opposition to these components.</para>
    <para>First, consider the friction. This has the property that frictional force increases to exactly match any horizontal force on the object up to a point called F<subscript>max</subscript>, beyond which it will begin to slide toward the MR system. A full analysis is complicated because F<subscript>max</subscript> is proportional to the object's weight and it also depends on the properties of the two surfaces in contact. For a given object, there will be an area surrounding the MR system's magnet, outside of which the object will remain stationary on the floor, and inside of which it will become a missile, due to horizontal forces. Objects with wheels have intrinsically low F<subscript>max</subscript> because that is the point of having wheels in the first place. That is, to allow devices such as wheelchairs and gurneys to move horizontally with very low friction. This means special care must be taken with wheeled items when present in the MR system room so that these devices are not moved closer than allowed based on the approved MR Conditional labeling. For example, certain patient support devices are labeled MR Conditional and the conditions specify use at 500-Gauss or less. Moving the device closer than 500-Gauss may pose a missile-related hazard.</para>
    <para>The vertical forces are different in nature. An object of a given weight will remain on the floor until the vertical component of the magnetic force exceeds it. Then, it may become a missile, as it rises off the floor and moves towards the scanner. This cannot be disentangled from the horizontal forces because F<subscript>max</subscript> depends on the force pressing the object to the floor, which is the difference between its weight and the opposing vertical magnetic force</para>
    <para>component. Because of this, objects positioned on the floor will tend to first travel along the floor, move near the MR system, and then leap up off the floor into the scanner.</para>
    <para>Again, it should be noted that the magnetic force is related to the spatial gradient of the magnetic field and not to the strength of the static magnetic field. While it is generally true that a ferromagnetic object in the presence of a 3-Tesla MR system will tend to be more strongly attracted than in association with a 1.5-Tesla scanner, with the emergence of new "open", vertical field MR systems it is conceivable that a lower strength magnet can have larger spatial gradients than a higher field strength one. The take home message is that it is always prudent to be cautious when introducing an MR Conditional item into the MR system room for the first time, even if the condition relative to the static magnetic field is met. What is important is the allowable fringe field (e.g., 500-Gauss or less) for which the device is labeled and where that value exists in the specific room where the device is intended for use.</para>
    <para>For handheld item, the restraining force is related to the muscular activity of the individual holding the object. Like the frictional force, muscular strength can also restrain a ferromagnetic object up to a point. Beyond this, the object may be snatched away from the person's grasp and become a missile. Normally, torque acting on the object is experienced prior to this point.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF MISSILE-RELATED ACCIDENTS</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Why Missile-Related Accidents Occur</emphasis></para>
    <para>Human risk factors are fundamentally inherent in the delivery of healthcare associated with medical devices and their applications during medical procedures. Simply stated, we are human and we are imperfect, so accidents will happen. Missile-related accidents occur for many reasons but there tends to be five main causes.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(1) Faulty safety protocols.</emphasis> Some MRI facilities have inadequate or outdated safety protocols that have dangerous gaps. Common examples include allowing untrained staff members or maintenance people into the MR system room, inadequate training regimes, lack of a policy regarding the use of certain types of equipment in the MRI environment, and failure to check and follow equipment labeling (11). The solution for this is to have an MRI Safety Officer or other individual responsible for developing and implementing proper safety policies and procedures.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(2) Ignorance of safety protocols by staff members.</emphasis> This occurs when staff members have not been properly educated and trained to follow the MRI facility's safety protocols and, thus, they are ignorant or unaware of them. Common accidents where this is the cause involve cleaning and maintenance staff as well as non-MRI medical professionals and other individuals. The prevention of this problem involves a concerted effort to educate and train all of those involved in the MRI environment.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(3) Unintentional disregard for safety protocols.</emphasis> Staff members may unintentionally disregard safety protocols due to lapses in concentration, or making wrong decisions under</para>
    <para>high pressure settings, or in emergency situations (12). This can, and often does, occur with highly experienced staff members. Long-term experience and a good previous record will not ensure safety due to this cause. There is no practical mitigation against this, although regular practice of safety policies especially those related to emergency situations may help.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(4) Deliberate disregard of safety protocols.</emphasis> This is the "I know better than the MRI Safety Officer" or "it will never happen to me" attitude. Some staff members guilty of such attitudes may decide that some aspects of their safety protocols are unnecessary or incorrect and, thus, they have decided to ignore them. Fundamentally, this is about the personality of the staff member. Strong character traits of arrogance, pride, or an attraction to risk may lead to this problem. Prevention of this issue is difficult, but training and safety inspections help. Disciplinary action should be considered for staff members caught disregarding safety protocols.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(5) Incorrect or absent information on MR Safe or MR Conditional equipment.</emphasis> The current MRI labeling was instituted in 2005 (10). Equipment labeling prior to 2005 may not have updated labeling applied. Even now, some equipment labeled MR Safe is not. Thus, the regular review of equipment and application of proper labeling are important procedures for MRI facilities. Additionally, MR Conditional equipment does not always have the conditions for use marked on the devices (13). Furthermore, an MRI facility may have recently upgraded from a 1.5-T to a 3-T MR system, resulting in different conditions that may pose risks. Prevention of this issue involves regular equipment inspections and review, particularly with regard to MRI labeling.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Frequency of Occurrence</emphasis>It is well known that the majority of missile-related incidents are not reported. This is because, in many instances, missile-related incidents that do not hurt individuals don't tend to be reported. Also, at least in the U.S., only a small minority of medical incidents of all kinds that result in patient harm are reported (14). For accidents involving the missile effect, estimates vary between 5% and 20% for the proportion of potentially harmful incidents that are actually reported. Despite the unknown scale of the problem, the missile effect is often quoted as one of the most serious hazards in the U.S. healthcare system (5).</para>
    <para>Fatalities in the MR setting are extremely rare, but it is estimated that major injuries occur approximately once a year across 20,000 MR systems. For minor injuries, there are no reliable statistics, but these are believed to be far more common. Expensive accidents resulting in damage to the scanner and downtime are thought to be relatively common. However, again, there are no reliable statistics in the public domain pertaining to this matter. Small accidents involving scissors, pens, paper clips, and other similar items that can be removed from MR systems without the need to quench the MR system are very common. Most MRI facilities have several stories of such incidents but there are no known statistics that document how often these problems occur.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Consequences of Missile-Related Accidents</emphasis>An internet-based search for MRI accidents will reveal many photographs and reports of some of the more serious cases. Floor buffers, gas cylinders, and office chairs are amongst</para>
    <para>the most common missiles, although monitoring equipment, ventilators, tools and even handguns may be seen. There are also many links to news reports describing accidents involving victims and near misses.</para>
    <para>If a patient or staff member is injured or killed, then there is a high risk of expensive litigation, and a significant loss of reputation for the hospital or the MRI facility. Larger ferromagnetic objects cannot be manually removed from the MR system unless the magnet is quenched, reducing the level of the static magnetic field.</para>
    <para>Therefore, it is usual for the manufacturer of the scanner to provide technical support to ramp the magnet down, remove the item, and repair any damage. After that, the magnetic field of the MR system needs to be ramped-up and shimmed. This process can take several days, resulting in a significant loss of imaging time. Estimates for the average cost of a missile-related accident not involving human injury vary between $20,000 to more than $200,000. If an injury is involved, the monetary costs can be excessive, not including any commercial damage due to loss of reputation.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">FERROMAGNETIC DETECTION SYSTEMS</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Introduction To Ferromagnetic Detection Systems</emphasis>Ferromagnetic Detection Systems (FMDS) designed for the MRI environment appeared in 2002, shortly after the tragic death of Michael Colombini in 2001. Colombini was struck by a steel oxygen tank that was brought into the MR system room while he was in the scanner undergoing a brain MRI (15). Prior to this, conventional archway metal detectors and some forms of magnetometers were tried at MR system room doorways, but these were not found to be useful. Conventional metal detectors "alarm" on all metals, ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic and, therefore, may detect many objects that can be legitimately taken into the MR system room which do not pose a missile-related hazard.</para>
    <para>The first example of a modern-day FMD device was installed in the Royal Hospital Haslar in the United Kingdom in November 2002. Since then, several companies specializing in FMDS have supplied these devices commercially (16-18).</para>
    <para>As the name suggests, ferromagnetic detection systems selectively detect ferromagnetic objects, ignoring nonferromagnetic objects. Because only ferromagnetic objects pose a missile-related hazard, an FMD device selectively detects threats and operates by monitoring the ambient magnetic field using magnetic sensors. The ambient field is a combination of the fringe field of the magnet and the Earth's magnetic field plus the contribution from architectural steel and any other stationary steel objects in the immediate vicinity. A ferromagnetic object distorts the ambient field in its vicinity. If it is brought close to an FMD device, the distortion is detected as a changing magnetic field and an alert is triggered. This is illustrated in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>, where the ambient field is illustrated as parallel horizontal lines. A person who is not carrying any ferromagnetic material will not modify this field in any way and can walk past the FMD device undetected, as seen in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4 (a)</emphasis>.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 4 (b)</emphasis> shows how a ferromagnetic object carried by a person perturbs the ambient magnetic field. Note that the perturbation in the field is local to the object. Because the per-</para>

  <para>son is far from the FMD device, the ambient field is unchanged, so the FMD device has not detected the object, as of yet. In <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4 (c)</emphasis>, the person carrying the ferromagnetic object is now close enough to the FMD device such that the perturbation in the field surrounding the object has caused a change of the ambient field at the FMD device. This change triggers an alarm.</para>
    <para>Importantly, an FMD device ignores static magnetic fields (i.e., magnetic fields that do not change with time). In practice, this means that the FMD device is only sensitive to changing magnetic fields or moving ferromagnetic objects. The device is insensitive to a stationary ferromagnetic object, so if an object is placed near to an FMD device it will be detected as it is put in place but thereafter ignored, until it is moved again. The reason for this is that the ambient magnetic fields are very large compared with the magnetic perturbations caused by a ferromagnetic object, and it is difficult to measure tiny changes on a large background field. The large static background is therefore removed by the FMD device by filtering it out, irrespective of whichever components make up that static magnetic field including the magnet of the MR system, the Earth's magnetic field, or a metal cabinet next to the FMDS.</para>
    <para>For a handheld FMD device, the object may be stationary but the FMD device is moved, so it is the relative motion that is important when using this type of device. By comparison, a stationary FMD device detects moving ferromagnetic objects only.</para>

          <title>Magnetic Sensors</title>
    <para>There are several types of magnetic sensors, however, only three types have been used in devices used for FMDS. Each has relative merits and drawbacks. The detailed workings of the sensors have been described previously (19). Therefore, only a brief summary of features relevant to FMDS is provided below.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Fluxgates</emphasis></para>
    <para>These are the most sensitive magnetic sensors used in FMDS. Fluxgates can resolve better than 20 x 10<superscript>-12</superscript>-Tesla in a 1-Hz bandwidth at 1-Hz. Their main drawback is their high price and several are needed in an FMD device. The high sensitivity and high price means that fluxgates are only used in top-end FMDS.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Amorphous Magneto-Resistive (AMR)</emphasis></para>
    <para>These are solid-state devices with a resolution of 350 x 10<superscript>-12</superscript>-Tesla in a 1-Hz bandwidth at 1-Hz and cost one-tenth of the price of fluxgates. Their main limitation is the limited sensitivity, so more of them are required to provide full coverage in an FMD device.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Induction Coils</emphasis></para>
    <para>These sensors are coils of wire wound on ferrite cores. They are intrinsically similar to an AMR sensor in both sensitivity and cost. Induction coil FMDS are used by one company in their hand-held FMD device (17, 18) where they use a magnet within them to boost the ambient field and hence the magnetization of the ferromagnetic objects they seek to detect</para>
    <para>(17, 18, 20). This adds to the effective sensitivity close to the FMD device's sensors, but the device should be kept away from electronic implants and the eyes.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Ferromagnetic Detection Systems</emphasis></para>
    <para>A stationary FMD device needs to be highly sensitive in its immediate vicinity but highly immune to large moving ferromagnetic objects further away, such as cars on roads and elevator counterweights. These FMDs consist of magnetic sensors along with the necessary amplifiers and filters to condition the signals. There are methods employed to provide the rejection of unwanted distant moving ferromagnetic objects. Following the signal conditioning is the detection stage. Detection can be done in several ways but the simplest is to rectify the signals so that they are always positive and compare them with a threshold level. If the threshold is exceeded by the magnetic signal, an audible and visual alarm will result. Adjusting the threshold modifies the sensitivity of the system. That is, a higher threshold means that the magnetic signal must be larger to exceed it and vice versa.</para>
    <para>There are two uses of FMDS: entryway and patient screening:</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Entryway FMDS.</emphasis> The purpose of these is to protect the MR system room and any people within it. Entryway FMDS are systems that are normally mounted at or near the entrances of the scanner rooms. Their main use is to provide a warning to individuals approaching the scanner room if they are bringing ferromagnetic objects with them, prior to their actual entry. Normally these FMDS are configured to detect objects that can cause serious accidents such as phones, scissors and, in particular, larger ferromagnetic objects.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Patient Screening.</emphasis> These FMDS mounted in or near the patient preparation areas (e.g. the dressing rooms) with the purpose of warning if the patient who is about to be scanned is carrying a ferromagnetic object. This type of an FMD device may be a wall-mounted or a handheld device. They are set to be of higher sensitivity than the entryway systems because they need to detect relatively small objects such as bobby pins that may cause imaging artifacts. This type an FMD device comes in two forms: wall-mounted as a single upright unit, in front of which a patient rotates, or as a handheld device.</para>
    <para>For an entryway FMD device, if ferromagnetic objects are moving close to it that are not intended to go into the MR system room, most manufacturers have techniques for suppressing the alarm unless the object is actually passing into the scanner room itself. This reduces the unwanted or nuisance alarms (21). Because doors leading into the MR system room tend to be relatively wide, in order to get good coverage across the width, the FMD device will have sensors on both sides of the door. This may be in the form of two wall-mounted units as illustrated in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 5 (a)</emphasis>, a frame surrounding the door as shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 5 (b)</emphasis>, or two freestanding units that are upright poles with bases, although these are less common.</para>
    <para>It is important to note that the sensors are housed in the upright sections of the FMD device, and the closer these are together the more sensitive the system will be in its least sensitive position, that is, at the midpoint of the uprights. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis> shows illustratively how the field perturbation from a ferromagnetic object decays with distance as B ∝ 1 / r<superscript>3</superscript>.

    <para>Note that the FMDS response is non-uniform and has a minimum for objects at the midpoint, point B (Figure 6). If the FMD device uprights were further apart, the minimum would be lower.

    <para>Sensitivity (or true positive alert rate) in the context of FMDS is the ability for detecting ferromagnetic objects. The higher the sensitivity of the sensors within an FMD device, the smaller the ferromagnetic object it will detect. For a patient screening FMD device, this is extremely important because a more sensitive device can find ferromagnetic objects that a less sensitive one will miss. Not all FMDS are the same. Sensitivity can vary considerably between different manufacturers. The FMD device market is unregulated and most manufacturers claim, without accountability, to have the most sensitive products.

    <para>To warn an individual approaching an MR system doorway with a ferromagnetic object, entryway FMDS typically incorporate both lights and sound. For entryway systems, the magnetic sensors can detect objects before they get to the threshold. The distance at which they can do this depends on the magnetic susceptibility and size of the object and the sensitivity setting of the detector. Visible lights, normally green for no detection and red or yellow for a detection, are used to indicate approaching ferromagnetic objects. It is incumbent upon the person entering to stop and check themselves prior to entering if a red or amber warning light is observed. FMDS also normally have a light beam or other sensor across the threshold to sense whether a person or object is entering the scanner room rather than passing by. If the beam is broken by an individual and there is a detected ferromagnetic object, then an audible alert will be issued (21). The audible alert is the final warning before the MR system room is entered.</para>

            <title>Installation Considerations</title>
    <para>The effectiveness of an FMD device depends not only upon the quality of the system itself, but where it is sited and what its environment is. We first consider the entryway FMDS. It is important that an FMD device is sited such that anyone entering the MR system room must pass through it. There may be many different architectural layouts for scanner rooms, however, there are five main entrance types. These are, as follows:</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Off an atrium.</emphasis> In this case, the door is in the wall of a room that may have an open control room (or several) or a waiting area. In some facilities, these are highly compact with control room desks and patient transfer equipment in a confined space. Others have large uncluttered areas.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">With an anti-chamber.</emphasis> Here, stub walls are built out from both sides of the MR system doorway, usually to a distance of 1.5- to 2-meters. These may be built for a variety of reasons, but most commonly for allowing extra control desk and working areas, or dedicated space for outward opening MR system room doors to swing into. Sometimes these are built specially to accommodate an FMD device.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">End of a corridor.</emphasis> Due to being at the end, the last section of the corridor is dedicated to the MR scanner. In this respect, it is similar to the anti-chamber setting. The system control room will often have a door to the side of the corridor shortly before the MR system door, itself.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Side of a corridor.</emphasis> This is a common layout but the least safe. This layout is poor practice from a safety consideration unless the corridor can be a controlled area.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Mobile MRI trailer.</emphasis> This a highly compact setting and a smaller than standard MR system door is usually installed. The control room is in close proximity to the door.</para>
    <para>For each of these entrance types, the door may be swing-in or swing-out (although swing-out is rare for a side of a corridor entrance). Usually the FMD device will be installed on the immediate surrounding area of the door itself because there is normally available wall space. It is preferable to use an FMD device that has a door-ignore capability to mount at the door. Otherwise, the system should be offset a distance of 1.5- to 2-meters in front of the door so the person entering has been screened by the FMD device before the door is opened. This can only be practically achieved with anti-chamber or end of corridor layouts.</para>
    <para>For swing-out doors that open near an FMD device mounted on the outside of the door, as issue is presented because the FMD device needs to distinguish between the door opening and a person carrying a ferromagnetic object. In both cases, a moving ferromagnetic object is passing through the FMD device, the door is safe and the person is unsafe. Different manufacturers of FMDS have developed different solutions to address this situation. One manufacturer developed a solution that allows the FMD device to be mounted on the outside of a swing-out door and operate normally (22). Another manufacturer elected to install the FMD device on the inside of the MR system room, so that the door swings outwards away from the device, not through it (17). Notably, some MRI users regard this as providing a warning too late, or as being non-compliant with ACR recommendations (2), while others accept it.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">WHAT FMDS WILL AND WILL NOT DETECT: ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Magnetic Qualities of Potentially Dangerous Objects</emphasis></para>
    <para>The physics involved with magnetics is not intuitive. There are two common misconceptions that individuals have when they consider using an FMD device in the MRI setting. It is often expected that identical objects will have identical magnetic qualities but, in fact, they can magnetically vary by several orders of magnitude. Another misconception is that larger ferromagnetic objects will be magnetically stronger (and pose a greater risk) than smaller ones. This premise can be true but so can the converse. Probably the most common question asked of the FMD device manufacturers is, <emphasis role="italics">what is the smallest object that can be detected?</emphasis> It is one of the most difficult questions to answer because a ferromagnetic object's size is not strongly related to its magnetic properties. Furthermore, because of the strong dependence on distance, very small ferromagnetic objects may be detected close to an FMD device sensor, whereas at longer distances to the FMD device, the same or larger objects may not be detected.</para>
    <para>As previously mentioned, the magnetic properties of a ferromagnetic object depend primarily on the material's magnetic susceptibility and the shape of the object (23). For objects with different sizes but made of the identical material, there is potential for the larger objects to be more heavily magnetized than the smaller ones. Also, for objects of identical size but made from different materials, there is potential for the objects with higher magnetic permeability to be more heavily magnetic than those with lower magnetic permeability. For example, a "weakly magnetic" pair of scissors made from steel can be magnetized more than a stainless steel pair of the same size and shape.</para>

    <para>Very small objects have only a limited potential to achieve high magnetic moments. Most magnets associated with MR systems will have relatively minor missile-related occurrences by paper clips, pens, or other small objects. The limited magnetic qualities along with the very light weight of certain objects such as those means that they cannot accumulate enough kinetic energy to do damage or cause much inconvenience (unless the object impacts a particularly delicate area, such as the human eye). There is clearly a grey-scale between this and a missile-related accident with larger objects that will be inevitably serious. Using an FMD device at the MR system door should, at the mid-point of the door, at least detect the latter.</para>
    <para>The relative signal strength related to the magnetic qualities of different objects that may be commonly found in the MRI setting has been measured (M.N. Keene, unpublished data) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>). These measurements were made in the fringe field, just outside of an MR system room at 1-Gauss and at the mid-point, 75-cm from the uprights of the FMDS. The average of several movements past the FMD device for each object are shown. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis> shows data for objects commonly found in control rooms and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis> shows data for personal items. The vertical scale is consistent between <emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>. Depending upon the type of sensor used (or brand of the FMD device), the maximum sensitivity that is available is between 0.06 and 0.3 on this scale. Notably, the signals are much higher if the objects are near to the FMD device's uprights.</para>

            <title>Working With Entryway FMDS</title>
    <para>The ideal FMD device (which does not yet exist) would have the following qualities: (1) no adaptations to workflow would be needed to accommodate the FMD device, (2) the FMD device would never alarm unless there was a ferromagnetic object entering the MR system room and (3) the FMD device would only alarm on loose objects that could become a hazard and not on tethered or restrained ferromagnetic objects (e.g., bra underwires or docking tables associated with scanners).</para>
    <para>It is not ideal for MRI technologists or radiographers to have to modify their behavior to accommodate an FMD device. The main concern is opening and entering the door (which is highly magnetic) to the MR system room. At least one system allows the door to be opened and swinging as the MRI technologist enters and is still able to screen them efficiently (16). Others do not and so the door must be open and stationary before anyone can enter. The door is not an issue where an FMD device that is mounted a few feet in front of the door, although this configuration only works with certain facility layouts.</para>
    <para>Some unwanted audible alerts may occur when a person not carrying a ferromagnetic object enters the MRI room at a time when there is a large ferromagnetic object moving nearby, such as a control room chair. FMDS are developed to minimize the detection of</para>
    <para>moving ferromagnetic objects in Zone III but different systems do this to different degrees. Also, the more compact the Zone III space is, the more likely this will occur.</para>
    <para>An FMD device cannot yet distinguish between loose ferromagnetic objects that could become missiles and "fixed" ferromagnetic objects that cannot. For example, the bolts in an MR Conditional gurney or the ferromagnetic components in MR Conditional monitoring equipment become problematic for screening. In these instances, the FMD device detects only the presence of ferromagnetic objects and not whether they are free to move. Therefore, extraneous alarms are inevitable in some circumstances. This will be discussed in more detail in the following section.</para>
    <para>Overall, the use of an FMD device is believed to significantly enhance the safety level of MRI facilities, although non-ideal aspects of the current systems can impact the day-to-day activity and workflow of the MRI staff members, especially the MRI technologists. The individuals who are believed to cause most missile-related accidents are non-MRI workers who enter the room. While MRI technologists may not be able to supervise and control access to the scanner room constantly, an FMD device can and, thus, provides a warning to a person entering when the door is unsupervised. If non-technologists cause "alarms", they should be trained to seek the advice of an MRI technologist before entering the MR system room.</para>
    <para>When an FMD device alarms, its purpose is to prompt the MRI technologist to investigate. For example, an MRI technologist pushes an MR Conditional stretcher into the room and the alarm sounds, as always, because the stretcher typically has ferromagnetic components. The correct response of the MRI technologist is to stop and to perform a final check of the patient and the stretcher. Is the stretcher acceptable to use with this particular MR system? Is there a ferromagnetic oxygen cylinder or IV pole present that is MR Unsafe? Is there a ferromagnetic object under the sheets such as a sand bag with metallic shot? The incorrect response is to ignore the alarm because an MR Conditional stretcher will always trigger an alarm. Many accidents have occurred because of ferromagnetic items being placed on top of stretchers or underneath sheets, next to the patient. In this case, the alarm from the FMD device acts as a reminder to do a final check. It must be emphasized that FMDS are an adjunct to all other safe practices established for the MRI environment and should not replace any part of it. An FMD device adds an extra layer of safety.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Extraneous Alarms and False Alarms: Causes and Prevention</emphasis>There is an important distinction between false alarms and extraneous (nuisance) alarms. A <emphasis role="italics">false alarm</emphasis> occurs when there is no ferromagnetic material passing through the FMD device but the alarm is activated. This may be due to some external factor causing a magnetic disturbance at the same time as a magnetically "clean" person passes through or by the FMD device. False alarms are rare when the FMD device has been installed and set up properly. The most common cause of false alarms are control room chairs when they are close to the FMD device and the occupant is moving or swiveling on it.</para>
    <para>An <emphasis role="italics">extraneous alarm</emphasis> occurs when ferromagnetic material is deliberately passed through the FMD device because it is known to not present a missile-related hazard. The most common causes of extraneous alarms are, the following: the door to the MR system room mov-</para>
    <para>ing as individuals pass through; MR Conditional equipment (e.g., gurneys, wheelchairs, monitoring equipment, equipment tables, etc.) passing by the FMD device, staff clothing and accessories (e.g., underwire bras, watches, shoes with metal supports, etc.); and patient clothing and accessories. Notably, with extraneous alarms, the FMD device is functioning normally and doing its job.</para>
    <para>If the frequency of extraneous alarms is excessive, alarm fatigue sets in and staff members soon begin to ignore the FMD device. When this occurs, the FMD device is reduced in effectiveness during the working hours of the MRI facility, although it still remains effective for non-MRI staff members. However, most of the causes of extraneous alarms are preventable and within the power of the MRI technologists to remediate them. Certain solutions exist to prevent extraneous alarms including, the following:</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Staff member clothing and accessories.</emphasis> This can be one of the biggest causes of extraneous alarms. One of the most common items is the ferromagnetic underwires in bras. Considering the activities of female MRI technologists, nurses and other personnel, these wires may come into close proximity with the MR system's magnet and, thus, become highly magnetized, for example some underwires can increase in magnetization by 20 times as a result of exposure to an MRI magnet. Other objects such as watches, bracelets, and shoes with tangs or metallic supports can also trigger the FMDS. Alternatives for all such clothing and accessories are readily available. Watches and ferromagnetic jewelry can easily be removed.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional equipment.</emphasis> For patient transfer equipment, there are products that are available that are entirely nonferromagnetic and, thus, will not cause extraneous alarms. The use of nonferromagnetic transfer equipment means an FMD device will alarm only on any ferromagnetic materials carried on them. For docking tables associated with scanners, patient monitors, and other equipment there is currently no solution. It is recommended that the extraneous alarm should be used for the purpose of taking the time to check the equipment for objects placed upon them before proceeding into the MR system room.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Patient clothing and accessories.</emphasis> It is always best practice to place patients in pocketless gowns or scrubs in preparation for MRI examinations. Accordingly, any FMD device alarm will be real and not extraneous. Underwire bras, shoes with metal supports, and ferromagnetic jewelry issues are the same as for staff members.</para>
    <para>There is a relationship between the effectiveness of an FMD device and its sensitivity level that becomes limited by the extraneous alert rate (24). Referring to <emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>, the 'effectiveness' of an FMD device is its ability to warn users that there are ferromagnetic objects entering the MR system room. When plotted against the sensitivity setting of an FMD device, the effectiveness increases with the sensitivity setting, up to a point (Point A in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). Further increasing the sensitivity results in lowered effectiveness due to alarm fatigue (Point B) caused by watches, shoes, pens, badges, underwires bras, and other items that the staff members may have as they enter the scanner room or pass the FMD device, or due to MR Conditional equipment with ferromagnetic components. Where such things are limited, the extraneous alarm rate may be lowered and a higher sensitivity level can be set, thus, increasing the FMD device's effectiveness (Point C). Some facilities operate a "zero magnetic" working policy (see next section) and with this, the highest effectiveness is achieved</para>

    <para>While it is unacceptable for patients to enter the MR system room with unnecessary ferromagnetic objects, it is often deemed acceptable (albeit poor practice) for staff members to do so, with the exception of those objects are retained in place by counterforces (e.g., watches, underwire bras, belt buckles, etc.). Zero magnetic working in the MRI environment is a method of working whereby staff members adopt the same mantra as patients and have no unnecessary ferromagnetic objects. The purpose is to minimize extraneous alarms on entryway an FMD device so that they can be set to a higher sensitivity level with a low extraneous alert rate (Point D, <emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>) to provide higher levels of safety.

            <title>Guidance on the Adoption of FMDS</title>
    <para>The effectiveness of an entryway an FMD device for improving safety depends predominantly on the attitude of the MRI facility's managers and MRI technologists. The introduction of an FMD device significantly increases the potential for safety improvements, but this may not be realized due to various factors. To illustrate this, two examples are provided.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">MRI Facility A</emphasis> purchased several entryway FMDS to protect their scanner rooms. They adopted a zero magnetic working policy. The patient transfer equipment was replaced with entirely nonferromagnetic equivalents. A culture of "zero tolerance" to unnecessary ferromagnetic materials entering the MR system rooms was introduced. Staff members were required to be entirely nonferromagnetic, adopting the same standard of "magnetic cleanliness" as their patients, and even wore pocketless scrubs to prevent accidental entry of objects. Each patient was gowned and checked with a screening FMD device prior to entry into the MR system room. The doors to the scanner rooms were always kept closed when not in use. The low extraneous alarm rate that resulted from these measures allowed each FMD device to be set at a relatively high sensitivity level, such that it could detect smaller ferromagnetic objects. The staff members had regular MRI safety training and were able to contribute to the evolving safety protocols for the facility.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">MRI Facility B</emphasis> also purchased several entryway FMDS to protect their MR system rooms. Unfortunately, the ferromagnetic detection systems were purchased by an inexperienced manager without consultation the MRI technologists. The staff members were unwilling to change the way they clothed, and the managers were unwilling to enforce a clothing policy. They kept their regular MR Conditional transfer equipment. Staff members resisted making any workflow concessions with regard to the doors to the MR system rooms. Patients were not gowned and their family members were allowed into the scanner rooms. A patient screening FMD device was not utilized. Despite being set to a low sensitivity to reduce extraneous alarms, each FMD device alarmed on virtually every entrance and exit occurrence. When this became intolerable each FMD device was turned off.</para>
    <para>The examples of <emphasis role="italics">MRI Facility A</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">MRI Facility B</emphasis> may be regarded as being at opposite ends of a safety spectrum where one facility maximized its safety standard and represented best practice, while the other facility was unchanged from its initial poor practice. For any MRI facility, improving safety with regard to missile-related accidents using an FMD device is a journey. Some facilities choose to make that journey in one leap with a radical culture change to become like <emphasis role="italics">MRI Facility A</emphasis> in a very short time. Typically, the facility will usually have good reason to do this with the most common reason being an occurrence of a missile-related accident or near miss that shocked the facility. Events like these tend to unite the MRI technologists and the facility management to take all effective measures to prevent a problem from occurring again.</para>

    <para>For most facilities, the implementation of an FMD device involves gradual changes. The FMD device may be set to the modest sensitivity initially (e.g., Point A in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>. As the MRI technologists improve their protocols, procedures, and their surrounding environmental factors, the sensitivity of the FMD device may be increased accordingly, as time goes by. Well-organized facilities do this as a defined structured plan. It is possible with some entryway FMDS to chart the number of entries into MR system room and the number for which an alert was issued (see <emphasis role="italics">The Entryway FMD Device as a Safety Management Tool</emphasis> below). Thus, improvements due to new procedures, workflow or environment can be measured. It is much more motivating for MRI technologists to see that changes can result in measurable improvements to safety.</para>

          <title>Workflow Aspects of Using an Entryway FMD Device</title>
    <para>The FMD device should be sited where workflow is least affected. For an MRI facility that is high on the safety scale where extraneous alarms are low, there is very little impact on workflow. In the case of where there are a substantial number of extraneous alarms and each one is investigated, the impact increases. In many facilities, the workflow is a key priority that will not be compromised. There are two common responses to this situation. One is to ignore the FMD device, which reduces safety levels. The other is to move up the safety scale to reduce the extraneous alarms. Both responses retain the workflow, but one increases safety while the other reduces it. For example, implementing a nonferromagnetic clothing policy tends to make the greatest impact on maintaining workflow in a positive safety direction followed by changing to nonferromagnetic patient transfer equipment.</para>

          <title>The Entryway FMD Device as a Safety Management Tool</title>
    <para>Recent innovations in entryway FMDS have taken them beyond a warning device at the MR system door. Some entryway systems (16, 17) now have optional cameras that can make a short video recording or take a series of photographs when an alarm is triggered. This may help a facility understand the causes of alarms or to perform a root cause analysis on missile-related events.</para>
    <para>The most advanced FMDS can additionally collect data from the scanner doorways and provide access and interpretation of it to be presented on an app or a web browser (16). The data that such an FMD device can measure include the number of times the MR system room (i.e., Zone IV) has been entered, the number of times a ferromagnetic object has entered, the general level of magnetic activity in the area prior to the MR system room (i.e., Zone III), the status of the door (i.e., opened or closed), and the FMD device's self-test results. These data accumulate with time so trends can be observed. The data from each entryway FMD device within the facility can be inspected from an office computer, or on a smart phone or tablet remotely, and at any time by authorized users.</para>
    <para>These data can be distilled into information that is useful to a facility manager, the MR safety officer, or the lead MRI technologist. For example, knowing the proportion of entries that cause extraneous alerts may be used to track the progress of process improvements implemented to reduce the entry of ferromagnetic objects. Additionally, the trend over time provides evidence of safety improving or worsening. Because the data from all MR systems owned by a facility are monitored, comparisons can be made between different shifts and</para>
    <para>between different scanners. This reveals where attention needs to be given for safety improvements. It is obvious that the fewer unnecessary ferromagnetic objects that enter the MR system room, the lower the probability of missile-related accidents. Thus, to measure and analyze this information will help to manage the improvement processes. Example data that illustrate the above is shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>. This facility implemented a procedural change during a one-month period that resulted in a lower number of incidents related to ferromagnetic objects.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 10.</emphasis> Illustration of how data from an FMD device can be used to manage safety. Here, it was observed that the ingress of unnecessary ferromagnetic material into the MR system room (Zone IV) required improvement. A process improvement was introduced at the end of February 2017 and the situation measurably improved. (Figure courtesy of Metrasens Ltd.)</para>
  <para>Data on the status of the MR system door can also drive safety management decisions. For example, the data may show that MRI A has the door left open on average 10 minutes per hour but is used by individuals passing through only for 2 minutes. By comparison, for MRI B, the door is only opened for people passing in and is closed at all other times. This may suggest for MRI A, that the door is left open unnecessarily, which is a safety weakness whereas MRI B has a good safety practice in this regard.</para>
    <para>High levels of magnetic activity outside the MR system door may indicate the presence of ferromagnetic objects that could accidentally and easily be carried into the room because they are in the immediate vicinity. It is not uncommon to find ferromagnetic trash bins, chairs, stools, linen carts, oxygen cylinder carts, and crash carts placed immediately outside the door to the scanner. Having the data to indicate which MR system room has a high level of magnetic activity immediately outside the door may motivate an inspection and lead to improvements.</para>
    <para>The collection of these data from across a facility, regardless of whether they are in different buildings or even different cities, allows these aspects of safety to be actively managed, centrally. Improvements can be targeted, and the effect of any changes measured. Safety changes that are evidence-based are often more acceptable than seemingly esoteric changes.</para>

          <title>FERROMAGNETIC DETECTION SYSTEMS FOR USE TO SCREEN PATIENTS</title>
    <para>Using an FMD device for patient screening is becoming more common (25-29). The main purpose of this practice is to check patients for ferromagnetic objects just prior to the MRI examination. The utilization of an FMD device will help to prevent potential missile-related incidents from devices a patient may bring into the MR system room and to reduce scanning artifacts due to small and well-hidden ferromagnetic objects such as bobby pins.</para>
    <para>A detailed study by the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority (30) reveals the range of objects and frequency of reported events for ferromagnetic items that passed conventional screening undetected. This study included events where objects were carried in by staff members. Ferromagnetic screening can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary ferromagnetic objects being carried into the MR system room by patients, as well as staff members if they screen themselves as a safety check.</para>
    <para>There are two types of patient screening FMDS available, wall-mounted as shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figures 11 (a) and 11 (b)</emphasis> and a handheld device, <emphasis role="bold">Figure 11 (c)</emphasis>. For a wall-mounted FMD device, the patient approaches the unit and slowly rotates in front of it. This process brings all parts of the surface of the patient within a few inches of the FMD device, which has a twofold purpose: (1) the small distance between a ferromagnetic object and the magnetic sensors permits smaller (i.e., lower magnetic susceptibility) objects to be detected and (2) it provides the necessary motion of the ferromagnetic object relative to the FMD device. By comparison, handheld FMD device is used to methodically scan the surface of the patient.</para>

(c) Handheld FMD device that is swept over the patient's body. (Photographs provided courtesy of Metrasens Ltd., Kopp Development Inc., and Mednovus, Inc.)</para>
  <para>Performing patient screening using an FMD device does not tend to have extraneous alarms because only the patient is screened and should essentially be free of ferromagnetic objects. Staff members and equipment are not screened this way unless there is a policy for this procedure. However, patient screening using an FMD device is subject to false alarms if there is a moving ferromagnetic object nearby during this screening process. Normally, the MRI technologist can easily identify this situation by observation, and repeat the screening, as needed.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The Patient Screening Process Using an FMD device</emphasis></para>
    <para>Screening the patient using an FMD device is an additional step in the screening process and is the last step before the MRI examination. It is important to note that it is not a replacement for any aspect of the screening procedure but rather it is an supplemental procedure that adds a final objective check prior to performing MRI (29). This type of screening normally takes less than a few minutes to complete provided that there is no positive alarm. It takes somewhat longer to use a handheld FMD device because it has to be manually scanned over the entire surface area of the patient's body. Ideally, there will be a line item at the bottom of the screening questionnaire that records the result FMD device screening and any observations or actions as a result.</para>

            <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management    427</title>
    <para>If a patient passes the FMD device screening without a detection occurring (i.e., no positive alarm), this should be documented on the screening form and the patient may then proceed with the MRI examination. If an alarm occurs, then the patient must be investigated for the presence of a ferromagnetic object and it should be removed, if possible. Once this has been completed, the patient should be re-screened using the FMD device. If a ferromagnetic object cannot be found, the FMD device screening should be repeated in case the original result was a false positive alarm. With genuine alarms that cannot be resolved, the MRI technologist must then suspect the possibility that the ferromagnetic object is internal, being either an implant or a foreign body (25-29). The patient's history should then be thoroughly checked before proceeding to MRI.</para>

          <title>Detection Performance</title>
    <para>The earlier discussion concerning the size of ferromagnetic objects that can be detected using entryway FMDS applies to patient screening utilizing an FMD device, as well. However, due to the shorter distance when using a patient screening FMD device, magnetically weaker objects can be more reliably detected. In general, bobby pins, hair barrettes, and other similar items can be reliable detected with the best performing patient screening FMD device. Obviously, this feature is good for artifact reduction and will save time re-scanning individuals in the MRI setting. However, very small ferromagnetic objects are not likely to be detected, such as a small metallic ferromagnetic foreign body in the eye.</para>
    <para>Because potentially dangerous objects that are discovered by FMD device screening and removed prior to MRI are not reportable, the efficacy of patient screening using this technique in clinical environments is difficult to accurately measure. Some investigations have been performed and report the performance of using a patient screening FMD device (25, 31, 32), but several are unpublished. A summary of information regarding clinical alert rates is provided in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>. It is interesting to note that although the patients in each of these published and unpublished studies were gowned, there were a surprising number of positive alarms. These alarms were mainly associated with removable dental implants, eyeglasses, underwire bras, and other objects.</para>

          <title>Using a Wall-Mounted Versus Handheld FMD Device</title>
    <para>The use of a wall-mounted FMD device provides head-to-toe, whole-body screening that is easy to accomplish and fast to perform for cooperative ambulatory patients. For nonambulatory patients, the only means of screening with a wall-mounted FMD device is to use a nonferromagnetic gurney or wheelchair and perform a "drive-by" in two directions parallel to the wall, pushed by an MRI technologist that has no ferromagnetic objects. However, this process will not provide the close distance required to detect the smallest objects, but is nonetheless useful for the detection of larger personal items.</para>
    <para>The use of a handheld FMD device (17, 18) is somewhat similar to using a handheld metal detector (e.g., the type used at airports), insofar as it must be swept or scanned over the surface of the individual's body at close range, usually within 5-cm of the surface. The sensing area is relatively small (approximately 5-cm x 9-cm) so that care must be taken to ensure that screening occurs with no gaps while maintaining a relatively short, stand-off distance. Due to this being a manual process, the quality and reliability of the screening de-</para>

    <para>pends on the person performing the scan using the handheld FMD device. Staff members may be reluctant to screen an intimate patient area, such as the groin, which may result in safety issues as reported by James et al. (26). Notably, the only available handheld FMD device at this time has a strong permanent magnet within it to boost the magnetization of ferromagnetic objects (17, 18). Because of this, this type of handheld FMD device should never be used close the eyes, near cardiac pacemakers, or other similar implanted devices to prevent the magnetic field from posing possible problems. A handheld FMD device can be used for a non-ambulatory patient on an MR Conditional stretcher or wheelchair, as well as nonferromagnetic ones. Using a stretcher, the patient needs to turn over from one side to the other to get full coverage for proper screening. Using a wheelchair, it is more difficult to get full coverage unless the patient can stand in front of the FMD device for a short period of time.</para>

            <title>Screening for Ferromagnetic Implants, Devices, and Foreign Bodies</title>
    <para>The question surrounding the detection of ferromagnetic implants, devices, and foreign bodies is a current research topic with growing interest (25-29, 31). The use of a patient screening FMD device is not intended to be used for the specific purpose of detecting implanted objects according to the manufacturers of these systems. However, because human flesh is effectively transparent to ferromagnetic detection, the distinction between ex vivo and in vivo ferromagnetic objects is merely one of range, and it can therefore be expected that ferromagnetic implants can be detected. Investigations on implant and foreign body detection have been conducted (25-29, 30, 32). Recently, a more comprehensive study confined to cardiac pacemakers demonstrated that good detection of such devices is possible with all pacemakers detected in the study group (33 different pacemaker models).(32). Pace-</para>
    <para>makers constitute by far the largest proportion, (58% compared to second place 14%), of objects causing adverse screening events in the most systematic study currently available, to date (30). Implanted objects can range from completely nonferromagnetic (e.g., abandoned cardiac pacing leads) to highly ferromagnetic items. The implants that may or may not be reliably detected are, therefore, dependent upon the sensitivity of the FMD device. It is important to note that FMDS are not approved medical devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, thus, cannot be sold as "implant detectors". Because of this, there are no standards of performance for the detection of implanted devices. Therefore, it is important to see published evidence in the peer-reviewed literature for performance of different FMDS if patient screening is to be considered for this additional use.</para>
    <para>It is important to note that conventional handheld metal detectors are still commonly found in patient screening areas. These handheld devices transmit a fluctuating magnetic field, which, if strong enough, could exceed the safe conditions for certain active implanted devices. However, the manufacturer rarely states the specifications for their device and how it changes with distance. As such, it is difficult to be certain that these are acceptable metal detectors for use on patients intended to detect active implants. Experimental studies have not determined a combination of implantable device and metal detector that may cause an adverse event (33), likewise for the handheld FMD device (17, 18) that contains a strong magnet (17, 18).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Siting Considerations for FMDS</emphasis></para>
    <para>Wall-mounted and handheld patient screening devices have two requirements on their installation or use location. First, this type an FMD device needs to be installed in a convenient position from the point of view of efficient workflow. This will typically be in the patient changing or preparation area, or sometimes in the immediate area prior to the MR system room (Zone III), although this is less ideal due to the activities in this area. The second requirement is that it is located sufficiently far enough awayfrom interfering magnetic sources so that it can be set to maximum sensitivity. Interfering sources may include public corridors, roads, and elevators.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">INTERVENTIONAL, INTRAOPERATIVE, HYBRID-MR SYSTEMS, AND 7-T MRI ENVIRONMENTS</emphasis></para>
    <para>There are increasing numbers of hospitals using suites where the MRI is not a standalone diagnostic imaging tool. These include interventional, intraoperative, hybrid-MR systems (e.g., PET/MR, radiation therapy MR, etc.), and ultra-high-field systems, each of which present new challenges for patient safety with respect to missile-related events. These suites are intrinsically more at risk from ferromagnetic projectiles than regular clinical MR scanners for two important reasons: (1) there is a more varied mixture of staff members involved with the procedures, so a consistently high standard of safety knowledge and training is very difficult to achieve, and (2) there is a substantially larger number of types of equipment that is needed in the respective scanner.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Interventional.</emphasis> The use of an entryway FMD device at an interventional MR system room entrance is likely to be counter-productive unless it is implemented as part of a broader</para>
    <para>safety strategy. The main issue is alarm fatigue because the mixture of different staff members, types equipment that is required for use in this setting, and other factors. Currently, there are two approaches for the use of an entryway FMD device in the interventional MRI environment. The first is to implement a zero magnetic dress code for all staff members working in this area regardless of role or position. Notably, an FMD device patient screener repurposed as a staff screener outside of the suite will enable self-checking. All equipment entering should be inspected for safety and transferred in only by the MRI technologist preferably in advance of the procedure and other staff members arriving. This way, the equipment may be checked by an experienced individual and the FMD device can be ignored or temporarily silenced (a feature that some FMDS have) during this ingress.. With the exception of the patient being transferred to the room on the docking MR system table or MR Conditional gurney, there should be no further extraneous alerts.</para>
    <para>The second approach is to use an entryway FMD device in an area some distance in front of the suite's door such that it can be bypassed. Thus, the FMD device can then be used at the discretion of the MRI technologist to check individuals and equipment for which there is some uncertainty. Objects or staff members that the MRI technologist has confidence are safe for the MR system room but that are like to cause an alert, may bypass the FMD device.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Intraoperative.</emphasis> For entrances inbetween interoperative suites (including the IMRIS Hybrid Operating Suites), the issues and solutions are similar to the interventional suite. However, if there is a door to the scanner room from the control room for the MRI technologist to use and is not in the workflow for patients and the other staff members, then a regular entryway FMD device may be used. Many intraoperative suites have inner sliding doors between the operating room and the MR system, such as that used with the IMRIS Hybrid Operating Suite. It is inadvisable to use an entryway FMD device in this setting because there will always be nuisance alerts related to movement of the table. However, the installation of a 'patient screener' FMD device near these doors in the OR side is advisable for the use of OR staff to check themselves prior to entering the MR system room. It is the role of the technologist to assess the safety of the docking table with the patient on the table. This may be by visual inspection and also questioning the surgeon about whether any instruments are internal to or attached to the patient.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Linac/MR.</emphasis> Linac (linear accelerator)/MR radiotherapy suites feature very heavy radiation shielded doors that are very slow opening due to the lead and concrete construction in a steel frame. This presents a challenge to install entryway FMDS at the door as regular door-ignoring technology in FMDS struggle to cope with slow moving automated sliding doors. An entryway FMD device may be installed at the doorway, but it is best to wait for it to fully open before entering. Alternatively, they may feature a <emphasis role="italics">maze corridor</emphasis> leading to a regular MRI door to prevent any line-of-sight for radiation leakage into the hospital. It is advisable to install an entryway an FMD device in this corridor prior to the scanner's entry door.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">7-T MRI Environment.</emphasis> The introduction of research and clinical 7-T MR systems presents new challenges for safety. The magnetic fringe fields are generally higher than for 1.5- and 3-T and, thus, the forces acting on ferromagnetic objects will be higher. Much of the</para>
    <para>equipment labeled MR Conditional that is familiar for everyday use in scanners with lower static magnetic fields needs to be tested at 7-Tesla. This important task been accomplished by Culo, et al. (34) for many commonly used patient support devices including wheelchairs, IV poles, instrument tables, step stools, and others devices. Entryway and/or patient screening FMDS may be used for 7-T MRI settings similar to how they are used with lower field strength scanners. In 2019, Hoff, et al. (35) presented general safety considerations for the 7-T MRI environment.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">REQUIREMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FMDS</emphasis>In the United States (U.S.), the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends the use of FMDS in their guidance document on MR safe practices (2). This document is largely regarded as a model for the standard management of patients referred for MRI examinations. The Facilities Guidelines Institute (FGI) requires FMDS for new and retrofitted builds (36). The FGI guidelines have been adopted by The Joint Commission in their Environment of Care Standard EC.02.06.05 and by over 40 states in the U.S. (37).</para>
    <para>In the United Kingdom, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends the use of FMDS (38), and Italy is likely to emerge as the first country to have a national requirement (39). There are other international bodies that make similar recommendations based on the ACR's recommendations (2). Therefore, it is advisable for all MRI facility planners and managers to familiarize themselves with the recommendations or requirements from their national regulators with respect to FMDS.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis>The safety of patients, staff, equipment, and reputation of an MRI facility should be recognized as a holistic issue, not just about the use of an FMD device, but the entire culture. This culture should be characterized by the adoption of best practice in safety procedures, staff training and education, use of safety-related technology along with a striving for continuous improvements at all levels. Unfortunately, there is a notion that adopting high safety standards often work against the high throughput or efficiency of the MRI facility. This is a dangerous and incorrect perspective.</para>
    <para>The availability of an FMD device as a safety technology has substantially increased the potential safety levels that a facility may attain. If these devices are adopted with the view that they are one key element of an overall safety improvement program, they will be most effective. If they are adopted as an excuse to do nothing more on training or safety procedures, they will have a limited positive benefit.</para>
    <para>Earlier in this chapter, the ideal FMD device was defined. As the technology continues to develop, systems will move toward this ideal. The main non-ideal issue present with an FMD device relates to extraneous alarms, which are partly a result of the introduction of the FMD device into a setting where unnecessary ferromagnetic objects may be routinely carried into the MR system room and partly due to problematic siting (e.g., in proximity to equipment that transmits "magnetic noise"). Hopefully, technology used for FMDS will evolve to eventually overcome these matters.</para>
    <para>FMDS are not currently subjected to regulatory standards so there is no minimum performance standard defined for these devices. When selecting an FMD device, an MRI facility currently has to rely on the manufacturer's claims, whether or not a satisfactory experience occurred during the demonstration of the product, or recommendations from MRI safety experts. Fortunately, articles in the peer-reviewed literature have also helped to support the use of FMDS to prevent incidents and accidents.</para>
    <para>At some point, the use of an FMD device may become an essential screening tool for MRI facilities. To date, the statistical impact that these devices have on safety has yet to be investigated and, therefore, it is difficult to know how many accidents or injuries have been avoided. As the recognition of the need to improve MRI safety proliferates and as the use of FMD device technology correspondingly widens, the global MRI community will hopefully become substantially safer.</para>
    <para>Entryway FMDS may now have an additional use in the management of safety due to the data they collect at the doorway. This has elevated them from being just a point-of-use device to, additionally, an IoT (Internet of Things) device whereby safety managers may view and act upon data from all of their scanners in order to direct changes and target improvements, as well as to measure improvements. Additionally, these particular devices provide a recorded audit trail. Patient screening FMDS are increasingly being used as a final objective check for a patient before performing MRI. Their ability to discover certain important-to-detect implants and foreign bodies has been realized (26-32).</para>

          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Conventional physiological monitoring equipment and patient support devices were not originally designed to be utilized in the harsh magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment where static, time-varying gradient, and radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields can adversely impact (e.g., as a result of missile effects), affect, or alter the operation or use of these devices (1). Fortunately, various monitors and other patient support devices have been specially modified or specifically developed to be utilized safely in the MRI setting (1-32). Thus, commercially available MR Conditional monitors and other devices (note, certain devices are MR Safe if made from nonconducting, non-metallic materials) are readily available and can be used routinely for patients in the MRI environment (1-32).</para>
    <para>MRI healthcare professionals must carefully consider the ethical and medicolegal ramifications of providing proper patient care that includes identifying patients who require monitoring in the MRI setting and following a protocol that ensures their safety by using appropriate equipment, devices, and accessories (1, 33-43). The early detection and immediate treatment of complications that may occur in high-risk, critically ill, or anesthetized patients undergoing MRI can prevent relatively minor problems from becoming life-threatening situations.</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>One of the most critical factors involved in protecting patients from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-related injuries involves an understanding of the risks associated with the presence of metallic implants and devices that may cause problems that include serious injuries and fatalities (1-21). The standard of care for managing a patient referred for an MRI examination with an implant or device is to positively identify the particular item and then determine the relative safety of scanning the patient. This is best accomplished by referring to the MRI-specific labeling for the implant or device, which is typically presented in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis> (IFU). In instances when no labeling exists, the supervising physician (which is typically a radiologist) is responsible for making a decision on whether to scan the patient based on a careful consideration of the risks associated with the metallic object and the benefit of the diagnostic information provided by the MRI examination (1, 4, 5, 12).</para>
    <para>This chapter discusses the various MRI-related issues that exist for implants and devices (1-21). Notably, a comprehensive understanding of this essential information is particularly vital when managing patients with unlabeled medical products (1, 4, 5, 12). This chapter will also review information for commonly encountered implants, as well as medical devices that may present challenges with respect to MRI-related labeling.</para>

        <title>MRI-RELATED ISSUES FOR IMPLANTS AND DEVICES</title>
    <para>It is well known that MRI may be a contraindication for a patient with a metallic implant because of various factors that can result in serious injury or death (1-16). These include movement or dislodgment of a ferromagnetic implant or device, excessive MRI-related heating associated with the time-varying, gradient magnetic fields (i.e., for certain implants) and/or the RF field, induction of currents resulting in unintentional stimulation or other issues, changes in the operational aspects of the device, damage to the function of the device, the difficulty in interpreting MR images due to signal loss and/or distortion, and the misinterpretation of an imaging artifact as an abnormality (1-19).</para>
    <para>Implants and devices are typically categorized into two types: passive and active. A passive implant, such as a vascular clip or heart valve prosthesis, is one that serves its function without any source of power other than that generated by the gravity or the human body, while an active implant (often referred to as an active implantable medical device or AIMD), such as a cardiac pacemaker or neuromodulation system, is a medical device that relies on its function from a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by gravity or the human body (1, 9, 21, 22). Because of their complexity, AIMDs inherently pose a greater number MRI-related issues for patients compared to passive implants. The possible MRI-related risks for passive and active implants are summarized in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>.</para>

        <title>Magnetic Field Interactions</title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Translational Attraction and Torque.</emphasis> With regard to magnetic field interactions and MRI, translational attraction and/or torque may cause movement or dislodgment of a ferromagnetic implant, resulting in an uncomfortable sensation for the patient, an injury, or even a fatality (1-4, 20, 21, 23-58). Therefore, both translational attraction and torque are important to evaluate for implants and devices before patients with metallic objects are allowed to undergo MRI (1, 20-58).</para>
    <para>The effect of translational attraction acting on an implanted ferromagnetic object is predominantly responsible for a hazard that may occur in the immediate area of the MR system (1, 3, 8, 10, 12). That is, as one moves closer to the scanner or as the patient is moved into the bore for the MRI examination. The predominant effect of torque (or rotational alignment to the magnetic field) as it acts on a ferromagnetic object occurs in the center of the MR system, where the magnetic field is most homogenous (1, 3, 8, 10, 12). Notably, torque, which is proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field, will greatly influence implants and devices that have an elongated shape. Obviously, both translational attraction and torque combine to impact a ferromagnetic implant or device as the patient with the object moves towards the MR system and then into the center of the bore of the scanner (1, 3, 8, 10, 12).</para>
    <para>Various factors influence the risk of performing MRI in a patient with a ferromagnetic object including the strength of the static magnetic field, the level of the spatial gradient magnetic field (discussed below), the magnetic susceptibility of the object, the mass of the object, the geometry of the object, the location and orientation of the object <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>, the presence of retentive or anchoring mechanisms (i.e., fibrotic tissue, sutures, etc.), and the length of time the object has been implanted. These factors should be carefully considered before subjecting a patient with a metallic implant or other object to an MRI examination. This is particularly important if the object is located in a potentially dangerous area of the body such as a vital neural, vascular, or soft tissue structure where movement or dislodgment could injure the patient.</para>
    <para>With respect to the potential risks associated with a ferromagnetic implant, in addition to the findings for translational attraction and torque, the "intended <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> use" of the implant or device must be considered as well as the mechanisms that may provide retention of the object once it is implanted, as discussed above (e.g., implants or devices held in place by sutures, granulation or ingrowth of tissue, fixation devices, or by other means). Accordingly, sufficient counterforces may exist to retain even a ferromagnetic implant in place, <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>Numerous studies have assessed magnetic field interactions for implants and other items by measuring translational attraction and torque associated with static magnetic fields of MR systems operating as high as 8-Tesla (1, 23-58). These investigations generally demonstrated that MRI can be performed safely in patients with metallic objects that are nonferromagnetic or "weakly" ferromagnetic (i.e., only minimally attracted by the magnetic field), such that the magnetic field interactions are insufficient to move or dislodge them, <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>Additionally, patients with certain implants or devices that have relatively strong ferromagnetic qualities may be safely scanned using MRI because the objects are held in place by retentive forces that prevent them from being moved or dislodged with reference to the "intended in vivo use" of the object. For example, there is an interference screw (i.e., the Perfix Interference Screw) used for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament that is highly ferromagnetic. However, once this implant is placed in the patient (i.e., screwed into the patient's bone), this prevents it from being moved, even if the patient is exposed to a high-field MR system. Other medical implants that exhibit substantial ferromagnetic qualities may likewise be safe for patients undergoing MRI as a result of the presence of counterforces that prevent displacement of these objects. Of note is that there are medical implants that actually incorporate magnets as their functional components, such as programmable cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) shunt valves, cochlear implants, and certain orthopedic implants (e.g., the MAGEC System, Nuvasive, www.nuvasive.com). These particular implants are safe for patients undergoing MRI as long as highly specific safety guidelines are followed.</para>
    <para>In general, medical implants should undergo testing using ex vivo techniques to assess translational attraction and torque before allowing a patient with the object to undergo an MRI exam (1, 20-22). By following this guideline, the magnetic-aspects of an object may be determined so that a competent decision can be made concerning possible risks associated with subjecting the patient to MRI. Because movement or dislodgment of an implanted metallic object is one of the main mechanisms responsible for an injury, this part of implant testing is considered to be of utmost importance and should involve the use of an MR system operating at an appropriate static magnetic field strength. That is, if the intent is to scan the patient with the implant at 3-Tesla, the implant must be tested for magnetic field interactions at that field strength.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Lenz Effect-Related Forces.</emphasis> Forces related to the Lenz Effect are of potential concern in the MRI environment. In 1835, Heinrich Lenz stated the law that an electric current induced by a changing magnetic field will flow such that it will create its own magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field that created it. These opposing fields, which occupy the same space at the same time, result in a pair of forces. The more current that is generated, the greater the force that opposes it. The so-called "Lenz Effect" occurs with electrically conductive materials (i.e. not just ferromagnetic materials) that develop eddy currents in the presence of high-field-strength static magnetic fields, such as those associated with MR systems.</para>
    <para>Force associated with the Lenz Effect may restrict movement of large metallic objects (e.g., an aluminum oxygen tank) or potentially compromise the function of certain implants in the MRI setting, such as those with moving metallic parts. Interestingly, this force has been suggested to be of concern for prosthetic heart valves that have leaflets or discs, especially if the cardiac implant is used for mitral valve replacement, where the range of pressures are relatively low (higher pressures are more likely to overcome a substantial Lenz Effect).</para>
    <para>Condon and Hadley (59) first reported the theoretical possibility of Lenz Effect-related actions for heart valve prostheses that contain metallic disks or leaflets. In theory, "resistive</para>
    <para>pressure" may develop with the potential to inhibit both the opening and closing mechanism of a mechanical heart valve prosthesis that has leaflets or disks. In 2012, Golestanirad, et al. (60) conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Lenz Effect due to motion of artificial heart valves during MRI. They concluded that mechanical heart valves with strengthening rings may be considered safe even under ultra-high-field MRI conditions with field intensities as high as 10 Tesla. Edwards, et al. (61) performed an <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> study of the occurrence of Lenz Effect-related forces on various heart valve prostheses at 1.5-Tesla and assessed the risk of the impedance of valve function. The findings provided evidence of the Lenz Effect on certain cardiac valve prostheses exposed to the static magnetic field, which resulted in functional valve impedance and a potentially increased risk of valve regurgitation. While further evaluation of this phenomenon may be warranted, to date, the Lenz Effect has not been observed in association with clinical MRI examinations nor has it posed additional risks for patients with certain heart valve prostheses (i.e. those with metallic leaflets or disks) or any other implant for that matter.</para>
    <para>One important scenario of Lenz Effect-related forces involves patients with relatively large metallic implants, like implantable infusion pumps or external fixation systems. Despite the lack of movement or displacement hazards for these implants, rapid motion of the patient (e.g., as the patient enters the scanner's bore) with a large metallic implant that is oriented perpendicular to the direction of the static magnetic field of the scanner can result in forces on the implant opposing the motion that may be detected by the patient. In the event that the patient complains of experiencing forces, such as tugging or pulling on the implant, this might lead to the patient or MRI personnel erroneously concluding that the device has ferromagnetic components, and possibly cancelling the MRI examination (1, 4). Slowly moving a patient with a large metallic implant into and out of the bore of the MR system is essential to mitigate Lenz Effect-related forces that might be induced, decreasing the likelihood of a misunderstanding or unnecessary exam cancellation (1, 4).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Magnetic Field Interactions and Operational Disturbances.</emphasis> In certain cases, there is a possibility of changing the operation or function of a medical implant or device as a result of exposure to the powerful static magnetic field of the MR system. For an implant that has a component that is magnetic (e.g., cochlear implants, programmable CSF shunt valves, magnetic reflux management device, etc.), it is possible to disrupt the function of the device or to demagnetize the magnet, rendering it unacceptable for its intended use (1, 2). Therefore, this important aspect must be evaluated using comprehensive <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> testing techniques to verify that specific MRI conditions will not alter the device's function (20-22)</para>
    <para>MR systems with very low (0.064-Tesla or less) or very high (10.5-Tesla) static magnetic fields are currently used for clinical and research applications. Considering that most metallic objects evaluated for magnetic field interactions were assessed at 1.5- or 3-Tesla, an appropriate variance or modification of the information provided regarding the safety of performing an MRI procedure in a patient with a metallic object may exist when a scanner with a lower or higher static magnetic field strength was used for testing and labeling. Therefore, it is deemed acceptable to adjust safety recommendations depending on the static magnetic field strength and other considerations of a given scanner. Obviously, performing an MRI procedure using a 0.064-Tesla MR system has different risk implications for a patient with a ferromagnetic implant compared with using a 10.5-Tesla scanner.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="ch0018s0000s0004">
        <title>MRI-Related Heating</title>
    <para>Temperature increases produced in association with MRI have been studied using ex vivo techniques to evaluate various metallic implants, devices, and objects that have a variety of sizes, shapes, and metallic compositions or that are made from other conducting materials (1, 2, 38-82). In general, reports have indicated that only minor temperature changes occur in association with MRI and relatively short or compact metallic objects that are passive implants, including items such as aneurysm clips, hemostatic clips, prosthetic heart valves, vascular access ports, and similar devices. Therefore, heat generated during MRI involving a patient with a relatively small, passive implant does not appear to be a substantial hazard. Notably, to date, there has been no report of a patient being seriously injured as a result of excessive heating of a small passive implant or device.</para>
    <para>However, MRI-related heating is potentially problematic for implants that have an elongated shape or those that form a conducting loop of a particular diameter (1, 2, 4, 6-12, 15, 20-22, 62-75). For example, substantial heating resulting in injuries to patients can occur under certain MRI conditions for elongated implants (e.g., leads, wires, etc.) that form resonant antennas or that form resonant conducting loops (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Radiofrequency Field-Related Heating.</emphasis> Radiofrequency (RF) fields associated with MRI can induce electric current in conductors that causes tissue heating primarily due to resistive losses (1, 2, 4, 6, 8-12). Metallic implants and devices have high conductivity and low resistance to electric currents, which results in a minimal amount of implant heating. However, tissues surrounding a metallic implant can heat due to its relatively high electrical resistance (1, 2, 4, 6, 8-12). The evaluation of an implant or device for heating is particularly challenging because of the many factors that effect temperature increases in these items.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 1.</emphasis> Example of excessive MRI-related heating of a medical implant. An abandoned lead from a neuromodulation system was placed in a gelled-saline filled phantom and scanned using a 1.5-Tesla MR system at a whole-body averaged specific absorption rate of 3.8-W/kg. Note the rapid rise in temperature that occurred at the onset of MRI (black arrow) and the substantial heating of the lead that exceeded 73°C.</para>
  <para>Variables that impact RF field-related heating include: the specific type of implant or device; the electrical characteristics of the materials used for the implant or device; the transmitted RF wavelength of the MR system (e.g., at 1.5-Tesla, 64-MHz; at 3-Tesla, 128-MHz); the type of transmit RF coil that is used (i.e., transmit body RF coil, transmit head RF coil, etc.); the amount of RF energy delivered (i.e., based on the specific absorption rate, SAR or other RF energy-related metric); the technique used to calculate or estimate the SAR that is utilized by the MR system; the landmark position or body part undergoing MRI relative to the transmit RF coil; and the orientation or configuration of the implant or device relative to the source of RF energy (i.e., the transmit RF coil) (1, 2, 4, 6-12, 15, 20-22, 62-75).</para>
    <para>One consideration of RF field-related heating of an implant that may not be intuitive is that for a given item, heating can be substantially different depending on the frequency of RF that is applied. For example, evidence from an <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> study conducted by Shellock, et al. (83) reported that significantly <emphasis role="italics">less</emphasis> MRI-related heating occurred at 3-Tesla/128-MHz (whole-body-averaged SAR, 3-W/kg) versus 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz (whole-body-averaged SAR, 1.4-W/kg) for a pacemaker lead that was not connected to a pulse generator (same lead length, positioning in the phantom, etc.). This phenomenon whereby less heating was observed at 128-MHz versus 64-MHz has also been observed for external fixation devices, Foley catheters with temperature sensors, neuromodulation systems, relatively long peripheral vascular stents, and other implants. Therefore, it is vital to perform <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> testing to properly characterize MRI-related heating to identify potentially hazardous medical implants.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Gradient Magnetic Field-Induced Heating.</emphasis> Exposure to gradient magnetic fields utilized during MRI can induce eddy currents on the conductive surface of a metallic implant that is located inside the bore of the MR system (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78). Thus, this is a potential safety concern for patients that have certain metallic implants. The impact of the gradient magnetic fields is primarily determined by the surface area and thickness of the conductor (i.e., with specific respect to the dimensional aspects of the implant), the electrical conductivity of the metal, the rate of change of the gradient magnetic fields, and the relative orientation of implant to the gradient magnetic fields (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78).</para>
    <para>Because of the typical small planar surface area that exists for most passive implants, gradient magnetic field-induced heating is generally not expected to pose a hazard with respect to tissue damage for passive medical devices (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78). This is also the case for active implants that may have a relatively small surface area (e.g., leads associated with cardiac pacemakers and neuromodulation systems). However, gradient magnetic field-induced heating can be substantial for patients with certain sizable passive implants such as large cranial plates, acetabular cups used with total hip replacement prostheses, and implantable infusion pumps (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78). Accordingly, these situations pose a possible safety issue. Importantly, to date (i.e., 35+ years), there has been no report of an injury to a patient that has been attributed to gradient magnetic field-induced heating of a medical implant.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Induced Currents</emphasis></para>
    <para>The potential for MRI examinations to injure patients by inducing electrical currents in implants or devices made from conductive materials such as cardiac pacemakers, neuro-</para>
    <para>modulation systems, and other similar items has been previously reported (1, 2, 79-82). Notably, the performance of ex vivo testing of implants and devices to assess induced currents is predominantly focused on AIMDs since induced currents have not been described for passive implants (1, 2, 9, 20-22). In general, AIMDs developed to be safe for patients undergoing MRI incorporate special design features to suppress or prevent induced currents from presenting problems (9).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Artifacts</emphasis>The type and extent of artifacts caused by the presence of metallic implants and devices have been described and tend to be easily recognized on MR images (1, 2, 4, 17-19). Signal loss and/or image distortion associated with metallic objects are predominantly caused by a disruption of the local magnetic field that perturbs the relationship between position and frequency. In some cases, there may be areas of high signal intensity seen along the edge of a signal void or when there is an abrupt change in the shape of the item (e.g., the tip of a biopsy needle). Additionally, artifacts seen on MR images may be caused by gradient switching due to the generation of eddy currents.</para>
    <para>The extent of the artifact on an MR image is dependent on the implant's magnetic susceptibility, size, shape, position in the patient's body, the technique used for imaging (i.e., the specific pulse sequence parameters), and the image processing method. Careful selection of pulse sequence parameters decreases the size of artifacts and this is done routinely, especially for patients that undergo MRI with implants that are particularly large, such as total hip or total knee prostheses. Additionally, software-based techniques, such as the metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS), have been described that substantially reduce artifacts associated with metallic objects. Table 3 presents techniques that may be used to reduce artifacts associated with metallic implants.</para>

Thus, over the years, test methods have been developed by various</para>

    <para>organizations including the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with an ongoing commitment to ensure patient safety in the MRI environment (20-22, 84-88).</para>
    <para>The FDA is responsible for reviewing the test information submitted to them by the implant or device manufacturer, the MRI terminology, and the labeling assigned to the product. This terminology has evolved to keep pace with advances in MRI technology. Unfortunately, members of the MRI community frequently may not understand the terms that are used and are often confused by the conditions that are specified in "MR Conditional" labeling. This lack of understanding may result in patients with implants being exposed to potentially hazardous MRI conditions or in inappropriately preventing them from undergoing needed examinations. Importantly, the current labeling terminology that exists is associated with expanded labeling information that relates to the conditions that are deemed acceptable to ensure patient safety (21).</para>
    <para>Prior to implementing the current terminology, the terms "MR Safe" and "MR Compatible" were used for labeling purposes (89, 90). In time, it became apparent that these terms were somewhat confusing and often used interchangeably or incorrectly. In particular, these terms were frequently used without including the conditions for which the device had been demonstrated to be safe. Therefore, in an effort to develop more appropriate terminology and, more importantly, because the misuse of the terms could result in serious risks for patients and others in the MRI environment, a new set of MRI labeling terms was developed and released in 2005 (91). Thus, this terminology, which is currently recognized by the FDA (as well as notified or regulatory bodies outside the United States) and applied to implants and devices is, as follows (21): (a) <emphasis role="italics">MR Safe</emphasis> - a medical device that poses no known hazards resulting from exposure to any MR environment. MR Safe medical devices are composed of materials that are electrically nonconductive, nonmetallic, and nonmagnetic. Using this terminology, MR Safe items are non-conducting, non-metallic, and non-magnetic items such as a catheter made from silicone. (b) <emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional</emphasis> - a medical device with demonstrated safety in the MR environment within defined conditions including conditions for the static magnetic field, the time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and the radiofrequency fields. Conditions that define the MRI environment may include the strength of the static magnetic field value, the spatial gradient magnetic field value, the time-varying magnetic field value, the RF field value, and the specific absorption rate (SAR) level. Additional conditions, including the specific configuration for the item (e.g., the routing of leads used for a neurostimulation system) may be required. Other possible safety issues that may be part of the MR Conditional labeling include but are not limited to thermal injury, induced currents, electromagnetic interference, unintended stimulation, and unwanted interactions among other devices. (c) <emphasis role="italics">MR Unsafe</emphasis> – a medical device which poses unacceptable risks to the patient, medical staff, or other persons within the MR environment. MR Unsafe items include items such as a pair of ferromagnetic scissors.</para>
    <para>Because of the variety of MR systems (e.g., ranging from 0.064- to 7-Tesla) and conditions in clinical use today, the current terminology is intended to help elucidate labeling matters for medical devices and other items that may be used in the MRI environment to ensure the safe use of MRI technology. However, it should be noted that this updated terminology has not been applied retrospectively to the many implants and devices that pre-</para>
    <para>viously received FDA approved labeling using the now outdated terms, "MR Safe" or "MR Compatible" (in general, this applies to those objects tested prior to the release of the ASTM International information for labeling in 2005). Therefore, this important point must be understood to avoid undue confusion regarding the matter of the labeling that has been applied to previously tested implants (i.e., those labeled as MR Safe or MR Compatible) versus those that have recently undergone MRI testing and now labeled MR Safe, MR Conditional, or MR Unsafe (89-91). Notably, the specific content of the MRI labeling for an implant or device may take various forms (especially for AIMDs) because the format continues to be refined by the FDA in an ongoing effort to properly communicate this information to MRI healthcare professionals (21).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">MR Conditional Labeling Information: Explanation of the Content</emphasis>In addition to the frequent problems associated with understanding the MRI labeling, the actual content of the label is often misunderstood with respect to the conditions indicated for a given implant that is labeled "MR Conditional". Therefore, the following is an example of MR Conditional labeling for an implant, <emphasis role="italics">Example Implant</emphasis>, along with an explanation of the content provided for each aspect of the label (89):</para>

However, the term, "spatial gradient magnetic field" for medical device labeling relates to the rate at which the static magnetic field strength changes over space per unit distance and is the position in the MR system used to determine the translational attraction for the implant, according to the test procedure described in ASTM F2052 (84). Thus, indicated as dB/dx or, in this case, as 720-gauss/cm. In certain instances, if the measured deflection is relatively low, that is, 10-degrees or less, a calculation is performed to extrapolate the spatial gradient magnetic field value to a higher value in consideration of the basic acceptance criterion of 45-degrees or less for translational attraction. Therefore, it is not unusual to see labeling for implants or devices that present a spatial gradient magnetic field value of 2,000-gauss/cm or higher.)</para>

In certain instances, the MRI labeling may change for an implant as a result of new testing that was conducted or due to a change in materials. Importantly, the labeling that ensures the safe use of MRI is highly specific to the conditions that were utilized to assess the implant or device and any deviation from the defined procedures can lead to deleterious events, severe patient injuries, or fatalities, especially when AIMDs are present (1, 2, 4, 6-10, 79-82). MRI-related information is presented herein for a selection of <emphasis role="italics">passive</emphasis> implants in an effort to illustrate commonly encountered items as well as unique medical products.

By comparison, aneurysm clips classified as "nonferromagnetic" or "weakly ferromagnetic" are acceptable for patients undergoing MRI. (For the sake of discussion, the term "weakly ferromagnetic" refers to metal that demonstrates extremely low ferromagnetic qualities using highly sensitive instrumentation such as vibrating sample magnetometer or superconducting quantum interference and, thus, may not be technically referred to as being "nonferromagnetic." All metals possess some degree of magnetism, such that no metal is entirely nonferromagnetic.)</para>

          <title>Breast Tissue Expanders</title>
    <para>Adjustable breast tissue expanders are utilized for breast reconstruction following mastectomy, for the correction of breast and chest-wall deformities as well as underdevelopment, for tissue defect procedures, and for cosmetic augmentation. These devices are typically equipped with either an integrated injection port that is utilized to accept a needle for placement of saline for expansion of the prosthesis intra-operatively and/or postoperatively (47, 55, 58, 92-97).</para>
    <para>Breast tissue expanders commonly incorporate magnetic ports to allow for accurate detection of the injection site. These implants are substantially attracted to the static magnetic fields of MR systems and, therefore, may be uncomfortable, injurious, or contraindicated for patients undergoing MRI (47, 55, 58, 92-97). In general, because the magnetic infusion ports incorporated into most breast tissue expanders presumably interact adversely with the electromagnetic fields used for MRI, all such implants are labeled MR Unsafe. Therefore, the consensus practice is to use other imaging techniques when diagnostic exams, such as ultrasound or computed tomography, are needed for patient management (92-95). Another issue over and above safety is that breast tissue expanders with magnetic ports produce extremely large artifacts on MR images and, therefore, assessment of the breast using MRI is problematic (92-95). Of additional importance is that here may be a situation during which a patient is referred for MRI for the determination of breast cancer or an implant rupture, such that the presence of the excessive metallic artifact could obscure the precise location or nature of the abnormality.</para>
    <para>Over the years, there has been considerable controversy regarding the safety scanning patients with breast tissue expanders with magnetic ports (47, 55, 58, 92-97). During a period of more than three decades, only two cases reported problems associated with tissue expanders for patients that underwent MRI (96, 97), while a study conducted in a large series of patients where special precautions were taken to mitigate risks revealed no substantial issues (95).</para>

    <para>As part of the practice of medicine, MRI-trained radiologists may elect to override the labeling for implants, even if they are labeled MR Unsafe, by conducting a careful risk versus benefit analysis for individual cases. Therefore, in the event that a patient with a breast tissue expander with a magnetic port needs to undergo MRI for proper clinical management, the following procedural guidelines were proposed taking into consideration the clinical experience reported by Thimmappa, et al.

Notably, there is considerable evidence that MRI-related heating is a non-issue for breast implants with magnetic ports (55, 92, 93, 98), including a comprehensive study conducted by scientists from the FDA (94).

        <title>Coronary Artery Stents</title>
    <para>MRI testing has been performed on the majority of the commercially available bare metal and drug eluting coronary artery stents. These tests included assessments of magnetic field interactions, heating, and the characterization of artifacts. The findings resulted in MRI labeling that indicates that patients may undergo MRI exams at 1.5- or 3-Tesla immediately after implantation of the coronary artery stents.</para>
    <para>The standard policy that MRI labeling information is required to be reviewed before allowing scans in patients with coronary artery stents limits access to this essential diagnostic modality when labeling is unavailable. It should be noted that there has never been an adverse event reported in association with performing MRI in a patient with a coronary artery stent. Therefore, in consideration of the relevant peer-reviewed literature and other related documents (1, 2, 98-105), guidelines were developed indicating that it is acceptable to perform MRI exams in patients with all commercially available coronary artery stents, including patients with multiple coronary stents, by following specific guidelines. These guidelines were created by taking into consideration possible safety concerns, that is, magnetic field interactions and MRI-related heating for these implants. By following these admittedly conservative MRI conditions, every patient with a coronary artery stent can benefit from the diagnostic imaging information afforded by MRI (Table 4). Notably, the previous belief that it may be necessary to wait six weeks or longer after implantation of certain coronary artery stents to allow for endothelialization or other mechanism to prevent migration has been refuted because there are no coronary artery stents made from ferromagnetic materials (82, 98-105).</para>

    <para>A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is used to monitor blood glucose on a continual basis in individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes. A CGM uses a small needle-based sensor that is inserted subcutaneously and attached via an adhesive disc to the arm or abdomen (Figure 4). The CGM's sensor measures the individual's blood glucose level and can wirelessly transmit the information to a smart phone or other hand-held device. Because CGMs permit individuals to avoid needle sticks to determine their blood glucose level, these devices are extremely popular among diabetics.</para>
    <para>The most popular CGMs include the Dexcom G4 and Dexcom G6 (Dexcom, www.dexcom.com), the FreeStyle Libre products (Abbott, www.abbott.com), and the Guardian Connect (Medtronic, Inc., www.medtronic.com). Each of these CGMs is labeled MR Unsafe, requiring removal from the patient prior to permitting the individual to undergo an MRI exam.</para>
    <para>Presently, there is one CGM that is labeled MR Conditional. This device is the Eversense CGM System (Ascensia Diabetes Care, www.eversensediabetes.com). This CGM has an implanted sensor and an external transmitter, which makes its design entirely different from the other CGMs. The MR Conditional labeling states that the external transmitter must be removed from the patient prior to MRI. MRI may be performed in patients at 1.5- or 3-Tesla, using a maximum spatial field gradient magnetic field of 2,000 gauss/cm, and a maximum MR system reported, whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 4-W/kg (First Level Controlled Operating Mode) for 15 minutes of scanning per pulse sequence.</para>

          <title>Heart Valve Prostheses and Annuloplasty Rings</title>
    <para>In the clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) setting, it is often necessary to manage patients with heart valve prostheses [including transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVR), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) devices, percutaneous aortic valve replacement (PAVR) implants, transcatheter heart valves (THV), as well as other similar heart valve implants used in association with minimally invasive procedures] and annuloplasty rings (Figure 5). A large variety of heart valve prostheses and annuloplasty rings have been evaluated for MRI-related issues, especially with regard to the presence of magnetic field interactions and heating associated with exposure to clinical MR systems operating at field strengths of as high as 7-Tesla. Of these, certain ones exhibited measurable yet relatively minor magnetic field interactions. Because the actual attractive forces exerted on heart valve prostheses and annuloplasty rings are minimal compared to the force exerted by the beating heart (i.e., approximately 7.2-N), MRI will not pose a risk to patients with these implants. Furthermore, MRI-related heating has been reported to be relatively minor for all heart valve prostheses and annuloplasty rings that have undergone testing (1, 2, 82, 90, 103, 106-116).</para>
    <para>Similar to the routine management of patients with coronary artery stents, the standard policy that MRI labeling information is required to be reviewed before allowing scans in patients with heart valve prostheses and annuloplasty rings limits access to this essential diagnostic modality when labeling is unavailable. Importantly, there has never been an adverse event reported in association with performing MRI in a patient with a heart valve</para>

IUDs may be made from nonmetallic materials (e.g., plastic or polyethylene) or a combination of nonmetallic and metallic materials (117-123)(Figure 6). Copper is typically the metal used in an IUD, however, stainless steel or other metals may also be utilized.</para>
    <para>The IUDs made from nonmetallic materials are MR Safe. The ones that contain copper are MR Conditional (117-121). Common copper-based IUDs, such as the Copper T and Copper 7 IUD, have a fine copper coil wound around a portion of the implant. Accordingly, an artifact may be seen on MRI, however, the extent of the artifact is relatively small because of the low magnetic susceptibility of copper.</para>

    <para>IUDs made from stainless steel may pose a hazard to a patient undergoing MRI depending on the type stainless steel that was used. Stainless steels used for implants, including IUDs, may be either austenitic, which is a nonferromagnetic form, or martensitic which is a ferromagnetic type of stainless steel. At least four different IUDs commonly used in Asia, especially China, are made from stainless steel. Of these, the only one tested to date which displayed high magnetic field interactions was the Chinese Ring (123). The other stainless steel IUDs (the Chinese Double Ring, the Ota Ring, and the Chongqing Uterine-Shaped IUD) have not undergone testing for magnetic field interactions or heating and, thus, should be considered unsafe for patients until information can be obtained to demonstrate that they are MR Conditional.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Magnetically-Activated Orthopedic Implants</emphasis>Within the domain of orthopedic implants, certain products have magnetically-activated components that permit noninvasive adjustments of their lengths. For example, the Precice and Precice Stryde Systems (Nuvasive, www.nuvasive.com) are adjustable intramedullary rods that can be used for limb lengthening procedures involving the tibia or femur. These devices are lengthened using an external programmer, which eliminates the need for an external fixation system. The Precice System and Precice Stryde System are labeled MR Unsafe.</para>
    <para>Another example of a magnetically-activated orthopedic implant is the MAGEC System (Nuvasive, www.nuvasive.com) which utilizes innovative magnetic technology that is incorporated within adjustable growing rods that are modulated by an external controller (Figure 7). The MAGEC system is designed to avoid multiple distraction surgeries for the treatment of early-onset scoliosis. As a result, the MAGEC System helps reduce associated complication risks from repetitive surgeries and simplifies the management of patients with early onset scoliosis.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Penile Implants</emphasis>Various penile implants have been evaluated for MRI-related issues (1, 2, 125, 126) (Figure 8). Of these, two (i.e., the Duraphase and Omniphase models) demonstrated substantial ferromagnetic qualities when exposed to a 1.5- and 3-Tesla MR systems (1, 2, 125, 126). Fortunately, it is unlikely for a penile implant to cause an injury in a patient undergoing MRI because of magnetic field interactions. This is because of the manner in which such a device is utilized. With regard to scanning a patient with a penile implant made from ferromagnetic material, to avoid discomfort it is advisable to stabilized the implant by a suitable means such as an elastic bandage and to consider scanning the patient in a prone position. Findings for other penile implants reported that they either exhibited no translational attraction and torque, or relatively minor magnetic field interactions. To date, MRI-related heating has not been demonstrated to be substantial for any penile implant that has undergone testing.</para>

A vascular access port is usually implanted in a subcutaneous pocket under the upper chest wall (i.e., subclavicular area) with the catheters inserted in the jugular, subclavian, or cephalic vein (Figure 9). These implants have a variety of similar features that include a reservoir, central septum, and catheters and may be constructed from different materials including stainless steel, titanium, silicone, and plastic. Because of the widespread use of vascular access ports and the high probability that patients with these devices may require MRI examinations, it has been important to characterize the MRI-related issues for these implants (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129).</para>

  <para>Thus, over the years, MRI testing has been performed on the many commercially available vascular access ports (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129). These tests included evaluations of magnetic field interactions, heating, and the characterization of artifacts. The findings resulted in MRI labeling that indicates that patients may undergo MRI exams at 1.5- or 3-Tesla immediately after implantation of the vascular access ports (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129).</para>
    <para>Similar to the information presented for coronary artery stents, heart valve prostheses, and annuloplasty rings, the standard policy that MRI labeling information is required to be reviewed before allowing scans in patients with vascular access ports limits access to this essential diagnostic modality when labeling is unavailable. It should be noted that there has never been an adverse event reported in association with performing MRI in a patient with a vascular access port. Therefore, in consideration of the relevant peer-reviewed literature and other related documents (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129), guidelines were developed indicating that it is acceptable to perform MRI exams in patients with all commercially available vascular access ports. These guidelines were created by taking into consideration possible safety concerns, that is, magnetic field interactions and MRI-related heating for these implants. By following these admittedly conservative MRI conditions, every patient with a vascular access port can benefit from the diagnostic imaging information afforded by MRI (Table 7).</para>
    <para>With respect to MRI and artifacts, vascular access ports that will produce the least amount of artifact are made entirely from nonmetallic materials such as plastic, silicon, Delrin polyethylene, or polyether ether ketone (commonly known as PEEK). The ones that produce the largest artifacts are composed of metals or have metallic components in an unusual shape (e.g., the OmegaPort Access Port). Even vascular access ports made entirely from nonmetallic materials are, in fact, seen on MR images because they contain silicone (i.e., the septum portion of the port). Using MRI, the Larmor precessional frequency of fat is close to that of silicone (i.e., 100-Hz at 1.5-Tesla). Therefore, silicone used in the construction of a vascular access port may be observed on MR images with varying degrees of signal intensity depending on the pulse sequence that is used.</para>

    <para>The highest field strength MR system approved for clinical use is the 7-Tesla scanner. The unique research and clinical applications afforded by 7-Tesla MRI are predominantly due to the associated increase in the signal-to-noise ratio that can be exploited to achieve higher resolution images (4, 130-132). In addition, imaging at this ultra-high-field (UHF) enables the improved detection of functional and metabolic (i.e., using MR spectroscopy) abnormalities compared with lower-field-strength MR scanners (4, 130-132). Importantly, the UHF MR system presents unique safety issues, especially with respect to scanning patients with implants and devices (4, 130-132)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>).

    <para>As previously described in this chapter, attractive translational and rotational forces acting on metallic objects, including medical implants and devices, depend on a myriad of factors including the composition of the material and its shape (1, 2, 4, 130-132). Translational forces are highly dependent on the field strength and the spatial gradient magnetic field, while rotational forces are directly proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field (1, 2, 4, 130-132). Of note is that, in comparison to a 3-Tesla MR system, a scanner operating at 7-Tesla has a fringe field that changes faster as a function of distance from the static magnetic field. That is, the fringe field has a "steeper" spatial gradient magnetic field. Because both the static magnetic and spatial gradient magnetic fields are greater at 7-Tesla than at lower fields, translational attraction forces affect implants to a greater extent, which may pose higher risks for certain devices (4, 130-132).</para>

This results in the potential to heat shorter metallic implants and cause thermal injuries at 7-Tesla compared to what might occur at 1.5- or 3-Tesla (4, 130-132). Importantly, MRI-related heating at 7-Tesla may be of considerable concern when utilizing "stronger" RF pulses (e.g., fast spin echo pulse sequences) because temperature has been demonstrated to increase with the square of the transmitted pulse power (133).</para>

Accordingly, the test procedure applied to implants had to be modified in consideration of the available RF coils. Once a transmit body RF coil becomes available for 7-T MR systems, re-testing will be necessary.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Untested Passive Implants.</emphasis> In 2019, Barisano, et al. (144) described a case involving 7-Tesla MRI of the brain in a subject with untested and unlabeled, total knee replacement implants. Because these orthopedic implants were made of materials that were nonmetallic or had low magnetic susceptibilities and were implanted in an anatomic area far removed from the transmitted RF energy (i.e., a transmit/receive head RF coil was used for imaging), there were no deleterious effects anticipated for the scan. The subject had an uneventful outcome. The investigators proposed that, by following a similar strategy that takes into consideration the materials for a given implant and the anatomic area receiving the transmitted RF energy, 7-Tesla MRI may be used safely in situations where there is an untested implant (144). Note that this information applies to passive implants, only.</para>
    <para>Guidelines presented by Barisano, et al. (144) to manage patients or research subjects with untested implants were, as follows:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>The supervising physician (e.g., the MRI-trained radiologist) must perform an assessment of the risks associated with the implant versus the benefits of the MRI exam.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Because of the lack of MRI-related testing for the implant, a physician must provide written and verbal informed consent to the individual and include a discussion of the potential benefits, risks, and alternative imaging procedure that may be appropriate.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The material used to make the implant must be identified in order to establish if there may be issues with respect to magnetic field interactions and heating. Typically, material information can be obtained by contacting the manufacturer. Some common low magnetic susceptibility, metallic materials that are used for implants include cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy, nitinol, austenitic stainless steel (e.g., 316L, 316LVM, etc.), platinum, platinum-iridium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloy, tantalum, commercially pure titanium, and titanium alloy.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Since all metals are conductors, the position of the implant relative to the transmitted RF energy must be considered with respect to the potential for excessive heating. Thus, to ensure minimal risk, the entire implant must be located outside of the RF coil and a suitable distance from the area of the transmitted RF energy. (Note, in consideration of the possibility of "traveling-wave" effects, a minimum distance of 30-cm is deemed acceptable. See section below.) As previously indicated, the 7-Tesla MR systems approved for clinical use currently have transmit/receive head and knee RF coils, only. As such, a relatively straightforward decision may be made with respect to possible hazards related to excessive implant heating for this scanner configuration. Once a transmit body or other transmit body part-specific RF coils becomes available, the prediction of implant heating will become a greater challenge.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Continuously monitor the individual visually and verbally throughout the MRI exam. If the individual reports any unusual sensation, the scan must be immediately discontinued.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Kraff and Quick (131) summarized additional information regarding scanning patients at 7-Tesla with untested passive implants, recognizing that because of the lack of tested and labeled implants, both research and clinical uses of 7-Tesla MRI may be limited because of the exclusion of individuals with metallic implants. They proposed that by using a well-considered, risk versus benefit analysis, the already known advantages of 7-Tesla MRI in neurological and musculoskeletal diagnostic imaging should not be denied to patients despite the presence of passive implants, particularly for those implants labeled MR Conditional at 3-Tesla (131).</para>
    <para>In 2016, the national network German Ultrahigh Field Imaging (GUFI) published a consensus recommendation on the inclusion of study subjects imaged at 7-Tesla (145). The recommendation stated that the use of local transmit/receive RF coils (i.e., head and knee) has the advantage that the transmit RF exposure volume is considerably lower compared to the large exposure volume of transmit body RF coils that are on 1.5- and 3-Tesla scanners. As a result, the RF power density that exists outside of local transmit RF coils decreases rapidly. Therefore, for individuals with passive implants that are labeled MR Conditional at 3-Tesla, that do not contain magnetizable components, and that are located at a certain distance from the transmit RF coil, an overly conservative exclusion of individuals with implants would no longer be warranted, as previously required by many ethics committees.</para>
    <para>Of note is that the minimum distance between the implant and the local transmit RF coil depends on both components and, thus, must always be considered on a case-by-case basis. At 7-Tesla, the phenomenon of the "traveling wave" effect (146) (Note, the traveling wave effect suggests that there is a possibility that the bore of the scanner can act as a hollow circular waveguide for traveling waves that could interact with an implant outside of the area of the transmitted RF) needs to be taken into account, primarily for implants that have a complex geometry or that form a conducting loop of a certain diameter, and/or with dimensions of integral multiples of half a wavelength, or in cases for partially implanted metallic objects (131, 145). Accordingly, to ensure patient safety, the minimum allowable distance between the edge of the transmit RF coil and the implant should be 30 cm. While this value has not been determined by numerical simulations of various exposure scenarios, it does represent a conservative guideline for passive implants in association with scanning at 7-Tesla. (131).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Untested Active Implants.</emphasis> As previously discussed, an active implant contains electrical circuits and/or a power supply. Presently, no active implant has been tested and labeled MR Conditional at 7-Tesla. The potential safety risks are considered to be extremely high and related to excessive magnetic field interactions, RF field-induced heating, induced currents, device malfunction, and other MRI-related issues.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">GUIDELINES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE POST-OPERATIVE PATIENT</emphasis>There is often confusion regarding the issue of performing an MRI examination during the post-operative period in a patient with a metallic implant or device. Studies have sup-</para>
    <para>ported that, if the metallic object is a "passive implant" and it is made from nonferromagnetic material, the patient may undergo an MRI exam <emphasis role="italics">immediately</emphasis> after implantation using an MR system operating at 3-Tesla or less (1, 2). In fact, there are reports that describe placement of vascular stents, coils, filters, and other metallic implants using MR-guided procedures that include the use of high-field-strength (1.5- and 3-Tesla) scanners (1, 147, 148). Additionally, a patient or individual with a nonferromagnetic, passive implant is allowed to enter the MRI environment associated with a scanner operating at 3-Tesla or less immediately after the implantation of the device.</para>
    <para>Importantly, for a passive implant that does not state a "wait" period in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis> (IFU) or MRI-related labeling, there is no need to delay the MRI examination for the patient. For patients with implants that are "weakly magnetic" but rigidly fixed or otherwise anchored in the body (e.g., orthopedic implants or other similar devices), these individuals may undergo MRI immediately after implantation of the device.</para>
    <para>For an implant or device that exhibits ferromagnetic qualities, it may be necessary to wait a period of six weeks after implantation before performing MRI. For example, certain intravascular and intracavitary coils, stents, and filters designated as "magnetic" become firmly incorporated into tissue a minimum of six weeks following placement. In these cases, retentive or counter-forces provided by tissue ingrowth, scarring, granulation, or other mechanisms serve to prevent these objects from presenting risks or hazards to patients or individuals with respect to movement or dislodgement associated with magnetic field interactions (i.e., force and torque).</para>
    <para>Of course, the information above pertains to magnetic field interactions (i.e., force and torque) and further consideration must be given to MRI-related heating for the implant or device.</para>
    <para>If there is any concern regarding the integrity of the tissue with respect to its ability to retain the implant or object in place or the implant cannot be properly identified, the patient or individual should not be exposed to the MRI environment unless a radiologist gives careful consideration to the risk versus benefit aspects of the specific implant and the intended MRI conditions.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">MANAGING PATIENTS WITH UNLABELED IMPLANTS</emphasis>In the event that a patient referred for an MRI exam has a <emphasis role="italics">passive implant</emphasis> that does not have MRI labeling, the supervising physician may elect to clear the patient for MRI after a careful consideration of the risks versus the benefit, with attention to the factors that potentially pose a hazard for the particular implant (1, 4-12). These factors include magnetic field interactions (i.e, force and torque), MRI-related heating, and if the implant has a functional component, such as a programmable cerebral spinal fluid shunt valve, the impact of MRI on the operational aspects of the device must also be considered. It should be duly noted that the above information specifically pertains to scanning patients with <emphasis role="italics">passive implants</emphasis> and not to active implants because the inherent risks of AIMDs are particularly complicated and challenging to assess. Muhlenweg, et al. (11) and Kanal (12) provide thoughtfully de-</para>
    <para>signed strategies to follow when considering various aspects of the MRI-related risks associated with passive implants.</para>

        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <para>This chapter provided an overview of MRI-related issues for implants and devices and presented MRI-related information for several passive medical products. Comprehensive information for active implants is presented elsewhere in this textbook. With the continued advances in MRI technology and the development of more sophisticated implants and devices, there is an increased potential for hazardous situations to occur in the MRI environment. To ensure safety for individual and patients, MRI healthcare professionals should follow the guideline whereby an MRI examination should only be performed in a patient with a medical product that has been previously tested and demonstrated to be safe. For implants and devices with MR Conditional labeling, the specific information must be carefully followed to prevent patient injuries.</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>The number of active implanted medical devices available for treatment of medical conditions continues to increase rapidly. These devices are implanted frequently to address significant clinical conditions, and it is this group of patients that typically has need for clinical imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since these implants contain metallic components, by definition they cannot be considered MR Safe; they can be considered only MR Conditional or MR Unsafe. An active implantable medical device (AIMD) is a "medical device relying for its function on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity". In contrast, a passive medical device is one that serves its function without any source of power other than that generated by the human body or gravity (1). Notably, manufacturers are increasingly engineering their AIMDs to be MR Conditional, recognizing the commercial competitive advantage this can offer by permitting patients the ability to avail themselves of the diagnostic power of MRI.</para>

          <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     499</title>
    <para>Performing MRI examinations safely demands accurate identification of the precise make and model of any AIMD. Failure to identify an AIMD in a patient undergoing MRI can lead to severe risks. There is a well-known case in which a patient with a deep brain stimulation system suffered a severe radiofrequency (RF)-related burn to the thalami, resulting in a permanent neurological deficit (2). Undisclosed cardiac pacemakers have been associated with patient deaths in associating with the use of MRI. In 2020, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) foundation declared incomplete AIMD information in MRI patients as one of the top ten patient safety risks (3). Also in 2020, a panel of ten radiologists with expertise in MRI safety from nine high-volume academic centers was formed, with the objective of providing clarity on safety issues for the ten most frequently questioned devices (4). This panel reviewed the relevant peer-reviewed literature that was focused on key MRI-related issues regarding screening and adverse event reports, in addition to the manufacturer's Instructions For Use for various products. Using a Delphi-inspired method, 36 practical recommendations were generated with 100% consensus that should aid the clinical MRI community with respect to screening patients with biomedical implants (4).</para>
    <para>Sound, comprehensive screening processes are essential (5), and patients and/or their medical providers should be questioned at the time of ordering MRI exams about the presence of implanted devices. As an adjunct, electronic medical records are increasingly incorporating "implanted devices" modules that maintain important device-specific information (6). By identifying any device-specific MRI-related conditions prior to the patient's arrival at the facility, this can enhance efficiency by scheduling the patient on the proper 1.5-T or 3-T MR system, ensure timely availability of proper equipment such as transmit/receive RF head coils, and appropriate personnel (e.g., MR Safety Officers or MRSOs, specially-trained MRI technologists, MRI physicians, AIMD programming staff, etc.). This device-specific information should be reconciled when the patient reports to the MRI facility. Frequently, the patient will have an implant identification card from the device manufacturer that identifies the particular device. If the device was implanted at another institution, surgical records should be provided by written means, frequently by fax or similar alternative, to obtain the relevant information including the particular type of AIMD that is present and its component parts (e.g., the models of the implantable pulse generator and leads). It should be noted that verbal relaying of important device-specific information should not be permitted due to potential errors in accurately conveying the information. As an example, three different types of Yasargil aneurysm clips (Aesculap, www.aesculap.com) exist. The model FD, FE, and FT - all of which rhyme, and if the information for the clip model were conveyed only by telephone, and it was misinterpreted, there could be severe safety consequences insofar as the FE and FT models are MR Conditional, while the FD is MR Unsafe. Similarly, blanket statements from an outside facility purporting to claim that all their implants are "MRI compatible" or "MRI Safe" is unacceptable. As part of the screening process at the MRI facility, a ferromagnetic detection system can assist in disclosing the presence of certain implanted devices (7, 8).</para>
    <para>With positive identification of the device-specific make and model of the AIMD, several sources exist to identify whether a device is MR Unsafe or MR Conditional, with associated conditions. These include MRISafety.com, MagResource, Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID), and the specific device manufacturer's websites. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the GUDID, which is a compilation of every device</para>
    <para>that has a unique device identifier (UDI). With the UDI number, the GUDID website provides the manufacturer, name of the device and, in some cases, the MRI safety information as to whether the device is MR Conditional, MR Unsafe, or MR Safe. Other possible sources can then be consulted regarding the necessary conditions for safe scanning. For example, the MagnetVision app is a tool that is designed to help MRI healthcare professionals assess anticipated risks for patients with implants prior to performing MRI examinations (9).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Implant Movement</emphasis></para>
    <para>The MRI environment poses multiple challenges to safe scanning in a patient with an AIMD (Table 1). First, ferromagnetic content in the device is subject to translational attraction and torque from magnetic field interactions. Of note is that, typically, only limited ferromagnetic material remains in today's AIMDs, primarily associated with the power source (e.g., batteries). As the patient enters the MR system and moves through the spatial gradient magnetic field, nonferromagnetic metals are subjected to Lorentz forces that can produce slight displacement and vibration of the implanted metallic object. As such, it can be helpful for MRI staff members to alert the patient with an AIMD of this non-harmful possibility prior to entering the MR scanner to allay any concerns or fears if such minor movement is perceived. The potential mobility of the device is related to the degree to which it is encased by fibrous scar tissue or surgically fixed in place. Particularly for devices that are implanted off the central axis of the body, there is increasing tendency for these to be</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Heating of Device Components</emphasis></para>
    <para>Heating of device components primarily from the RF field is a major concern with respect to the leads associated with AIMDs. Conductive materials may act as resonant antennae, locally amplifying the RF energy used for MR image formation. Particularly in the context of neurostimulation systems, RF-related heating of leads in close proximity to sensitive tissues can potentially produce severe damage (2). In insulated leads where induced current is not dissipated over the length of the lead, heating is concentrated at the tip. Temperatures below 43°C are not associated with the long-term damage. However, at 60°C, there is instant protein denaturation and tissue coagulation. At temperatures between 44° and 60°C, tissue death is time-dependent.</para>
    <para>Particularly in insulated leads, the lead length exposed to the RF field is an important variable because heating is associated with the resonant frequency, with maximal heating related to the one-half wavelength. MR systems operating at 1.5-T and 3-T detect the nuclear magnetic resonance signal of <superscript>1</superscript>H nuclei at 64-MHz (wavelength 52 cm, one-half wavelength - 26 cm) and 128-MHz (wavelength 26 cm, one-half wavelength - 13 cm) resonance frequency, respectively. It should be noted that in body tissue, the effective wavelength is affected also by tissue permittivity as well as other factors (10).</para>
    <para>The physical length of the lead specified by the manufacturer may not correspond to the total length of the conductive material within the lead, making it difficult to predict which leads may create resonant conditions. Importantly, the attachment of a lead to an implantable pulse generator (IPG) can have a large influence on heating at the lead tip, with the possibility for temperatures being greatly elevated if the lead is unattached or abandoned. As result, there may be an increased risk of heating when scanning in the presence of abandoned leads, or when leads are unattached to an IPG (11).</para>
    <para>Other factors that can influence RF energy-related current deposition and heat production include the type of transmit RF coil employed for imaging and the position of the metallic implant, as well as its "path" or configuration, relative to the transmitted RF. The majority of clinically utilized receive-only RF coils rely on an integrated body transmit RF coil for RF excitation, exposing the majority of the patient's body to RF energy. Smaller transmit/receive (T/R) RF coils (e.g., the T/R head RF coil, T/R knee RF coil, etc.) that both broadcast RF and detect the emitted signals, are readily available on MR systems for head or extremity imaging. The smaller head or extremity transmit/receive RF coils typically deposit the majority of RF within the volume of the coil, only. Notably, the MRI-related conditions for AIMDs may specify eligible types of transmit RF coils and/or acceptable distances of the AIMD away from the transmit RF coil in order to limit or prevent exposure to RF energy during MRI.</para>
    <para>It is important to emphasize that MRI-related conditions, particularly related to RF-induced heating, cannot be presumed at different static magnetic field strengths or for multinuclear (i.e., non-proton) imaging, because the frequency and the frequency and wavelengths of the RF pulses are field strength dependent. For example, conditional safety</para>
    <para>for an AIMD at 3-T/128-MHz at a specific SAR level does not imply conditional safety at 1.5-T/64-MHz (10). Induced currents, particularly within AIMDs, is also a possibility due to exposure to the rapidly switching gradient magnetic fields associated with MRI.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Device Malfunction</emphasis></para>
    <para>Time-varying gradient magnetic fields and RF can induce currents within the AIMD, which may interfere with the control electronics. Thus, when exposed to the RF and gradient fields, AIMDs may improperly function or "reset". The static magnetic field can also interact with certain devices, especially those with moving metallic components. For example, implantable infusion pumps with rotor mechanisms can slow down or stop as a result of exposure to the static magnetic field of the MR system (see section on <emphasis role="bold">Implantable Infusion Pumps</emphasis>).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">PERFORMING MRI IN PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICES</emphasis></para>
    <para>Active implanted medical devices include cardiac devices (cardiac pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, loop recorders and others) and neurostimulation systems (deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation systems, vagus nerve stimulation systems, sacral nerve stimulation systems, hypoglossal nerve stimulation systems, peripheral nerve stimulation systems, auditory brainstem implants, cochlear implants, and others), implantable infusion pumps, ingestible video endoscopy capsules, and others devices. An exhaustive discussion of each of these is well beyond the scope of this chapter, however, other chapters in this textbook provide relevant information for AIMDs.</para>
    <para>Because conditions for scanning frequently change and new devices are constantly becoming available, it is essential that MRI healthcare workers ensure that they are using the most up-to-date information that is available. As always, it is essential to not fall prey to "siloed search" recognizing that patients may present with multiple implanted devices, any of which could be dangerous if not scanned with the appropriate MRI-related conditions.</para>
    <para>It is also important to understand that, within a particular model of AIMD, there may be multiple configurations using various components or lead models. In general, the evaluation of an AIMD for MRI-related issues is highly specific to the complete system and particular to a given IPG and leads. As such, the MRI-related conditions to perform an MRI exam safely may have different limits, depending on which components are present in the patient. Each component of the AIMD must be carefully identified to ensure that the complete system is MR Conditional. In some cases, an AIMD may involve MR Conditional components from different manufacturers and, as a result, the safety of scanning the patient is unknown because that scenario was never tested.</para>

  <para>vital brain structures, MR-induced heating could have devastating clinical consequences, as reported by Henderson, et al. (2). A patient undergoing an MRI of the lumbar spine using a body transmit system suffered a significant lesion in the thalamus on the side ipsilateral to the relatively long lead connected to an IPG implanted in the abdomen area, resulting in a hemiparesis (2)(Figure 2). Whereas cardiac tissue is highly perfused and difficult to thermally injure in relation to MRI, neural tissues are extremely sensitive to even modest temperature elevations.</para>
    <para>MRI safety conditions for scanning patients with certain DBS systems are generally associated with a strictly limited, whole-body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 0.1 W/kg or a B<subscript>1+Root Mean Squared</subscript> (B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>) value of 2.0 μT (13, 14). It is essential that, when performing MRI in patients with DBS systems, that the MRI safety conditions are followed in their entirety without deviations, and are considered with the entire system recognized (13, 14). Limiting the assessment of conditions for safe scanning only to those related, for example, to the IPG, without appreciating conditions associated with the implanted leads could pose substantial hazards for the patient. By way of example, for certain DBS systems from Medtronic, the presence of a pocket adapter associated with the IPG precludes the use of the transmit body RF coil, limiting the MRI exam to transmit/receive RF coils because pocket adaptors permit older style leads with low impedance (i.e., unsuitable for use of the</para>

    <para>Magnetic resonance (MR) scanners utilize static magnetic, time-varying gradient magnetic, and radiofrequency (RF) fields to image human subjects. Even when interacting with purely biological tissues, these electromagnetic fields can pose a hazard for the patient by excessive tissue heating due to the transmitted RF field.

    <para>cated when a patient has a metallic biomedical implant, especially if that device contains electrically conductive parts.</para>
    <para>By the physical nature of their interactions, patient hazards related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that are due to the presence of metallic implants can be grouped into four categories: (1) forces and torques acting on ferromagnetic objects due to the static magnetic field, B<subscript>0</subscript>; (2) forces, sometimes referred to as Lenz forces, and related torques exerted by the static magnetic field on moving metallic objects, even if nonferromagnetic; (3) malfunction of an active implanted medical device (AIMD, i.e., an implant relying on an embedded energy source to function such as a cardiac pacemaker or a neuromodulation system) because of the strong electromagnetic fields used during MRI, which may impact the vital functions of the device or even damage it; and (4) localized heating and resulting tissue damage due to currents in the implant induced by the RF fields and the time-varying gradient magnetic fields (1-3).</para>
    <para>Today's MR systems are built to image biological tissues but not to deal with implanted metallic objects and, thus, they have no means to automatically detect and adjust to them even though implemented safety measures are no longer adequate in the presence of metals (4). Ultimately, appropriate safety concepts for scanning patients with implants must be carried out at a <emphasis role="italics">system level</emphasis>. That is, MR scanners must be designed to detect an implant in the patient and respond accordingly by adjusting scan parameters or, in extreme cases, by rejecting the MRI exam if it cannot be conducted safely. However, this technology is not yet available and, until then, it will remain the responsibility of the MR system operators (i.e., the MRI technologists and radiographers) to ensure the safe scanning of patients with metallic implants.</para>
    <para>Severe injuries and fatalities have occurred in patients with implants that underwent MRI (5-10). Most of these incidents were related to dislodgement of a ferromagnetic implant (e.g., an aneurysm clip) or the malfunction of a device, such as a cardiac pacemaker. Severe injuries solely because of excessive implant heating have been documented (8-12). In these instances, RF-induced heating of deep brain stimulation leads was believed to be responsible for the greatest risk during MRI (8-12). Of note is that, in phantom experiments, the temperature at the tip of a long wire may increase by as much as 75°C under certain RF exposure conditions (13).</para>
    <para>The present chapter focuses on the state of knowledge on the important topic of MRI-related heating of implants and devices. This attention to this single subject is not because other MRI-related hazards would be less dangerous (the opposite is most certainly true) but because it is (1) omnipresent, and (2) scientifically and practically the most challenging case for a risk assessment (14). Within the limited space of this chapter, we will consider fully incorporated biomedical implants, while interventional and intraoperative devices will not be covered, despite plentiful conceptual similarities.</para>
    <para>In the following sections, the underlying physics of implant heating will be presented and summarized. Additionally, the most relevant standardization documents in this field will be recapitulated since they define how both MR systems and implants are designed, built, and tested. Importantly, such standards inform MRI users as to what they can, or rather should not, expect from a device.</para>

An extensive evaluation of past developments that brought the field to where it stands today is not possible within the present format.

          <title>PHYSICS OF IMPLANT HEATING</title>
    <para>MRI relies on two time-varying magnetic fields, that is, the RF field and gradient magnetic field, which differ in frequency and amplitude. The sinusoidal RF field, B<subscript>1</subscript>, is required to excite the spins to be imaged. Usually, it is generated by a volume transmit RF coil like the scanner's body RF coil or a dedicated transmit/receive head RF coil. The design target is a homogeneous B<subscript>1</subscript>-field over most of the RF coil's geometrical volume. Amplitudes are in the 10 μT range and frequencies are in the 100 MHz regime. The gradient magnetic field, B<subscript>G</subscript>, provides spatial encoding for image generation. The water-cooled gradient coils create B<subscript>(0, z)</subscript> gradients in three orthogonal directions. The design targets are linearly varying offset fields around the isocenter (where B<subscript>G</subscript>=0). Radially, B<subscript>G</subscript> fields are maximal at the MR system's bore; axially, they have maxima around the ends of the gradient coils (i.e., at |z|≈30 to 50 cm). In modern clinical MR scanners, amplitudes reach the 10 mT regime in those areas. Gradient magnetic fields have base frequencies in the kilohertz range, but higher harmonics up to several 10 kHz often exist.</para>
    <para>Faraday's law requires that all time-varying magnetic fields B(t) are accompanied by electric fields E(t), where E∝f·B for sinusoidal B(t) with frequency f. In an electrically conductive metallic implant with conductivity σ, those E-fields drive so-called eddy currents with current densities J = σE. This occurs also in biological tissue but is much more dramatic in metals (including "poorly conducting" alloys), which typically have ~ 10<superscript>6</superscript> times higher electrical conductivities. These induced currents have two effects: (1) due to ohmic losses, power P ∝ JE is locally deposited inside the implant, leading to a temperature increase with an initial slope of dT/dt=P/C, where C is the heat capacity of the exposed mass, and (2) secondary B- and E-fields are induced around the implant which superimpose the incident E-field and modify the power deposition. Both effects can lead to tissue heating but the mechanisms depend on frequency and, thus, are very different for gradients and RF fields.</para>

    <para>In a periodic MRI pulse sequence, ⟨P<subscript>RF</subscript>⟩<subscript>t</subscript> in Equation (1) is given by the sum of all pulse energies ∫ P<subscript>RF</subscript> dt divided by the repetition time, TR. Consequently, sequences with a short repetition time (TR) and a high density of high-power pulses have increased SAR values. The time-averaged SAR can be modified and limited to safe exposure levels, for example, by reducing the flip angle and, thus, the power per RF pulse, and/or by extending the TR and, thus, the mean time between RF pulses.</para>
    <para>RF currents at f ∼ 100 MHz in metallic objects are restricted to a thin surface layer of about ∼100 μm by the laws of electrodynamics (i.e., the skin effect). The mass of directly heated implant material remains too small, therefore, to affect the neighboring tissue noticeably. The current-induced secondary E-field (i.e., the "scattered field") around the implant becomes highly relevant, however, as it can vastly exceed the primary "background" E-field in critical locations. RF currents induced directly in tissue by the scattered E-field are the dominant effect for RF-induced implant heating <emphasis role="bold">(Figure 1)</emphasis>. In particular, a one-dimensional implant tends to exhibit the so-called "antenna effect" which is a pronounced maximum of the scattered E-field at the distal end, whose intensity peaks when the electrical length of the implant is in the range of one-quarter to one-half of the RF wavelength in tissue (17). The electromagnetic energy of the background field is then most effectively converted into implant current and corresponding scattered field.</para>

    <para>In contrast to the RF energy case, secondary E-fields and the direct induction of currents in tissue are both negligible for gradient switching at kilohertz frequencies. Switched gradients can heat-up the metallic implant, itself, however, via eddy currents. These currents and the associated power deposition are confined to the metal, but thermal energy diffuses into adjacent tissues, subsequently. Such confined eddy-current loops are intrinsically limited in small or approximately one-dimensional implants (e.g., screws or leads) but are possibly substantial in implants with a large cross-sectional area (e.g., orthopedic prostheses such as total hip or knee replacement implants), where large, low-resistance closed current paths exist (18, 19).</para>

    <para>A broad variety of gradient waveforms exist but trapezoidal pulses with linear B<subscript>G</subscript> ramps and flat tops are most common. Only the ramps create eddy currents, then, and the flat sections do not contribute. Under the simplifying assumptions of Equation (3b), the induced current density scales with implant conductivity, the change rate of B<subscript>G</subscript>, and the radius, r, of the current loop. The total heating power of those currents depends on the square of the current density.</para>
    <para>For a given implant, gradient heating is maximal, when the implant is positioned in the aforementioned locations of highest B<subscript>G</subscript>, when the gradients are ramped at the highest available slew rate, and when pulse sequences are run with a high "slew percentage" (i.e., a high fraction of ramp time during the TR). The gradient strength itself is only indirectly a factor, insofar as higher gradients need longer ramp times to reach them.</para>
    <para>Few studies on MRI-related gradient magnetic field-induced implant heating exist. Earlier reports did not find significant temperature elevations (20, 21), yet did not systematically investigate critical scenarios, as described in the previous paragraph. More recent work demonstrated that gradient magnetic field-induced heating of a hip prostheses (namely, the acetabular cup component) can increase the temperature in adjacent tissue by several degrees using a manufacturer-provided, "gradient aggressive" pulse sequence, in the aforementioned sense, on a clinical MR system (18, 22–24) (Figure 2). Very close agreement between experimental findings and computational results indicated that the effects are well understood (24).</para>

    <para>Parameters are specific heat capacity, c (W s kg<superscript>-1</superscript> K<superscript>-1</superscript>), thermal conductivity, k (W m<superscript>-1</superscript> K<superscript>-1</superscript>), mass density, ρ (kg m<superscript>-3</superscript>), and blood perfusion, w (m<superscript>3</superscript> s<superscript>-1</superscript> kg<superscript>-1</superscript>). Subscripts t and b refer to tissue and (arterial) blood, respectively. Tissue temperature change on the left is expressed as the balance of heat diffusion, perfusion cooling, metabolic heat Q<subscript>m</subscript> (W kg<superscript>-1</superscript>) and external heat, Q<subscript>ext</subscript> (W kg<superscript>-1</superscript>), such as SAR. Equilibrium (d T<subscript>t</subscript>/dt = 0) is reached when the terms on the right-hand side compensate each other. PBE is not a fundamental law and makes a number of questionable assumptions (e.g., the blood pool as an infinite heat sink, isotropic thermal conduction, inadequate perfusion model, absence of thermoregulation, etc.). Still, it appears to work remarkably well in predicting tissue temperatures (see (26) for an extended discussion).</para>
    <para>Thermal modeling is indispensable to assess hazards related to implant heating by gradient switching since the deposited power reaches the tissues only via thermal diffusion. But also for RF energy-induced heating it is highly advisable even though the existing regulations only impose limits on SAR. The tissue parameters k<subscript>t</subscript>, w<subscript>t</subscript>, and Q<subscript>m</subscript> in Equation (4) can vary by orders of magnitude between tissue types (27). Therefore, even a uniform external power deposition would result in a non-uniform distribution of equilibrium temperatures in the human body. Equivalently, it can be said that for a non-uniform SAR distribution, the temperature hotspots will not normally coincide with the SAR hotspots (28). This discrepancy can be further enhanced by the high thermal conductivity of metallic implants. This reduces temperature differences along the implant and tends to "smear" out localized hotspots.</para>
    <para>For a conclusive safety assessment, however, even a realistic temperature distribution is not yet sufficient, because tissue types vary not only in cooling properties but also in temperature resilience. For example, 10 minutes at a temperature of 45°C is not much of a problem for skin but it is for brain matter (29). Thermal Dose safety concepts, considering the applied temperature over time individually for each tissue type, account for this variation and arguably represent the best that can be done today. The best known example is the "Cumulative Equivalent Minutes at 43°C" (CEM43) approach (29–32). This is beyond the scope of this chapter, however, the present standard is still the whole-body averaged SAR.</para>
    <para>RF-Induced vs. Gradient-Induced Heating. As previously mentioned, RF-induced currents in metals are confined to a thin surface layer by the skin effect, while the low-frequency gradient currents fill almost the whole implant volume. Compared to RF fields, gradient switching has a lower frequency content (&lt;10<superscript>5</superscript> Hz vs. ~10<superscript>8</superscript> Hz) but a higher magnitude (~10 mT vs. ~10 μT). The combined effect is that, in "bulky" (i.e., implants with a relatively larger surface area such as an implantable infusion pump or a total hip prosthesis) metallic objects, switched gradients can deposit much more power than RF energy (19). In a nonferromagnetic sphere (radius R = 2 cm, σ = 1 MS/m, similar to the femoral head of a total hip prosthesis made of cobalt chromium alloy), the power deposition by a gradient magnetic</para>

    <para>A set of international standards was established in recent decades covering implant safety in MRI (34), which was supplemented by recommendations from governmental agencies (35, 36). All refer to the international MRI safety standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 60601-2-33, first established in 1995 (37). Below, we summarize the three most relevant standards concerning implant-related heating in the MRI environment, namely ASTM F2182 (38), IEC 60601-2-33 (37), and International Organization for Standardization/Technical Specification, ISO/TS 10974 (39). Note, however, that the instructions of use provided by the MR system manufacturer may be more restrictive than the currently applicable standard. These instructions are legally relevant, because not following them constitutes "off-label" use with potentially severe liability implications for the physician supervisor as well as the MR system operator.</para>
    <para>All three standards adopt a scheme from ASTM F2503 (40) where implants are labeled as either <emphasis role="italics">MR Unsafe</emphasis> ("an item that is known to pose hazards in all MRI environments"), <emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional</emphasis> ("an item that has been demonstrated to pose no known hazards in a specified MRI environment with specified conditions of use"), or <emphasis role="italics">MR Safe</emphasis> ("an item that poses no known hazards in all MRI environments"). Note that metallic items can always exert Lenz forces and create image artifacts, which may present diagnostic hazards (41) and hence are never <emphasis role="italics">MR Safe</emphasis> in this terminology. This labeling is the responsibility of the implant manufacturer who defines the conditions for safe use in association with MRI technology.</para>

        <title>ASTM F2182</title>
    <para>The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International standard F2182 is fully designated to RF-induced implant heating (38). It provides the implant manufacturer with well-defined procedures and materials for <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> heating tests of their devices. The standard itself defines no pass or fail criteria. The test results are sent to and evaluated by a competent authority, most notably the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for a decision on the conditionality of the implant for MRI. There are other related ASTM International standards (i.e., ASTM F2052, F2119, F2213, and F2503) that are outside the scope of this chapter.</para>
    <para>ASTM F2182 describes in detail a test procedure where the implant under test is embedded in gelled-saline filled phantom setup and exposed to a relatively high, whole-body averaged SAR value (i.e., 2 W/kg or higher) by using either a 1.5 T or 3 T MR scanner or a suitable benchtop system, reproducing the RF fields from a transmit body RF coil operating in a circularly-polarized (CP) mode. For 15 minutes, the temperature is monitored. By repeating the measurement with the implant removed, the background temperature rise is also measured, and the implant-related temperature rise can be determined.</para>
    <para>The scope of ASTM F2182 is limited to passive implants that are completely inside the human body. However, similar methods described in ASTM F2182 can be applied for devices penetrating the body's surface (e.g., external fixation systems, vascular catheters, etc.).

    <para>The IEC 60601-2-33 standard is the most relevant safety and performance standard for MRI (37). It provides manufacturers of MR systems with a comprehensive set of criteria and limits, thus allowing them to self-declare conformity if all requirements are met. This standard is generally all about the MR scanner and implant safety is only one of many topics presented in this document.</para>

    <para>with an averaging period t<subscript>x</subscript> = 10 s. From pre-scan flip-angle measurements, the absolute value of B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>+</superscript> can be determined, making B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> a reliably calibrated quantity when averaged over a proper region of interest in a central axial slice. B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is typically calibrated by the MR system, and its values should be displayed by the MR scanner's software. However, it is important to note that implant heating is related to the total B<subscript>1</subscript> (i.e., all three vector components), not just B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>+</superscript>, and the standard gives some guidance to estimate the uncertainties when using B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>. This quantity is a much more consistent approach to assess RF-induced implant heating than the whole-body averaged SAR, which was previously the reference metric. In contrast to the whole-body averaged SAR, B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is independent of the patient and calculated consistently by different MR system manufacturers.</para>
    <para>In the latest version of IEC 60601-2-33, the so-called Fixed-Parameter Option (FPO) was introduced for 1.5 T MR scanners (FPO:B), which specifically addresses scanning patients with implants.

The FPO rationale is that the MR system manufacturer guarantees that those field limits are kept, such that implant manufacturers can design and test their devices, accordingly. Only the combination, that is, a MR system operating in the FPO mode and an FPO-approved implant or device, would then establish a safe setting for the patient. The problem of the FPO is that a single set of field limits must suffice for a large variety of medical im-</para>

          <title>Simplifications</title>
    <para>Long, one-dimensional shaped implants (e.g., cardiac pacemaker leads) collect RF energy over their entire length which makes them potentially hazardous and simultaneously defies simplifying assumptions like a constant E-field, in magnitude and phase, over the entire implant. Their structural detail, for example, a finely wound helix or multiple electrodes, and steep field gradients near the implant call for a high mesh resolution but the simulation space, defined by the transmit body RF coil, remains large. To aggravate the problem, the trajectories for long leads are not well defined and, thus, a variety of different clinically relevant pathways needs to be investigated. Numerical simplification approaches exist and are widely used, such as the Huygens box concept where a high-resolution simulation of the implant region is embedded in a lower-resolution simulation of the rest of the body (43). For a discussion of the pros and cons of such procedures, the reader is referred to specialized reviews on numerical techniques including the work by Li, et al. (44).</para>
    <para>To simplify the geometry, helices are often modeled as straight wires plus lumped elements to account for their inductance or stents as cylinders, ignoring their complex wire-mesh structure (45, 46). Despite these efforts, full Tier 4 simulations are not yet feasible with normal computational resources, and Tier 3 represents the actual state of the art. There, first the full-scale native problem, that is, a numerical body model without the implant in an MR scanner, is computed at an appropriate resolution providing the spatial distribution of the unperturbed background E-field. This part may be repeated for different body models, positions, postures, or transmit RF coils, resulting in a library of background fields. In a second step, the electrodynamic response of the metallic implant to that background field is computed. Frequently, this is expressed as the "scattered field," that is, the difference between the total E-field with the implant and background field.</para>
    <para>The critical spot of a wire-like implant is always at the distal tip and a frequent simplification, therefore, is to ignore all other locations. The scattered field at the tip can be derived from the background-field distribution along the implant trajectory. A first step in that di-</para>
    <para>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     527</para>
    <para>rection was the definition of a "safety index" as a metric to characterize one-dimensional implants (47). Later, this was succeeded by the introduction of the transfer function (TF) (42), the most widely-used approach to assess the MRI safety of one-dimensional implants today. To determine the scattered E-field at some reference r⃗ in tissue, close to the tip, one needs to know the response E<subscript>s</subscript>(r⃗) of the E-field at the reference point to a unit tangential E-field applied somewhere along the implant (Figure 5). The latter location is uniquely identified by a scalar coordinate, ẑ measuring its distance from the tip along the implant trajectory. This response can be expressed as a complex weight function S(ẑ, r⃗) and the desired 'scattered' field E<subscript>s</subscript>(r⃗) can then be obtained by integrating the weighted tangential background field E<subscript>tan</subscript>(ẑ) along the wire:</para>
    <para>E⃗<subscript>s</subscript>(r⃗) = F⃗<subscript>tip</subscript>(r⃗) ∫<subscript>0</subscript><superscript>L</superscript> S(ẑ)E<subscript>tan</subscript>(ẑ)dẑ .     (7)</para>
    <para>The normalized, dimensionless function F⃗<subscript>tip</subscript>(r⃗) describes the spatial distribution of the scattered E-field around the tip and is assumed to be independent of how the implant was excited. Thus, the problem is broken down into two independent steps, namely to determine (1) the background E-field without implant, and (2) the transfer function S(ẑ) of the implant. The former means a state-of-the-art EMF simulation, the latter can be achieved either by simulations or experimentally. TF is a normalized, complex function, determining how various elementary RF currents induced along the length of the implant superimpose at the tip.</para>
    <para>Figure 5. Graphical representation of the transfer function introduced by Park, et al. (42). A piece-wise excitation with an incident tangential electric field E<subscript>tan</subscript> induces a scattered electric field E⃗<subscript>s</subscript>(r⃗) at the tip of a one-dimensional implant. Adapted from color figure in Winter, et al. (1), original figure from Tokaya, et al. (48). The length coordinate q in this figure is denoted ẑ in the present chapter (Equation 7).</para>
  <para>In this instance, the TF phase describes the propagation and the TF magnitude the attenuation of an RF current along the implant. In the simplest case, the TF phase would be a linear function of the distance from the tip. The E-field "collected" within a certain distance from the tip would then increase the scattered field around the tip while contributions from beyond that point would decrease it again (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). For longer distances, attenuation dampens the interference pattern, but a critical "resonance length" of one quarter to one half the RF current wavelength persists. This wavelength, and hence the TF, depend on the dielectric parameters of the tissue and possibly an insulation surrounding the implant. The TF of an implant depends on its environment, therefore, but for simplicity this fact is often ignored. For unfavorable phase distributions of the background E-field the tip heating can significantly exceed even the values for the resonant length (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>The TF can be determined by measuring or calculating the scattered E-field at some reference point, r⃗ close to the tip when the implant is exposed to a piece-wise excitation by a unit tangential E-field. In simulations, this can be approximated artificially by a short boxcar function (42) or as the E-field between two parallel metallic plates in close proximity to one another (48). Experimentally, for example, short toroid coils or coaxial cables with a few millimeters of bare inner conductor can be used (49, 50).</para>
    <para>An important advancement to reduce the multitude of piece-wise excitations and measurements (and/or simulations) to a single excitation is based on the principle of reciprocity (51). Injecting a unit current at its tip, the TF is represented by the current distribution along the implant and several experimental strategies were proposed to determine this current (50, 52, 53).</para>

For a uniform phase distribution, the temperature increase (ΔT<subscript>1W/kg</subscript>) shows a maximum at a "resonance length" of roughly half the RF wavelength in the phantom medium. If the phase distribution is non-uniform over the implant (ΔT<subscript>worst</subscript> = temperature increase for a worst-case phase distribution), which is often the case for relatively long implants, the tip temperature can increase even above the resonant length of the wire.

    <para><emphasis role="italics">Realistic Simulation and Body Models.</emphasis> If the 3D-CAD model of an implant cannot be obtained from the manufacturer, an electrically equivalent simulation model could be created from the actual implant, based on its geometry, composition, and size. Transmit RF and gradient coils are integral parts of the MR scanner and their actual design is more difficult to create. However, RF field measurements can be utilized to give a good estimate about the design, length, and diameter of commercial transmit body RF coils (55, 56). Regularly at 7 T but occasionally at lower field strengths, too, local transmit-receive RF coils are used (e.g., for head or knee MRI exams). In such a case, safety assessments of implants are only possible if the RF fields or the transmit RF coil model are known (57, 58). It is important to apply the correct transmit coil-driving conditions (e.g., circularly-polarized, CP, quadrature-driven). Transmit RF body coils of 1.5 T MR systems typically apply only the CP mode, whereas at 3 T and above, RF shimming is common to counteract B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>-</superscript> inhomogeneities (59-61).</para>

    <para>The dielectric properties of human tissues can be assigned according to literature values. The publication by Gabriel, et al. (66) is the pioneering paper in this respect, while the wealth of today's knowledge in this field has been conveniently compiled in a comprehensive database of electromagnetic and thermal tissue parameters (27).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Electromagnetic Simulation Techniques – RF Fields and Currents.</emphasis> There are several simulation techniques in computational electromagnetics, each with advantages and weaknesses. For birdcage coils, the method of moments (MOM) also called the Boundary Element Method (BEM), or the finite elements method (FEM) may be the best choices, because they can treat curved geometrical objects more accurately than other techniques. However, when complex anatomical models or structures are involved, the simulation space can easily reach dimensions of 100 million voxels (three-dimensional pixels) or more, which is most efficiently handled by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique.</para>
    <para>It has been shown that the common practice of simulating the metallic implant as a perfect electric conductor is sufficient for practical purposes (67). Thus, it is unnecessary to</para>
    <para>discretize the implant on the 10 μm scale of the RF penetration depth. Calculations can be parallelized on graphics processors, thus shortening simulation times by factors &gt;100. The simulation output contains the induced E-field distribution in the patient for a given exposure scenario and can be expressed as SAR maps, which are subjected to different averaging volumes. The most important of which are the whole-body averaged SAR and the local SAR averaged over 10 g of tissue (37). For implants, there is an ongoing discussion whether smaller averaging masses should be used to assess temperature and thermal dose more correctly (45, 68, 69).</para>
    <para>The exposure condition in the simulation model such as linearly-polarized, CP, or RF shimming, is important and needs to match reality since it determines the background E-field distribution responsible for the RF field-induced implant heating. With state-of-the-art electromagnetic modeling, satisfactory agreement (for the given purpose) with phantom measurements can be obtained and (standard) uncertainties in the range of 10 to 15% (70) should be achieved for local SAR values, because the dielectric properties of the tissues are only minimally affected by the physiological response.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Electromagnetic Simulation Techniques – Gradient Fields and Induced Currents.</emphasis> Most investigations dealing with the simulations of gradient-induced heating of bulky implants adopt the hybrid FEM/BEM frequency-domain formulation described by Zilberti, et al. (22). Such a formulation applies to non-magnetic metallic implants and, at the frequencies of interest, assumes that the current density induced inside bulky implants is much higher than in the surrounding tissues, thus limiting the electromagnetic problem to the implant volume. To simulate a gradient sequence realistically, the harmonic solutions are moved back to the time domain, where they are properly combined to follow the actual waveforms of the three gradient coils.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Electromagnetic Simulation Techniques – Thermal Simulations.</emphasis> The power-density distribution from electromagnetic simulations can be used as input for thermal simulations (Figure 7). For one-dimensional implants, RF power is absorbed along the whole length of the lead(s) but tissue heating occurs only around the tip or end and this fact can be exploited to reduce the total computational burden (71). Steady-state solvers can be used when only absolute equilibrium temperatures are of interest. To simulate temperature increase versus time, more complex transient time-domain solvers are required. As previously-stated, Pennes Bioheat Equation (PBE) (25) is presumably the most widely used formulation, and most commercial software to calculate tissue temperatures employs PBE or amended variants, for example, with thermoregulation included (i.e., temperature dependent tissue parameters). It performs well for the given exposure scenarios but is a heatsink model assuming stable core temperatures. If a patient's core temperature increase must be considered, the PBE can be enhanced by a variable blood temperature formulation. Other aspects remain neglected, however, such as anisotropic heat-flux or blood temperature variations along the vessel. For the latter, the impact of the thermal vasculature could be investigated based on a model which couples, one-dimensional convective vascular tree thermal simulations with 3D thermal modeling (72). While the PBE assumes that the arterial inflow to tissue is still at core temperature, such discrete vasculature (DIVA) models (73) acknowledge the flow directionality and the gradual thermalization of blood along the (arterial) vas-</para>

Personalized exposure evaluations might permit the reduction of the necessary safety margins for the majority of the patient population and, consequently, permit faster and safer MRI exams: for example, a dynamic adaptation of exposure limits based on the patient's body mass index (BMI) or body cross-section (70). We will briefly discuss two methods: a physics-based morphing and a three-dimensional image-registration approach.</para>
    <para>A physics-based morphing technique can be applied on existing anatomical models via constrained biomechanical FEM simulations, where the body is treated as a hyper-elastic material (75, 76). The tissue deformation is constrained by the proximity of rigid bones and</para>
    <para>regularized by the presence of surrounding soft tissue. This allows regional shrinkage or expansion of certain tissues (e.g., fat, muscle, etc.) to investigate the effect of different tissue distributions. A look-up table can be generated, where the actual patient would be matched to the closest morphing variant of an anatomical model. Pre-computed exposure data would serve as a coarse personalized estimate.</para>
    <para>If a certain target anatomy of the actual patient is aimed for in higher detail, a 3D image registration is better suited to capture the actual skeletal anatomy and posture. Sparse (e.g., cross-sectional) pilot-scan images of the patient could be used as input for the non-rigid registration approach to map the numerical phantom to the patient-specific anatomy (77-79). The resulting 3D-registered derivative can then be used to compute the exposure estimation on-the-fly. Unfortunately, as of today, personalized electromagnetic simulations are not yet in widespread use.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Measurements</emphasis></para>
    <para>Measurement procedures for <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> model validation are well described in ISO/TS 10974 (39). Assessments can be performed at points of interest near the implant, by measuring either (1) electromagnetic-field quantities using time-domain sensors, or (2) root-mean-square (RMS) quantities like voltage or temperature. Fiber-optic temperature probes are the most widely used sensors for safety assessments involving patients and metallic implants in MRI (11). They use a non-conducting transmission medium and are nonferromagnetic, preventing RF coupling and enable a precise and accurate application to record temperatures in the harsh electromagnetic environment associated with the MR system. Importantly, in order to obtain an accurate assessment of temperatures, probe positioning relative to the implant is crucial. For example, for a peak temperature of 10°C, a 1°C change can be observed over less than 250 μm (80).</para>
    <para>Time-domain probes yield information on amplitudes and phases of field quantities which is necessary, for example, for TF measurements (50, 81). For <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis> applications in the MR scanner, the field probes must be nonferromagnetic and must not generate static magnetic fields by internal DC currents. Examples of <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis> RF current measurements on implanted wires using optical fibers for signal transfer have been reported by Zanchi, et al. (13) and Weidemann, et al. (82). Recently, fully optical <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field measurements based on electro-optic field sensing have been used to assess the RF safety of different stent configurations (83). While this technique is promising, it is too premature for a final judgment with respect to its validity.</para>
    <para>Another approach to perform <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis> measurements especially in active devices is the use of already built-in sensors. Due to the lack of a phase reference, this appears to be limited to RMS measurements so far, but this issue may be resolved in the near future using state-of-the-art electronics.

        <title>In Vivo Assessments of Implant Safety</title>
    <para>Recently, methods have been investigated to assess implant safety in vivo by MR-based methods. This methodology, if further developed and validated, would enable patient-specific safety evaluations of implanted devices. Approaches to "put the implant patient in the scanner and see what happens" exist (85) and are not automatically unethical, if done with the necessary caution. Still, they are not discussed here as they do little to quantify the patient hazard.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Non-MR Based Methods.</emphasis> A metallic implant with strong coupling to the transmit RF coil causes substantial impedance changes. These can be measured via the RF coil's current distribution or scattering (S) parameters and related to the induced current strengths and the location of the implant if a multichannel transmission system is used (86–88) (Figure 8). Such an "implant detector" at an MR system level would solve many problems, only it would be very difficult to ensure that every hazardous implant is detected.</para>
    <para>Another method to determine potential RF field-induced heating in vivo independently of prior simulations is the use of integrated temperature sensors in the implant at locations where the maximum temperature increase is expected (84, 89). Alternatively, the thermoacoustic effect can be utilized for external temperature monitoring (90, 91). The latter exploits the pressure waves that a sudden temperature increase inevitably generates and can be detected by sensitive acoustic receivers. It has been shown in a proof-of-concept study that this ultrasound signal can be used to detect RF field-induced heating of a lead tip and,</para>

Translating such ultrasound-based systems to a robust clinical <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> application is challenging, however (i.e., due to receiver size and positioning, movement, acoustic window, signal-to-noise constraints, quantified measurements etc.), and still needs to be demonstrated.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">MR-Based Methods</emphasis>. The MR scanner itself is a versatile machine, and several publications demonstrated that it could be utilized for a noninvasive, implant safety assessment and monitoring, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>. However, this is ongoing research and not yet routinely available.</para>
    <para>For elongated implants, tip heating is related to the induced RF currents in the implant (92), which then induce a new B<subscript>1,ind</subscript>-field altering the total B*<subscript>1</subscript>. Consequently, tip heating can be estimated by MR-based measurements of B*<subscript>1</subscript> around the implant (93, 94) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). If B<subscript>1,ind</subscript> has a z-component, it will also shift the RF phase (95).</para>
    <para>Implant-related image B<subscript>1</subscript> effects can also be translated to direct measurements of the induced RF current in the implant. This may appear as a detour because, ultimately, the quantity of interest is temperature, and implant current is only a surrogate. The advantage of current measurements is their sensitivity. In principle, relatively small and harmless implant currents are detectable <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>, while a measurable temperature rise may be potentially hazardous for the patient. Frequently, model assumption like a perfect quadrature excitation or simplifications like a quasi-static treatment neglecting displacement currents are being used to facilitate direct current quantification without extensive numerical simulations. The measured B*<subscript>1</subscript> magnitude at a certain radius from the conductor can be converted into the magnitude of the current by applying a simplified Ampere's circuit law (96–98). The background signal around the lead, which <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> is often inhomogeneous, represents a source of error for magnitude-based methods. A way to suppress this background signal is by using reversed RF polarization on the transmitter and receiver (98) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). In this manner, ideally only the implant coupling is visualized in the MR image and can be used to determine the current amplitude. On the receiver side, reverse polarization reconstruction is intrinsic to the acquired dataset, while on the transmit side, parallel RF transmission (pTx) systems with ≥ 2 channels would allow for reversed polarization during transmission.</para>
    <para>Another method to quantify induced currents is based on analyzing the phase of an MR image around the implant (99). This way, RF field-induced implant currents can be detected with a low SAR, pre-scan sequence that poses no hazard in itself. Since the RMS-averaged RF current in the implant is proportional to B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>, the result from the pre-scan can easily be scaled to subsequent MR imaging sequences at higher SAR levels. Compared to magnitude-based methods, phase-based current measurements are potentially faster, independent of proton-density weighting and have lower SNR requirements. A disadvantage of phase-based methods is their sensitivity to gradient nonlinearities and phase variations of other origin, such as frequency shifts due to temperature variations, susceptibility jumps at interfaces, or blood flow. To reduce these influences, short echo times combined with a fast readout using an ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequence was applied <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> and demonstrated the ability to characterize RF currents within an accuracy of ~10 mA/μT (100). Based on these measurements and some simplifying assumptions, the corresponding RF-induced implant heating could be predicted accurately.

Typically, two null-locations can be identified in the signal intensity emerging from the transmitter and receiver separately. Since the location of the receiver-null is independent of the transmitter and different for each receiver element, the receiver-null and transmitter-null locations can be identified independently by inspecting the MR images from each receive-coil element separately. The phase of the current can then be calculated from the geometric null location and is an important parameter to allow mitigation of RF field-induced currents on the DBS lead using pTx systems (101).</para>
    <para>The MR-based determination of the transfer function represents another promising approach to measure implant currents (48, 102). This expands the TF approach beyond phantoms to more complex exposure scenarios with realistic tissue heterogeneity, implant geometry and location. The methodology uses the wire-like implant as a transceiver antenna. The implant is excited via a coaxial cable soldered to its tip and the resulting current distribution along its trajectory, reflecting the transfer function by virtue of the principle of reciprocity– can be measured by MRI (48, 51). The necessity to connect a cable to the implant modifies the TF, however, and prevents <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> applications. This restriction was overcome by the introduction of the transfer matrix. This approach measures the RF field-induced currents in the implant directly and without the need of any galvanic contact from MR measurements alone (102–104) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>).

This allows not only the ability to fully evaluate tip heating based on an incident background field but also to assess other locations of potential RF-induced heating along the implant. Like its "ancestor" TF, the transfer matrix describes how the implant responds to a pre-existing background E-field. Therefore, the latter must be known, that is, simulations are still required while the aforementioned sensor-based methods are, in principle, independent of such prior knowledge. The techniques applied for transfer-matrix acquisition have similarities with electric-properties tomography (EPT) (105, 106) and consequently share some of its problems as well, most notably the transceive-phase approximation and assumptions on the vector orientation of B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>+</superscript> and E.</para>
    <para>Most of these described MR-based techniques to assess implant safety still need further investigations, in particular if more complex implant geometries or locations, multiple implants or complex lead trajectories come into play. Also, most of these MR-based current-measurement techniques assume a homogeneous or known B<subscript>1</subscript> transmit and/or receive field to work accurately (100, 101). These assumptions are increasingly difficult to attain at higher field strengths, which may limit the general applicability of such methods.</para>
    <para>Current measurements are only an indirect measure of implant heating because they rely on thermal models that might be incomplete (e.g., neglecting perfusion or thermoregulation).

    <para>An interesting approach is to combine sensor measurements from on or around implants and use this information for pTx based mitigation. This has been demonstrated by using time-domain current (129, 132) and E-field sensors (136). More recently, even simple RMS sensors such as thermistors or diodes were utilized in proof-of-concept studies for real-time mitigation of RF-induced heating. In addition to being real-time capable, these sensor measurements also contain imaging information that can be used to maintain image quality, while at the same time RF field-induced heating is reduced substantially (136, 137). While still in its infancy, it is imaginable that in the future, sensor equipped "smart" medical implants could be communicating with a pTx cable MRI device to guarantee safe scanning of implants even under varying conditions such as patient movement.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Other Techniques</emphasis></para>
    <para>If pTx hardware is not available, other methods can be applied to reduce implant heating by shaping the RF field. For example, the linear-polarization mode of the birdcage RF coil has regions of reduced E-field, and if these regions overlap with the implant, RF-induced currents are reduced (122). If a birdcage coil had multiple ports along its circumference, one could 'rotate' the linear-polarization mode by changing the feeding port. Similarly, a birdcage coil in the linear-polarization mode with a single transmit channel can be physically rotated to align the low E-field zone with the implant (138). This concept has been applied to DBS leads and showed significant improvement compared to the standard CP mode of the same birdcage coil (139). Another mitigation approach that does not rely on pTx technology or modified RF coil hardware is to put high-permittivity material pads on the subject at strategic locations. The high-permittivity dielectric modifies the background-field and it has been demonstrated that this can be efficiently used to reduce RF field-induced tip heating (140). A simple, but effective solution is using vertical MR scanners, where B<subscript>0</subscript> is directed perpendicular instead of parallel to the axis of the bore. Consequently, B*<subscript>1</subscript> and the E-field directions change, and the same implant experiences a different background E-field. Simulations have shown that more than a ten-fold tip SAR reduction could be achieved for realistic DBS implant and lead geometries if scanned in a vertical MR system versus a horizontal one (141).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis></para>
    <para>This chapter reviewed the existing literature on MRI-related heating of implants and devices. It should be noted that a number of topics had to be excluded because of space limitations (e.g., interventional tools and devices, low-power pulse sequences, etc.), but the crucial information for RF energy- and gradient field-induced heating of implants was presented.</para>
    <para>Implant safety is an important field in MRI and much has been accomplished, but further work is needed. Three international standards are most relevant in this field: the MRI standard IEC 60601-2-33 and the implant standards that include ASTM F2182 and ISO/TS 10974. The latter set their scopes either on "passive" (ASTM) or "active" (ISO) implants. From the implant manufacturer's point of view, this distinction is fundamental since active implants need electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and other tests, while passive implants do not. From an MRI perspective, however, this distinction appears less relevant. Passive implant-related hazards are a subset of active implant-related hazards and are comprehensively covered by the document, ISO/TS 10974, as well. The document from the ASTM International, ASTM F2182, was a significant milestone and many of its procedural developments will prevail for the testing of passive implants. But no reasons exist, in these authors' opinion, to maintain two implant standards in parallel. ISO/TS 10974 is in many respects more up-to-date and more general. Accordingly, all implants, active or passive, should be tested against it. Low-cost test procedures for low-risk implants would be on the wish list for future editions. For example, test strategies to easily translate an existing safety assessment from, say, a spinal fixation system to a similar one. The concept of an empirical parameterization of the implant-related hazard as demonstrated by Winter, et al. (45) may be helpful in this context (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>It is important to note that the assessments of implant safety that are based on the current standards are always limited to a single, functional implant. Modifying this test scenario in any electromagnetically relevant way such as having multiple MR Conditional implants close to each other (83), multiple AIMD leads in close distance (142), or broken or abandoned AIMD leads of a previously MR Conditional implant (143) may pose potential safety hazards to the patient.</para>
    <para>The paucity of peer-reviewed literature on gradient field-induced heating of implants suggests that excessive heating occurs only in unfavorable and potentially, unrecognized cases. Regardless, such cases are possible and, thus, it is unsatisfactory that presently, neither the manufacturer of the scanner nor the implant informs the MR system operator's when a critical situation may arise and how to avoid it.</para>
    <para>Accurate numerical simulations are the key to implant safety because they have reached a high level of maturity and can provide both insight and practical solutions. Future developments must be directed towards treating complex implants in realistic detail. To date, ISO/TS 10974's Tier 4 is mostly of conceptual but not yet of any practical value. Simulations need validation, however, and measurements are often restricted to phantoms. This is acceptable as long as phantom measurements are not misunderstood as predictive for the in vivo case. Phantom experiments are a testbed to validate the simulation methodology, transmit RF coil models, and other situations that are then identically applied to anatomical voxel models.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Ex ante</emphasis> simulations of certain numerical models remain surrogates, however. Ultimately, any safety assessment must be specific to the given subject or patient, implant, and scan conditions. This means, that the scanner and implant must somehow "communicate". For example, the implant must "inform" the MR system about its presence and condition, and the scanner must be able to "respond" to this input. The combination of real-time sensors</para>

    <para>(temperature, current, E-field, etc.) on the implant and a pTx system incorporated into the MR scanner would be most helpful to achieve this goal, but other approaches are certainly conceivable.</para>
    <para>In implant safety-related discussions, it is often taken for granted that lower static magnetic field strengths automatically reduce the risk. ISO/TS 10974 or the Fixed-Parameter Option were initially conceived for 1.5 T but not for 3 T MR systems and, recently, the idea of dedicated or niche, low field strength scanners with fields less than 0.6 T (and as low as 0.05 T) is gaining new attention (144-147). Conceptually, the translation of B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> into implant SAR, for example, at the tip of a cardiac pacemaker lead, is a two-step process, however. First, B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> creates a background E-field. This effect scales with the frequency, hence B<subscript>0</subscript> and the lower field strength may have the safety edge. In the second step, background E-field creates the tip E-field, and this conversion scales linearly with the RF wavelength in tissue (as long as half this wavelength is shorter than the implant and the transmit body RF coil). This time, the higher field strength has the advantage. Qualitatively, this effect can be seen in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 14</emphasis> (148). There is no universal answer to the question of a safest field strength, therefore, the individual implant, transmit RF coil, and scan parameters must be considered.</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), through a well-orchestrated manipulation of electromagnetic fields, manages to create tomographic images of patients without exposure to ionizing radiation. However, MRI still exposes the patient inside the MR scanner to three different types of electromagnetic fields (a static magnetic field, time-varying gradients, and radiofrequency fields). Because these electromagnetic fields interact with the human body, MRI safety standards, such as the document from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), IEC60601-2-33 (1), provide limits for field exposure levels and characteristics to reduce patient risks from hazards including: radiofrequency (RF)-induced burns, local and whole-body heating, peripheral nerve stimulation, and cardiac stimulation, among others. While these risks are mostly mitigated through the exposure limits, and MR systems have a strong history of safe use, there continues to be reports of adverse events, including in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from the Food and Drug Administration (2).</para>
    <para>There are additional safety concerns related to implantable medical devices in patients undergoing MRI examinations due to the interactions of electromagnetic fields with the implants. These potential hazards, along with several unfortunate patient injuries related to interactions between MR scanners and implanted devices that occurred during the early days of the use of MRI technology historically led to conservative default consideration of implantable devices as being contraindicated for MRI (3-8). In the mid-1990s, passive medical devices (i.e., an implant without an internal power source), such as vascular stents and heart valve prostheses, began to undergo testing and received MR Conditional labeling following guidelines from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International (9-13) and recommended MRI safety procedures presented in publications on this topic subject (14, 15).</para>
    <para>An active implantable medical device (AIMD), which is an implant relying on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity for its function (16), continued to be contraindicated for MRI throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s due to the presence of the many different types of interactions and potential patient harms. In 2002, the neurosurgeon, Ali R. Rezai, and the group based at the Cleveland Clinic conducted multiple investigations focused on characterizing MRI-issues for deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems (17-20). This research contributed to the first successful MR Conditional labeling of an AIMD, the DBS system from Medtronic, Inc. nearly two decades ago. Despite the somewhat restrictive MRI operating conditions for this AIMD (i.e., 1.5 Tesla, only; use of a transmit/receive RF head coil was required; maximum whole body averaged specific absorption rate of 0.1 W/kg), patients were able to receive "on-label" MRI examinations for the first time.</para>
    <para>AIMD manufacturers have come a long way in designing their implants with MRI-related issues in mind and with consideration given to what conditions of the MRI examination (e.g., level of the static magnetic field, limits of gradient fields and/or RF power level, etc.) permit the procedure to take place without compromising patient safety. In 2011, the first successful FDA labeling of an MR Conditional cardiac pacemaker (Medtronic, Inc.) occurred in the United States (21), which marked the beginning of the recent era in which many more patients with AIMDs from manufacturers across the industry can now have access to MRI through MR Conditional labeling.</para>
    <para>The achievement of the current state of MR Conditional devices today, especially including the many industry-standard test methods that are the subject of this chapter, may not have been possible without an effort that started in 2006 across the MRI safety community, which included representatives from implanted device manufacturers, MR system manufacturers, safety test houses, and regulatory bodies. These experts came together as a Joint Working Group (JWG), convened under the International Standards Organization (ISO) and incorporated contributors to the existing MR system standards-making groups from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and ASTM International, with leadership from across the various stakeholders. A major outcome of this effort was the publication of an international Technical Specification (TS), ISO/TS 10974, documenting guidelines pertaining to the assessment of MRI safety for patients with AIMDs. The first version of this TS was published in 2012 (22) and the second updated version was published in 2018</para>

          <title>Important Notes About MRI Safety Testing of AIMDs</title>
    <para>The following notes address many common aspects of MRI safety testing of AIMDs and certain misconceptions that exist:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>There are many types of potential patient hazards, which require comprehensive testing. Notably, it is not simply about magnetic materials or RF energy-induced burns with respect to the MRI-related issues that exist for AIMDs.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The vast majority of implants that permit MRI examinations to be performed in patients are "MR Conditional" (i.e., a medical device with demonstrated safety in the MR environment with defined conditions including conditions for the static magnetic field, time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and radiofrequency fields) (24). Because all AIMDs contain metal, there is no, "MR Safe" (i.e., a medical device that poses no known hazards resulting from exposure to any MR environment) AIMD. Thus, if the implant has metallic components, it is either MR Conditional or MR Unsafe (i.e., a device which poses unacceptable risks to the patient, medical staff or other persons in the MR environment) (24).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>What can be considered MR Conditional is a specific device or system (e.g., a specific IPG plus a specific lead) according the device's formal MRI safety labeling conditions listed in its Instructions for Use or Clinician's Manual. These conditions, based on the field exposure conditions a device will experience within a patient in the MR scanner, are derived from the methods and results of the rigorous testing that was conducted by the device manufacturer or a test house.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>According to this rule, the MR Conditional status is a "system tag" that is not practically applicable to one component of the system.</para>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem><para>That is, for any MR Conditional system with a specific IPG and a specific lead, this specific IPG, by itself, does not carry the MR Conditional tag, because when it is combined with a lead not within the approved list of leads per this MR Conditional requirements, the "MR Conditionality" does not apply. A similar argument applies to leads. Note: Sterile packaging for such implants commonly includes a package for the IPG by itself, and a separate package for the lead by itself.</para>

          <listitem><para>According to this rule, no generalizations of MRI safety can be made about any other device or system from the same manufacturer or from other manufacturers (e.g., lead extensions or lead-to-IPG adapter that are not included in the MRI-related label, and not MR Conditional).</para>

      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>If mixing and matching an IPG from an MR Conditional device or system with lead(s) from another MR Conditional device or system, without the explicit labeling about this combination, one cannot assume that the new combination is MR Conditional or otherwise safe for a patient undergoing an MRI examination. Importantly, there is typically no testing or data available to assess or support the safety of such combinations.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Fractured leads, abandoned leads, and other damaged or non-functional implants are typically not assessed for safety, although the test methods in ISO/TS 10974 could potentially be applied to such circumstances. Recent research suggests that excessive heating may occur under certain MRI conditions for these situations (25, 26).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>There are no generally accepted test methods or appropriate guidelines on how to safely scan a patient with multiple AIMDs (e.g., a cardiac pacemaker and a spinal cord stimulation system). Even if each device or system is MR Conditional by itself, the multi-system combination is not labeled for MR Conditional safety because of the lack of testing on such combinations. Of note is that there is a suggestion that lead electrode heating characteristics can change when another implant is present in close proximity (27).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Almost all present safety testing and MR Conditional labeling of implants is for either 1.5 Tesla or 3 Tesla cylindrical bore, horizontal field MR systems, or both. Open-bore scanners that are either lower- or higher-field MR scanners typically are not yet included in testing standards or in MR Conditional labeling.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>For testing related to RF field interactions, if an MR Conditional device or system is tested for safety in a specific static magnetic field strength and frequency (say 1.5 Tesla/64 MHz), there is no implication on MRI safety of the device within other field strengths and frequencies (e.g., lower fields such as 1 Tesla/42 MHz or higher field such as 3 Tesla/128 MHz or 7 Tesla/298 MHz)(15). No presumption of safety can be made at any field strength/frequency other than the specific ones at which the safety assessment was performed, because the RF fields-dependent properties of the system change substantially (e.g., RF field wavelength, current deposition in the leads, exposure fields in the patient due to scanner design differences, etc.) and could be either more safe or unsafe.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>In general, accessories of devices or systems (e.g., remote control, charger, etc.) are not MR Conditional, because they are neither designed nor tested for safety. Many such accessories are MR Unsafe and, therefore, cannot be brought safely into MR system rooms.</para>

        <title>MRI AND AIMD INTERACTIONS: POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARDS ACCORDING TO ISO/TS 10974</title>
    <para>The demonstration of the MR Conditional status for an AIMD by device manufacturers, for example to achieve FDA labeling, involves testing in numerous (hundreds or thousands) different exposure conditions along with modeling of many thousands (or millions) of such potential exposure conditions. This includes exposure in realistic MRI environments, benchtop injection testing, and the development of appropriate risk assessments though physical experiments and modeling. This section of the chapter describes the full range of proper test methods according to established standards that collectively form the "testing package" regulatory bodies review for a given MR Conditional device label.</para>
    <para>Importantly, while there are some abbreviated methods used by some researchers to preliminarily assess device safety through testing of a handful of configurations of a device within a phantom of tissue simulating medium (which was common in past decades, and still finds its way into the literature) such methods are simply insufficient for establishing the MR Conditional safety for AIMDs. While such tests can be a helpful first step, or potentially useful in demonstrating hazards, they unfortunately do not meaningfully evaluate safety in a comprehensive manner.</para>
    <para>According to ISO/TS 10974:2018 (23), the potential safety hazards due to the MR system and the interactions with an AIMD are presented in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> also illustrates these possible risks. As indicated, each of the three different types of electromagnetic fields associated with an MR scanner (static magnetic field, time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and RF fields) generate specific interactions and potential safety hazards for patients, as do the different combinations of the fields (e.g., device vibration is a result of the combination of the static magnetic field and time-varying gradient fields).</para>
        <sect3 id="ch0021s0000s0003s0001">
          <title>Acceptance Criteria</title>
    <para>Most test methods described in the various standards do not include explicit acceptance criteria (e.g., how many degrees of temperature rise is acceptable for electrode heating). Since the risk level depends on the nature and location of the implant, as well as the tissues surrounding it, each device manufacturer must set and justify acceptance criteria for each potential hazard according to their internal risk management procedures, which is subject</para>

    <para>A displacement force produced by the static magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>) on a device containing magnetic materials has the potential to cause unwanted movement of the implant. The force exerted on the device is a function of the spatial gradient of the static magnetic field (or the product of B<subscript>0</subscript> and the spatial gradient of B<subscript>0</subscript>, depending on whether the materials are below or above magnetic saturation) as well as the mass of magnetic material. This established test method described in ASTM F2052 (11). It is measurement-based and is typically conducted using an MR system.</para>
    <para>The concept of testing is to measure the magnetically-induced displacement force of the implant where the "patient accessible" spatial gradient magnetic field is greatest (near the opening of the bore) and compare against value the gravitational force acting on the device (since all implanted devices are subjected to the force due to gravity without patient harm)(29). One version of this test is to suspend the device by a light-weight string at that location and measure the deflection angle. If the device deflects less than 45°, its magnetic force is less than that of gravity.</para>
    <para>Implants with a displacement force less than the force of gravity are automatically deemed acceptable for patients undergoing MRI examinations. However, if the force is greater, it still could be acceptable with the justification of an appropriate acceptance crite-</para>

    <para>Magnetically-induced torque, produced by the static magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>), has the potential to cause unwanted movement of a device containing magnetic materials (i.e., rotating the implant to align it with the direction of the static magnetic field of the MR system). Torque is sensitive to field strength of the magnet and should be measured at a location where the static magnetic field is homogeneous (e.g., at the isocenter of an MR scanner). This established test method is described in ASTM F2213 (12). It is measurement-based and is typically conducted using an MR system.</para>
    <para>Experimental approaches to conducting torque testing vary in complexity and applicability. Some methodologies are only applicable to devices that experience little or no torque, while others are appropriate for devices that experience substantial torque and must be more rigorously quantified to assess safety.</para>
    <para>Most implantable devices, including AIMDs with extended leads, experience measurable torque but have no trouble passing a reasonable acceptance criterion. Similar to magnetically-induced force, the impact of torque acting on an implant may be mitigated by counter-forces that are present, <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis> (30).</para>

      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Time-varying gradient magnetic fields associated with an MR system induce eddy currents on the conductive surfaces of an AIMD. These eddy currents produce a time-varying magnetic moment that interacts with the static magnetic field, causing vibration of the conductive surfaces and, subsequently, the device. The primary potential for patient harm, since the vibration of the device is typically very low-amplitude due to the high frequency of oscillation, is related to possible breakage of internal components that may lead to malfunction of the device. As such, there could be compromised functionality or a lack of therapy from the device.</para>
    <para>Vibration is sensitive to the static magnetic field and the time-varying gradient magnetic fields. This test is described in ISO/TS 10974:2018 (23). It is measurement-based and is conducted using an MR system or using a "shaker" table.</para>
    <para>There are two methods for testing. One method requires the use of an MR scanner and provides higher accuracy with an increase in test burden, while the other method employs a shaker table and uses conservative approximations to reduce test burden after initial calibration testing utilizing an MR system. Because most conceived failures are due to fatigue fractures of internal components, the concept of testing is to expose the implant to extended periods of vibration and confirm full device functionality afterwards.</para>
    <para>The test duration represents the cumulative patient scan time over the lifetime of a typical AIMD. Guidelines in the standard establish, based on prior clinical experience, that conservative total MRI examination time exposure ranges from 2.5 hours to 7.5 hours, if considering at the top 0.8% of the population to the top 0.01% of the population, respectively.</para>
    <para>For small- or medium-sized IPGs, and non-life-sustaining devices, vibration is not considered a high-risk hazard. Notably, larger devices (e.g., IPGs associated with implantable cardioverter defibrillators or implantable infusion pumps) typically vibrate more, with potentially greater likelihood of device damage.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">4. Gradient Field-Induced Device (IPG) Heating</emphasis></para>
    <para>The time-varying gradient magnetic fields associated with MRI pulse sequences induce eddy currents on conductive AIMD enclosures (i.e., the IPG for an ICD) and other conductive internal surfaces such as battery components and circuit ground planes, which can result in device heating.</para>
    <para>IPG heating is sensitive to the average or root-mean-square (RMS) gradient field amplitude |dB/dt|, with secondary dependence on the gradient waveform characteristics (i.e., the shape and frequency). It is greatest when the device is located where the gradient field |dB/dt| RMS is maximum and when the device is oriented so that the gradient field vector is orthogonal to the AIMD surface(s) with the largest conductive area. Gradient magnetic field-induced heating also scales strongly with device radius (i.e., larger devices heat more).</para>
    <para>This test is described in ISO/TS 10974:2018 (23). It is measurement-based, with preferential use of a laboratory gradient coil, amplifier, and function generator that can simulate clinical gradient field exposures. Alternatively, testing may be conducted using a clinical MR system.</para>
    <para>Testing may be conducted using one of two tiers for the gradient waveform shape. Tier 1 uses a conservative waveform shape, and Tier 2 allows the characterization and use of a clinically relevant waveform. Tier 2 is most useful for AIMDs with larger conductive surfaces.</para>
    <para>The standard calls for a test duration that is the maximum allowed for a clinical MRI examination as specified by the AIMD MR Conditional labeling, or 30 minutes. All other testing parameters are determined by the AIMD manufacturer to reflect conservative clinical use conditions for their device.</para>
    <para>The key concern is local tissue heating due to radiant heat from the IPG. For most AIMDs with extended leads, this is not considered a high-risk hazard, though some MR Conditional labels have suggested applying an ice pack near a subcutaneously implanted device if the patient reports localized heating sensations near the device (IPG) during MRI.</para>

Otherwise, any parameter that affects RF power level can be adjusted to reduce the value according to the following suggestions (33).</para>

      <listitem><para>Use the "Low SAR" option on the MR system. This feature is available on most MR scanners and helps to reduce the B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> or SAR, typically without impacting image quality. However, it is unlikely that this option, by itself, will suffice in certain instances. Therefore, use this option in combination with one or more options adjustments to the pulse sequence parameters: (1) increase the repetition time (TR), but not to the extent that it changes the image contrast, as in T1-weighted spin echo pulse sequences); and/or (2) reduce the number of section locations or the grouping of section locations); and/or (3) reduce the flip-angle used for the pulse sequence, or the refocusing flip-angle; and/or (4) use fewer RF saturation bands; and/or (5) decrease the number of phase encodes; and/or (6) reduce the number of echoes such as with respect to the echo train length or the turbo factor (34).</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Active implants may pose hazards to patients referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures. An active implant is defined as one that relies on its function from a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity (1). In contrast, a passive implant, such as a coronary artery stent, hemostatic clip, or hip prosthesis, does not require electrical power or other external energy in its operation or during its intended use. Some active implants have external leads and electrodes for delivery of electric current for therapy and/or for physiologic sensing. Examples of active implants include cardiac pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), neurostimulation systems, bone growth stimulators, and cochlear implants. Other types of active implants, such as implantable drug infusion pumps, use electrical power for operation but may not have attached metallic leads and electrodes.</para>

        <title>IN-VITRO TESTS OF HEATING</title>
    <para>Implants with conducting leads have been referred to as "MR Critical" with respect to radiofrequency (RF) heating because of the length of the metallic materials (2). Testing in phantoms has demonstrated the potential for significant temperature rises at the electrodes of leads that are part of an active implant system (3). For example, Rezai, et al. (4) measured a temperature rise of 25.3°C on the tip of a deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead in a phantom</para>

    <para>at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz in association with an MR system reported, whole-body averaged SAR of 3.9-W/kg. Achenbach, et al. (5) reported a temperature increase of 63.1°C at the electrode tip for a cardiac pacing lead not connected to a pulse generator (PG) under 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz conditions. Luechinger (6) measured an RF-induced temperature rise in laboratory animals (pigs). A maximum temperature increase of 15°C was measured for a passive fixation lead and a temperature rise in excess of 30°C was measured for a "cork-screw" fixation lead (6). No significant threshold or impedance changes of the cardiac pacing leads were measured nor did pathology indicate any heat-related damage under the conditions used in this investigation.</para>

        <title>CLINICAL RELEVANCE</title>
    <para>An understanding of heating behavior for active implant-related leads is crucial to establishing patient safety in association with the use of MRI. Excessive heating at the electrode could damage the surrounding tissue, which may be particularly serious for neurological or cardiac tissue. Active implants with lead wires are mostly contraindicated for MRI primarily because of the large temperature rises that have been reported in laboratory testing. Before an implant manufacturer can receive regulatory approval for a given product relative to the use of MRI, tests and analyses must be undertaken to document that a patient with the implant can safely undergo an MRI procedure. This is particularly important for active implants.</para>
    <para>Several active implants have labeling approved for patients needing MRI examinations including cardiac devices, neurostimulation systems, cochlear implants, and others. For example, the first cardiac pacemaker approved in the United States (U.S.) for MRI was the Revo MRI SureScan Pacing System (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) (7). Patients with the Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) System (Cyberonics, Inc. and LivaNova) and the Activa Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) may safely undergo MRI by following highly specific conditions (8, 9).</para>
    <para>MRI-related heating of active implants without external leads is expected to be similar for a passive implant with similar geometry and materials (10). However, interactions of the electromagnetic fields with the device circuitry could result in heating or other issues. For example, magnetic saturation of a transformer core by the static magnetic field of the scanner may result in additional power delivery by a battery.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="ch0022s0000s0004">
        <title>MECHANISM OF RADIOFREQUENCY FIELD-RELATED HEATING</title>
    <para>The radiofrequency (RF) field used during MRI induces an electric field in the patient or the phantom (i.e., in the case of evaluating heating for implants and devices). The frequency of the RF electric field is the same as that of the RF magnetic field, 64-MHz for 1.5-T and 128-MHz for 3-T. The electric field results in power deposition from the ohmic heating of tissues. The specific absorption rate (SAR) with units of W/kg is the metric for the RF power.</para>
    <para>The mechanism for heating of an implant during MRI is coupling of the metal with the electric fields. The tangential component of the electric field along the length of the lead</para>
    <para>induces waves of electric current on the lead (11). These waves produce an electric field in the vicinity of the electrode, which produces heating of the tissue. There may also be measurable temperature rises due to ohmic heating by the induced RF current through the conducting wires in a lead.</para>
    <para>Thus, the temperature rise at an electrode is due to the tangential electric field along the entire length of the lead. This concept was quantified by Park, et al. (12) using a transfer function (TF) method. The temperature rise may be expressed as</para>
    <para>ΔT = A[∫<subscript>0</subscript><superscript>L</superscript> E<subscript>tan</subscript>(τ)S(τ)dτ]<superscript>2</superscript>                    (1)</para>
    <para>In Equation (1), A is a constant with units of °C/(V/m)<superscript>2</superscript>, E<subscript>tan</subscript> is the tangential electric field, distance τ = 0 at the electrode and τ = L at the generator, and S is the transfer function (i.e., the lead model) between the incident E<subscript>tan</subscript> and the scattered electric field near the electrode. The dimensions of S are inverse length. Both S and E<subscript>tan</subscript> are complex, that is, they have magnitude and phase.</para>
    <para>Due to phase effects, it is possible to have a high or low temperature rise for different lead paths in the phantom with similar magnitude of E<subscript>tan</subscript>. This phenomenon was demonstrated by Mattei, et al. (13) who measured temperature rises for leads in a phantom for 374 different configurations. This group reported that the observed temperature rise at the tip of a pacemaker lead depended on the path in the phantom and whether or not the pulse generator was attached to the lead. In tests conducted in a circular phantom, Langman, et al. (14) also found that heating depended on the termination conditions at the generator end of the lead. Importantly, heating of a lead will also depend on how it is constructed. Nordbeck, et al. (15) measured RF heating of unipolar and bipolar pacing lead assemblies in a rectangular phantom. It was concluded that heating could be reduced by changes in the configuration of the lead. Mattei, et al. (16) tested the role of lead structure by in vitro measurements on 30 commercial cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads in a rectangular phantom. At a whole-body averaged exposure SAR of 1-W/kg, the recorded temperature rises ranged from 2.4°C to 15°C. These tests were conducted for straight-line placement of the lead in the phantom and, thus, it is possible that greater rises would be measured for other lead paths.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="ch0022s0000s0005">
        <title>CALCULATION OF RADIOFREQUENCY FIELD-RELATED HEATING</title>
    <para>The temperature rise of a passive implant in a phantom, such as a spine prosthesis or fixation device can be accurately calculated (17) and these types of simulations are described elsewhere in this textbook. Calculation of the transfer function and consequent temperature rise for an implanted lead is difficult because of the intricate and complicated geometry of the lead. The lead conductors have a minimum feature of the order of tens of microns, which is of the order of 10<superscript>5</superscript> greater than the length of the lead. Park, et al. (12) calculated S and RF-induced temperature rises for bare and insulated wires using method of moments. Neufeld, et al. (18) calculated heating for a straight insulated wire and for a helical wire</para>
    <para>using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. Both groups reported agreement between calculations and measurements with a 17% uncertainty determined by Neufeld, et al. (18).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION ISO/TS 10974 FOR MRI AND ACTIVE IMPLANTS</emphasis></para>
    <para>A joint working group commissioned by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) developed a draft International Technical Specification ISO/TS 10974:2018 that provides test methods for MRI-related hazards associated with an active implantable medical device (AIMD) including RF-induced heating (1). The technical specification (TS) presents an approach with four tiers for assessment of RF heating of active implants. Tier 1 has the simplest test and computation requirements, but also requires the most conservative assumptions on incident RF energy. Tiers 2 and 3 progressively require more measurements and simulations, but are able to use successively less overestimation of test field magnitudes. Tier 4 requires the most stringent computational analysis and utilizes the least overestimation of test field magnitudes.</para>
    <para>Cabot, et al. (19) evaluated RF heating of a generic deep brain stimulator in 1.5-T/64-MHz as a vehicle to test the four tiers of ISO/TSO 10974. The model implant consisted of a stainless steel "can", a dielectric header, and leads consisting of either an insulating helical copper lead or an insulated straight copper lead. Lead lengths of 50-, 100-, 150-, and 200-mm were evaluated. Simulations for this implant, which is much simpler than an actual DBS device, required as many as 500 x 10<superscript>6</superscript> mesh cells. Simulations were run on an accelerated cluster and it was projected that carrying out the estimated 12,000 simulations for a Tier 4 analysis would take several decades. Cabot, et al. (19) concluded with a suggestion for a procedure that follows a test strategy between Tier 3 and Tier 4.</para>
    <para>In consideration of the above, the following information should be considered regarding MRI-related heating and active implants: (1) Heating at the electrode of an implanted lead used for a cardiac pacemaker, neurostimulation system, or other similar device that has an active lead may be significantly greater than the threshold risk of approximately 6 to 7°C for tissue injury (20). (2) Heating at the electrode is a complicated function of the magnitude and phase of the incident E<subscript>tan</subscript> over the entire length of the lead. If only phantom tests are used to characterize lead heating behavior, a significant number of these tests may be required. (3) Current computational methods are not capable of accurately calculating the temperature rise for a clinically relevant lead wire. (4) A combined approach of innovative measurements and complementary computations will improve the accuracy and efficiency of determining the temperature rise of the lead over the clinically relevant range of incident E<subscript>tan</subscript>.</para>
    <para>A primary purpose of this chapter is to describe test methods and analyses to predict the heating that an active implant would undergo during MRI. The test case is a commercial neurostimulation system used for vagus nerve stimulation (Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) System (Cyberonics, Inc. and LivaNova). First, the transfer function, S, is developed from electrical measurements of the response of the lead</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>The level of knowledge of a natural phenomenon has often been related to the ability to describe it through more or less complex mathematical relationships. Notably, physicists and engineers have always used mathematical tools and modeling to represent the real world. On the contrary, some biological disciplines, especially in the past, showed more skepticism to their use. It is argued that the biological reality is extremely complex and, therefore, not suitable to be represented by an oversimplified model. This objection implies that the description of a system through mathematical and physical models may produce a distortion of the phenomena under investigation. As such, it is difficult to refute this objection because, as a matter of fact, the construction of any mathematical model needs to formulate simplifying hypotheses. However, this is a characteristic of all cognitive phenomena,</para>
    <para>which are always based on some form of schematization. What is interesting to see is whether the mathematical or physical model is indeed more distorting than other methods. The mere presentation of experimental results does not produce conceptual distortions, but cannot be considered free from defects on a practical level, because even the measurement, in itself, implies an alteration of the system. Moreover, and this is a point of great importance, it does not allow the interpretation of the phenomenon, since its function is purely descriptive. On the other hand, when it is possible to describe a complex phenomenon using the basic laws of physics, it is possible to provide an interpretative key to the results that are obtained (i.e., an interpretative model). On the basis of the model, it is then also possible to formulate predictions on the behavior of the same phenomenon over time, or even under conditions that differ from those observed when experimental data were collected (i.e., a predictive model).</para>
    <para>It is useful to emphasize that the biomedical world has always been very familiar with the concept of model, although it is generally associated with <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> studies or animal models. Indeed, experimental medical practice leads from clinical to laboratory experience to return to clinical experience, developing through abstraction and simplification steps, in order to understand the single aspects that contribute to complex natural phenomena. This approach is very similar to that of physical-mathematical modeling: the profound complexity that characterizes living organisms and the countless relationships existing between their different components, make it impossible to describe the system in its entirety and require the identification of specific sub-phenomena, with the introduction of drastically simplified models with respect to reality. However, keeping in mind these simplifications, the models can provide results and interpretations on the physical aspects of biological reality that could hardly be achieved by the observation of experimental evidence alone.</para>
    <para>The definition of a model commonly accepted by methodologists of science is: given any system, S, where system means a set of elements connected to each other, it is said that a new system, M, represents a model of S when it is possible to establish a correspondence between the elements and relationships of S and the elements and relationships of M. Such definition implies that, to a certain extent, the study of the system S can be traced back to the study of the system M. When the elements of M are mathematical entities and the relationships between them are mathematical functions, M is called a mathematical model.</para>
    <para>The definition of a physical model is more debated. In some cases, a physical model is defined as a mathematical model in which the relationships that bind the different elements of the model are borrowed from the language of physics. According to another interpretation, the physical model represents a simplification of the starting model that allows a simpler characterization and evaluation, but always in terms of experimental measurements and not through mathematical functions.</para>
    <para>When it is possible to characterize the structure and properties of a system and write the relationships between the different variables, it is also possible to proceed to the construction of the mathematical model with interpretative function. However, it is evident that when choosing the structure of the model corresponding to the system under consideration, it is necessary to accept some simplification. Thus, the model is generally deduced through a process of abstraction and a series of simplifying hypotheses, which lead the real system</para>
    <para>to be associated to an ideal or "abstract" system that is an image of the former but which it is not the exact replica.</para>
    <para>The adoption of simplifying hypotheses poses the problem of the validation of the model, which is generally based on the comparison between the results obtained from the model, through logical deductions or numerical simulations, and the results obtained from the experimental analysis on the real system. Even when the comparison is successful, it is necessary to ask whether the model is valid only for the particular experiment carried out or has more general validity. In the first case, the model would lose all forecasting capacity. However, even in this case, the model would still have the merit of providing an interpretation of the experimental evidence, which goes far beyond the simple descriptive function.</para>
    <para>When all the hypotheses underlying the model are demonstrated to be valid, the deductive nature of the modeling process reasonably allows the ability to recognize the interpretative (and predictive) capabilities of the model, for a various set of physiological conditions, not necessarily limited to those under which the validation was carried out. The possibility of modifying the structure of the physical/mathematical model that describes a particular biological phenomenon, undoubtedly represents a useful tool towards a form of predictive, preventive, and personal care, which is now becoming the paradigm of modern medicine.</para>
    <para>The general concepts expressed so far fit well with the study of the interactions of electromagnetic fields with biological tissues. In particular, the modelistic approach has represented and continues to be an indispensable means of analysis for the evaluation, both in qualitative but also in quantitative terms, of human exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic fields. The knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the propagation and the interactions of electromagnetic fields with the external world has always proceeded in parallel with the ability to describe them through mathematical laws. Beginning with the identification of simple relationships, valid only for particular cases and under strong simplifying hypotheses, with the progress of science, increasingly complex models of general validity have been formulated. In some cases, they have also permitted the capability to hypothesize the existence of particular phenomena before being able to have an experimental evidence of the same phenomena. Maxwell's equations constitute the fundamental mathematical model for the description of the electromagnetic phenomenon and give a complete description of the relationships between electromagnetic fields, charges, and current distributions.</para>

In the first case, however, only relatively simple problems have so far been successfully addressed, such as the absorption of a plane wave by an infinite tissue surface, possibly consisting of several layers, or by spheres, and the absorbed electric field has been obtained in a closed form. Despite the major simplifications needed by the analytical approach, the latter has definitely helped in understanding the theoretical basis of the power absorption by a biological body, and in identifying the parameters that play a major role in this process.</para>
    <para>In the case of numerical analysis, on the other hand, the electromagnetic equations are solved by algorithms that use numerical approximation.

    <para>The numerical computation of the induced electromagnetic field inside the human body is the starting point for the study of the possible effects of electromagnetic fields on biological systems and the mechanisms underlying them.

    <para>The SAR is the typical parameter adopted by international regulations that address the protection from electromagnetic fields, as a basic parameter for the risk assessment. Such a choice derives from the consideration that the whole-body averaged SAR and local SAR are suitable quantities to compare the effects of electromagnetic exposure under different conditions.

    <para>In parallel with the development of modeling/numerical techniques, the effects of the interactions between electromagnetic fields and biological tissues have also been investigated through experimental studies. In many cases, experimental measurements have represented the starting point for the definition of the numerical model, as well as the source of data necessary for the validation of the model itself.</para>
    <para>However, by analyzing these experimental studies and the limitations necessarily related to them, the great importance of numerical models and simulations is even better highlighted. Generally speaking, experimental studies evaluate the electromagnetic field interactions with biological tissues by exposing a physical model of the human body, typically referred as a "phantom", to the electromagnetic field. The strong simplification needed by the physical model compared to the case of actual biological tissues makes it difficult to immediately extend the results obtained to what can be expected in the real case in human subjects without any further analysis. In addition, the measurement of the electromagnetic quantities (e.g., electric field, induced currents, etc.) without perturbing the system is often a difficult challenge that must be adequately addressed. Therefore, an indirect measurement is often preferred, considering, for example, quantities, such as the temperature, that are</para>
    <para>more easily accessible, but that, in any cases, must then be related to the electromagnetic quantities of interest always through mathematical models.</para>
    <para>In consideration of the above, the modern computational capabilities and computing powers that have grown continuously in recent years have made the modelistic approach an excellent means to describe the interactions between electromagnetic fields and biological tissues, not only limited to the research field. Presently, numerical simulations are used as a predictive and design support tool in different contexts, from the industrial prototyping of new devices to the regulatory compliance evaluation in terms of electromagnetic compatibility issues.</para>

        <title>NUMERICAL MODELS APPLIED TO MRI SIMULATIONS: A BRIEF HISTORY</title>
    <para>The evaluation of the possible effects induced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-related electromagnetic fields on a patient bearing a metallic implant is an excellent example to demonstrate the important role that computational modeling plays today. MR systems generate time-varying gradient magnetic fields and pulsed radiofrequency (RF) fields in the presence of a powerful static magnetic field to create an image of the body. Together, the three electromagnetic fields (static, time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and RF fields) create a hostile environment for any metallic device implanted in the patient, in particular for active implanted medical devices (i.e., medical devices relying on functioning by a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity) such as a cardiac pacemaker, an implanted cardioverter defibrillator, a neurostimulation system or a cochlear implant.</para>
    <para>The scientific community has been engaged in finding a practical solution to extend the unparalleled benefits of MRI to patients implanted with metallic devices since the early 1990s (2-8). Numerical analysis has been widely adopted for the design and optimization of MR systems: for the optimization of static magnetic field homogeneity and for shimming (9-14); for the design of gradient coils and their optimization (15-19); for the design of transmit RF coils and optimizing RF field homogeneity (20-26); and for the design of receiver coils and the assessment of the signal-to-noise ratio for MR images (27-33). Numerical tools were also adopted to model the human body's exposure to the three aforementioned components of the electromagnetic fields generated by the MR scanner. Electromagnetic modeling has been used to evaluate the biological effects related to the power static magnetic fields of MR systems (34-36), the peripheral nerve stimulation caused by the time-varying gradient magnetic fields (37-39), and safety aspects of RF power deposition and resultant tissue heating during MR signal excitation (40-50).</para>
    <para>However, the modeling of the interactions with the human body in presence of a metallic implant, definitely suffered from the oversimplifications made necessary by the computational resources available at that time, and tools based on numerical simulations played, in this field, a secondary role compared to experimental measurements and <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> studies.</para>
    <para>Indeed, Maxwell equations have to be solved to simulate the interactions of the electromagnetic field with the implanted medical device. For a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner, the Lar-</para>
    <para>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     617</para>
    <para>mor frequency is 64 MHz, which corresponds to a wavelength in human tissues of approximately 40 cm. Therefore, the wavelength is about the size of the studied object, and full-wave simulations need to be run, meaning that no approximation on Maxwell equations can be made. This is true for MR systems that works at 3 T (Larmor frequency =128 MHz, wavelength in human tissues of about 20 cm) as well. Thus, in order to reduce the computational costs of the model, the human body was often represented as a homogeneous domain with a simple geometry (e.g., rectangular or ellipsoidal) (51-54), or only a part of the body, such as the head, could be modeled taking into account the different tissues properties (55-57). In addition, the model of the implant could not account for the actual structure and geometry of a real device (i.e., the insulation sheet and the arrangement of the inner wires of the lead were not considered) (58-62).</para>
    <para>In vivo and in vitro experimental studies demonstrated the complexity of the interactions between the MR system, the human body, and the medical implant, and described multiple variables that may play an important role in such interactions, including the patient's size, anatomy, body composition, the patient's position in the MR system, the pulse sequence, (which included RF power level), lead routing, and lead design (63-66). The consequence of the great number of variables involved led to a substantial variability in the results presented in the peer-reviewed literature and indicated how the characterization of an implanted device in a patient undergoing MRI was an extremely complex problem.</para>
    <para>While the experimental approach could demonstrate in a relatively easy way the hazards related to the exposure of a patient implanted with a device to the MRI-related electromagnetic fields, it was far more difficult to prove a solution to these hazards because of the complex and unpredictable nature of the MRI-implant interactions. The use of phantoms, which do not account for the anatomical details and differences in terms of dielectric properties of different tissues, does not allow the results to be immediately extended to what occurs in a human subject. In addition, the simple measurement of a parameter does not allow any interpretation of the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon and does little to identify any strategies to reduce the risks associated with the parameter of interest. Thus, it became evident early on that there was a need for a different approach that was able to provide an interpretative and predictive key to the phenomenon: the modeling and numerical analysis.</para>
    <para>As the computational resources increased over the years, the reliance on numerical calculations increased as well. Such an increase was supported by the possibility of performing systematic analyses of the several variables affecting the interactions between the MRI electromagnetic fields and the implanted device, with decreased costs and increased reproducibility compared to performing experimental measurements. Computer-aided modeling demonstrated a practical and efficient method for exploring millions of variable combinations in a holistic manner. Additionally, computer modeling allowed the analysis of parameter extremes, outside the bounds of normal clinical practice, which permitted further assessment of safety margins and the sensitivity of influencing variables. The results of model simulations enabled predictions to be made about what would happen in the "real" system that was being studied in response to changing conditions, and to obtain information virtually impossible to obtain by experiments, like the electric fields inside a human body.</para>
    <para>For all of these reasons, present-day numerical simulation has become an indispensable means of safety testing for metallic devices associated with MRI, not only for research purposes, but also for medical device manufacturers to affordably obtain MRI-related safety labeling for their products. As an example, the first cardiac pacemaker implant that obtain the FDA clearance as MR Conditional in 2009 used modeling data to support regulatory submissions for approval. In particular, the modeling data was, in fact, the primary vehicle to demonstrate safety for this active cardiac device (67).</para>
    <para>Considering the complexity of the electromagnetic problem, most of the modelistic methods implement the numerical solution of the Maxwell's equations. The vast majority of numerical field calculations performed for MRI of the human subject, without or with a metallic implant, are related to the RF fields. Whereas perturbations associated with the static magnetic and time-varying gradient magnetic fields due to the presence of the human body in the MR system are only a few parts per million (on the order of 0.000001 times the applied field), perturbations in the RF field can easily be tens of a percentage (on the order of 0.1 times the applied field in free space). In addition, RF field-induced heating in tissue (concomitant with the maintenance of the RF field in a lossy medium) must be understood and monitored to avoid excess heating or a burn injury in a patient (68). This is also the major concern when assessing the MRI issues for a metallic implant that is present in a patient undergoing an MRI examination.</para>
    <para>Several numerical methods exist, each of them solving the Maxwell's equations following a specific algorithm. However, every numerical method has the implicit limitation of not solving solutions in a linear continuum. Every physical system has to be discretized in finite domains, so that the numerical solution is computed based on partial differential equations. The geometry of the physical systems involved in the problem is partitioned into elements of space or cells, in which the differential equations can be computed. The entire net of elements discretized into the numerical system is typically named by the term, "mesh". Several meshes can be implemented based on the specific grid of elements defined. In general, a mesh can be classified based on the following factors:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Domain dimension: One-, two-, or three-dimensional;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Element type: Triangular, tetrahedral, quadrilateral, hexahedral, or a mix of more than one type;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Element aspect ratio: Isotropic or anisotropic;</para>
      </listitem>

      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Topology: Structured or unstructured mesh.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>A structured mesh presents a regular topology with a well-known pattern. Conversely, an unstructured mesh has an irregular topology where the connectivity of the grid is part of the data structure. Once the mesh is defined, then the relation to the physical system within each element of the numerical space has to be found. What needs to be defined then is the algorithm that is able to solve the physical problem in the discretized space for the specific characteristics chosen. Several numerical methods exist to solve a physical system, however</para>
    <para>each one is defined with respect to its numerical implementation. Thus, every method cannot be independently defined by the algorithm.</para>
    <para>The methods used to solve Maxwell's equations in a physical system are based on differential or integral equation solvers, such that they discretize the differential or integral form of Maxwell's equations. Both methods can be solved in the time or frequency domain. In the time domain, the frequency range of interest is specified, and a gaussian signal with the frequency information is defined. Then, the signal is transformed into the time domain by using an inverse Fourier transformation, resulting in a time signal with a gaussian envelope. The system is then excited with this time pattern.</para>
    <para>Conversely, in the frequency domain, the behavior of a physical system is usually relevant in a specified frequency range. Thus, no information can be concluded for a single frequency. Hence, several simulations in the frequency band of interest have to be performed, the number of which are defined by the software algorithms to achieve a predefined accuracy of results by interpolation of points.</para>
    <para>The most favorable methods for this type of problem, in terms of memory requirements and simulation time are the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) (69) or the Finite Integration Technique (FIT) solved in the time domain. These time domain solvers require reasonable memory and simulation time compared to the frequency domain solvers (FEM, Finite Element Method; MM, Method of Moments) (70). Moreover, these algorithms tend to be easily implemented on Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) allowing a tremendous acceleration of the simulations with a hardware cost way below the cost for a cluster of central processing units (CPUs).</para>
    <para>One drawback of these time domain solvers is the hexahedral mesh, which is much less flexible than the tetrahedral mesh of a finite element solver. However, the possibility of using a conformal mesh permits the ability to follow the strong curvature of a geometry without having to dramatically refine the mesh. This is even more important because the smaller the mesh step, the smaller the time-step of the time domain solver.</para>
    <para>The FDTD method is a related space-grid, time domain technique that involves the resolution of Maxwell's equations on their differential form. Since its introduction by Yee in 1966 (69), the FDTD method has been widely used for a broad range of electromagnetic applications including geophysical, bioelectromagnetic, and biophotonics (71) and this technique experienced an exponential growth starting from its first proposal. One of the major reasons for such growth is the increase of computational performances for a given cost of technological resources.</para>
    <para>Because the FDTD algorithm is based on the solution of Maxwell's equations on their differential form, it is required to define the boundaries condition of the problem. In particular for wave-propagation problems in unbounded media, artificial boundary conditions have to be used to eliminate the reflections from the edge of the finite computational domain (72). A major turning point of the method for the study of wave propagation problems was the introduction of the perfectly matched layers (PML) by Berenger in 1992 (73). One of the characteristics of the FDTD method is that as the resolution of the sampled object is refined, the time required by the simulation to reach the Courant Friedrich Levy condition</para>
    <para>grows. This is a direct consequence of the intrinsic definition of the time-step as directly proportional to the square root of space resolution (71). Thus, the smaller the resolution, the smaller the time-step, and the higher the number of time-step intervals required to perform a time-defined simulation. Presently, computers are able to simulate increasing simulation space with higher resolution steps within a reasonable amount of time for each simulation. As described by Taflove, et al. (71), there are several reasons for the popularity of this method, including its robustness and systematicity. On the other hand, one of the major disadvantages of the technique is due to the inability of modeling smooth curved and tilted profiles. Without implementation of a specific algorithm, a curved or tilted profile implemented in FDTD will be affected by "staircasing". Although the simplest and most frequently used approach is the staircasing approximation, it has been reported that there is a solution inaccuracy related with the staircasing effect (74, 75). Moreover, an error of up to 2% error can be committed in the evaluation of the resonance frequency of a resonant object with respect to the tilted angle of the object with Cartesian axes of the grid (74).</para>
    <para>In addition to the staircasing approximation, in the past years several methods have been proposed to generate a conformal mesh for tilted and curved profiles. Among all, four categories can be highlighted: the contour path (CPFDTD) algorithm (76), the non-orthogonal FDTD (77), the hybrid methods using FDTD-FEM (78) or FDTD-MoM (79), and the sub-gridding method (80). Even though these methods have been extensively discussed and compared (81), the original FDTD Cartesian grid for the simulation of a radiofrequency (RF) coil for MRI has been, to date, the most commonly used methodology adopted in the peer-reviewed literature.</para>
    <para>Other methods including the Method of Moments (MoM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM) are very good for creating accurate representations of good conductors of arbitrary geometry, but rely on methods such as matrix inversion that work best for sparsely-populated spaces. Finite element representations of the human body are used occasionally in MRI (82-84), but due to the computational requirements, the representations tend to have far more homogeneous representations of far fewer tissue types than FDTD methods can accommodate on a given system.</para>
    <para>The FEM method is a near-neighbor, volume method for solving Maxwell's differential equations in the frequency domain. The physical space is divided into a non-structural grid, composed of meshes of small volumes or cells of tetrahedral elements, and this fact makes this method very suitable in modeling inhomogeneities and complex geometries. Once the volume has been subdivided, the unknown field within each element is approximated using linear extrapolation, starting from a sparse system equations matrix. The solution is given by the inversion of this matrix. The FEM can couple the electromagnetic solution with other physics, such as those associated with mechanical and thermal problems. However, it could be inefficient in the treatment of highly conductive radiators due to the requirement to have some mesh between the radiator and the absorber, and the mesh could be very complex, resulting in a meshing time that is longer than the solution time.</para>
    <para>The MoM is a full wave solution of Maxwell's integral equations in the frequency domain. The radiating/scattering structure is replaced by equivalent currents (normally surface currents) that are discretized into wire segments. Then, a matrix equation is derived and</para>
    <para>able to describe the interaction of every source segment on every other segment, computed with the Green's function. The strong points of this method are that: (1) it is unnecessary to discretize the "air space" around the antenna, leaving only the antenna and the region of interest to be considered; (2) only the surface is meshed; and (3) there is an efficient treatment of highly conducting surfaces. However, the MoM does not handle electromagnetically penetrable materials, especially if the material is inhomogeneous, and requires the surfaces to be closed, which is often impractical.</para>
    <para>To represent both the transmit RF coils and human body accurately in the same simulation, some groups have devised hybrid methods combining more than one method and sharing results between them (85). After an electromagnetic simulation, the specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution that is obtained is then scaled for each real RF pulse of the sequence and can be given as an input to the transient heat equation solver.</para>
    <para>For the magneto-static problem, to assess the interaction of the field with complex geometries, the most frequently used method is the FEM. For gradient magnetic fields for which the frequency is a few kHz, approximations can be made on the Maxwell equations and the most common method used is the FEM (86).</para>
    <para>Today, the crucial role that the numerical simulations play in the evaluation of the electromagnetic field generation, propagation, and interaction with the human body, not only limited to research purposes but also for industrial design and manufacturing, is revealed by the several tools that are commercially available. The main commercial simulation software available on the market providing a time domain solver are CST Microwave Studio™ (CST GmbH, Germany), Sim4Life™ (Zurich MedTech AG, Switzerland), XfdId™ (REMCOM Inc., USA), and FEKO™ (Altair Development SA, South Africa). ANSYS™ (ANSYS Inc., USA) and COMSOL Multiphysics™ (COMSOL Inc., Sweden) are finite-element solvers that are mainly used in the frequency domain.</para>
    <para>Parallel to the growth of the electromagnetic solver capability and computational efficiency, numerical human phantoms additionally evolved tremendously since the first need for these in the 1960s (87), from an approximate geometric model to the very detailed anatomical models existing today. The first numerical phantoms adopted in electromagnetic simulation were "stylized phantoms". These phantoms were the first generation of computational phantoms and were also called the mathematical phantoms (88, 89). They were implemented and used mainly between the 1960s and 2000s.</para>
    <para>Stylized phantoms were introduced to assess the dose exposure in body organs and tissues that were described by mathematical expressions representing planes or cylindrical, conical, elliptical or spherical surfaces. All of the models developed over the years were representative of the "average or standard individual" as defined by International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) data on the reference man (89). The most utilized stylized phantom model was the "MIRD" model. This phantom was named after the initials of the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) Committee of the Society of Nuclear Medicine based in the United States (U.S.). The MIRD phantom was first introduced by Fisher and Snyder in 1967 and later refined (90, 91). The refined model shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> was representative of an adult human model. In the following years, several other models that were part of the MIRD-type phantoms were released, representing infants and children of</para>

  <para>various ages, separate male and female adult models named Adam and Eva, and three phantoms representing the adult female in three stages of pregnancy (92-95).</para>
    <para>The second generation of computational phantoms was the voxel phantoms. The voxel models were first presented as a "tomographic-type" and were introduced in 1984 by Gibbs, et al. (96) and in 1986 by Williams, et al. (97). These numerical models were generated from medical imaging data collected through MRI or computed tomographic (CT) scans. The voxel models were able to provide three-dimensional representations of the human body by volume elements of the same size (i.e., voxel) but representing the anatomical structures of the human body (e.g., white matter, muscle, bone, etc.).</para>
    <para>Since their introduction in 1980s, the voxel models are still in use, and a large number of them are free to download or are commercially available. In the context of the MRI exposure assessment, one of the first studies on this important topic was performed by Dimbylow in 1996 (98). The exposure was computed on the NORMAN (i.e., NORmalized MAN) human voxel model with a weight of 73 kilograms (kg) and height of 1.76 meters (m). The model was implemented based on MRI data from a series of continuous, partial body scans of a single subject. Because the concept of the ICRP reference man was still strong, the final dimensions of the model were scaled so that the mass and height would agree with the new values for the reference man. Over the years, additional models were developed, including the Visible Human Man (VHM) and Visible Human Woman (VHW), which were completed in November 1994 and 1995, respectively. The VHM and VHW were the result of the visible human project led by the U.S. National Library of Medicine that started in 1956 and formed the basis for a large number of MRI safety assessments.</para>
    <para>With the growth of computational power and imaging resolution, several other models were introduced. In particular, volumetric models were adjusted by using surface description methods, which allowed smoother surfaces that could be meshed at one's convenience, with</para>

    <para>a high-resolution that is essential when fine body structures were studied (99). Among all of the models available today, one of the more popular ones that are used for the assessment of electromagnetic exposures are the phantoms of the Virtual Family (100), which were expanded to the Virtual Population (101). The populations include models of males and females ranging from an infant to an older adult. Models of pregnant woman and obese human are also present.</para>
    <para>Recently, a further improvement for computational phantoms is represented by the boundary representation (BREP) phantoms. The BREP phantoms are computational human models that contain exterior and interior anatomical features of a human body using the boundary representation method. With respect to the voxel models, the BREP phantoms are deformable phantom whose geometry can be conveniently transformed to fit particular physical organ shapes, volumes, or body postures. The operations that are possible to perform on BREP phantoms include extrusion, chamfering, blending, drafting, shelling, and tweaking (89). These features allow BREP models to include very complex anatomical features, as well as surface deformations. More details about the human phantoms adopted today in MRI numerical simulations, as part of complete model of interactions between the MR scanner and the patient, are provided in the next section.</para>

          <title>THE COMPLETE MODEL OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MR SYSTEMS AND PATIENTS WITH IMPLANTED LEADS</title>
    <para>Patients with active implants that incorporate one or more leads (e.g., cardiac pacemakers, neurostimulation systems, cochlear implants, etc.) are often referred for MRI examinations. Importantly, to ensure the safe use of MRI technology in these individuals, comprehensive <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> testing is necessary to evaluate the various MRI issues that exist, especially MRI-related heating of the leads. As part of this assessment, modeling is often performed because of the above-mentioned reasons. Modeling of the interactions between the MR system and the patient implanted with metallic leads faces three major challenges:</para>
    <para>First, there is inter-MRI examination-related variability. The initial studies that focused on the MRI safety of biomedical implants immediately highlighted that there are several factors that greatly impact the results and that justify the large variations of the findings reported in the peer-reviewed literature. For example, the type of MR scanner that is used and imaging conditions (e.g., the static magnetic field strength and frequency of the transmitted RF fields, the pulse sequence parameters, the duration of the scan, the body part undergoing imaging, etc.) vary between MRI procedures. Furthermore, other factors influence the level of lead heating that occurs during MRI such as the patient's position in the transmit RF coil, the position of the implant and the lead configuration inside the patient, and the patient's characteristics (e.g., size, morphology, and posture). In addition, variations exist in the length and design of the lead as well as in the type of implanted device that is present in the patient (i.e., cardiac pacemaker versus spinal cord stimulation system). Thus, the large number of different combinations of the factors mentioned above makes individual simulations of each combination a particularly challenging problem.</para>
    <para>Second, there is body tissue heterogeneity. The different tissue types present in the human body are both geometrically complex and differ strongly in dielectric properties.</para>

        <title>The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</title>
    <para>Just to get an idea, Liu, et al. (102) used conductivity values ranging from 0.02 S/m (yellow bone marrow) to 2.3 S/m (cerebrospinal fluid) and values for the relative permittivity ranging from 7 (fat and mammary tissue) to 128 (intestine/bowel content) in their simulations of an MR scanner operating at 64 MHz (1.5 T scanner).</para>
    <para>Third, this is a multi-scale problem. Importantly, several length scales are present in the problem. At 64 MHz, the wavelength λ0 of the RF field in free space is roughly five meters. Thus, the human body has a size of approximately λ0/3. Inside the body, the wavelength is reduced to λ = λ0/√εr, where εr is the relative permittivity of the body tissue. Despite this reduction of the wavelength, in many cases the components of the implanted device (e.g., the insulation sheath of a cardiac pacemaker lead) have dimensions on a length scale of approximately λ/1000. Volume discretizing methods are able to resolve these length scales concurrently but are limited by overwhelming simulation times and memory requirements.</para>

    <para>The implant extends typically over an area of approximately 30 cm² and must account for very small details, such as the thickness of the insulation sheath that cover the metallic lead and the geometry of the lead tip, that cannot be ignored in order to obtain reliable results and that entail the need to maintain a resolution of less than 1 mm. The human body has extremely complex geometry of weakly-conductive material that today is most readily represented on a high-resolution regular three-dimensional grid, with a minimum step of</para>

Running a simulation with such constraints is computationally expensive because it leads to a large number of discretization cells (up to 200 million cells) and a complex distribution of material of different electrical properties.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The Model of the MR System</emphasis></para>
    <para>The risks of MRI-related electromagnetic fields on implanted devices arise from three basic aspects of scanning (103-105). Magnetic resonance utilizes extremely powerful static magnetic forces (usually 30,000 to 60,000 times the Earth's magnetic field). This powerful magnetic field has the theoretical potential to move or dislodge an implanted metallic device. MRI also involves the use of time-varying gradient magnetic to image the scanned field of interest. These rapidly varying magnetic fields have the potential to induce electrical currents. Finally, MRI uses "pulsing" RF energy during the scanning process. If the implanted metallic device acts like an "antenna", this RF energy has the potential to cause substantial localized heating or to induce electrical currents.</para>
    <para>Today, the materials typically used in implanted biomedical devices have physical properties that make mechanical effects (i.e., force and torque) negligible in association with static magnetic fields. As an example, reports confirm that, indeed, the forces for cardiac pacemaker pulse generators exposed to 1.5 T and 3 T MR scanners tends to be lower than the gravitational force exerted by the Earth (106, 107). More dangerous are the effects related to the time-varying gradient magnetic fields and the RF fields, in particular when the implanted device is an active implanted medical device (105).</para>
    <para>Devices such as cardiac pacemakers or ICDs have the ability to sense several physiological parameters of the patient and to modulate their activity, accordingly. The gradient magnetic fields and/or RF fields may affect the proper sensing activity, causing an inappropriate functionality of the device. In MR Conditional devices, this hazard has been mitigated by introducing a specific mode of operation, called the "MRI Safe Mode", "MRI Protection Mode" or other suitable term, that temporarily switches off the sensing ability of the active cardiac device, preventing any form of interference.</para>
    <para>The heating generated at the tissue/device interface due to the electrical currents induced during the scanning process represents the most significant and potentially dangerous effect of the complex interactions between the implant and the MR system, in particular for those devices that used long metallic leads. Since the magnitude of the RF field is several times higher than the gradient magnetic fields, the induced heating is mainly due to the RF field. For this reason, the vast majority of numerical field calculations performed for MRI of the human subject implanted with metallic devices are related to the RF fields.</para>
    <para>RF coils can be distinguished into surface coils, array coils, or volume coils. Volume coils (e.g., the transmit body RF coil) completely encompass the anatomy of interest and are mostly operated as transmit RF coils coupled with receive-only coils but are also capable of operating as transmit/receive RF coils. Volume coils are typically cylindrical and rely upon a sinusoidal distribution of currents arranged circumferentially around the tube and</para>
    <para>running along the length of the coil to create a transverse magnetic field. Such RF coils, as the birdcage and the transverse electromagnetic (TEM) resonator, were designed to generate a very homogeneous RF excitation field B<subscript>1</subscript> across the entire covered volume.</para>
    <para>A surface RF coil consists of a partial loop of wire having dimensions that match the area of interest and its inductance in resonance with the capacitance at the Larmor frequency. The inhomogeneous field profile of surface RF coils restricts their use primarily to the receive-only mode, except in the case where adiabatic pulses or trains of pulses are used to reshape the flip angle profile. However, they are, as their name suggests, good for detecting signals at a much higher SNR close to the surface of the patient. RF array coils are used to reduce imaging time by their ability to spatially localize signals.</para>
    <para>Volume coils, and in particular birdcage coils, are the most common type of RF coils adopted as RF sources in the numerical field calculations performed for MRI of the human subject. The issue is to tune it properly to get the wanted homogeneous mode of the resonant structure. The birdcage body coils are implemented using two circular rings named end-rings connected by a certain number N of straight longitudinal connectors named rungs or legs. The RF field produced by the birdcage coil is the result of the currents flowing in the rungs. The currents flowing in the RF coil system is the result of the resonance of each network component of the coil structure.</para>
    <para>In 1997 work, Leifer (108), accurately described the theory behind the birdcage resonator, through a simple LC (also called resonant circuit) circuit. Leifer solved the birdcage coil using Kirchoff's mesh equations on the coil network. Leifer described the network as a generalized "band-pass" birdcage containing capacitors in both the end-rings and rungs. From the same structure "low pass" and "high pass" coils can be derived as special cases of the general band-pass coil. The three coil typologies are characterized by different resonant "modes". In fact, because of its geometry, the birdcage resonator shows a periodic or cycling nature. The periodic waves produced are named "modes" of resonance and their number is dependent on the number of coil rungs, such that the modes of resonance are those that show an integral number of wavelengths around the coil structure, each with a different field pattern and frequency of operation. Theory demonstrates that the number of resonant modes in a birdcage coil is strictly related to the number of rungs N, and equal to N/2 -1. In addition to those, Leifer (108) showed that a mode of resonant can exist in which the currents flow in the same direction in each end ring. Because of co-rotating currents in the end rings, this mode was named Helmholtz or the co-rotational (CR) mode, and it can be constructed from any combination of currents in the LC network. This mode, however, doesn't produce any propagating wave around the RF coil, hence it doesn't generate a magnetic field in the sample region. With the addition of this last Helmholtz mode, a total of N/2 + 2 resonant mode exist in a birdcage coil of N rungs. Between the N/2 +2:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>The mode of resonance with periodicity or order equal to 0 has equal and opposite ring currents and zero rung currents. It is called the anti-rotational (AR) ring mode.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The 0 mode is followed by the CR mode that is not identified by a periodicity or order number.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The mode of resonance with periodicity or order equal to 1 is the only one able to generate a homogeneous magnetic field. Thus, this is the typical mode used for imaging.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>All the other modes generate a magnetic field with a null at the center of the birdcage coil.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Low pass and high pass models present the same number of resonance modes, but they differ by showing a low or a high resonance spectrum, respectively. In particular for a low pass birdcage type, the AR and CR modes degenerate at zero frequency, with higher-order modes increasing in frequency. Conversely, in high pass birdcage type, the AR and CR modes form a doublet in high frequency, with higher-order modes decreasing in frequency.</para>
    <para>Over the years, the RF birdcage coils have been proffered as the main implementation of RF coil for approximating the B<subscript>1</subscript> propagation in the patient. However, the presence of a patient can affect the B<subscript>1</subscript> homogeneity. As a result, there may be areas within the body of the patient in which the transmit RF field is substantially weaker than in other regions. Additionally, the loss of homogeneity increases with the static magnetic field strength and with the RF coil's dimensions. For this reason, other technologies have been implemented to overcome the loss of field homogeneity. The more relevant ones are the Transverse Electromagnetic (TEM) resonator coils, and the parallel multi-transmit RF coils. The TEM resonator was first introduced by Vaughan in 1999 (109). The structure of the TEM resonator differs from the one of a birdcage coil in two ways. First, longitudinal connectors of the birdcage coil are replaced in the TEM coil with microstrips that are affixed to the inner surface of a non-conducting cylinder. Second, in the birdcage coil the rungs current use the end-rings as a return path, whereas in the TEM resonator the microstrips are all connected to the outer thin metallic shield. Thus, inductance and self-resonance of the TEM coil are independent of RF coil's diameter, because the TEM coil return path follows the shield rather than the end rings. The main characteristic of the TEM resonator is that at high frequencies, it becomes a cavity resonator or longitudinal transmission line in which oscillating standing waves develop.</para>
    <para>The increase of the SNR has always been the main target of improvement for RF birdcage body coils. To this aim, the use of multi elements excitation was adopted as a measure to improve the RF homogeneity in the excited volume. The simple birdcage coil was seen as a multi-element transmit coil array that could allow for an independent adjustment of amplitude and phase of the signal feeding each element of the coil. Starting from 2000s, this concept was evolved and made to take advantage of this method to reduce the RF inhomogeneities in the patients, particularly at high static magnetic fields (110). This new RF modality is also known as parallel multi-transmit or RF shimming. The degree of freedom given for each element of the coil to be fed with a specific waveform, permitted the ability to more carefully control and increase the homogeneity of the B<subscript>1</subscript> field generated by the RF excitation. Thus, the main concept of the multi-transmit coil is that the power is distributed to the feeding sources of the transmit RF coil (typically a TEM resonator) using two or more independent channels. A second advantage of these transmit RF coils is that they can be also used in a parallel receiving mode with a consequent reduction of the acquisition time.</para>
    <para>The structure of the birdcage coils allows for multiple feeding conditions within the coil rings. Depending on the source number, and feeding phase and amplitude, different polarization of the produced magnetic field can occur. Historically in the 1980s, the birdcage coils were fed using a single port coil, such to achieve a linearly polarized field. However,</para>
    <para>with such polarization, "quadrupole" artifacts were present in the resulting MR image (111). These artifacts manifested as "holes" or voids of decreased image intensity that could not be attributed to any anatomical feature of the patient scanned.</para>
    <para>By running simulations with cylinders of different size and material, it was evident that the "holes" were caused by the asymmetric nature of induced eddy currents that derive from the finite conductivity of the medium. To overcome this artifact problem, it was suggested to implement the circularly polarized birdcage coil with two feeding ports. The two ports were fed with the same amplitude and differential phase of 90° in order to generate a purely rotating wave. With this new polarization, a 1.4 and 1.6 higher SNR was observed with respect to left/linear and right/linear polarization, respectively.</para>
    <para>The linear polarization is then considered less efficient for MRI because half of the transmitted power is not used for the imaging process. The circularly polarized field is obtained by adding to the original linearly polarized field, a second field generated by sinusoidal current phase shifted by 90°. This is typically obtained by a quadrature transmission of signals in the RF birdcage coil.</para>
    <para>This can be achieved by two or more feeding sources around the coil ring. When such a circularly polarized field is generated, the two counter-rotating components of the two generated fields (i.e., B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>-</superscript>) cancel each other, whereas the subfields effective at inducing MRI (i.e., B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>+</superscript>) add together. Hence all of the power is used for imaging and an overall higher efficiency is achieved. Presently, the RF coil implemented in a clinical MR system uses the highly efficient, quadrature excitation. Conversely, linearly polarized transmit RF coils are restricted for use in small animal imaging.</para>
    <para>Besides the time-varying magnetic field (B<subscript>1</subscript>) used for the excitation of the magnetization vector, when a conductive media, such as the human body, is present inside or in close proximity to the RF energy, an altering voltage or electromotive force is induced inside the conductive media by the variation of the magnetic flux. The electromotive force generates eddy currents inside the media that, in turns, generate a secondary magnetic field and a corresponding additional voltage. Overall, the induced internal fields are strongly dependent on both the incident field, and the size, shape, and dielectric properties of the exposed medium. The voltage induced by B<subscript>1</subscript> is much larger than the secondary one. However, within the human body it can be considerably high enough to perturb the primary field. This is due to the complexity of the body's anatomy and to the inhomogeneity of the dielectric properties of the tissues.</para>
    <para>Additionally, an electric field can be generated within the body by the distribution of electrical potential specific to a given resonant structure. In MRI, such an electric field is typically named "conservative" or "capacitive". One possible situation in which the capacitive effect should be taken into account is when the medium is in close vicinity to the RF resonator. All these elements must be considered in the development of the model of the transmit RF coil used for MRI. For an ideal computation, the entire RF coil (with the actual power supply and the tuning capacitors able to produce the circularly polarized magnetic field), should be reproduced using a grid resolution fine enough to adequately account for the detail of the implanted device under investigation. As previously mentioned, the challenge is to combine a simulation of large dimensions (i.e., the length of the MRI's transmit</para>
    <para>RF coil &gt; 1 m) and small structures (i.e., the thin wire &lt;&lt; 1 mm). In order to decrease the computational effort required by the model, in many of the numerical studies, the birdcage coil is simplified with respect to its actual structure. In some investigations (112, 113), the birdcage coil is modeled removing all the lumped elements: the capacitors are replaced by current generators, with sinusoidal time behavior (i.e., at the frequency of 64 or 128 MHz) and a phase delay equal to the azimuthal angle in order to obtain circular polarization. In this case, the resonance mode is no longer achieved by tuning the capacitors, but by forcing the right current distribution inside the birdcage coil. This model is able to faithfully reproduce the electromagnetic field distribution of an unloaded birdcage coil, but, when adopted to simulate the interaction with an implanted device in the body, it becomes much less accurate, in particular when the implant is placed immediately underneath the skin (e.g., an implanted infusion pump), close to the transmit RF coil.</para>
    <para>As already highlighted in the previous section, FDTD and related methods remain dominant in numerical field calculations that consider realistic human body models. However, it is not the ideal method in all situations, such as when dealing with fields near highly conductive surfaces in any arbitrary orientation, as with most RF coils. Generally, FDTD and related methods rely on a Cartesian grid (with regular or irregular grid spacing), so surfaces at oblique angles are represented in a 'staircase' fashion. Although there are some algorithms to help reduce the shortcomings of FDTD-type methods in these situations, other approaches include development of human body models for finite element methods (114) and hybrid approaches using one numerical method in regions containing the RF coils, and another in the region containing the human body are often adopted (115).</para>
    <para>Modeling has also been applied to investigate the interactions between implants and the time-varying gradient magnetic fields. The gradient coils of an MR system generate time varying magnetic fields with a frequency in the kHz range. These varying magnetic fields generate induced electric fields on implanted metallic devices during the MRI process that results in the appearance of eddy currents which can generate induced voltages on the electronics of active implanted medical devices. In the frequency range of gradient fields, capacitive and electromagnetic propagation can be neglected, thus, it is possible to treat bioelectric currents and voltages in living tissues as stationary. This is known as the quasi-static approximation. Under quasi-static assumptions, the stimulus amplitude and the resulting voltage, electric field and current density are all in a linear relationship. Therefore, it is sufficient to employ a steady-state solver, which greatly simplifies the computational costs of the analysis required.</para>
    <para>As for the static magnetic field, modeling and simulations were mainly adopted to address the problem of the disturbance of the static field owing to the presence of a metallic implant in the patient, resulting in imaging artifacts which may impact the diagnostic use of MRI, sometimes making it difficult or even impossible to interpret the images. To consider the implementation of correction techniques or magnetic susceptibility artifacts attenuation, it is essential to be able to calculate very accurately the disturbance of the local magnetic field generated by the implanted metallic object placed in MRI conditions. For this purpose, analytical models may be useful tools to perform design and optimization studies on metallic objects with simple geometries (116). For more complex geometries, however, an accurate computation of the local magnetic field is needed, using numerical</para>

          <title>The Model of the Human Body</title>
    <para>The success of computational modeling is due to the possibility of performing systematic analyses of the several variables affecting the interactions between the patient with a metallic implant and the MR system, with reduced costs and increased reproducibility compared to experimental measurements. If there are fundamental flaws or inaccuracies in the model that mask or modify the physics under examination, even if the simulation itself runs flawlessly, results might be erroneous and predictions based on that simulation will not accurately embody the intended aspects of the physical world. It is with this motivation in mind that developers of phantoms characterizing the human body and its corresponding physiological processes have continuously advanced the state-of-the-art and pursued ever more accurate representations of human anatomy at a variety of geometric scales.</para>
    <para>Many MRI simulations that evaluated the safety of implanted devices, in particular the early studies conducted when the computational resources were still limited to account for the detailed representation of the human tissues, adopted numerical models of the body that were derived from the physical phantoms used in experimental studies. Physical phantoms are typically made of solid materials, which are approximately equivalent to human tissues in terms of electromagnetic properties. They can be based on simplified designs or they can be anthropomorphic phantoms.</para>
    <para>Simplified phantoms have the advantage of being easily standardized. In the peer-reviewed literature, it is possible to find simplified phantoms made of different geometries such as: "oblong saline bath to simulate an endovascular intervention" (118), cylindrical phantom (119, 120), or spherical phantom (121). Because of their simplicity, simplified physical phantoms were also standardized. In the context of MRI exposures, the standardized phantom to assess MRI-related heating for a metallic implant is the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International phantom. In the first version of the standard, the phantom had a shape based on simplified human head and trunk regions (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3a</emphasis>). In the 2011 edition of the standard (122), the phantom was revised to include only the trunk, suggesting a rectangular box shape (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3b</emphasis>). The ASTM phantom of the standard is a container filled with a gelled-saline phantom material with electrical and thermal properties in the same range of the ones of the human body at the frequencies of interest (i.e., 64 to 128 MHz corresponding to 1.5 and 3 Tesla, respectively).</para>
    <para>An additional phantom proposed for controlled exposure conditions is the ellipsoidal phantom, described in the Annex M-3 of the Technical Specification (TS), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ISO/TS 10974:2018 (123) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3c</emphasis>). In addition to simplified phantoms, anthropomorphic phantoms have been also implemented for a more realistic representation of the human body heterogeneity. These phantoms typically consist of several tissue-equivalent materials that are molded into shapes of organs or bones to represent single part or all of the human body. Among all, the bottle manikin absorption (BOMAB) phantom represents the ICRP reference man and it consists of 10 high-density polyethylene containers (124). Each of these phantoms are representative of body sections,</para>

    <para>Currently, several voxel and surface human body models are available for downloading free of charge for non-commercial use. Among these, the most often used solution adopted not only for electromagnetic exposure evaluations but also in many other medical applications where the detailed human anatomy has to be reproduced, is the Virtual Family (VF) (100).</para>
    <para>The VF is a set of four highly detailed, anatomically correct, whole-body models of an adult male, an adult female, and two children. The four models are based on high-resolution (MRI data of healthy volunteers. Organs and tissues of the models are represented by three-dimensional, highly detailed computer-aided design (CAD) objects without self-intersections and gaps. The CAD objects allow the models to be meshed at arbitrary resolutions without loss of small features. As of the end of 2014, the VF was used in more than 120 medical device submissions to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was cited more than 180 times in the peer-reviewed literature. The following two VF model versions are available free of charge:</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> summarizes the main characteristics of the four models of the VF.</para>
    <para>In the VF models, individual tissues are composed of large numbers of triangles, and the whole-body triangle count ranges between 3.6 to 7.7 million. The models are distributed as surface meshes in STL (i.e., Standard Tessellation Language or STereoLithography) format. Each tissue is stored as a separate surface mesh, which is guaranteed to be closed, but may contain non-manifold edges or vertices.</para>
    <para>In addition to the initial human body models, the VF has been then extended to increase the population coverage: the MR images of additional child volunteers (five and eight year old girls, and five and 14 year old boys) were segmented to create the Virtual Classroom. Increased coverage of anatomical variability was provided with obese (37 years old, 1.82 m, 120 kg) and elderly (84 years old, 1.73 m, 65 kg) male models, an eight week old baby model, and three pregnant women models at gestational stages of three, seven and nine months. Today, this widely used set of anatomical models is also known as the Virtual Population (ViP) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>The ViP 1.0 has been applied in a large variety of exposure studies, such as those involving mobile phones, wireless devices, MR systems, home appliances, and safety and efficacy assessments of medical treatments (e.g., hyperthermia therapy), implant safety,</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 4.</emphasis> Virtual Population voxel models (100, 101).</para>
  <para>product development and optimization, and basic research, including mechanistic investigations).</para>
    <para>However, while they have been employed in selected cases to the assessment of medical devices and therapies (e.g., the safety of implants during MRI), the first generation of the Virtual Population suffers from limitations related to limited local detail and accuracy, unsuitable tissue surface quality, missing fine structures and insufficient fine structure continuity, as well as inconsistent segmentation across the different models. Furthermore, current devices often combine complex interactions from multiple domains of physics and physiology sometimes in a coupled manner, which require models adapted to different solvers (e.g., a finite-element method, FEM), which typically requires high-quality unstructured meshes. In order to overcome these, a second generation of VF models (ViP3) was developed, reaching a level of detail and accuracy with more than 300 tissues and organs per model and a resolution of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm³ throughout the entire body. For these new-generation models, posing functionalities are available to parameterize the posture of the models. In addition, to further extend the population coverage, morphing functionality is also provided that allows, for example, the fat or muscle content to be increased or decreased to change the body-mass index (BMI) of the models while preserving realistic internal organ placement and tissue distributions.</para>
    <para>The Virtual Population 3.0 models are integrated within the multiphysics simulation platform, Sim4Life, which includes only a time domain electromagnetic solver, or the SEMCAD time domain electromagnetic solver. The Virtual Population 3.0 models cannot be exported to any third-party software. The Virtual Family v1.x models are also compatible with Sim4Life or SEMCAD time domain electromagnetic solvers, or can be exported to other solvers only in voxel format, which is not suitable for import into solvers based on unstructured meshes.</para>
    <para>Recent literature includes reports of the development of surface-based models obtained from the conversion of voxel-based data, and then used for electromagnetic simulation with solvers that need unstructured meshes (e.g., FEM), which could be more efficient in modeling in the frequency domain than other elements of the complete model, that is, the transmit RF coil and the implant. However, converting to high-quality, surface-based objects and correctly matching contact regions is not trivial and presents a significant challenge. Thus, only a few surface-based, full-body human models are available today, providing levels of detail of different human tissues that are not always adequate to be used as a realistic human model in MRI simulations for the assessment of the safety of implanted leads. However, these models have the advantage that can be obtained from the voxel models derived from the Visual Human Project Visible Man and Visible Woman data sets, which have formed the basis for a large number of MRI safety assessments (126). For inter-laboratory studies, in general, it is beneficial to use voxel- and surface-based models derived from the same dataset.</para>
    <para>The anatomic accuracy of the human body model is not the only key element that guarantees the success of a numerical analysis. Depending on the physics to be applied in the simulation, the parameters of interest (e.g., electric and magnetic conductivity, permittivity and permeability for electromagnetic simulations, or thermal conductivity, heat generation</para>
    <para>rate, heat transfer rate or perfusion, and heat capacity for thermal simulations) must be assigned to the different tissues. Such parameters can be derived from the studies available in literature that specifically investigated the properties of human tissues in the different frequency ranges (127) or from the databases available on-line (128) that, based on a comprehensive review of the aforementioned scientific papers, provide the modeling community with average and range-of-variation values of electromagnetic and thermal properties, as well as density and perfusion of biological tissues, as a function of the frequency of interest.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The Model of the Implant</emphasis>The model of the lead represents the most critical aspect for MRI simulations that evaluates the safety of this implant. As such, it needs, at a minimum, a sub-millimeter discretization inside the comparatively large volume of the transmit body RF coil of the MR system and must account for a vast selection of realistic implant positions in numerous human body models in order to perform a statistical basis for a prediction of the expected worst-case condition. In addition, the inner structure of the lead is often difficult to be known in sufficient detail because each device manufacturer may adopt proprietary solutions that are rarely accessible by the general public. For these reasons, many MRI simulations directed toward comparing different exposure conditions (e.g., in terms of implant positioning inside the human body, the level of RF energy applied during MRI, the position of the body inside the transmit RF coil, etc.) or different implant basic characteristics (e.g., lead length, thickness of the insulation sheet, etc.), adopted as the implant model a simple insulated metallic wire with exposed conductive tips. It is obvious that such a simplified model does not produce realistic results and, thus, is not suitable to predict what can be expected during a "real" MRI examination involving a patient with actual implanted leads.</para>
    <para>Typical leads used in implanted devices (e.g., cardiac pacemakers, implanted cardioverter defibrillators, neurostimulation systems, etc.) use coiled wire configurations. The coiling of the wire is essentially utilized to increase the flexibility and implanted lifetime of the lead. Coiled wires used in such devices may be single filar (single strand of wire) or have multi-filar windings (i.e., there may be more than one conductive strand coiled together to form the wire form). Such complex structures, arranged over realistic pathways compatible with the anatomy of the human body cannot be easily represented in the FDTD environment. Other techniques, such as the MoM, are more favorable, but then suffer from the already mentioned limitations, when the model of the implant has to be integrated inside an accurate model of the human body.</para>
    <para>Studies that reproduced and investigated lead structures more complex than the simple insulated wire mainly focused on developing and comparing the performance of implanted lead designs or strategies that could eliminate or ameliorate the hazards related to MRI (129, 130). Whereas these studies achieved a substantial significance with respect to the design of the MR Conditional implants, they were not suitable for adoption as an accurate implant model in the complete model of interactions between the MR scanner and the patient. The difficulties to numerically solve human and lead models simultaneously due to the complex structure of implanted lead systems prompted the researchers to find an alternative approach,</para>
    <para>based on the concept that it may be advantageous to model the lead and the human separately and then combine the results to determine the heating.</para>
    <para>In 2007 Park, et al. (131), introduced the concept the transfer function (TF) of a lead, that is a mathematical function that relates the incident electric field to the scattered electric field in the vicinity of the electrode. From knowledge of the TF, the heating at the lead's electrode and the resonant behavior of leads in phantom and human models can be predicted.</para>
    <para>The TF concept comes directly from the formulation of the electromagnetic problem by the Method of Moments (MoM): the scattered field at the lead tip is considered to be the linear superposition of the effect of the tangential incident field all along the lead. Different methodologies have been proposed to measure the TF of an implanted lead.</para>
    <para>Park, et al. (131) calculated the transfer function for simple wire geometries that simulated implanted leads using the MoM technique. First, the scattered electric field at a test point near the lead tip arising from a uniform incident electric field of 1 V/m was computed. Then, the radial component of scattered electric field at the same test point, P, was calculated for a step function of the tangential E-field that has unit value (1 V/m) over a specific segment of the lead and is zero over the remainder of the lead. The TF is finally obtained from these two contribute to the scattered electric field, considering the power dissipation around the lead tip as the linear superposition of the contribute obtained by the moving the step function of the tangential E-field all along the lead length.</para>
    <para>By definition, the FT depends on the electrical properties of the surrounding tissue, the RF frequency, and on the structure and characteristics of the lead under test. Therefore, it is assumed to be independent from the particular lead path adopted. Thus, the electric field at the tip of the lead, placed in any possible configuration inside the human body model, can be easily estimated from the E-field distribution computed inside the body without the implant.</para>
    <para>Even if such an approach allows the ability to "decouple" the model of the implanted lead and of the human body, the estimation of the TF obtained from numerical calculations is still rather demanding, since the actual detailed model of the lead has to be known and reproduced. The TF can be calculated also via experimental measurements, by exciting a small portion of the lead with an electric field that needs to be constant over the small section measured and then drastically reduced to zero in the nearby sections. The TF is then obtained by recording the E-field at the tip, while moving the excitation signal all along the lead. However, the generation of such an excitation signal is not immediate and requires specific and rather expensive systems (131, 132).</para>
    <para>Due to the aforementioned limitations, alternative methods have been proposed in the peer-reviewed literature (133, 134). An interesting alternative approach is based on the reciprocity principle conjugated with the Huygens' principle (i.e., this principal shows how a wave field on a surface determines the wave field outside the surface) and demonstrates that, if one excites the electrode where the heating has to be evaluated, the current distribution along the lead is actually the transfer function. Thus, the current distribution can be obtained numerically, by exciting the lead with a known current source at the tip, or exper-</para>
    <para>imentally, by injecting an RF signal (64 MHz or 128 MHz corresponding to 1.5 Tesla or 3 Tesla, respectively) into the lead and measuring the current along the lead itself. In the latter case, in order to obtain from the resulting current distribution a transfer function for the heating evaluation, a calibration factor has to be determined experimentally, by performing heating measurements under a known incident electric field.</para>
    <para>Currently, the TF is widely adopted, not only for research purposes, but also by device manufacturers, in the design phase to test the safety of their products, and to produce evidence of the safety for the regulatory body in charge of issuing the marketing authorization. The TF is also described as one of the four-tiered approaches described in the Technical Standard (TS) from the International Organization for Standards, ISO/TS 10974:2018 (123), which will be discussed in detail in one of the following sections.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Model Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification</emphasis></para>
    <para>Although performing a numerical analysis has numerous benefits, experimental validation of the numerical model remains a complementary and fundamental step to determine the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended use of the model. Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) is a complex set of procedures for the assessment of the overall quality of the physical system results that are obtained with numerical simulations. The process of determining the accuracy with which a computational model can produce results deliverable by the physical system on which it is based is a development process that follows several steps.</para>
    <para>The flowchart presented in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis> from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) guide on Standard for Verification and Validation in Computational Solid Mechanics (135) is a good outline of all the necessary steps that are required in the VVUQ process. The VVUQ can be essentially divided into three fundamental steps: (1) the verification of the numerical code implemented (2) the validation of the numerical results with experimental measurements, and (3) the quantification of the uncertainty of both numerical and experimental results. In accordance with this guidance from the ASME, these steps can be defined as:</para>

      <listitem><para>Uncertainty Quantification: The estimated amount or percentage by which an observed or calculated value may differ from the true value.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Ultimately, the numerical outcomes can be considered a good representation of the reality if the data are within the combined uncertainty of the numerical and experimental results. However, it is important to understand that a numerical code can never be fully verified for any conditions, but every code is verified against a set of numerical tests for the specific physical system of interest.</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides unparalleled soft tissue resolution utilizing multiple pulse sequences, each optimized for the evaluation of particular tissue attributes. Therefore, MRI is the modality of choice for visualizing numerous soft tissue conditions including various neurologic, musculoskeletal, thoracic, and abdominal abnormalities. Additionally, due to the absence of ionizing radiation, MRI is optimal for sequential imaging for disease follow-up and surveillance as well as diagnostic imaging in children and women of childbearing age. In parallel to an increase in the use of MRI, the number of patients with permanent cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) continues to increase. As such, it is inevitable that healthcare providers will face the need to perform MRI in an implantable cardiac device recipient. The safety of using MRI in patients</para>

    <para>The electromagnetic fields used with MRI are associated with several potential risks involving CIEDs. Therefore, prior to performing clinical studies of MRI in the setting of implanted cardiac devices, our group and others performed extensive in vitro and in vivo laboratory and animal studies to understand the extent of these interactions.</para>

          <title>Magnetic Field Interactions: Force and Torque</title>
    <para>Ferromagnetic materials in or near the MR system are exposed to a powerful static magnetic field involving induced force (i.e., translational attraction) and torque. Therefore, a common concern among practitioners is the potential for movement of device components relative to the scanner. However, current designs contain little or no ferromagnetic materials and, thus, are unlikely to experience force and torque (1). Although the amount of ferromagnetic materials in CIED pulse generators has substantially decreased over time and is relatively minor for modern-day systems, some ferromagnetic components remain vital to device function. The potential for movement of a pacemaker or ICD pulse generator in the MRI setting depends upon the field strength of the static magnetic field, ferromagnetic components of the device, how it is retained in place, in situ), and the distance from the MR system (2). The maximal force acting upon modern permanent pacemakers (manufactured after 1996) and ICDs (manufactured after 2000) appears to be less than 0.98-Newtons (equivalent to 100-grams) in association with a 1.5-Tesla MR scanner. The maximum torque in our studies was not found to be substantial and, thus, is unlikely to dislodge a chronically implanted device that is anchored to the surrounding tissue (3). These results are consistent with those of Luechinger, et al. (4) regarding modern pacemakers. However, Luechinger, et al. reported that some modern-day ICDs may still pose possible problems due to strong magnetic field interactions (4).</para>

          <title>Current Induction</title>
    <para>Current may be induced within wires that are present in patients undergoing MRI examinations. Therefore, the radiofrequency (RF) and time-varying gradient magnetic fields of the MR system may induce electrical currents in leads in association with an MRI exam. However, this is a possibility only if the lead is part of a current loop that is completed through the body (i.e., the pulse generator must complete the current path). For cardiac pacemakers, this condition is only satisfied during specific time points within the pacing cycle. Present-day designs have been developed to overcome this issue. The ratio of lead length versus the RF wavelength and lead configurations, such as loops of a certain diameter, are strongly associated with the extent of current induction (5-7).</para>

    <para>We assessed the magnitude of MRI-induced current using a current recorder connected in series to single chamber permanent pacemakers programmed to sub-threshold asynchronous output during unipolar and bipolar pacing (8). Under conventional implant conditions (i.e., without additional lead loops), the magnitude of induced current was less than 0.5-milliampere (mA). Current induction at greater than 30-mA resulting in myocardial capture was possible with the addition of more than four lead loops that substantially increased the total circuit area. However, the presence of so many lead loops is never observed in the clinical setting (8). Bassen and Mendoza (9) have also investigated the possibility of current induction in association with MRI and reported that unintended stimulation may occur in the setting of abandoned leads as well as leads connected to a pulse generator with loss of the hermetic seal at the connector. Additionally, Bassen and Mendoza (9) noted that pacemaker-dependent patients could receive altered pacing pulses during MRI examinations.</para>

            <title>MRI-Related Heating</title>
    <para>Another potential MRI-related interaction with CIEDs is the possibility of heating and tissue damage where the lead tip contacts tissue. Metallic devices and leads can act as antennae, thus, amplifying local RF energy power deposition (10-12). In our studies utilizing clinical MRI protocols with whole body averaged, specific absorption rates (SAR) &lt; 2.0 W/kg, temperature changes were limited to 1.0 °C in an in vitro model and to 0.2 °C in an in vivo model (3). However, it is important to note that due to poor correlation of heating profiles at different SARs associated with different pulse sequences across different scanner platforms, even for the same manufacturer, the reported SAR limits from one given study should not be directly applied to other MR systems. Fractured leads or lead loop configurations of a certain diameter may increase the potential for heating even further. The extent of heating also varies as a function of lead length and configuration, proximity to the edge of the gradient coils, proximity to the transmit RF coil, lead insulation thickness, lead design, and other factors (9-17).</para>

            <title>Electromagnetic Interference and Other Issues</title>
    <para>CIEDs may deliver unintended therapies or fail to provide necessary therapies in patients undergoing MRI. Cardiac pacemakers and ICDs have the potential to receive electromagnetic interference (EMI) during MRI, resulting in radiofrequency noise tracking, asynchronous pacing, inhibition of demand pacing, delivery of unintentional ICD therapies, programming changes, or loss of function. The static magnetic field of the MR system can also alter device function by inducing unexpected reed switch opening or closure. Additionally, temporary programming changes made to avoid device interaction with the scanner (such as disabling of tachycardia therapies) may lead to catastrophic results if a spontaneous arrhythmia occurs and is not recognized.</para>
    <para>We implanted modern ICD systems (manufactured after 2000) from the three major manufacturers in the United States (U.S.) in 18 dogs, and after four weeks, performed 3- to 4-hour MRI examinations under worst-case scenario conditions (i.e., imaging over the region containing the pulse generator and using whole body averaged SARs that were greater than 3.5-W/kg) (3). No device dysfunction occurred. After eight weeks of follow up, pacing thresholds and intracardiac electrocardiogram amplitudes were unchanged, with the exception of one animal that experienced transient (less than 12 hours) capture failure. Due to</para>
    <para>this observation, we initially did not perform MRI exams on pacemaker-dependent ICD patients. ICD leads are generally longer than pacemaker leads and, thus, may be more prone to possible heating at the lead tip. Pathological data of the scanned animals revealed very limited necrosis or fibrosis in the area around the tip of the lead, which was not different from controls that were not subjected to MRI (3). Similarly, Luechinger, et al. (17) found no clear evidence of heat-induced damage on histology despite observing lead parameter changes in their <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> model. Recently, we relaxed the restriction on scanning pacemaker-dependent, ICD patients at our institution because of our experience with non-clinical scanning parameters that were used that did not result in problems, the lack of any histologic changes that were due to any potential heating, and observing no changes in pacing parameters in hundreds of patients with ICDs that underwent clinical MRI exams.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="italics">Implantable Cardiac Monitors and Loop Recorders</emphasis></para>
    <para>Implantable cardiac monitors and loop recorders have been evaluated for MRI-related issues. Gimbel, et al. (18) demonstrated the safety of MRI in the setting of implantable loop recorders in ten patients that underwent eleven examinations. No abnormalities were observed. Sensations of tugging or warmth at the implant site were not reported. We have also performed thoracic and non-thoracic MRI examinations on numerous implantable loop recorder recipients with similar findings of safety. Patients with implantable loop recorders can be safely scanned under specific conditions. However, the device may record MRI-related electromagnetic interference artifacts as an arrhythmia. Therefore, care should be taken to clear episodes recorded during MRI to prevent future misinterpretation of such artifacts as clinically significant arrhythmias. The Reveal implantable cardiac monitor (Medtronic, www.medtronic.com) was the first such device to receive MR Conditional labeling from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (19). Other similar devices from Medtronic as well as from other companies now have labeling stating that these systems are also MR Conditional (see the manufacturer's website or www.MRIsafety.com for specific information pertaining to MRI labeling for implantable cardiac monitors and loop recorders).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Temporary Cardiac Pacemakers</emphasis></para>
    <para>Temporary cardiac pacemakers (implanted outside of the electrophysiology laboratory) have leads that are longer and are potentially more susceptible to induction of lead currents and heating. An <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> study of temporary transvenous pacing leads showed that lead-tip heating that exceeds 15° C is common and temperature rises up to 63.1° C are possible based on laboratory evidence (20). Additionally, the electronic platform of external temporary pacemakers is less sophisticated and has less filtering compared to modern permanent cardiac pacemakers. Therefore, such devices tend to be more susceptible to EMI during MRI procedures and, therefore, imaging of patients with temporary pacemakers is inadvisable. However, we have safely performed MRI in the setting of temporary cardiac pacing utilizing an active fixation, permanent lead, an externalized permanent pacemaker in contact with the patient's skin, and a non-conductive covering adhered to the patient's body with a pressure dressing.</para>

At our institution, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, we began the process of performing MRI on patients with permanent pacemakers based on findings from our <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> studies, which led to the development of a protocol including (a) device selection based on previous testing, (b) device programming to minimize inappropriate activation or inhibition of brady/tachyarrhythmia therapies, and (c) limitation of the whole body averaged SAR for the applied pulse sequences (less than 2.0-W/Kg) (21). The protocol is discussed in detail below. Using this protocol, we have now safely performed MRI on greater than 4,000 patients with implantable cardiac devices. Our latest report of safety included 880 patients with permanent cardiac pacemakers, 125 of whom were pacemaker-dependent (22). Pacing mode was changed to an asynchronous mode for pacemaker-dependent patients, and to demand mode for others. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry, and symptoms were monitored. The primary clinically significant event attributable to MRI was the occurrence of power-on-reset events in up to 1.5% of device recipients. Aside from transient episodes of asynchronous pacing induced by reed switch activation in certain pacemakers, no episodes of inappropriate inhibition or activation of pacing were observed. Statistically, both right ventricular and atrial sensing and right and left ventricular lead impedances were reduced immediately after MRI. At long-term follow-up, decreased right ventricular sensing, decreased right ventricular lead impedance, increased right ventricular capture threshold, and decreased battery voltage were noted. The observed changes did not require device revision or reprogramming and there were no significant differences between baseline and immediate or long-term sensing amplitudes, lead impedances, or pacing thresholds (22).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Retained Pacing Leads</emphasis>Retained (capped and/or cut, and abandoned) leads are susceptible to the previously described risks of heating and current induction. Depending upon the lead length and configuration, retained segments may be prone to significantly higher temperature rises than those attached to pulse generators (14). We have performed at least 40 MRI examinations in the setting of absolute clinical necessity and retained cardiac lead segments. All of these studies were completed without safety issues. To further investigate the risks of cardiac MRI on patients with abandoned leads, Golestanirad, et al. (30) used electromagnetic simulations and bio-heat modeling utilizing numerical models of retained cardiac leads built using CT and X-ray images from six patients with retained cardiac leads. These simulations were performed considering the use of a transmit/receive RF body and transmit/receive head RF coils operating at 64 MHz and 128 MHz. Nine different imaging landmarks from the head to the lower limbs were studied. Their findings suggested that the amount of heating appeared to increase both with the field strength and frequency of the MR system (1.5 T/64 MHz versus 3.0 T/128 MHz) and with pulse sequence duration. However, all scans led to lead heating that did not exceed 6° C in all simulated models, which was considered to be clinically insignificant (30). Despite these interesting findings, clinical experience remains limited and, thus, additional investigations on this topic are warranted to accurately delineate the risks and benefits of using MRI in patients with abandoned pacing leads.</para>
    <para>In 2021, Schaller, et al. (63) investigated the effect of MRI in 139 patients with CIEDs who also had abandoned leads (total, 243 leads). The findings indicated that there were no abnormal vital signs or sustained tachyarrhythmias in this patient group. Furthermore, there were no changes in battery voltage, power-on reset events, or changes of pacing rate. One patient with an abandoned subcutaneous array experienced sternal heating that subsided on premature cessation of the study. The investigators concluded that the risk of performing MRI in patients with abandoned CIED leads was low in their large observational study, including patients who underwent examinations involving the thorax (63). Thus, the growing aggregate of data challenge the absolute contraindication for performing MRI in patients with abandoned CIED leads.</para>

        <title>Our Institutional Safety Protocol for MRI of Patients with CIEDs</title>
    <para>With regard to performing MRI examinations in patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs, the safety protocol followed at our institution is based on selection of device pulse generators previously tested under worst-case scenario (e.g., prolonged imaging over the region containing the device using whole body averaged SAR levels greater than 3.5-W/kg) MRI conditions (3). This protocol is summarized as a checklist in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>To perform MRI on patients with CIEDs, we recommend that patients with device pulse generators prone to EMI (generally devices manufactured prior to 2000) be excluded. Reports of safe MRI immediately post-implantation exist in the literature (31), and the risk for lead and/or pulse generator movement is considered to be extremely low or nonexistent. However, we recommend conservative measures to exclude patients with leads that are susceptible to spontaneous (regardless of MRI) dislodgement or that do not have chronic stable lead parameters that would allow careful measurement of safety. Therefore, we advise avoiding MRI in patients with less than six weeks of time since the devices were implanted and those with acute parameter changes suggestive of lead malfunctions. In our experience, however, patients with mature active and passive fixation endocardial (and coronary sinus) leads of any diameter can safely undergo MRI exams. We recommend avoiding MRI when</para>

    <para>device leads are present that are prone to heating, such as non-transvenous, epicardial and abandoned (capped) leads. We do, however, relax these restrictions if there is a compelling clinical need for the MRI exam, but require a higher level of monitoring. To reduce the risk of inappropriate inhibition of pacing due to detection of radiofrequency pulses, we program devices to an asynchronous, dedicated pacing mode in pacemaker-dependent patients.</para>
    <para>To avoid inappropriate activation of pacing due to tracking of radiofrequency pulses, we suggest device programming in patients without pacemaker dependence to a non-tracking ventricular or dual chamber inhibited pacing mode. We also recommend deactivation of rate response, premature ventricular contraction response, ventricular sense response, and conducted atrial fibrillation response to ensure that sensing of vibrations or radiofrequency pulses does not lead to unwarranted pacing.</para>
    <para>Although asynchronous pacing for short time periods is typically well tolerated, we prefer to reduce the already minimal chance of inducing arrhythmia or causing atrioventricular (AV) dyssynchrony by minimizing asynchronous pacing in patients without pacemaker dependence through deactivation of the magnet mode when possible. We typically deactivate tachyarrhythmia monitoring to avoid battery drainage that results from recording of multiple MRI-related, radiofrequency pulse sequences as arrhythmic episodes. Reed switch activation in ICD systems disables tachyarrhythmia therapies. However, reed switch function in the periphery of the scanner versus the bore of the MR system is unpredictable (21, 32, 33). Therefore, therapies should be disabled to avoid unwarranted anti-tachycardia pacing or shocks. Finally, blood pressure, ECG, pulse oximetry, and symptoms should be monitored in the patient for the duration of the MRI exam. We also favor the presence of a radiologist and cardiac electrophysiologist, or advanced cardiac life support (ACLS)-trained individual familiar with device programming and troubleshooting during all MRI examinations (21, 25, 34). At the end of the MRI procedure, all device parameters should be checked and programming should be restored to pre-MRI settings.</para>

        <title>MRI-Related Susceptibility Artifacts in the Setting of Cardiac Pacemakers and ICD Systems</title>
    <para>The quality of the MR image is not affected when the pacemaker or ICD is located outside the field of view or the area of interest. However, when performing thoracic imaging, the presence of a pacemaker or ICD can cause variations in the surrounding (i.e., local) magnetic field and other issues that result in issues including signal voids, bright areas, image distortion, or poor fat suppression. Typically, the artifacts associated with pacing and ICD leads are minimal in size. However, pulse generator-related artifacts, particularly with ICD systems, can be substantial (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>) (35, 36). Such artifacts tend to be most pronounced on partial flip angle pulse sequences as well as others (e.g., inversion recovery and steady state sequences). Greater than 50% of cardiac sectors (primarily antero-apical segments) can be affected by pulse generator-related susceptibility artifacts in patients with left-sided ICD systems (37). Artifacts on inversion recovery images show high signal intensity and can mimic areas of delayed-enhancement, which would otherwise indicate myocardial scar. Correlation of artifact-related bright areas on different pulse sequences can help avoid misidentification of the artifact as pathology. Artifacts related to metal can be considerably reduced by using wideband pulse sequences (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>) (35-37), even in pa-</para>

In addition, selecting imaging planes perpendicular to the plane of the device's pulse generator, shortening the echo time, and using spin echo and fast spin echo pulse sequences reduces the qualitative extent of the artifact (Figure 3). Using such techniques, images of sufficient quality to address diagnostic questions, as well as to guide therapeutic procedures, can be obtained in the majority of cases.</para>

    <para>and capture threshold were evaluated before and immediately after (i.e., within 10 minutes) completion of each MRI examination. There were some small, non-clinically significant changes in device parameters immediately after the MRI exams. However, there was no evidence of an association between MRI parameters that characterize patient exposure to radiofrequency energy and changes in device and lead parameters immediately after MRI. Importantly, the investigators indicated that cardiac device interrogation before and after MRI remains mandatory due to the potential for device reset and changes in lead or pulse generator parameters (38).</para>

        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <para>MRI is the preferred imaging modality in many clinical scenarios. The decision to perform an MRI exam on a patient with a legacy cardiac pacemaker or ICD system is frequently made by considering the probable benefit of MRI relative to the potential risks. Therefore, it is important to conduct a systematic review of the patient's condition as well as the specific cardiac device that is present prior to proceeding with MRI. Notably, peer-reviewed literature involving patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs continue to support the safe use of MRI (64, 65). As such, besides staying apprised of recently published information, the reader is encouraged to consult other resources such as the American Heart Association Scientific Statement (40), the practice guidelines from the American College of Radiology (66) and the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (67), and websites (e.g., www.MRIsafety.com and CIED manufacturers' websites) that provide specific information regarding individual devices. Although there is a growing body of literature on safety of MRI for patients with CIEDs, it is critical that there is real-time monitoring of all patients undergoing MRI with CIEDs because the possibility of an adverse event, while very small, is still present.</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>The rapid technologic evolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to a broad spectrum of medical applications (1). In parallel, cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) technologies have been developed for arrhythmia diagnosis as well as treatment of bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, heart failure, and other conditions (2). The implementation of these two technologies has reached a crossroads, as increasingly, patients with CIEDs may require MRI exams, but are limited in performance by the presence of the cardiac device (3). The assessment of the potential interactions between CIEDs and the MRI</para>

    <para>environment are important to the current and future designs of CIEDs in order to increase accessibility to MRI technology. Because there are now non-MR Conditional as well as MR Conditional CIEDs, the decisions and management of patients with these devices depend on the specific system that is present.</para>

      <sect2 id="ch0025s0000s0002">
        <title>NON-MR CONDITIONAL CIEDS</title>
    <para>The study of MRI and CIED interactions stems from known theoretical physics concerns related to the ferromagnetic content of cardiac devices, the effects of time-varying, gradient magnetic fields, and the impact of radiofrequency (RF) energy on the structure and function of CIEDs. In the era prior to the development of MR Conditional CIEDs, these MRI-related issues were studied through multiple means including: <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> assessments, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> animal models, case reports, small retrospective series of patients inadvertently or intentionally exposed to the MRI environment, and prospective series of patients intentionally exposed to MRI procedures under specified conditions. Each of these lines of research provided data regarding MRI and CIED interactions but had inherent limitations. <emphasis role="italics">In vitro</emphasis> studies permit an assessment of the physics of MRI and CIED interactions but are limited because phantoms do not adequately reproduce the three-dimensional anatomy or physiology of the patient or <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> device function. Animal models also have limited applicability to human subjects. Rare case reports of inadvertently scanned CIED patients with associated mortality lacked complete information on the patients, specific circumstances of the studies and, importantly, the fact that physiologic monitoring was not used (1-3). Notably, retrospective studies of patients with preexisting CIEDs do not serve as a true surrogate for properly performed MRI safety investigations.</para>
    <para>Data from the pre-MR Conditional cardiac device era demonstrated that a small number of adverse events of variable clinical significance occurred in patients with CIEDs who underwent MRI (<emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>). In regard to permanent cardiac pacemakers, case series and prospective studies of patients intentionally exposed to MRI exams under specified conditions demonstrated various findings including: heating or discomfort at the implantable pulse generator (IPG) site (4), elevated cardiac biomarkers (5), MRI-related ectopy (4, 6-8), short pauses (9), asystole (10), pulse generator changed to the asynchronous mode due to activation of the reed switch (11), decreased battery voltage with subsequent recovery (12), clinically unimportant changes in sensing, pacing capture threshold, battery voltage, and lead impedance which did not require an increase in pacing output (13-20), significant change in the pacing threshold requiring an increase in programmed output (21), transient change to the elective replacement indicator (ERI) (22), ventricular lead impedance rise necessitating lead replacement (23), temporary, sensing errors and safety signal generation (24), pacing at maximum voltage at a fixed rate of 100-beats/minute (25), rapid pacing (26), communication failure (24, 27), power-on reset (4, 6, 17, 27-31), elective replacement indices reached after scanning (27), and other issues.</para>
    <para>With respect to implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), reports of patients inadvertently subjected to MRI have shown inappropriate sensing, battery voltage transient or sustained change to End-of-Life (EOL) (32), inability to communicate with the device (33), noise detected as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, with no therapy presumably due to magnetic mode activation and asynchronous pacing as a result of a change</para>

Case series and prospective study of patients intentionally exposed to the MRI examinations under specified conditions have demonstrated various findings including: MRI-related ectopy (7, 8), sensing errors (24), decreases in battery voltage, pacing threshold increases, changes in pacing and high-voltage lead impedance changes that were statistically significant but clinically unimportant (17, 18, 30, 31, 36), transient anomalous battery life indication (28), inability to communicate with a devices (30, 37) and power-on reset (17, 28, 29, 31, 38-40). In addition to issues related to performing MRI in patients with ICDs, investigators have raised the issue as to whether non-MR Conditional ICD defibrillation threshold testing should be performed after exposure to an MRI exam (41). This important matter warrants further study.</para>
    <para>Prospective studies and registries have also been performed to assess for adverse effects associated with MRI in patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs. In a large prospective study using MRI in patients with CIEDs, a total of 438 patients with cardiac devices (54% pacemakers and 46% ICDs) were enrolled between 2003 and 2010 (17). Of these patients, 53 (12%) had biventricular pacing systems. Patients with new devices (less than six weeks), abandoned or epicardial leads, and pacemaker-dependent ICD patients were excluded from the study. In addition, pacemaker-dependent, ICD patients were excluded. Of a total of 555 MRI examinations performed at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz, 18% of the scans were thoracic and 82% were non-thoracic. Although changes in right ventricular sensing, lead impedances, increased capture threshold and decreased battery voltage were noted at the six month follow</para>

    <para>up interval, the observed changes did not require device revision or reprogramming. In three (1.5%) of the patients, transient reversions to back-up programming mode were noted (i.e., power-on reset) without long-term sequelae.</para>
    <para>The MagnaSafe Registry was a prospective multicenter site registry of patients with non-MR Conditional pacemakers and ICDs that underwent clinically indicated, 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz non-thoracic scanning under specified conditions (30). Data was collected before, immediately after, and at 6 months following 1,000 MRI exams in patients with cardiac pacemakers (n=818) and 500 MRI exams in patients with ICDs (n=428) between April 2009 and April 2014. The results demonstrated no deaths, lead failures, or capture losses during non-thoracic MRI examinations. There were six cases of self-terminating atrial fibrillation or flutter, as well as six cases of partial electrical reset. There were no cases of full electrical reset. Of the pacemaker patients, 28% of the registry patients were pacemaker-dependent. Pacemaker-dependent ICD cases were excluded from the study. One ICD required replacement after it could not be interrogated following the MRI exam, however, this device had not been reprogrammed according to the study protocol beforehand. Sub-analysis suggested performing subsequent MRI exams for patients with implanted cardiac devices did not increase the risks of clinical events compared to patients who underwent a single scan.</para>
    <para>A large prospective study reported safety data on 2,103 MRI exams (multiple 1,509 patients included 880 patients with cardiac pacemakers, 466 with ICDs, and 163 with cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, CRT-D, devices studied at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz at various anatomical positions) (31). Of this cohort, nine studies resulted in transient reset to a backup mode (seven pacemaker and one ICD). In one MRI exam, a pacemaker with less than one month left of battery life reset to ventricular inhibited pacing and could not be reprogrammed.</para>
    <para>Non-significant, acute decrease in P-wave amplitude was present in 1% of cases. In the 63% of cases in which long-term data were available, decreased P-wave amplitude was present in 4% of patients, increased in right ventricular capture threshold in 4% of patients and increased left ventricular capture threshold in 3% of patients. These changes were not clinically significant and did not necessitate cardiac device reprogramming or revision. Of note is that there were no long-term clinically significant adverse events reported.</para>
    <para>Meta-analysis of data related to performance of MRI in patients with non-MR Conditional devices has also been reported. The largest meta-analysis to date reviewed data from 5,099 patients with non-MR Conditional devices that underwent 5,908 scans between 1990-2017 (40). Of this group, 551 patients were pacemaker-dependent. There were no reported patient deaths and three lead failures. There were no clinically relevant changes in lead, battery, or pulse generator performance.</para>

    <para>The initial body of data related to use of MRI in patients with CIEDs raised questions such as (1) whether patients with important clinical issues to be resolved and no other adequate imaging options had absolute contraindications to MRI, (2) whether scanning had been performed based on the risk:benefit ratio, or (3) would this require the engineering of cardiac devices with MR Conditional labeling status (45-56). The limitations inherent in investigating and scanning patients with previous era devices led to the development of CIEDs designed for the MRI setting under highly specified conditions. Notably, a variety of MR Conditional CIEDs from several different manufacturers (i.e., Abbott/St. Jude Medical, Biotronik, Boston Scientific, LivaNova/Sorin, and Medtronic) have been released for use in the clinical setting. Each commercially available device has specified device and programming requirements as well as MRI parameters and conditions defined in the labeling, approved by the specific regulatory agency of the country where the device has been clinically released.</para>

    <para>The precise use of nomenclature is extremely important to understanding and implementing technologies as it pertains to specific patient and scanning conditions in the MRI environment (57). The American Society for Testing Materials (ATSM) International designates implants and devices as being MR Safe, MR Conditional, or MR Unsafe (58). An MR Safe designated device would require nonmetallic, non-conducting materials and systems with no known hazards in all MRI environments. Thus, the engineering of an MR Safe designated pacemaker or ICD is not feasible. An MR Conditional designated device refers to an item that has been demonstrated to pose no known hazard in a specified MRI environment under defined conditions of use. These defined conditions may include the strength of the static magnetic field, spatial gradient magnetic field, time-varying, magnetic fields, RF fields (i.e., the specific absorption rate, SAR), and other factors. CIEDs designated as MR Conditional must be used in a specified MRI environment under defined programming parameters and with close attention to the patient specific clinical factors, such as the presence of abandoned or fractured leads. MR Conditional designs have sought to take into account both the theoretical and investigational concerns related to CIEDs and to create technological designs to minimize the possibility for interactions when implanted in patients undergoing MRI exams. Notably, the design and engineering of devices extends to all components including the implantable pulse generator, leads, and, programming software.</para>

        <title>ELECTROMAGNETIC-RELATED ISSUES</title>
    <para>Because MRI involves the use of static, gradient, and RF electromagnetic fields, these elements must be carefully considered because they can lead to substantial MRI/CIED interactions. Physical forces acting on ferromagnetic objects due to static and gradient magnetic fields can cause movement and/or vibration of these objects. Factors affecting these forces include the quantity and shape of the ferromagnetic content, proximity to the MR system's magnet, and the strength of the static magnetic field (59). Studies of non-MR Conditional and MR Conditional pacemakers at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz have not demonstrated significant clinical effects (60-62). Conduction of electromagnetic energy through the cardiac device can occur due to the time-varying, gradient magnetic fields and/or the pulsed RF energy, leading to heating or interference with sensing or pacing. This potential energy transfer is dependent on factors including: the features of the time-varying, gradient magnetic fields (e.g., the slew rate, etc.), the type of RF pulse used in the MRI sequences, the whole body averaged and local SARs, the spatial relationship and orientation of the CIED relative to the transmit RF coil, the composition, length, geometry, configuration and orientation of the lead(s), and other factorss (63-73).</para>

    <para>asynchronous pacing while in contact with the patient's skin overlying the IPG in order to avoid electromagnetic interactions with the use of electrocautery during surgical procedures (74). When present in the MR system, reed switch activity may be unpredictable, potentially varying with the orientation between the reed switch and direction of the magnetic field, as well as with the strength of the static magnetic field (3, 61, 75-77). One option is to replace the reed switch with a solid state, Hall sensor, which possesses a more predictable function in the presence of magnetic fields. Other design changes have been formulated such as a magnetic field detection sensor that prevents reed switch-related issues (78). Additional IPG design features include generator shielding and circuitry filters to inhibit or divert transference of particular electromagnetic frequencies. Importantly, IPGs used for ICDs tend to be larger and more complex than those used for cardiac pacemakers. The also have a greater ferromagnetic content, circuitry hardware related to arrhythmia detection and treatment, and capacitors for cardioversion and defibrillation (79-81). Therefore, MRI issues related to ICDs versus cardiac pacemakers tend to be more problematic. Device settings for an "MRI-mode" include pre-scan checklists, programming of pacing mode, disabling sensed activity, and inactivating tachycardia therapies during an MRI exam (42).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CIED LEADS</emphasis>Pacemaker and ICD leads are composed of non-magnetic materials (e.g., platinum and iridium). With regard to MRI issues, leads may serve as antennas conducting electromagnetic energy impulses (26, 82). The effects of this energy transfer could potentially include pain, myocardial stimulation, heating with myocardial necrosis at the lead tip, and damage to the IPG. Adverse effects potentially include inappropriate sensing, increases in pacing threshold, and lead impedance changes. These factors could lead to inappropriate pacing function with associated bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias, as well as battery depletion (3, 7, 12, 14-16, 21, 22, 24-26, 83-89). These effects can be due to the transference of MRI-related electromagnetic energies at the resonant frequency of the lead. Importantly, a resonant lead length can be associated with a greater heating effect (90). Therefore, a focus of lead design and engineering is to avoid the resonant frequencies of the electromagnetic sources associated with MR systems through consideration of factors such a lead length, configuration, and morphology. In regard to heating, lead length, lead coiling, and the position of the lead in relation to the transmit RF coil can affect MRI-related heating (65, 69, 91, 92).</para>
    <para>In a large prospective study assessing the relationship between SAR and non-MR Conditional CIED function, a longer right ventricular lead length was association with decreased right ventricular sensing and capture threshold immediately after MRI (93). Lead wire coiling in a three-dimensional orientation is an important factor in transference or avoidance of the resonant frequency of electromagnetic energy (94). Decreasing the number of coiled filars, increasing the diameter of the filars and subsequent increases in the winding turns of the coils has resulted in a three-dimensional morphology for the lead that limits the conduction of MRI relevant frequencies in one design, while maintaining the strength of the lead (95). Furthermore, the use of a lead tip coating has decreased polarization.

Small, predominantly retrospective studies in patients with abandoned leads have not demonstrated adverse effects (Table 2) (98-101). Considering the differences between <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> data, there is now controversy regarding how to proceed with MRI scans in patients with abandoned pacing leads.

    <para>The design of an MR Conditional device requires clearly demarcated MR Conditional programming modes for the time period when the patient undergoes MR imaging (42). If MRI is performed in patients with non-MR Conditional devices, specific decisions for programming must also be made (42). Programming of pacing in a sensing mode can lead to inappropriate inhibition of pacing due to lead noise caused by electromagnetic interference due to operation of the MR system (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>). Programming decisions require knowledge of the patients underlying sinus rate, atrial-ventricular (AV) nodal conduction, ventricular rate and presence rate, and location of escape rhythms (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 2 and 3</emphasis>).

One device programmed to asynchronous A and V pacing (DOO) converted to ERI during the scan and automatically reprogrammed to V only antibradycardia pacing (VVI) mode without any significant consequence. Another device close to ERI experienced an unintended mode change from DOO to VVI without any patient harm. Both devices were implanted before 2005. At the present time, most patients undergoing MRI will likely have newer generations of MR Conditional systems, which are less likely to have power-on reset events.

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been utilized in the clinical setting for more than 35 years. During this time, the technology has continued to evolve to improve image quality, acquisition time, and patient comfort. These changes resulted in MR systems with more powerful static magnetic fields, faster and stronger time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and improved radiofrequency (RF) transmission coils. The short-term exposures to the electromagnetic fields used for MRI at the levels recommended in the governing MRI standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 60601-2-33 and by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration have resulted in relatively few problems for the hundreds of millions of MRI examinations performed to date (1-7). MRI-related injuries and the few fatalities that have occurred in patients without and with implants have been mostly due to not following recommended user guidelines related to the safety aspects of the MR scanners and medical implants.</para>

    <para>Accordingly, the preservation of a safe MRI environment requires the utmost vigilance with respect to the management of patients with implants and devices because the variety and complexity of these items constantly changes (3, 6-9). This is particularly important when managing patients with active implantable medical devices (AIMDs) because of the elaborate nature of these implants (3, 6, 9). In consideration of the above, this chapter discusses MRI safety issues for neuromodulation systems, which are widely used and clinically important AIMDs.</para>

          <title>WHAT IS NEUROMODULATION?</title>
    <para>Neuromodulation utilizes a medical device to relieve symptoms through alteration or modulation of nerve system function via the targeted delivery of a stimulus, such as electrical stimulation or a chemical agent, to a specific neurological site in the body (7-12). Neuromodulation therapies have been available since the 1960s and are an essential tool for healthcare professionals. The field of neuromodulation encompasses a wide range of therapeutic applications from chronic pain to neurological conditions, such as epilepsy, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease, with the goal of supporting the recovery of abilities such as hearing, vision, and mobility, as well as the control of bladder or bowel function (7-12). In many instances, neuromodulation therapies improve the lives of patients because they provide an alternative to long-term drug therapy for the symptomatic relief of persistent or chronic conditions, which is especially important when existing medications are ineffective or become problematic for chronic use due to development of tolerance, addiction, adverse side-effects, or toxicity (10).</para>
    <para>Technological advances in neuroscience combined with neuromodulation systems that were miniaturized to feasibly permit implantation contributed to the exponential growth of neuromodulation applications, including those used for deep brain stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, sacral nerve stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, as well as the administration of drugs for pain management (7-12). Notably, neuromodulation systems are the fastest growing segment of the overall medical device industry.</para>

    <para>Static magnetic field-related issues are known to present hazards to patients with certain implants or devices primarily due to movement or dislodgment of objects made from ferromagnetic materials (3-9, 12, 13). Thus, neuromodulation systems with ferromagnetic materials, which are usually related to the power supply in the implantable pulse generator (IPG), will be attracted to (i.e., force) and aligned (i.e., torque) with the strong static magnetic field of the MR system (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>). This movement could result in patient injury (e.g., torn sutures, internal bleeding, etc.) or require surgical revision to reposition the device (i.e., to restore therapy or for patient comfort). Exposure to the scanner's powerful static magnetic field may also alter the neuromodulation system's settings, requiring reprogramming, or permanently damage the device, necessitating replacement surgery (8, 9).</para>

    <para>Numerous studies have assessed magnetic field interactions for implants and devices by measuring translational attraction and torque associated with the static magnetic fields of MR systems (3, 6). These investigations demonstrated that, for certain items, MRI exams may be performed safely if the items are nonferromagnetic or "weakly" ferromagnetic (i.e., the object minimally interacts with the magnetic field in relation to its <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> application), such that the associated magnetic field interactions are insufficient to move or dislodge the items <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>. Furthermore, the "intended use" of the implant must be taken into consideration, because this can greatly impact whether or not a particular item is acceptable for a patient undergoing MRI from a magnetic field interaction consideration. Sufficient <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>-related forces (e.g., fibrous encapsulation of an IPG) can exist to retain even a ferromagnetic device once it is implanted in the patient (3, 6).</para>

        <title>Time-Varying Gradient Magnetic Field-Related Issues</title>
    <para>MRI may be unsafe for patients with certain implants or devices due to induced energy and/or eddy currents related to the time-varying gradient magnetic fields. According to Faraday's Law of Induction, any circuit located within the rapidly changing magnetic fields is subject to induced currents (9, 13, 14). With typical neuromodulation systems that utilize a lead and electrode, the circuit can be formed between the implanted electrode and the IPG, on a metallic structure (i.e., the IPG), or on individual components (e.g., coiled structures like antennas or energy transfer coils) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>). A variety of interactions can occur if current flows. For AIMDs, like neuromodulation systems, there is the risk of unintentional stimulation at the switching rate of the MR system's gradient coils. Unintentional stimulation can be relatively benign as is the case with most neurostimulation scenarios, since neurostimulation pulse frequencies are much higher than the gradient switching frequencies associated with clinical MRI exams.</para>
    <para>It should be noted that the gradient-induced voltages acting on the antennae and recharge coils of AIMDs, such as neuromodulation systems, can be extremely high, due to the number of coils within the associated components. If the circuitry is not robust enough to shield against high voltages, the device may sustain damage to its communication or recharge sys-</para>

    <para>The use of AIMDs, physiological monitors, external accessories and similar objects made from conductive materials has caused excessive heating, resulting in serious burn injuries to patients undergoing MRI (3, 6, 7). The heating of implants and devices tends to be problematic primarily for objects made from conductive materials that have an elongated shape such as electrodes, leads, guidewire, and certain types of catheters (e.g., thermodilution catheters with thermistors, intracranial pressure monitoring catheters, etc.)(3, 6, 7, 14, 15).</para>
    <para>Relatively long conductive structures can act as antennas during MRI, collecting RF energy and dissipating it along the path of least resistance. For leads associated with neuromodulation systems, this typically occurs at the electrodes of the leads, which are commonly found at the distal end and in contact with the organ receiving stimulation (e.g., brain, occipital nerve, vagus nerve, sacral nerve, etc.)(Figure 3). Since the electrodes used with neuromodulation systems are relatively small, the dissipated energy is concentrated very close to their surface. Excessive heating can be generated in neuromodulation systems under certain MRI conditions and there have been reports of serious patient injuries (16-18). A variety of factors contribute to the potential heating of a neuromodulation system. The important variables that impact MRI-related heating of an implanted medical device are presented in Table 1 (3-7, 9, 14-28). Importantly, each of these variables must be taken into consideration to create safe MRI operating conditions for patients with neuromodulation</para>

    <para>systems. It is particularly important to appreciate the complex interactions between the variables related to RF heating. For example, each RF frequency used for MRI (i.e., 64-MHz associated with 1.5-Tesla, 128-MHz associated with 3-Tesla, etc.) needs to be evaluated and considered individually for a given neuromodulation system because the resulting temperature rises may actually be lower at higher frequencies compared with lower frequencies (3, 6, 9, 14, 15-28)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>Over the years, different RF field-induced heating mitigation strategies have been employed and presented in the MR Conditional labeling for neuromodulation products. For example, for certain neuromodulation systems that did not incorporate design changes in consideration of the electromagnetic fields used for MRI, the strategy was to exclude the RF exposure entirely by utilizing a transmit RF head or extremity coil if the neuromodulation system was implanted outside of that particular transmit coil. In those instances, the transmitted RF energy did not subject any part of the implant to heating, resulting in a safe MRI exam (3, 6, 8, 9). Other neuromodulation systems used a reduced whole-body averaged SAR or B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> limit to minimize exposure to RF energy, while still other neuromodulation products have been specially designed to safely manage the RF energy so that the MR system can be operated under normal RF power levels (i.e., the Normal Operating Mode or First Level Controlled Operating Mode)(3, 6, 8, 9).</para>
    <para>With respect to the whole-body averaged SAR value reported by the MR system, it should be realized that this metric is especially problematic with regard to MRI-related implant heating, as reported by Baker, et al. (29, 30) and Nitz, et al. (31). The scanner reported SAR values can be considered to be "not to exceed" values, such that each MR system manufacturer may have a different safety margin (i.e., comparing one manufacturer to another) to ensure that the displayed SAR values are not exceeded. Because there is no direct way to measure SAR prior to or during an MRI exam, scanner manufacturers rely on numerical</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 4.</emphasis> MRI-related heating at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz (diamond) versus 3-Tesla/128-MHz (circle) for a lead not connected to a pulse generator. The MR system reported, whole-body averaged SAR used at 1.5-Tesla was 1.4-W/kg and at 3-Tesla it was 3-W/kg. Note the substantial differences in the temperature profiles during MRI-related heating of the lead (i.e., 1.5-T/64-MHz showing substantially higher temperatures), which illustrates that different resonant effects impact temperature rises for elongated implants. For an implant of a given length, different RF wavelengths will yield different heating effects (i.e., 64-MHz versus 128-MHz).</para>
  <para>models to conservatively estimate the SAR for a particular scan sequence and each manufacturer uses certain assumptions for their SAR models. Importantly, the estimates of SAR did not consider situations when metallic implants were present in patients. Therefore, it is important to understand that implant heating may differ significantly when using different MR systems of the same static magnetic field strength and frequency for a given pulse sequence.</para>
    <para>Significant variations in heating for a deep brain stimulation lead in association with different 1.5-Tesla scanners (notably from the same manufacturer) was first reported by Baker, et al. (29) and further examined in a later investigation (30). The specific concern is when MRI safety labeling for an implant is based on data generated using a particular MR system that has a high SAR safety margin, which ultimately equates to a lower transmitted RF power. In the clinical setting, the device's safety conditions may be followed using a different scanner that has a lower SAR safety margin, resulting in a higher transmitted RF power level. The end result could be a substantially higher temperature rise for the implant, potentially resulting in a patient injury.</para>
    <para>In consideration of the myriad of issues of using SAR to ensure safety for patients with implants, the Food and Drug Administration along with other entities recommended that a different metric for RF energy should be utilized to characterize MRI-related heating specifically for AIMDs. This metric, the B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>, is the root-mean-square value of the MRI-effective component of the RF magnetic field (B<subscript>1</subscript> field). That is, it is the time-averaged RF magnetic field component relevant for creating an MR image.</para>
    <para>The MR scanner measures the B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>+</superscript> field (i.e., the positively rotating RF magnetic field) needed for an imaging sequence and uses the time-averaged B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>+</superscript> field, or B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>, that is associated with a particular imaging sequence. Thus, the B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> value is calibrated by the MR system's software during the "prep" or "pre-scan" phase of an MRI exam. An important characteristic of B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is that it is not an estimated value but it is a known quantity based on the pulse sequence and the associated parameters. Notably, B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is not patient-dependent nor is it calculated differently based on a given MR system manufacturer.</para>
    <para>Understanding the importance of B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> as a metric for RF energy that is presented in MR Conditional labeling of AIMDs necessitates an appreciation of basic MRI physics. When a patient enters the MR scanner, protons in the body align in the direction of the static magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>), similar to a compass aligning with the Earth's magnetic field. An MR imaging sequence is composed of a series of RF pulses that produce a magnetic field that interacts with these magnetically-aligned protons and rotates them through a specific angle commonly referred to as the "flip angle". The RF magnetic field (B<subscript>1</subscript> field) of which only one part, known as the positively rotating or "+" component, is useful for "flipping" the magnetically-aligned protons, allowing MR images to be created. The maximum 10-second, time-averaged B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>+</superscript> field strength of the RF pulses in the imaging sequence is the root-mean-square or "RMS" B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>+</superscript> value of the imaging sequence.</para>
    <para>In 2013, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) mandated that all MR systems manufactured going forward must display the B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>. Therefore, it is unlikely to see B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> information presented on older scanners or those with software that has not been updated. B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is measured and reported by the MR system in units of micro-Tesla (μT).</para>
    <para>Considering that B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is a more precise RF exposure metric than SAR, AIMD manufacturers typically present values for B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> that must not be exceeded when scanning patients in the Instructions for Use (IFU) for their implants. When following B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> as a condition of use, the SAR value is irrelevant, unless, of course, a particular operating mode of the MR system is specified. Using B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> tends to provide better performance for the MRI exam because it has fewer limitations versus using SAR values for patients with AIMDs.</para>
    <para>Because B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is being used by manufacturers in their MR Conditional labeling for AIMDs, it is vital to understand how to adjust protocols to achieve an acceptable B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> value to ensure patient safety. The parameters that an MR system operator uses to modify B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> will vary with the particular MR system. By way of example, parameters and options that can be adjusted to reduce B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> include, the following: (1) increase the RF pulse duration, (2) utilize a "Low SAR" mode of other similar option, (3) increase the repetition time (TR), (4) reduce the number of slices for a given TR, (5) reduce the echo train length</para>

    <para>In addition to being a more precise metric for controlling RF power deposition, another advantage to using B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> as opposed to SAR is that, once the adjustment is made to a desired B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> value for a given sequence, that information can be saved in scanner's protocol library for future use. The B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> will then remain at that value for the next patient unless the imaging parameters are changed.</para>
    <para>As previously stated, patients with neuromodulation systems are exposed to the risks associated with the RF energy collected in undesirable antennas in the leads, resulting in excessive heating. Because RF energy can also travel in the opposite direction towards the IPG, device components or memory can be damaged and, thus, may require replacement surgery in the event that the electronics are compromised (3, 6, 8, 9, 14). The RF energy entering into the IPG can impact the internal electronics causing rectification (i.e., rectification is the process of turning an alternating current waveform into a direct current waveform, thus, creating a new signal that has only a single polarity) and the resultant signal can be delivered to the patient through the lead contacts creating unintended stimulation.</para>

        <title>MRI EXAMINATIONS AND NEUROMODULATION SYSTEMS</title>
    <para>As previously indicated, neuromodulation systems have been employed for a variety of neurological disorders as well as for many other conditions (8, 9, 11, 12). A typical neuromodulation system used for stimulation consists of an IPG (i.e., similar to a cardiac pacemaker) and one or more leads that conduct the electrical pulses to the therapeutic target via one or more electrodes (3, 6, 8, 9)(Figure 5). The IPG contains electronics and a single-use or rechargeable battery. The size of the IPG and the therapeutic target dictate the potential implant locations and lead routings through the patient's body.</para>
  <para>Figure 5. X-ray showing a typical neuromodulation system used for stimulation that consists of an IPG and a set of leads that conduct the electrical pulses to the therapeutic target via one or more electrodes. This example shows a spinal cord stimulation system. Note the positions of the IPG, leads, and electrodes.</para>
    <para>There is a newer type of neuromodulation system that is predominantly used for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) or peripheral nerve stimulation (32-34). This device utilizes an implanted lead and has an external battery and stimulator. The external component communicates with the implanted lead using wireless technology (3, 6, 8, 9)(Figure 6). This platform was developed for neuromodulation for various reasons. Traditional neuromodulation systems require surgical implantation of multiple components: the IPG, lead extensions, and lead with stimulating electrodes. The IPG used with a conventional neuromodulation system is somewhat bulky and, thus, may cause tissue damage or other problems (32-34). Because of possible complications and hardware-related issues, the standard neuromodulation system platform is suggested to pose a higher risk for certain adverse events (32-34).</para>
    <para>By comparison, wirelessly-powered leads used for SCS or peripheral nerve stimulation represent a practical option for patients with respect to their clinical utilization. Importantly, a clear advantage of using a wirelessly-powered lead system is the elimination of components that are required by traditional systems, namely the pulse generators, lead extensions, and longer leads (32-34). Thus, the proposed benefits of a wirelessly-powered lead system include decreased implantation procedural time, lower risk of infection (i.e., because fewer components are implanted), reduced overall costs compared with conventional neuromod-</para>

    <para>Current neuromodulation therapies approved by the FDA and other notified bodies include deep brain stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder and other conditions; SCS for chronic pain; peripheral nerve stimulation for chronic pain sacral nerve stimulation for urinary and fecal incontinence; gastric stimulation for gastroparesis; vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) for epilepsy; VNS for depression; auditory nerve stimulation for hearing impaired patients; administration of Baclofen or other medications for chronic pain via implantable infusion pumps; as well as many others (8, 9, 11, 12, 33, 34).</para>
    <para>During the early days of MRI technology, because of the inherent risks associated with neuromodulation systems relative to the MRI environment, the presence of these AIMDs and others was considered a strict contraindication for patients. However, over the years, various studies were performed that supported the safety of scanning patients with neuromodulation systems under highly specific MRI conditions (9, 11, 12, 20, 22, 24, 29, 30, 33-61). Because of concerted efforts of device manufacturers and biomedical investigators, a large number of neuromodulation systems now have MR Conditional labeling, allowing patients to benefit from the diagnostic capabilities of MRI (8, 9, 11, 12, 62, 63). As such, if specific guidelines are followed, MRI examinations may be conducted safely in patients with certain neuromodulation systems.</para>
    <para>Various representative examples of neuromodulation systems that have criteria defined to permit safe MRI examinations are presented in the following sections of this chapter, with the acknowledgment that many other devices exist with approved MR Conditional labeling. It should be noted that certain neuromodulation systems are labeled MR Unsafe in the United States but MR Conditional outside the United States. Therefore, it is always important to obtain country-specific labeling information for a given neuromodulation system. In addition, because the labeling for implants may change based on new information, healthcare professionals are advised to contact the manufacturer of the neuromodulation system to obtain the latest information to ensure patient safety relative to the use of MRI.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Deep Brain Stimulation Systems</emphasis></para>
    <para>Deep brain stimulation is one of the most rapidly growing areas in neuromodulation. Since 1997, there have been well over 160,000 patients implanted with DBS systems worldwide. As previously mentioned, DBS is currently approved for the treatment of essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition, clinical trials are underway assessing the role of DBS to treat epilepsy, chronic pain, cluster headaches, major depression, post-traumatic stress syndrome, morbid obesity, and other conditions (11, 35-40).</para>
    <para>A typical DBS device includes an IPG, which is usually implanted in a subclavicular position but may also be placed in an abdominal site.

    <para>The necessity of using MRI is essential to the use of DBS therapy in patients. MRI is important for the diagnosis of hemorrhage, stroke, and intracranial lesions, as well as for assessing the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, MRI-guided procedures are used to optimally position the DBS electrodes, resulting in a substantial decrease in the time required for implantation (58, 59). MRI is used post-operatively to determine the location of the DBS leads and electrodes, which is critical information for the evaluation of patients with sub-optimal results or side effects, as well as for targeting during revision, or other cranial surgeries. Furthermore, functional MRI (fMRI) has been demonstrated to be beneficial for understanding the mechanisms of DBS (47, 60).</para>
    <para>The inherent desire to use MRI in DBS patients prompted several groups to systematically study MRI-related issues for these AIMDs (8, 9, 29, 30, 41-57, 61). Approximately 20 years ago, the earliest research contributed to the first AIMD to receive MR Conditional labeling, the DBS system from Medtronic. Despite the limitations for MRI that included scanning at 1.5 Tesla, only, using a transmit/receive RF head coil, and a maximum head SAR of 0.1 W/kg, patients were allowed to undergo MRI for the first time. Importantly, these studies along with those conducted by device manufacturers resulted in MR Conditional labeling for several DBS systems, including those that are "full-body eligible", enabling a wide range of MRI exams to be performed in patients (8, 9). Because manufacturers of DBS systems have strict safety criteria for MRI examinations, healthcare professionals must only scan patients according to the specific information indicated in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions</emphasis></para>

    <para>In this case report, Henderson, et al. (17) described a patient with Parkinson's disease that sustained a serious permanent neurological injury secondary to an RF lesion caused by excessive heating of the electrode of a DBS system associated with MRI of the lumbar spine. Because the patient was an avid hunter, the IPG for the DBS system was placed in his abdomen rather than in the typical subclavicular region to avoid interference with the butt of his rifle. Seven months after placement of the IPG, the patient underwent an MRI of the lumbar spine for the evaluation of back and left leg pain. Multiple scan sequences were performed at 1.0-Tesla/42-MHz with a transmit body RF coil and a receive-only spine coil. Following the MRI examination, the patient experienced hemiparesis.</para>
    <para>The patient was subsequently evaluated by his neurologist, who noted that he exhibited "obtunded aphasia with right hemiplegia, bilateral extensor plantar responses, and skew deviation, right eye below left." A computed tomography scan performed immediately following the MRI revealed hemorrhage surrounding the left DBS electrode. An MRI of the brain conducted using a 1.5-Tesla MR system two days after the lumbar scan found "subacute hemorrhage with methemoglobin in the left thalamus, posterior limb of the left internal capsule, and left cerebral peduncle." The hemorrhage was adjacent to the DBS electrode, with surrounding edema seen on T2-weighted pulse sequences (Figure 8).</para>

(A) A computed tomography scan performed immediately after a lumbar spine MRI exam was performed in a symptomatic patient with a DBS system, which revealed evidence of a hemorrhage surrounding the left DBS electrode. (B) Axial plane, T2-weighted MR image of the patient's brain showing edema around the left DBS electrode. In this case, the patient underwent MRI of the lumbar spine at 1.0-Tesla, using a transmit body RF coil, substantially deviating from the safety labeling for the DBS system, resulting in a permanent neurological deficit.</para>

    <para>The patient was evaluated seven months following the MRI exam and determined to have severe dysarthria that made his speech nearly impossible to understand. He had persistent right hemiparesis with falling toward the right and clumsiness of his right hand. Notably, this patient's neurological deficits were identified immediately after his lumbar MRI exam, implicating a direct relationship between the imaging procedure and associated brain lesion. In addition, the hemorrhage and edema demonstrated on subsequent brain imaging surrounded the DBS electrode circumferentially, as would be expected of a lesion generated by RF heating (17). Of further note is that this patient suffered from a lesion on the left side of the brain, corresponding with the left-sided lead and the IPG implanted in his abdomen. No lesion was produced on the right side, where the IPG was implanted in the standard subclavicular position. This serious accident clearly emphasizes that, while MRI may be performed safely in patients with DBS systems with close adherence to specific safety guidelines (i.e., in this case, the labeling required imaging at 1.5-Tesla using a transmit/receive head coil and not exceeding a head SAR of 0.1-W/kg), any deviation from the stated MRI requirements can result in serious consequences for the patient.</para>
    <para>While the findings from numerous investigators helped the medical community understand the safety and risks associated with MRI of patients with DBS systems, because of the complicated and expensive nature of the testing procedures (9, 13, 14), device manufacturers decided to conduct their own evaluations based on guidelines outlined in the In-</para>

    <para>Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is commonly used to treat chronic pain of neurologic origin, as well as other conditions that are undergoing clinical investigations (8, 9, 12). Several types of IPGs and many different types of leads with different electrode arrays are used to administer SCS. Figure 10 shows an example of a SCS device. Equipment-related factors associated with standard SCS devices substantially complicate MRI-related issues for these devices (8, 9, 65-72). Importantly, the lead used for SCS varies in length depending on the spinal location targeted for stimulation, presenting particular challenges for the evaluation of MRI-related heating (i.e., because the length of an implant is a major determinant of heating)(3, 9, 13-15, 74). There are several different manufacturers of SCS products, many of which have MR Conditional labeling.</para>

    <para>Initially, SCS systems approved for patients undergoing MRI were limited to the use of 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz scanners to image the head using a transmit/receive RF head coil, only. In 2013, the first "full-body" MR Conditional SCS systems from Medtronic were approved for scanning at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz. These AIMDs utilized "MRI SureScan" technology, which involved substantial modifications of the IPGs, leads, and electrodes and still have conditions that must be complied with in order to perform risk-free MRI exams (8, 9). Other device manufacturers such as Boston Scientific, Abbott, Nevro, and others now have MR Conditional SCS systems that are full-body eligible. Patients with these particular SCS systems are now afforded the benefit of the diagnostic capabilities of MRI since other body parts can be examined in addition to the head. Tables 6 and 7 present MRI-related information for two SCS devices from Abbott and Boston Scientific, respectively.</para>

The other platform used for SCS has an implanted lead (which may incorporate pulse generating electronic components) and an external battery and stimulator that wirelessly communicates with the lead (33, 34). Using this type of SCS system, the patient must wear the external components when therapy is needed for pain management. Because of the inherent shorter lead lengths and fewer metallic components, it is less challenging to meet the MRI safety requirements for these SCS systems compared to traditional SCS systems (33, 34). In all instances, the external components are MR Unsafe and must be removed from the patient prior to entering the MR system room. Various manufacturers make SCS devices with implanted leads and external components. Table 8 describes the MRI-related information for one such system, the Freedom-8A (FR8A) Stimulator Receiver for Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) from Stimwave Technologies.</para>

        <title>Peripheral Nerve Stimulation System</title>
    <para>The use of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) to treat chronic pain conditions has become an increasingly important field in the area of neuromodulation (8, 9, 12). Pain in the extremities may occur due to a variety of central and peripheral neuropathic and nociceptive syndromes. Accordingly, peripheral nerve stimulation may be particularly effective when the pain is localized to a part of a single extremity or when the source of the pain is related to the malfunction of a known peripheral nerve. The ongoing advances in electrical neuromodulation technology since 1999 led to the miniaturization of the implantable electronics</para>

    <para>Despite the advances in the PNS technologies, there are only a handful of neuromodulation devices designed specifically for the periphery. However, similar to SCS devices with implanted leads and external components, because of the miniaturization of the implantable PNS devices, there are fewer limitations for the use of MRI in patients with these implants (Figure 11).

        <title>Cochlear Implants</title>
    <para>A cochlear implant (CI) is neuromodulation system designed to help severely-to-profoundly deaf adults and children who get little or no benefit from external hearing aids (89-106). Notably, even individuals with severe or profound "nerve deafness" may benefit from these AIMDs. A cochlear implant has two main parts: an external part that hooks over the ear or that is worn on the head, and a surgically implanted internal part (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15</emphasis>). The two components are coupled together using powerful magnets, one or more of which are implanted. With respect to the external part of the CI, this component contains a transmitter, microphone, and speech or sound processor. The microphone detects acoustic sounds and sends it to the speech processor. The processor then analyzes and digitizes the signal before sending it to the transmitter. The transmitter "codes" the signals and sends them to the implanted receiver via the magnetic coupling. With respect to the internal part, this component includes one or more magnets, a receiver, which is located under the skin on the temporal bone, and one or more electrode arrays (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 16</emphasis>). The receiver collects signals from the transmitter and converts them to electrical pulses, which are then dispatched to the electrodes that have been inserted into the inner ear. The electrodes directly stimulate the auditory nerve throughout a portion of the cochlea, resulting in the brain interpreting the signals as sound.</para>

    <para>(IPG, implantable pulse generator; WBA, whole-body averaged; SAR, specific absorption rate)</para>
    <para>The technology used for cochlear implants has made tremendous advancements since the earliest version used in the 1960s, which was relatively large and had a single electrode (106). Presently, sophisticated CI devices exist and are available from three major manufacturers: Cochlear Limited, Advanced Bionics, and MED-EL. Similar to other AIMDs, CI systems were not originally designed in consideration of the electromagnetic fields used during MRI. Not surprisingly, the implanted magnets, which are integral parts of these devices, along with the presence of other ferromagnetic materials used in the internal components of cochlear implants, present particular challenges for MRI safety (89, 93, 98, 99, 101-105).</para>
    <para>MRI-related labeling for the first CI devices required removal of the magnets prior to performing MRI exams, meaning that the patient had to undergo two separate surgical procedures: one to remove the magnet and another to replace it after undergoing MRI (Figure 17). One of the major issues related to removal and replacement of the magnet is that the patient with a CI needed to endure a period without sound to allow the surgical wound to heal. Obviously, this was undesirable for most patients, resulting in many individuals refusing to have MRI exams, undergoing less favorable diagnostic imaging procedures, which usually involved exposure to ionizing radiation.</para>

    <para>In order to avoid magnet removal and replacement surgery, an alternative approach was utilized, whereby a "compression bandage and splint kit" was used to immobilize the cochlear implant's magnet and control its orientation with respect to the direction of the static magnetic field (98, 101-104). This MRI safety strategy was suboptimal because patients could experience unintended acoustic stimulation because of the implant's interactions with the electromagnetic fields that are applied during scanning (89). Notably, clinical imaging of the patient's head was still impacted by substantial signal loss and distortion caused by the implant (this occurred even with the magnet removed due to the ferromagnetic materials used in cochlear implants)(89, 94, 97-99). Furthermore, there was still a tendency</para>

Targeted drug delivery with these AIMDs provides several advantages including the fact that significantly decreased dosages may be used in patients (which appears to reduce drug-related adverse events) and, importantly, these devices permit patient mobility (8, 107, 108).</para>
    <para>An infusion pump operates by having the drug enter the pump through the reservoir fill port, where it passes through the reservoir valve and the pump's reservoir. At normal body temperatures, pressurized gas that is stored below the reservoir expands, exerting pressure on the reservoir. The pressure helps advance the drug into the pump's tubing. The peristaltic action of the pump moves the drug from the pump's reservoir, through the pump's tubing, check valve, catheter access port, through the implanted catheter, to the infusion site. Figure 23 shows a schematic of the critical components of an implantable infusion pump.</para>

  <para>Infusion pumps and associated catheters typically contain metallic parts and, thus, can be impacted by MRI-related electromagnetic fields (3, 9, 100-114). For example, the electromagnetic fields (static magnetic, time-varying gradient magnetic, and radio frequency fields) may displace the infusion pump, generate excessive heating, alter the programmed settings, damage the device, and create substantial artifacts. Several programmable pumps have undergone comprehensive MRI testing and certain ones have FDA approved, MR Conditional labeling. <emphasis role="bold">Tables 15 and 16</emphasis> present the MRI-related information for two of the more popular implantable infusion pumps: the Prometra II Programmable Pump (Flowonix Medical) and the SynchroMed II Implantable Drug Infusion Pump (Medtronic, Inc.).</para>

          <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <para>With the continued advancements in MRI technology and the development of more sophisticated AIMDs, there is an increased potential for hazardous situations to occur in the MRI environment. Therefore, to prevent incidents and accidents, it is essential to be cognizant of the latest information pertaining to MRI safety and to adhere to current labeling for AIMDs, particularly for neuromodulation systems. Unfortunately, there is still reluctance by MRI facilities to scan patients with neuromodulation systems. Thus, further interaction is needed by the device manufacturers to provide educational resources and technical support, so that MRI healthcare professionals feel competent when performing MRI in patients with AIMDs.</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>No matter what the structure of the facility, be it an academic medical center, a community hospital, or a small rural hospital, the overriding mandate is to maintain a safe environment for the patients and employees. To this end, with specific regard to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), facilities must "establish, implement, and maintain current MRI safety policies and procedures," often referred to as a "Safety Manual", to ensure the safety of patients, visitors, and staff members (1). These policies and procedures dictate the desires of the organization and how they are to be implemented. In consideration of the above, the objective of this chapter is to focus on policies and procedures, the nature of how these are developed, implemented, reviewed and distributed, and the legal implications with an emphasis on MRI safety in the setting of a hospital or medical center.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="ch0027s0000s0002">
        <title>GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
    <para>Policies and procedures are written for a variety of reasons. Some are designed to be the institution's response to regulatory and governing body requirements (2). This is less true with MRI than it is for modalities that use ionizing radiation (e.g., X-ray and nuclear medicine) due to differing levels of governmental oversight and regulation. Some policies and procedures are written as a means of ensuring consistency across similar entities within a larger organization, as is the case with larger academic and regional institutions with small satellite campuses and diagnostic imaging centers. Policies and procedures can also be written in response to events. For example, before 2001, few facilities had a formal policy on the use of portable oxygen cylinders or other tanks used for gases utilized in the MRI envi-</para>

      <sect2 id="ch0027s0000s0003">
        <title>750    MRI Safety Policies and Procedures - Hospital / Medical Center</title>
    <para>ronment (3, 4). By far, the most common reason policies and procedures are written is to ensure compliance with industry best practices. Some believe that the current de facto, best practice standard for MRI is the American College of Radiology (ACR) Guidance Document on MR Safe Practices: 2013 (1). The ACR document rapidly changed the manner in which the clinical MRI setting operated. The MRI industry, self-governed since the beginning, suddenly had a written document to use as a template to guide MRI safety procedures. As far as written documentation was concerned, while this document had no enforceability, it almost overnight prompted significant changes.</para>
    <para>One key concept of the ACR document, and the only element to be detailed in this chapter, is the concept of dividing the imaging facility into four discrete zones with increasingly restricted access as the zones progress from Zones I to IV. The zone model is intended to help control access to the MRI environment and, thus, facilitate safety in this setting. Zone I represents the public space and is essentially unregulated. Zone II represents the public interface and can be defined as the public space within the MRI department such as the waiting, changing, and interview areas as well as the areas for the restrooms and similar spaces. Zone III represents the limited access, technical workspace between Zone II and the MR system room and as such is under the constant supervision of trained MR personnel. Zone IV is the scanner room and is the most tightly controlled space. In Zone IV, the potential problems exist whereby ferromagnetic implants, foreign bodies, and external devices will be affected. Failure to restrict access to those personnel without proper training and the use of support equipment specifically designed for use in the MRI setting can result in significant injury or death to patients, visitors, and staff members. The only other published standard, and one which dovetails nicely with the ACR guidance document, is the Sentinel Event Alert #38, published by The Joint Commission (5, 6).</para>
    <para>When creating policies and procedures based on industry best practices, it is important to carefully search the published literature on the topic. Drafting a policy and procedure with outdated information or improper terminology (e.g., using "MRI compatible" versus "MR Conditional" for MRI labeling purposes) offers little in the way of guidance or protection for any of the parties involved. It is also important when formulating policies based on best practices, to create a comprehensive manual of policies and procedures to ensure that all aspects of operations are covered. A sample outline for a comprehensive MRI Safety Manual presented in Appendix I.</para>
    <para>Some MRI facilities in the hospital or medical center setting use the ACR guidance document as single blanket policy covering all general operations within the department or as a road map to drafting individual policies. Other facilities use the guidance document as a starting point and draft additional policies and procedures to narrow the focus of operational issues in key areas, as needed, or if there are persistent concerns, such as a pattern of MRI-safety related events that occur during the preparation of patients for the MRI examinations.</para>
    <para>The scope with which policies and procedures are written can be very broad and applicable to everyone within the organization or narrowly focused to apply to a very limited target audience. Whatever the reason for writing the policy and procedure, it is vital that the policy works toward the goals of the organization without placing undue burden on op-</para>
        <sect3 id="ch0027s0000s0003s0001">
          <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     751</title>
    <para>erations. The global scope and application of policies and procedures is beyond the boundaries of this chapter, which will instead focus on the basics as they pertain to MRI.</para>
    <para>In general terms, the hospital or medical center policy and procedure manuals operate on a "trickle down" approach whereby the top institutional policies and procedures apply to all those lower down the organizational and operational chain. The lower you go, the more narrow the scope of the policy. For example, an institutional policy and procedure on Infant Safe Haven Laws applies to everyone in the institution regardless of department or position, while a policy and procedure pertaining to screening patients prior to entering the MRI environment applies only to those individuals employed in and empowered to enter the MRI setting. With this in mind, the policies and procedures used in MRI are generally quite specific and require a basic understanding of the safe operation of the MR systems in use today.</para>

    <para>Policy and procedure manuals are an essential component of all institutions. They convey the desires of senior leadership with respect to common departmental operations. Additionally, they instruct the staff on how issues are to be handled during routine operations and unexpected events. Policy and procedure manuals also set the cultural tone of the department and allow the vision of the organization's leadership to manifest itself in daily operations while protecting the institution from undue risk (7). In the broadest terms, the policy and procedure manual is the "owner's manual" for the hospital or medical center and the standard to which the facility holds itself and to which it will be held by others.</para>

    <para>There are many formats that policies and procedures can follow. Some take the form of detailed memos, position statements, or papers that narrate how specific situations or comprehensive operations are to be handled within the department. Others utilize a formalized layout specifically optimized for hospital policies.

    <para>ensure that all patients, visitors, and non-MRI employees undergo comprehensive screening for the presence of contraindicated materials on or in the body that could result in injury to self or others if taken into the MR system room (i.e., Zone IV).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Scope:</emphasis> The section of the policy referred to as the "scope" defines the policy's intended audience. Some policies are very limited to a specific piece of equipment, room, or department, while others are all encompassing and apply to an entire organization. Accurately defining the scope helps to ensure that the policy will be followed by those who need it and not lost in the realm of non-applicable policies. If properly worded, the scope of the policy will not need to be revised when capabilities are changed, hardware is upgraded, or scanners are added unless they involve entirely new departments.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Procedure</emphasis></para>
    <para>While the policy dictates the desires of the institution, the procedure details the methods by which the policy is carried out. Using Example 1 above, the MRI Screening Policy, the procedure would detail the necessary steps to be taken to screen patients, visitors, or non-MRI personnel so that they may safely enter the scanner room. The procedure will vary in detail depending on facility type, patient mix, and level of complexity of the MRI examinations that are performed. The procedure for all MRI facilities should include the core elements of what is to be done, how it is to be done, who is responsible for performing the procedure, and what, if any, resources should be utilized.</para>
    <para>Additionally, the procedure should contain sufficient detail so that it can be easily understood by those covered in the "scope" section of the document. It should not contain excessive details that do not provide clinical relevance. For example, a venipuncture policy that specifies the size of catheter to be used includes a detail that serves no purpose except to limit the type of departmental flexibility needed for efficient operations, since the size of catheter can vary depending on the status of the patient, size of the patient, and examination to be performed. An effective venipuncture policy should instead specify that a suitable sized catheter should be inserted based on the examination to be performed. The choice of catheter size should be at the discretion of the hospital or medical center personnel establishing the venous access. While this type of attention to detail may seem trivial and lead to frustration, we must remember that overly detailed policies make compliance difficult and lead to routine deviations. Deviations from policy are to be expected occasionally and, if clinically justifiable, do not pose a problem. On the other hand, regular deviations suggest a poorly conceived and worded policy and should be avoided.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Implementation and Revision Date for Policies and Procedures</emphasis></para>
    <para>MRI safety policies and procedures developed for MRI facilities in hospitals and medical centers should contain a minimum of two dates, one for the date of creation and/or implementation and the other indicating the date of the last revision. The implementation date can be a single date for all policies that commence on the day a new facility begins operations or the dates can vary if policies are added over time in established facilities. The implementation date should not be edited in later revisions.</para>
    <para>The revision date indicates the date the policy was last reviewed. The preferred method for documenting revision history is with multiple date lines progressing chronologically. While this is a slightly more "busy" effect visually, it allows the full revision history to be established. A single date that changes at subsequent revisions, while satisfying the basic need to keep policies and procedures current, does not indicate any temporal frequency or periodicity with respect to the review process. This is, of course, academic with a fully digital manual that can take advantage of revision history and version control features of the software. In general, the frequency of review and revision should be annually. Additionally, if there is a substantial change in operations such as the addition of a new scanner, new operating locations, or a major upgrade with respect to the equipment (e.g., software or hardware), this also warrants a review of the policies and procedures that specifically apply to MRI safety (1, 13).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Signatures</emphasis></para>
    <para>All policies and procedures should be signed. The signature can be a line item on all policy and procedure documents in facilities that have numerous individual documents or a single signature on the revision page of a comprehensive MRI Safety Manual. Exactly who signs the policies is up to each individual facility operating within a hospital or medical center. At the very least, the signature should be that of the modality, section, or department chief. Ideally, the document would claim multiple signatures from an administration representative, the MRI Safety Officer or Chairperson of the MRI Safety Committee, and the party responsible for daily operations within the department, usually the MRI Manager. The use of electronic signatures for electronic policy and procedure manuals is well established and is acceptable as long as it complies with established hospital security protocols.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Managing the Policy and Procedure Manual</emphasis></para>
    <para>The need for a comprehensive policy and procedure manual is evident. There are situations though, in which the responsibility for the manual becomes less obvious. For most hospitals and medical centers, the lines are well defined. The departmental policy and procedure manual is created and maintained by the departmental leadership. In certain cases, this is not always possible, such as when MRI examinations are provided as a contracted service through a third-party company. These arrangements are overall quite common, though the service delivery model can vary considerably. Sometimes MRI service is provided one or more days per week via a visiting mobile MRI unit or the unit can be parked full-time as a lower-cost "imaging center". It is also possible to have a fully functional, fixed MRI center within the confines of the hospital that is operationalized and managed by a third-party who provides staff and operational support. Regardless of the arrangement, the policy and procedure manual needs to be agreed upon by all parties and should be discussed as a matter of course during any negotiations for provided services. Adherence to policy and procedure standards by contracted personnel should also be considered an integral part of the contracted service and any violation should be treated as a material breach of the contracted terms. It is critical to remember that the hospital or medical center is responsible for the care of their patients even if a component of the care is outsourced to a third-party.</para>
    <para>When MRI procedures are provided via a contracted mobile service, there are additional safety policies and procedures that need to be considered. In a mobile arrangement, the zone model described by the ACR (1), while not mandatory, is less easily achieved and, therefore, it may be necessary to build docking structures, temporary shelters, or other adaptable spaces. The regulations governing the use of these spaces varies greatly from state to state with some municipalities requiring electricity, plumbing, HVAC (i.e., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) and even fire suppression. Whatever the type of structure, it is important that the policy and procedure manual matches the delivery model.</para>
    <para>The policy and procedure manual is also only as good as the data it contains and it is important to keep the information as current as possible, as previously stated regardless of MRI facility type, it is essential that the policy and procedure documents be maintained as a "living document" (1, 2). The old policies should be compared with any departmental changes and equipment upgrades to see if it still satisfies the original purpose. All facilities should be familiar with governmental, agency, or regulatory mandated review requirements, though at present few, if any exist with particular regard to MRI safety. As an example, the State of Pennsylvania mandates that all radiology policies be reviewed annually (8). Other states recommend a two-year review while still others have no formal provision for reviewing policies and procedures (9-11). On the agency side, The Joint Commission (TJC) has no formal standard, but a policy review date older than three years would raise concerns and lead the inspector to question what other areas of operations have not been reviewed or revised in greater than a three-year period (Personal Communication, The Joint Commission Standards Interpretation Group, December 27, 2012).</para>
    <para>Policy and procedure review on an annual basis can be time consuming but the time is well spent. There are different strategies for managing the manual. Some hospitals and medical centers use a formal committee to review, revise, and manage the policy and procedure manual. Others delegate management of specific sections of the manual (e.g., MRI, computed tomography, ultrasound, etc.) to the department managers and/or modality chiefs. Whichever technique a hospital or medical center chooses to follow, it is essential that they follow a regimented schedule of review and document the process with updated signatures and dates.</para>

        <title>Implementing New Policies and Procedures</title>
    <para>When developing and implementing new policies and procedures for MRI safety, it is essential that the process be based on careful research and deliberate thought as well as a focused review of industry best practices in order to be the most effective (2, 6-7). The proposed policy and procedure should be initiated as a preliminary document with an implementation date and proposed review date. The preliminary document should be revisited after the third month of implementation to assess the clinical impact and to revise, as needed. When initially written, policies and procedures tend to be either too specific or too vague. Therefore, implementing them as preliminary for a period of three months allows the department to better assess the impact of the policy and procedure on the overall operation of the department and to correct problems with the wording of the policy or the "mechanics" of the procedure. Once final and fully operationalized, there is usually no need for further revision unless mandated by departmental changes.</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="ch0027s0000s0007">
        <title>DISTRIBUTION OF THE POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL</title>
    <para>Once a hospital or medical center has a workable version of the policy and procedure manual, it needs to be available to all entities within the organization. For a small hospital with a single scanner this is a relatively simple task. A university-level hospital with several departments and affiliated smaller centers faces a greater challenge. Irrespective of facility type, there are two basic choices for the distribution method of the policy and procedure manual. Both have benefits and complications and the ultimate distribution choice depends on the needs of the hospital or medical center.</para>
    <para>Hard copy distribution of the policy and procedure manual has been the standard for many years. It is basic and, once the manual is written, quite effective. The policy and procedure manual is copied and a copy is then provided to key locations where it can be accessed, such as the MRI center. Typically, there is one copy of the MRI safety policies and procedures manual provided to the MRI department and another maintained in the administrative area where it resides in a larger manual of global radiology documents covering the other imaging or therapeutic modalities. Manual distribution is low cost and requires very little time commitment. For a larger hospital or medical center with more entities and locations, or even when a few locations are geographically distant from the main facility, the manual distribution method becomes much less desirable. A major disadvantage of hard copy manuals is the intricacies of the revision process. A change in a policy and procedure, regardless of the magnitude of the change, requires that the old version be physically replaced with the newer version in all manuals. This process requires diligence and attention to detail and, thus, it is a frequent weak link in the process.</para>
    <para>Many modern-day hospitals and medical centers and certainly most facilities with multiple clinical areas, campuses, and affiliated centers opt instead for an electronic policy manual distribution. Maintaining an electronic manual of policies and procedures offers significant benefits over hard copy manuals. For example, the master manual can be updated, as needed, and the changes applied to all subordinate documents immediately and universally. The same applies to updates for signatures and revision dates. A single source policy and procedure manual, once edited, passes through to all locations and entities ensuring consistency and minimizes the chances that an outdated document will remain in a forgotten manual. Another feature of electronic manuals is that there are few limits on what can be included. Some hospitals and medical centers include photographs that serve as visual aids for the policy and procedure or even links to videos that reinforce certain elements of the document. Notably, the greatest benefit of an electronic policy and procedure manual is the ability of it to be linked together with other documents. In an electronic manual, it is easy to include a hyperlink to another policy and procedure in the same department or any department in the organization. This is extremely important when dealing with complex policies and procedures that may contain important elements that not only directly impact the safety of the MRI department but are also associated with nursing policies and those involved in safety.</para>
    <para>Examples of policies and procedures that have a high degree of commonality with other departments include any such document that discusses the administration of non-contrast medications, which relate very closely to nursing policies, or any document that discusses</para>
    <para>conscious sedation or anesthesia in the MRI department, which ties in heavily to anesthesia policies. With electronic-based policies and procedures, the referenced nursing or anesthesia policy is instantly available, making the manual far more effective overall. The drawback of this increased effectiveness is that the manual requires an increased level of commitment in terms of time and resources. While it is preferred to have references to other departments, it is imperative that the reference links be maintained and that the referenced policies are current and accurate. This increased complexity requires a high-level commitment at the administrative level to devote the time and resources necessary to create and maintain the electronic manual. It is also imperative to maintain the electronic policies and procedure manual in a way that is accessible in the event of a connectivity failure, since patient care continues even in the absence of the hospital's or medical center's intranet. If the manual is copied to local computer hard drives as part of the update process, it should be readily available at all times as long as there is electrical power to the department. If the facility relies heavily on cloud-based technology the situation becomes more complicated as access to data could be compromised in the event of a connectivity failure. Generally, Information Technology departments have systems in place for maintaining data and allowing for continuation of care during a communication blackout or emergency. With respect to an electronic policy and procedure manual, it can be as simple as a periodic hard disk backup of the manual that is available in the command center or on strategically placed hard drives. The details can vary but what is important is the need to have all relevant departments involved from the beginning.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF POLICIES</emphasis>The rule of law is that everyone must obey the law. If people violate the law, they are subject to the consequences depending on the nature and severity of the violation. The content of the policy and procedure manual can be viewed as the "law" of the department. All employees must follow the law and no employee is exempt. As such, policy and procedure manuals are designed to clearly define the responsibilities of the healthcare professional and set the standards to which employees are held (12). Ideally, each hospital and medical center will have an up-to-date, comprehensive manual covering all aspects of departmental operations for both routine and non-routine situations. A facility without a policy and procedure manual is declaring, "I cannot meet the standard of care so I have no policy for it" and, unfortunately, that facility starts on the defensive in any legal action (Personal communication, Emanuel Kanal, M.D., November 06, 2012).</para>
    <para>In the broadest general terms, the key to any policy and procedure is its ability to be defended. The range of variation in a policy and procedure from one facility to another within the same industry may be significant. Where any facility falls within the range from conservative to liberal is based primarily on the culture of the organization. Therefore, especially with respect to MRI safety matters, it is critical that the facility constructs the policies and procedures with sound judgment and that they meet the basic standard of care set forth in the industry (1). For example, a small community hospital typically does not possess the infrastructure to scan patients with MR Conditional pacemakers and, therefore, it should have a policy stating that these devices are not to be scanned at the MRI center. As the hospital grows and the level of sophistication of the department increases, the policy and procedure needs to grow as well to reflect any changes it desires. If the policy is that</para>
    <para>pacemakers are still absolute contraindications, then an exclusion policy will suffice. If the hospital or medical center decides to allow scanning of patients with MR Conditional pacemakers only, then the policy and procedure needs to be amended to reflect specifically which pacemakers can be scanned, which cannot, and the exact procedure to be followed to safely do so. This is a key point in that whatever policy and procedure the department chooses, it will remain as the standard they are held to until the document is changed.</para>
    <para>Consider the following fictionalized example. In this example, there will be two patients with cardiac pacemakers who undergo MRI examinations at two separate but equally capable, hospitals (Facility A and Facility B). Both MRI facilities in these hospitals are prepared to scan these complicated patients with all of the necessary collateral support from nursing and cardiology. Unfortunately, both patients experience negative consequences that require the cardiac pacemakers be replaced after the MRI examinations. Facility A has a policy and procedure detailing how pacemaker patients are to be scanned and follows that information to the letter. Therefore, Facility A's liability is limited with respect to the damaged pacemaker. Facility B performs exactly as Facility A, but their policy and procedure is outdated and states than cardiac pacemakers are an absolute contraindication to MRI and patients with these devices are not allowed into the MR system room (Zone IV). Facility B's liability is greater because, although they had the same negative outcome as Facility A, Facility B violated their own policy. This example is exaggerated to illustrate the point that each facility dictates the standards to which it will be held within the range of common practice. It is important that those standards be appropriate for the protection of patients, staff, and visitors without limiting the functionality of the department. Failing to keep policies current and accurate is like announcing, "I did not know the problem existed and, therefore, I have not thought about it" (Personal communication, Emanuel Kanal, M.D., November 06, 2012).</para>
    <para>There is also a delicate balance between a policy and procedure that is too restrictive and one that is too vague. A policy and procedure that contains too many details can negatively impact the department on several levels. The policy will ultimately be difficult to follow, as flexibility is lost in the presence of overly tedious details. Additionally, any issues arising from failure to follow the policy and procedure place the department in a defensive posture. An overly restrictive policy and procedure, particularly in the realm of MRI safety, slows the delivery of care and will surely be violated on a regular basis, neither of which is good news for the patient, department, or facility in general.</para>
    <para>There are times when extremely specific details are necessary for patient safety. For example, implanted devices approved for use in patients referred for MRI examinations under specific conditions are labeled MR Conditional and the specific conditions under which these devices can be safely scanned are specified in writing by the manufacturer, usually presented in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis>. The difference between scanning the patient safely and risking injury relies squarely on the details, which are clearly spelled out in the product literature. Accordingly, any policy and procedure concerning the device must clearly state what needs to be done in step-by-step fashion with all possible details intact.</para>
    <para>When drafting policies and procedures, the choice of language is also a factor. Words like "shall," "must", and "will" should be avoided as they suggest absolutes. The policy</para>
    <para>should opt for "should" instead as it allows for a bit more flexibility. Improper language, poor choice of words, absolutes, and colloquialisms are all potential problems when the policy is viewed by non-imaging professionals, opposing counsel, and in the worst case, a jury.</para>
    <para>In the event of a legal case there are a few things to be considered. First, the policies and procedures manual will be requested by opposing counsel as part of the discovery process. A good attorney knows that the manual contains the type of details that can be used to validate or discredit a witness. Second, the contents of the policy and procedure manual will be used by opposing counsel to assess fundamental knowledge during depositions and not knowing that the policy and procedure existed or what information it contains will not make the situation better. All staff members are held to the standards contained within the manual and, thus, need to know the entire content, where to find it, and what information it contains. Lastly, policies and procedures may be used during a trial. If the legal case involves a loss suffered as a result of a violation of a policy and procedure, it will certainly feature prominently in the trial process.</para>
    <para>In the end, violating a policy and procedure of a hospital or medical center by itself is not going to result in legal action. Depending on the violation, it could result in disciplinary action as defined in the employee handbook but it is not, in and of itself, a legal issue. If the violation of the policy and procedure is determined to be the proximate cause of an injury, illness, or negative outcome for a patient, visitor, or co-worker then the situation has changed and is more likely to involve the legal system.</para>

Policies and procedures serve as a sound foundation for any safety program, especially with regard to MRI safety. A policy and procedure manual can be a single document detailing that an industry standard or guideline (e.g., the ACR guidance document) is utilized as the de facto operational policy for the department, a collection of individual documents tailored to specific operational issues in the department, or a comprehensive Safety Manual for MRI As long as the policies and procedures are based on industry best practices and understood by all involved parties to be the standard to which they are held, they will be an effective tool for improving safety without limiting operational agility.</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>A well-designed safety program to protect medical personnel and patients is mandatory for all centers performing clinical medical imaging. However, due to unique inherent risks, specific requirements must be stipulated for the outpatient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facility (1, 2). <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> lists safety concerns relevant to all medical imaging procedures. All outpatient imaging departments must have a written safety program, properly implemented and maintained by management, technologists, and radiologists.</para>
    <para>This chapter provides the requirements for a safety program to help ensure protection of employees, patients, and others while complying with regulatory obligations. Thus, this chapter should assist new and existing facilities in developing and/or revising safety, health, environment, and loss control programs while establishing consistency in operations and medical delivery with particular attention focused on proper policies and procedures.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Implants</emphasis>Screening patients for the presence of implants and devices that may pose hazards in the MRI environment must begin with the scheduling process. Notably, the Safety Committee should provide scheduling personnel with guidelines so that implants and devices inappropriate for MRI are detected and exams not scheduled. Patients should be asked at the time of scheduling to bring their implant device card or information in writing from their physician. The physician or surgical center can be contacted when the patient cannot provide the necessary information. The presence, nature and MRI information for implants and devices (i.e., the labeling for MRI which is usually found in the Instructions for Use, IFU, for the item) should be re-verified by the MRI technologist when reviewing the patient's history just prior to the patient entering the MR system room.</para>
    <para>All employees should be familiar with current MRI labeling terminology, as follows: MR Safe, MR Conditional, or MR Unsafe (3, 4). The MRI-specific restriction information for each MR Conditional-designated implant should be carefully evaluated before the patient is allowed into the scanner to ensure compliance (e.g., strength of the static magnetic field, level of the spatial gradient magnetic field, type of transmit radiofrequency coil, specific absorption rate limitations, etc.) (3-7). Scheduling personnel must have access to an MRI technologist and/or a radiologist in case questions concerning safety of specific devices cannot be resolved. A detailed list of this information can be found on the website, www.MRIsafety.com, in an annually updated textbook (4), or from the implant manufacturer. In addition to the above, policies and procedures must be in place to ensure that pa-</para>
    <para>tients are properly identified and the correct patient information is entered into the MR system and medical record.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Access Zones</emphasis></para>
    <para>Because of the potential risk inherent in the MRI environment, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends segmenting the area into four different zones (5, 7). In new construction, these zones should be physically separated by barriers or other appropriate means. In certain outpatient MRI centers, physical separation may not be practicable and, in general, has been found to be unnecessary.</para>
    <para>Areas that are restricted, that is, the immediate areas outside the MR system room (Zone III) and the scanner room (Zone IV) where the static magnetic field exceeds 5-Gauss should be clearly marked and designated as being potentially hazardous. Danger signs should be prominently displayed at the entry of hallways and rooms that are adjacent to the MR system room and should also be prominently displayed on the door of the scanner room (5, 7).</para>
    <para>Where locking mechanisms are available, the MR system room should be physically restricted from general access by key locks whenever MRI personnel are not in the immediate vicinity and cannot control access (e.g., lunch break and evening closing). Only MRI personnel should be provided with the access keys to the scanner room. The ACR recommends that physical barriers be maintained across doorways when the MR system room must remain open for cleaning or maintenance (5-7).</para>
    <para>Patients are screened for risk factors before being escorted into the Restricted Zones III (hallways or rooms adjacent to the scanner room) and IV (the MR system room). This topic is covered in great detail elsewhere in this textbook. Patients (or their family, guardian, or designate) must complete a written screening form. Special diligence is required for incommunicative and critical patients. The facility can create its own screening form approved by the Safety Committee or a form can be obtained from other sources, such as the ACR (5, 7) or downloaded from www.MRIsafety.com. A completed and signed screening form should be obtained each time a patient presents for an MRI examination. Screening of unconscious or incommunicative patients who are unable to provide a history for surgery, trauma, metal exposure, or prior MRI contrast reactions should be performed by the MRI technologist in conjunction with the patient's spouse, closest relative, guardian, or personal physician. This individual should complete and sign the screening form designated for this purpose.</para>
    <para>The MRI technologist performing the examination must review the completed screening form and verbally review the answers with the patient or other individual before witnessing (i.e., signing) the form. The screening form is placed in the patient's medical record. Any implants, devices, or metallic foreign bodies raising concerns relative to MRI safety should be checked with published sources or by other means (1-6), before allowing entry into the MR system room. Consultation with the supervising radiologist or MR Safety Officer is recommended if any safety concerns cannot be resolved. The MRI technologist should perform a final visual and verbal safety check prior to entering the MR system room with the patient.</para>
    <para>Sedated, anesthetized, incommunicative or high-risk patients should undergo appropriate physiologic monitoring throughout the MRI examination. This may include checking the patient's vital signs, such as respiratory rate, heart rate, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation as clinically indicated and as deemed appropriate by the MRI facility and supervising physician (5).</para>
    <para>A critical component of the outpatient MRI facility's safety program is planning for attending to patients who may have medical emergencies in the MR system room. Appropriately trained personnel and supervisory physician shall be available at all times to provide emergency medical treatment to patients with cardiac and respiratory arrest. Mock emergency or "code blue" drills are recommended to ensure that the emergency team can efficiently manage medical emergencies. In the setting of a serious emergency such as a cardiopulmonary arrest, the patient should be rapidly and safely removed from the scanning room and immediate basic or advanced life support or other appropriate treatment should be initiated. Emergency medical equipment and medications should be readily available and accessible to emergency personnel.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Pregnant Patients</emphasis></para>
    <para>Pregnant patients warrant special consideration. MRI may be performed at any stage of pregnancy if the patient's physician and radiologist determine that the risk versus benefit warrants performing the exam. This topic is covered in detail in another chapter in this textbook.</para>
    <para>The indications and other information for scanning during pregnancy must be documented in the patient's medical record and should include that the MRI study cannot be acquired via other non-ionizing means such as ultrasound, the diagnostic information is medically necessary to diagnose the mother or fetus during pregnancy, the referring physician does not believe it is prudent to wait until a later stage of pregnancy or after pregnancy, and the patient agrees to have the examination during pregnancy. Importantly, the prior requirement for written and verbal informed consent is no longer a requirement from the American College of Radiology (7). Table 7 outlines the indications for performing MRI in pregnant patients.</para>

    <para>MRI contrast agents should only be administered to pregnant patients after risk versus benefit consideration and approval by an MRI-trained radiologist (7-9). Notably, the fetus</para>
    <para>has a higher exposure to gadolinium in the first few weeks of pregnancy when the mother may not know she is pregnant (8). Ray, et al. (9) reported that gadolinium exposure at any time during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of inflammatory conditions, stillbirth, and neonatal death.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Fetal MRI</emphasis>Fetal MRI is indicated for use if diagnostic ultrasound is inadequate or the examination provides important information about the fetus that would otherwise require exposure to ionizing radiation (4, 5, 7-9). Fetal MRI is conducted only on the recommendation of a radiologist after consultation with the referring physician (4, 7-9). The radiologist should document in the radiology report the fact that: (1) the diagnostic study could not be acquired via other non-ionizing diagnostic imaging means, (2) the information was needed to potentially affect the care of the fetus during the pregnancy, and (3) the referring physician did not feel that it was prudent to wait until the fetus was born to obtain the information. Of note is that recent investigation reported that MRI exposure to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy was not associated with increased risks (9).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Specific MR System-Related Patient Risks</emphasis>The time-varying magnetic fields applied during image acquisition induce currents in conductors in the field's influence and, when applied in the presence of a high static magnetic field, create torque on the gradient coils, producing acoustic noise. Because of the intensity of the noise induced by gradient switching in high field strength MR systems, patients should wear hearing protection when undergoing MRI (4, 7, 10-12). Typical hearing protection devices include earplugs, headphones, or headphones with noise reduction technology. Certain MR scanners provide active noise control (noise cancellation) systems that attenuate acoustic noise and/or have an option of using quiet pulse sequences (11). Despite these features being available, patients should still utilize passive noise control (earplugs or headphones) during all MRI exams performed on high field strength scanners.</para>
    <para>The radiofrequency (RF) fields used during MRI can generate heat in conductors (4, 7, 12-16) resulting in temperature increases. Therefore, all unnecessary electrically conductive materials should be removed from the patient and the bore of the MR system before initiating scanning to prevent patients from experiencing excessive heating or burns (4, 7). All electrical connections, such as on surface RF coils, electrocardiogram leads, and other similar items should be checked by the MRI technologist prior to each use to ensure integrity, and that the thermal and electrical insulation is intact. Damaged cables and exposed wires should be immediately reported to the service engineer and the equipment taken out of service until it is repaired.</para>
    <para>For electrically conductive materials, such as wires, that are required to remain in the bore of the MR system during MRI, the wires must be oriented so that no loops are formed (4, 7). Adequate thermal insulation (i.e., using air, padding, etc.) should separate the patient's skin from all conducting materials, as well as the transmit RF coil (e.g., the body RF coil) during MRI. Procedures to prevent excessive heating and burns in patients during MRI have been previously presented and should be closely followed as part of preparing patients for MRI examinations (4, 5, 7).</para>

        <title>MRI Safety Policies and Procedures for an Outpatient Facility</title>
    <para>Before undergoing an MRI examination, patients should be asked if they have ever had a permanent coloring technique (i.e., tattoos or permanent cosmetics) applied to the body. This includes cosmetic applications such as eyeliner, lip liner, lip coloring, as well as decorative designs. Screening is necessary because of associated imaging artifacts and, more importantly, because a small number of patients have experienced transient skin irritation, cutaneous swelling, or heating sensations at the site of the permanent coloring in association with MRI (4). These issues do not represent a contraindication to MRI but precautionary measures should be in place, such as application of a dry, cold compress (ice pack wrapped in a towel) to the tattoo site during the exam. Patients should be advised to immediately notify the MRI technologist regarding any unusual sensation felt at the site of the tattoo during scanning (4, 5, 7).</para>
    <para>Patients with metallic body piercing jewelry must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and cleared in the same manner as other implanted devices that have no labeling information. Accordingly, the supervising physician must make a careful assessment of risk associated with the MRI versus the benefit of the diagnostic information.</para>
    <para>Some drug delivery or medication patches may contain metallic foil or other similar conducting material. Subjecting the area of the medication patch to RF energy may result in thermal injury to the patient (4). Since removal or repositioning can result in altering the medication dose, consultation with the patient's prescribing physician is recommended. If the medication patch is removed, a nursing staff member should be given the responsibility for ensuring that it is replaced or repositioned (4)</para>
        <sect3 id="ch0028s0000s0005s0001">
          <title>Sedation</title>
    <para>Certain outpatients may require sedation in order to complete a successful MRI examination (17-19). The Safety Committee must have written policies and procedures detailing how adult and pediatric patients should be medicated in the MRI setting. For pediatric patients, these policies and procedures should be based on national standards, facility-specific policies defined by the referring pediatrician and the pediatric radiologist, the age of the patient, the mental capacity of the patient, the time duration of the MRI examination, and the depth of sedation needed. Written guidelines for adult sedation are also needed. Facility-specific policies developed in conjunction with anesthesiologists should determine the type of sedation that is utilized. Sedation should always be administered in accordance with national guidelines and state and local laws (4, 7, 17-19). Separate sedation consent forms must be approved by the Safety Committee and explained to the patient by an appropriate healthcare professional before the patient or designate signs the document.</para>

          <title>Gadolinium-Based MRI Contrast Issues</title>
    <para>The most common adverse event leading to emergency room visits from outpatient MRI facilities is an adverse reaction to intravenous administered MRI contrast agents. No patient should be given an intravenous contrast agent without the written prescription of a licensed physician in accordance with state laws. Depending on state regulations, a physician, registered nurse, or IV-qualified MRI technologist may start and attend to the peripheral intravenous access line and administer the MRI contrast agent as a bolus or continuous injection.</para>
    <para>Before administering an intravenous MRI contrast agent, preferably at the time of scheduling the study, a history must be obtained from the patient or patient's guardian concerning prior contrast injections and possible adverse reactions (20-23). A history of asthma or allergic-type respiratory reaction not associated with MRI contrast agents is a risk factor for adverse reactions, but does not require premedication in most circumstances. Monitoring the cardiovascular and/or respiratory status (i.e., via the use of an MR Conditional pulse oximeter) is prudent during and following administration of intravenous gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents in high-risk patients. According to recommendations by the ACR, if the patient has a history of an adverse reaction to a gadolinium-based contrast agent, then the patient should be considered for premedication prior to receiving the contrast dosage (20). The patient's cardiovascular and respiratory status should also be carefully monitored using appropriate techniques during MRI and for 30 minutes following contrast administration. While serious reactions are rare (21, 23), patients who have had a severe anaphylactoid reaction to prior gadolinium-based contrast media should be given careful consideration before use in future MRI exams.</para>
    <para>According to recent recommendations in the ACR Manual on Contrast Media (20), outpatients do not need to be screened for renal function status before administration of a Group II agent at standard or lower doses unless they have the known risk factors. In other instances, screening questions designed to determine the patient's risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) should be asked at the time of scheduling and when the MRI technologist obtains the patient's history prior to MRI (24-34). <emphasis role="bold">Table 8</emphasis> lists screening questions that we recommend to ask patients relative to the issue of NSF. A positive answer to any of these questions requires calculation of the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to determine risk for NSF before administering gadolinium-based contrast agents in the outpatient setting.</para>

    <para>If the patient is on dialysis, has an estimated GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73-m<superscript>2</superscript> (stage 4 or stage 5 renal disease), or has acute renal injury, then injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent should be given cautiously only after the following information is documented:</para>

    <para>Although the benefits of hemodialysis have not been definitively established if the patient is on dialysis, the patient should undergo a hemodialysis session as soon as possible after the administration of the gadolinium-based contrast agent, preferably within a few hours of the study. The ACR no longer recommends that dialysis be repeated 24 hours later (20). Of note is that peritoneal dialysis provides less NSF risk reduction compared to hemodialysis.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Visitor Screening</emphasis>All visitors entering the Restricted Zones (III and IV) must be screened for MRI risk factors and fill out a specific screening form designed for those not undergoing an MRI examination (4) while still in the Patient Preparation Zone and undergo screening by the MRI technologist. If deemed safe to enter the Restricted Zones by the MRI technologist, then the visitor may be allowed access to these areas under direct supervision by an MRI safety-trained healthcare worker. Prior to entering the MR system room, it is recommended that the visitor change into a gown or scrubs provided by the MRI facility. However, if the visitor is allowed to remain in street clothes, pockets must be emptied of all metallic objects, external hearing aids, jewelry and analog watches, and any other objects that are ferromagnetic or could be damaged in the presence of a high static magnetic field must be removed.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Emergency Personnel</emphasis>Emergency responders (e.g., first responders), firefighters, police, and security personnel must be fully screened as a visitor and cleared by an MRI technologist before being allowed access to the scanner room. Furthermore, it is prudent for outpatient MRI facilities to periodically inform their local police and firefighter organizations of the risks of the powerful static magnetic field of the MR system and the 24-hour presence of the magnetic field for superconducting magnets before emergencies arise so that emergency personnel will be cognizant of the risks when responding to emergencies. Security personnel must remove all metallic objects from their possession including guns and ammunition, electronically-activated restraint devices, radios, cell phones, badges, name tags, jewelry, coins, wallets, keys, pocket knives, and similar items before entering the MR system room. If the patient is a detainee and requires a restraining device, a plastic restraint device must be used (7).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Employee Safety</emphasis>The outpatient MRI facility is a dynamic and often stressful environment. Therefore, it is important to establish policies and procedures for professional behavior and etiquette to</para>
    <para>avoid unnecessary patient stress on top of an anxiety-provoking examination. Center personnel who interact with patients should properly identify themselves and explain their roles.</para>
    <para>All employees of an outpatient MRI facility must be screened for MRI risk factors and any employee who is deemed to be unsafe for the MRI setting (e.g., as a result of having an unsafe implant) must be kept from the Patient Preparation and the MR system room. Employees with access to the scanner room must complete and pass an MRI safety training course, which should be repeated on an annual basis (5, 7).</para>
    <para>If an equipment malfunction occurs, then the chief or lead MRI technologist, facility manager, or radiologist should be informed in a timely manner. Only certified and qualified MRI technologists and MRI safety-trained radiologists should be permitted to operate an MR system and have unrestricted access to the scanner room. These individuals must be extensively trained and educated in the broader aspects of MRI safety, including issues related to the potential for attraction of ferromagnetic implants and devices, burns, peripheral nerve stimulation, acoustic noise, and other potential risk factors (4-7).</para>
    <para>In order to minimize errors, it is recommended that the MRI technologist indicated in the patient's medical record should be responsible for screening the patient and performing the MRI examination. Only safety-trained MRI technologists should be authorized to conduct MRI screening. Non-MRI personnel should be accompanied by and/or under the immediate supervision of an MRI technologist while they are in the immediate area prior to the MR system room and the scanner room, itself.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Pregnant Personnel</emphasis></para>
    <para>Pregnant healthcare workers can work in and around the MRI environment throughout all stages of their pregnancy (4, 5, 7). This includes, but is not limited to, positioning patients, scanning, archiving, injecting MRI contrast agents, entering the scanner room in an emergency, and performing similar tasks. However, if pregnant workers are uncomfortable with the concept of exposure to the static magnetic field of the MR system, they should not be required to work in the MR system room. Pregnant healthcare workers should not remain within the bore of the scanner during the operation of the scanner (4, 5, 7)</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Equipment</emphasis></para>
    <para>Proper installation and maintenance is necessary for the safe operation of an MR system. All equipment used in the scanner room must be deemed safe for use in the MRI environment. Oxygen tanks must be nonferromagnetic throughout the imaging facility. Fire extinguishers must be MR Conditional versions and must be placed in a conspicuous place in or near the scanner. Monitoring equipment such as pulse oximeters and anesthesia equipment must be MR Conditional in order to be used in the MR system room. All other equipment such as IV poles, step stools, stretchers, and other patient support items must also be MR Safe or MR Conditional.</para>
    <para>There are risk factors unique to the powerful magnet associated with an MR scanner. For example, if an individual is "trapped" against the MR system by a large ferromagnetic object, then the static magnetic field will likely need to be shut down immediately. If the</para>
    <para>magnet is resistive, then the power can be shut off. If the magnet is superconducting, then the field must be reduced using the "quench button", which should be located in a conspicuous place. Special training and education are important for all staff members working in the outpatient MRI facility with regard to specific procedures to follow involving a quench (4, 7).</para>
    <para>Preventive maintenance is mandatory to ensure high performance of the scanner in order to minimize down time and to maximize image quality and should be performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations and properly documented.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis>Optimal MRI safety in outpatient imaging centers requires a well-organized plan that includes the facility's management, employees, an MRI Safety Committee and committed MR Medical Director, and MR Safety Officer. A written safety plan that includes policies and procedures that address the risks uniquely associated with the MRI environment must be developed and explained to all employees, along with the assignment of specific responsibilities for execution of the plan. Since few lay people understand the risks associated with high static magnetic fields and other potential hazards associated with MRI, screening must begin at scheduling and continue prior to scanning. Strict adherence to patient safety management must be practiced before and during the MRI exam. Visitors, emergency personnel, and others must be screened and prohibited from entering the MR system room with unsafe devices to ensure both their safety as well as that of patients and staff members. Fortunately, extensive experience with MRI technology in outpatient facilities worldwide during more than thirty years has demonstrated that outpatient MRI is extremely safe if proper policies and procedures are in place and the precautions discussed herein are rigorously enforced.</para>

    <para>In all aspects of life, children are provided with a different set of rules and regulations than adults to help keep them safe, and this is no different in the medical field, particularly in radiology. In fact, a major initiative in radiology is to reduce exposure to ionizing radiation in the pediatric population. In 2008, the <emphasis role="italics">Image Gently</emphasis> campaign was created by the Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging to help the medical community change their practice by increasing awareness of the opportunities to promote radiation protection in the diagnostic imaging of children. While there is presently no similar group leading the effort with regard to the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the pediatric population, it is this author's hope that we will continue to share best practices within the MRI community which will help ensure safety in pediatric patients relative to the utilization of MRI technology.</para>
    <para>The objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of information pertaining to best practices as well as to present policies and procedures related to MRI safety for pediatric patients. Notably, in the MRI environment, children can present many challenges in imaging and safety (1-4). Trying to establish safety policies and guidelines in the use of equipment (e.g., radiofrequency coils, monitoring systems, anesthesia equipment, etc.) and the development of MRI techniques can be extremely challenging. To help guide us through these issues, it is essential for the facility to establish an MRI Safety Committee and safety enhancement program.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">THE MRI SAFETY COMMITTEE</emphasis></para>
    <para>It can be challenging to impose the concept of MRI safety upon those not directly involved with it on a daily or otherwise routine basis. Without an MRI Safety Committee, the</para>

        <title>MRI Policies and Procedures for a Children's Hospital Setting</title>
    <para>involvement from ancillary teams (e.g., nursing, anesthesia, transportation, etc.) can be difficult to establish. As such, a collaborative approach allows for the development of rules and regulations that impact the workflow of all individuals involved in the care of patients who undergo MRI exams. By seeking the advice or input from the other healthcare professionals, the implementation of new policies and procedures becomes a synergistic effort. Developing an MRI Safety Committee composed of vital representatives from ancillary departments such as the anesthesia department, the intensive care unit (ICU), respiratory care, and nursing staff members is beneficial because it provides a path by which the members of the committee become the liaison between radiology/MRI and the individual disciplines and departments.</para>
        <sect3 id="ch0029s0000s0001s0001">
          <title>FUNCTION OF THE MRI SAFETY COMMITTEE</title>
    <para>Before developing an MRI Safety Committee, careful thought should be given as to how the committee will function, as well as to the development of the roles and responsibilities of the various committee members (5-8). There are several avenues the group can take when forming an MRI Safety Committee. The committee can be one of three basic types: (1) Advisory, (2) Policy Making, or (3) a combination of the two.</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>The Advisory Committee investigates MRI safety issues within the department and hospital, offering guidelines, as needed. This committee does not make policies, but rather, offers opinions to those individuals responsible for developing rules that impact the MRI facility.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The Policy Making Committee is entrusted with the power to make or change policies and procedures based on their safety findings or in response to a need to address an accident or incident. Similar to the Advisory Committee, the Policy Making Committee may have to investigate or research topics and issues, but this committee is also granted the further discretion to formulate new policies and procedures.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The Combination Committee takes into account recommendations from both the Advisory Committee and the Policy Making Committee.

        <title>MRI SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM</title>
    <para>MRI safety should be continuously enhanced because every year, new biomedical equipment and medical implants are deployed that can create possible unsafe situations in the MRI setting and for patients. Additionally, every year new personnel join medical centers, many of which may need to visit the MRI facility.

    <para>Most pediatric patients are usually unable to speak for themselves and, thus, rely on parents and guardians to provide and convey information for them and to ensure their safety. If you are a parent, you know that when you take your child to the hospital for an examination or procedure, you are focused on the child getting diagnosed or treated and may not always remember the answers to all the questions being asked. Parental anxiety plays a major role in how screening questions for MRI are answered and, therefore, having multiple tools and/or interviewing sessions provide parents with the opportunity to remember something they may have forgotten.</para>

Monitoring the ancillary staff, allowing a family member into the MR system room, performing the scan, answering telephones, and other tasks can be overwhelming for the MRI technologist due to the variety and vast number of support staff members that may be involved and the duties that are required. As such, to help monitor the large number of staff members in the MRI environment, there is a great dependence on screening policies and procedures.</para>

When screening pediatric patients, a family member or responsible guardian should fill out the screening form. In the event that there is not a parent or guardian available before the MRI exam, then a knowledgeable nurse or physician can fill out the form. Notably, the MRI screening form should include the parent or guardian's cell phone number in the event that it is necessary to ask questions so that these individuals can be reached directly and not delay their child's MRI exam.

At the time of scheduling, the parent (or patient, as appropriate) should be questioned in regards to potential MRI safety issues. If there is a concern, the MRI safety group member (i.e., a designated MRI technologist whose responsibility it is to investigate implants, devices, or safety issues before the patient arrives to the MRI facility) should be contacted via phone or email. All details of the investigation should be documented as part of the scheduled visit.</para>

        <title>PROTECTION FROM ACOUSTIC NOISE</title>
    <para>Acoustic noise can pose a threat to a child's psychological and physical health. Therefore, the use of proper hearing protection in pediatric patients is an important part of ensuring safety. Modern-day MR systems can generate acoustic noise from 78- to 130-decibels or higher depending on the pulse sequence and other factors. While certain scanners may have reduced the maximal acoustic noise levels to 90-decibels, it is still recommended that all patients utilize hearing protection. In addition, healthcare workers who remain in the MR system room during the MRI exam should likewise wear hearing protection.</para>
    <para>Hearing protection is utilized to minimize the risk of hearing impairment in association with MRI. Special noise attenuation devices may be used (e.g., MiniMuffs (Natus Medical, Seattle, WA) for neonates and young infants (Figure 5). These devices may be used in conjunction with soft ear putty (silicone-based and/or beeswax). Additional protection such as using positioning sponges (i.e., the ones provided with the MR system's head RF coil) will help prevent acoustic noise-related problems for pediatric patients. The combination of MiniMuffs and ear putty is advantageous over other types of earplugs because they provide the best type of noise reduction and help to avoid the difficulty of inserting earplugs into relatively small ear canals. This strategy also prevents the possibility of small children swallowing or choking on tiny earplugs.</para>

        <title>MRI SAFETY ISSUES RELATED TO THERMOREGULATION IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS</title>
    <para>Thermoregulation is the ability to maintain body temperature independent of the outside environment. Infants rely on their mothers to regulate their temperatures <emphasis role="italics">in utero</emphasis>. Once born, the infant has a somewhat limited ability to regulate body temperature in response to exposure to cold environments primarily due to the inability to shiver. While an infant can sweat, only the glands in the head, neck, hands and feet are active (i.e., approximately 25 to 30% of their total body size) (18-25). To keep warm, a baby may try to curl up into the fetal position, move, or cry. However, a baby's main source of heat production is the special type body fat, known as brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT starts developing at 26 to 30 weeks of gestation and makes up about 2 to 7% of the baby's total body weight at birth. BAT is similar to the fat tissue found in hibernating animals.</para>
    <para>BAT plays an important role in providing body heat for the infant. Unfortunately, a disadvantage of using BAT to stay warm is that the metabolism associated with utilizing this type of fat to produce heat requires extra oxygen and glucose. This can result in the newborn becoming physically stressed, as the infant attempts to maintain a proper body temperature. If allowed to become too cold (the baby's temperature should never be lower than 36°C), the infant may be reluctant to feed in an effort to conserve energy, thus, compounding the problem (21-25).</para>
    <para>Importantly, procedures should be in place to ensure that a newborn's temperature is maintained at an acceptable level throughout the MRI examination. Once a patient from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is ready to travel to the MRI facility, a checklist composed of three sections should be used for: (1) Pre-Study, (2) Arrival at the MRI facility, and (3) Post-Scan Instructions.</para>

    <para>While it is important to maintain the infant's temperature during MRI, it is equally important to review the relevant MRI procedure when utilizing an MR Conditional incubator for that purpose of ensuring that there will be no issues (Figure 6). Fortunately, several types of MR Conditional incubators from various manufacturers are available for use in the MRI setting. These incubators offer thermal regulation with air warming, which allows the infant's skin temperature to be monitored at all times during transport to and from the MRI facility and throughout the MRI examination (26-28).</para>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Maintaining safety in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment is a never-ending challenge, whether it is part of a clinical facility or one that is restricted to research studies. There are, however, specific concerns that may only be encountered in a research facility due to the variety of individuals allowed to access the MRI environment, including those present for the development of software, hardware, and ancillary equipment. This calls for specific policies and procedures that are vigilantly maintained by those managing and supporting MRI laboratories in the research setting.</para>
      <para>Over the years, there appears that the number of reported MRI safety incidents is increasing. There are many theories as to why this is happening including an increase in the number of MR systems worldwide, the increase in the number of scanners with higher static magnetic fields being installed especially at research facilities, the improvement in the reporting of such incidents, the increase in the number of MR systems being installed in departments and facilities outside of the traditional radiology department, an increase in the overall number of MRI examinations performed, or possibly more incidents are actually occurring.</para>
      <para>In consideration of the above, an investment is required to ensure that the utmost is being done to maintain safety for patients and volunteer subjects, researchers, faculty and staff members. Understanding this investment requires both time and money, paving the way for a successful MRI safety program. Importantly, it takes only one mistake for the freedom that an MRI research facility currently enjoys to be revoked. Therefore, we must act responsibly and out of concern for study subjects, patients, and staff members.</para>

      <title>DESIGN AND ACCESS OF THE MRI ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <sect3 id="ch0030s0000s0002s0001">
        <title>Zones of the MRI Environment</title>
        <para>Since the early developments of interventional or intra-operative MR systems, the areas associated with the MRI department have been divided into specific sections as a method to clearly identify which individuals and equipment are given access, and under which conditions. This was further reinforced by the American College of Radiology (ACR) document on MRI safety, first published in 2002 and updated in later years, thus, identifying and demarcating the four "zones" of an MRI department (1-6).</para>
        <para>Basically, the four zones described by the ACR include as follows, the area typically accessed by the general public (Zone 1); the dressing room, bathroom and patient preparation room (Zone 2); control room used for MR system operation (Zone 3); and the scanner room (Zone 4). The MRI suite of rooms should include specific areas separated by locked doors using card key access or other means to control access, but not combination locks. The codes for combination locks can be easily communicated to many individuals, requiring multiple changes to maintain security.</para>
        <para>The initial design of the MRI suite includes critical details, as follows: card key locked access from the hallway, lobby, or reception area into the MRI suite; easy visual access from the control room of the MR system room door and the path leading from the dressing room and patient preparation room towards the scanner room door; visual access from the control room into the MR system room; emergency exhaust fan controls located inside and outside of the scanner room; quench button for a superconducting magnet located immediately inside or outside of the scanner room door; and video observation of the inside of the bore of the MR system.</para>
        <para>It may be problematic to move walls due to cost and space issues when planning to renovate an MRI suite for enhanced safety. Therefore, it is critical to focus on what can be done to ensure maximum safety through reduced and controlled access to the various areas of the MRI environment (1-6). Doors with locked access should be in place between general access areas such as main hallways, waiting rooms and reception areas (i.e., Zone 1) and Zones 2, 3, and 4. Only individuals appropriately screened and accompanied by trained MRI staff members are allowed to access the dressing room and patient preparation room (Zone 2) and the MR system room (Zone 4). Patients and volunteer subjects should never be allowed unaccompanied access past Zone 1 into Zones 2, 3 or 4, and should never be left unattended in Zones 2, 3 or 4 at any time.</para>

      <sect3 id="ch0030s0000s0002s0002">
        <title>Access</title>
        <para>Policies and procedures must be in place that clearly identify which kind of access is given to each of the MRI staff members as well as MRI physicians, other healthcare professionals supporting patients or volunteers undergoing the MRI examination, clinicians, and family members. For example, technologist aides may be allowed to initially review the completed screening form with patients or volunteer subjects, and accompany them to the dressing room and give initial preparation instructions. The MRI technologist or radiographer conducts the final review of the completed screening form and accompanies the</para>

          <para>Current and appropriate signage, especially immediately before entering the MR system room (Zone 4) is an absolute requirement (1-4). Other forms of warning to individuals entering the area of the dangers of the MRI environment are also recommended. These include MRI warning rugs, stanchions, placards, or gates placed in front of the door leading into the scanner room (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>). Frequently, something more three-dimensional or that provides a tactile experience is extremely helpful in reminding all individuals about the potential danger of entering the MR system room.</para>

          <emphasis role="bold">Assigned Responsibilities, Education, and Training</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Depending upon the number and type of scanners present in the research facility, an adequate number of appropriate staff should be present to support the various research stud-</para>
        <para>ies and patient examinations (1-5). This includes but is not limited to: MRI technologists/radiographers, nurses, receptionists, assistants and/or technologist aides, radiologists and/or clinicians, administrative support, and/or research associates (e.g., doctoral, Ph.D., scientists). Current policies and procedures must include the assigned level of responsibility for each staff member. This will determine the level of education and hands-on training required for each. In addition to the staff previously listed, limited but appropriate training will also need to be provided to other individuals including: housekeeping and maintenance personnel, ancillary staff (nursing, respiratory therapy, etc.), physicians, firefighters, police and security officers, and first responders. Of particular importance is for firefighting personnel that may respond to a fire or other emergency at the facility to undergo MRI safety training in order to acquaint them with the dangers of the MRI environment.</para>
        <para>In order to properly support scientific research studies, the MRI technologists/radiographers must possess a thorough working knowledge of MRI. Using research software, hardware, radiofrequency (RF) coils, and prototype accessory devices can result in a variety of artifacts and other imaging challenges including safety. Possessing a clear understanding of the principles and physics of MRI allows the technologists/radiographers to quickly address MR system difficulties resulting in the successful completion of research studies. Competency lists are excellent tools to determine the educational needs of each staff member. At a minimum, these lists should include: anatomy and physiology; MRI physics and principles; scan parameters and imaging options; safe and appropriate use of RF coils and other ancillary equipment including physiologic monitoring systems; patient and volunteer subject preparation, instruction and communication; positioning and immobilization; sterile technique; and emergency procedures.</para>
        <para>Ongoing education is a must in the rapidly changing world of MRI especially in the research facility. Time and financial support must be provided to ensure that all staff members maintain a comprehensive knowledge in order to competently support the research MRI studies being conducted. Continuing education can be obtained through attendance at educational seminars, completion of online webinars, and video training. Subscription to the MRI technologist society, the Section for Magnetic Resonance Radiographers and Technologists (www.ismrm.org/smrt/) provides educational support with current knowledge shared by peers and other experts in the field. The investment in continuing education for MRI technologists/radiographers results in knowledgeable, productive healthcare professionals. Understanding MRI physics and principles are necessary to comprehend the issues in MRI safety and screening. It also clearly communicates to the staff that they are a valued part of the team resulting in responsible, interested individuals. In addition, enlisting the faculty at the research facility to use their specific expertise to provide training to the MRI technologists/radiographers provide the foundation for successful teamwork. This results in the successful completion of research studies because the staff comprehends the facility's priorities. Both didactic and hands-on training are equally valuable in this comprehensive training program.</para>

The safety officers are selected from those with an advanced knowledge in MRI and MRI safety. To ensure comprehensive safety support, the committee should include an MRI technologist/radiographer, a radiologist or MRI clinician, and an MRI scientist (e.g., typically a doctoral level person, Ph.D.). The MRI technologist/radiographer and radiologist/MRI clinician are primarily responsible for making all decisions concerning MRI pre-procedure screening of patients, volunteer subjects and researchers. The MRI scientist provides the expert understanding of hardware and software necessary for comprehensive decision-making.</para>

      <title>Research MRI Procedures Conducted by MRI Technologists</title>
      <para>MRI research examinations that involve the administration of contrast agents, interventional procedures, the introduction of intra-cavitary coils, and patients or volunteer subjects with special concerns such as paralysis require the presence of an MRI research technologist/radiographer (2, 3, 5). Proficiency in sterile technique and intravenous (IV) set up procedures is part of the competency required by the MRI technologist/radiographer. As healthcare professionals are trained in the skills of medical procedures and patient communication, this background is extremely valuable to ensure patient comfort and safety during IV placement, positioning of the patient or volunteer subject with the IV line in place, resuscitation procedures in the event of a reaction to the IV placement or injection, extravasation issues, and/or insertion of an endo-rectal RF coil.</para>
      <para>The IV administration of contrast media requires the presence of a minimum of two healthcare professionals. In addition to the MRI technologist, either a nurse, physician or tech aide is required to ensure safety for the patient or volunteer subject during IV placement. If the patient should suddenly lose consciousness, it will require two trained healthcare professionals to safely and successfully address the situation (i.e., to slowly lower the subject's head to the same level as the body while maintaining control over the IV site). A physician trained in emergency care is required to be present in the MRI suite during the injection of the contrast media and for a short period thereafter (approximately 15 minutes) to ensure there are no resulting reactions or complications (1, 2).</para>
      <para>It is also extremely beneficial that an MRI technologist/radiographer be present for more complex animal model research studies. In addition to the operation of the MR system, this individual's responsibility includes maintaining a safe environment for people and equipment. Research studies commonly involve multiple individuals (researchers, clinicians, surgeons, veterinarians, and veterinary technicians) who are present in the MRI environment but engaged in their specific roles, focusing on their particular research needs and outcomes of the research study. In addition to protecting the many individuals working in the research study, the MRI technologist/radiographer is responsible for preventing expensive damage to the MR system and maintaining cleanliness standards required for human MRI examinations (patients and volunteer subjects) following the animal model study.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="ch0030s0000s0005">
      <title>MRI Procedures Conducted by Researchers</title>
      <para>Researchers may be allowed to conduct research studies on phantoms and human subjects without an MRI technologist/radiographer present. The researchers must first complete</para>
      <para>their requirements for MR system access and use, including MRI safety and policy and procedure training, hands-on scanner training, RF coil training, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training (3, 4, 7). In addition, it is policy that any scanner equipment or accessory issues, or human subject screening question issues be reported immediately to the appropriate support staff or the MRI Safety Committee for resolution.</para>
      <para>During weekdays (e.g., 7:00 am to 6:00 pm), a minimum of two safety-trained researchers should be present for all scans on human subjects including normal, healthy volunteers, as well as patients. To ensure safety and fulfill the ability to manage any emergent situation involving a human subject such as a loss of consciousness, seizure, or other serious event, a minimum of two safety-trained researchers should be required to be present for all evening, night and weekend scans being conducted (5). This is further discussed below in emergent cradle/table operation.</para>
      <para>All new MRI accessories, equipment, devices, RF coils, furniture, and patient support equipment are required to be reviewed by the MRI Manager (MRI technologist/radiographer on the Safety Committee) before being taken into the MR system room. If the device has an electronic component, then it must undergo comprehensive testing to ensure that it does not contribute noise (i.e., electromagnetic interference) to the images or other data being acquired (8).</para>
      <para>Imaging accessories, devices, and RF coils are often designed and developed as a prototype for use during research MRI examinations. In addition, these same prototype components may be purchased from third party vendors. If an investigational device is a "non-significant risk device", an investigator does not need to submit an investigational device exemption (IDE), the IDE will be "considered approved" under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Such devices do not have to comply with FDA premarket approval and performance standards prior to use in research studies (9). To ensure safety for the patients and volunteer subjects as well as the MR system, and to ensure that it will function properly with the scanner in use, early contact with the members of the MRI Safety Committee is recommended to prevent inappropriate designs that could result in costly mistakes, wasted resources, and/or potential safety issues.</para>

      </para>
      <para>It is recommended that an MRI technologist/radiographer or technologist aide complete stocking responsibilities in the MR system suite to ensure the medical supplies present are not only correct, but also not expired when they are needed. This is not something that should be delegated to an individual (e.g., student, etc.) who is not a health care professional. Along with sterile technique, the importance of cleanliness in the medical imaging environment is stressed during didactic and hands-on training to ensure human subject safety as long-term consequences can prevail without this. Maintenance and stocking of the crash cart located in the MRI suite is required to be conducted by a healthcare professional, either MRI technologist/radiographer or nurse due to the presence of drugs.</para>

      <para>To access and/or use any of the research MR system, completion of an initial MRI Safety Policy and Procedure Training conducted by the MRI Manager (e.g., MRI technologist/radiographer member of Safety Committee) is required. All researchers are required to complete this training despite any previous experience working on or around scanners at other facilities, either clinical or research. Typically, this review is a 90-minute comprehensive yet interactive presentation that includes all aspects of MRI safety and human subject screening, in addition to covering the research facility's policies and procedures. Annually, each of the approved researchers is required to complete an online renewal that is similar to the initial training but includes quizzes spaced throughout the tutorial. It also includes completion of the MRI pre-procedure screening form. The results of each completed quiz are automatically emailed to the members of the MRI Safety Committee and registered in a database.</para>
      <para>A commitment for a minimum of six months use of the research MR system is required by researchers to attend the initial MRI Safety Policy and Procedure Training and to subsequently be given access to the scanners. If a researcher has completed this training and then is absent from conducting or participating in research scans for a period of three months or longer, completion of the online version of the MRI Safety and Policy and Procedure Training is required prior to accessing the MR systems. A database should be maintained with all of the trained researchers' names and contact information that allows automatic reminders to be sent instructing them to take the required annual training, and automatic removal from accessing the scanners if the training is not completed within a designated time period. Other databases are maintained for the purpose of distribution of information to researchers.</para>
      <para>The presence of a whole body 7 Tesla (T) scanner highlights the need for an additional and highly specific MRI safety training (6). This focuses on the challenges present in working around such a high static magnetic field and spatial gradient magnetic field (dB/dx) in Zone 4 (the scanner room), the fringe fields present in Zones 2 and 3, and increased specific absorption rate (SAR) associated with MRI-related heating for researchers, patients, and volunteer subjects. Currently, at most facilities housing high field strength MR systems such as 1.5 T or 3 T, the five-Gauss line is contained within the scanner room. However, the fringe field present in the control room, equipment room, or other nearby rooms of a research 7 T scanner may exceed 100 Gauss. Thus, careful thought must be given to the type of access allowed to each individual and specifically where the MRI pre-procedure screen-</para>

        <para>In the event of a suddenly unconscious or unresponsive patient or volunteer subject, researchers must be fully trained in the safe removal of the individual from the MR system and the room (Zone 4), into the patient preparation room (Zone 2) prior to the arrival of paramedics or other resuscitation (code blue) team members. Emergent care of the patient or volunteer subject must never be conducted within the scanner room due to the unmonitored devices carried and used by first responders to revive the subject and the time required to properly complete screening procedures for those individuals (3, 5, 7). This requires the utmost preparation and speed to complete certain procedures prior to the arrival of the resuscitation team or first responders. Practice sessions should be conducted on a regular basis (e.g., bi-annually) by all MRI technologists/radiographers to ensure their proficiency in the procedures.</para>
        <para>The number of researchers required to be present for MRI examinations conducted on human subjects, whether patients or normal volunteers, is determined by the day and time of the examination. MRI studies conducted in the evening (after 6:00 pm), early morning (12:00 am to 7:00 am), and weekends require a minimum of two researchers to be present (5). This is to ensure the necessary emergent procedures can be completed successfully in the event of a safety issue with the patient or volunteer subject. Even if only "normal, healthy" volunteer subjects are being scanned, there is always a risk, albeit small, that these individuals could experience a stroke, heart attack or syncope.

In addition, all of the potential resulting issues from a quench should be addressed in proper training including the formation of a helium cloud in the MR system room, failure of an exhaust fan that may prevent the opening of the door to the scanner room, and liquid helium dripping from the cryogen exhaust pipe. Training in the operation of the quench button should only be given to appropriate researchers, never to housekeeping or maintenance personnel.

This instruction in the prevention of potential risks associated with RF coils includes the operation and safe utilization of these devices, and correct RF coil selection in the MR system software. Basic knowledge is reviewed in the appropriate use for specific anatomy, positioning of the RF coil as well as the associated cable and connector box, and immobilization of the coil relative to the human subject. Additionally, training should encompass the prevention of cables coiling upon themselves and preventing the cables coming into contact with other cables, devices, human subjects and/or the bore of the scanner (1-3, 5-7, 10). First-time use of any RF coil at the research facility requires training by the MRI Manager (MRI technologist on Safety Committee), MRI research technologist/radiographer, or Scientific Center Director (Ph.D. on the MRI Safety Committee).</para>
        <para>All RF coils and devices should be thoroughly checked before use in any MRI examination for signs of damage including fraying cables, cracked housing and/or loose contents in the coils or connector boxes in order to prevent risk of burns to the patient or volunteer subject, or damage to the scanner. RF coils used to image anatomy other than its designated use must be referred to the MRI Manager or MRI research technologist/radiographer for approval. For example, wrapping a cardiac RF coil around an elbow and positioning it next to the MR system's bore is a mistake that could easily result in injury to the patient and/or hardware. Imaging pediatric brains using a knee coil may be an acceptable alternative to the indicated anatomy for that coil, and should not result in any potential dangers for the patient or scanners as long as proper padding (insulation) is provided to prevent contact between skin and the coil housing.</para>

In addition, the sponges and pads provide the necessary separation and insulation for all cables and devices to prevent areas of excessive heating to the patient or volunteer subject and/or damage to the scanner (1-3, 5, 7, 10, 11). This includes critical insulation between human anatomy and the bore walls and ceiling of the MR system.

Therefore, it is critically important for the researchers to clearly understand how the RF coil they are using operates to ensure necessary insulation is provided for the human volunteer subject or patient, coils, cables and devices present in the bore of the MR system.</para>
        <para>If there is not 1 cm of insulation guaranteed and maintained using pads and sponges between the subject's arms, chest or abdomen and the bore of the scanner, the patient or volunteer should not be scanned because the risk of heating and subsequent burns is far too great due to the electrical fields present. Faulty RF coils including the body RF coil can also be the cause of burns. Positioning sponges or pads between the subject's arms and other body parts that come into close proximity to the bore walls is, therefore, a requirement for all imaging that utilizes the body coil to transmit the RF energy (Figure 2). The cost of positioning sponges and pads for use in the MRI environment is expensive, especially those that are durable, and maintain their position without slipping. However, the issues surrounding the burn of a patient or volunteer subject in the MRI environment results in a far greater financial liability.</para>

The First Level Controlled Operating Mode should only be used in normal, healthy control subjects as the outputs may result in some physiologic stress. The Second Level Controlled Operating Mode may require a password to access and should only be using when scanning phantoms due to the potential for excess physiologic stress due to the level of outputs.

        <title>MRI Pre-Procedure Screening</title>
        <para>Safety screening of patients and human subjects is conducted routinely before each and every MRI examination (1-5, 7). Screening is done to ensure safety upon entering the MR system room (Zone 4), entering the scanner and residing in the scanner during the examination. Potential dangers are due to the presence of the static main magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>), radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (B<subscript>1</subscript>), and the varying gradient magnetic fields (G<subscript>x,y,z</subscript>).</para>
        <para>Metals and conductors are the main concerns as well as the sound levels attributed to the time-varying magnetic fields. Metal can exhibit one or more behaviors when exposed to an MR system. It can exhibit translational attraction, becoming a projectile (missile) by being pulled into the magnet due to the change in static main magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>) over distance (dB/dz); exhibit torque or rotational alignment (attempt to align with the main static magnetic field lines; heat resulting in burns to the patient or damage to the scanner; and/or generate artifacts in the images and/or raw data (1-5, 7). Translational attraction is strongest at the ends of the MR system and zero at the center, whereas torque is strongest at the center of the scanner. Due to the additional magnetic shielding added to an MR system allowing it to have a reduced fringe field, the compressed field lines of the magnet result in projectiles experiencing attraction to the sides of the scanner's bore as well as to the center of the bore in the Z-direction.</para>
        <para>In 2005, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International published new terminology for use in describing and labeling biomedical implants and devices as well as equipment to determine under which specific conditions that they can safely enter the MR system room and be present in the scanner during the examination. The labeling terms are MR Unsafe, MR Safe, and MR Conditional (8).</para>
        <para>MR Unsafe describes an item that poses hazards in all MRI environments. MR Safe describes an item that poses no known hazards in all MRI environments. MR Conditional describes an item that has been demonstrated to pose no known hazards in a specified MRI environment with specified conditions of use. Field conditions that define the specified MRI environment include field strength, spatial magnetic field gradient (SFG, MSG), dB/dt or slew rate (time rate of change of the time varying gradient magnetic fields), radio frequency (RF) fields, specific absorption rate (SAR), and B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>. Additional conditions, including specific configurations of the implant or device, may be required (8). Implants, devices, and other items should be labeled with proper terminology and researchers engaged in performing investigations using MRI technology should carefully consider this information in the realm of MRI screening policies and procedures.</para>

      <title>MRI Pre-Procedure Screening Forms</title>
      <para>Two MRI screening forms should be available (Figures 3a and 3b). One form is completed by patients and volunteer subjects undergoing the MRI examination prior to entering the MR system room (1-5, 7). A shorter version is completed by individuals who wish to enter the MRI environment but that will not be scanned. This second form is used for family members when it is necessary or useful for them to be present in the MR system room with the patient or volunteer subject. This same form is also used for maintenance and housekeeping personnel, visiting researchers, clinicians, nurses, and others. It is important to routinely check with all researchers to ensure that they are using the most current MRI pre-procedure screening forms. This is especially important for researchers from departments other than the one in which the scanner is located.</para>
      <para>The screening process is an interactive one between the researcher and the patient or volunteer subject. The researcher conducting the screening must be trained and, therefore, qualified to perform the required screening procedures (1-5, 7). They must have completed the required MRI Safety Policy and Procedure Training and be current with their online safety training. All screening questions regarding biomedical devices and implants, and/or any other condition which may prevent the patient or volunteer subject from undergoing the MRI examination is forwarded to the MRI Manager or radiologist/MRI clinician from the MRI Safety Committee. A good rule to always follow in MRI safety is that "a previous MRI procedure does not guarantee safety" for any subsequent MRI examination. In addition, researchers are required to consult with the MRI Manager, or radiologist/MRI clinician from the MRI Safety Committee if the patient or volunteer subject mentions any previous surgeries. Further investigation is necessary to obtain additional information in order to make the decision for the patient or volunteer subject to undergo the research MRI examination. This includes the date of the surgery, city, state and country in which surgery was conducted, the physician's and/or surgeon's name, name of hospital, anatomical location, surgical procedures conducted, reason for surgery, and devices or implants present (1-5, 7).</para>
      <para>Researchers are required to complete the patient and volunteer subject MRI pre-procedure screening form once a year when they complete their MRI Safety Policy and Procedure Training tutorial online. If a researcher undergoes surgical procedures or acquires a biomedical device or implant then they are required to report to the MRI Manager to determine if it is safe for them to enter the MR system room, to work around the scanner and/or be scanned as a volunteer subject. Pregnant patients and volunteer subjects may undergo research MRI examinations if approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the MRI Safety Committee. The decision to allow pregnant researchers to enter the MR system room is made by the MRI Safety Committee for that particular research facility.</para>
      <para>In research studies, more than one MRI examination may take place during the course of the investigation. The participant undergoes the informed consent process typically once and signs the consent form. However, the MRI pre-procedure screening form should be completed each and every time the participant is scanned, even if the scans are only one day apart (1-5, 7). Much can happen in twenty-four hours that might not be noticeable to the researcher conducting the study (e.g., having a pacemaker implanted). Importantly, the screening form should be completed on-site at the research facility on the day of the MRI</para>

      <para>examination. Researchers are required to conduct an earlier telephone interview or email pre-screening for major issues such as the presence of biomedical devices or implants, pregnancy, presence of acupuncture needles, body piercing, etc. These are issues that would need to be resolved by those responsible on the MRI Safety Committee before the patient or volunteer subject would be allowed to undergo the MRI examination.</para>
      <para>It is critical that the researcher conveys to the patient or volunteer subject the seriousness of the screening form and how important it is to provide accurate, complete answers to ensure their safety. After the patient or volunteer subject completes the MRI pre-procedure screening form, the researcher sits down with the individual to review their responses on the form. This is to ensure that the patient or volunteer subject has not misunderstood or forgotten any information, surgeries, or conditions that might prevent them from undergoing the MRI examination. After the review is complete, the researcher prints his or her first and last name at the bottom of the completed form. This ensures that a record is kept of which individual reviewed the completed screening form with the patient or volunteer subject before taking this individual into the MR system room. The completed screening form goes in a second file with the completed consent form in the office of the principal investigator (PI) as evidence that everything was done to ensure safety for the patient or volunteer subject during the MRI examination.</para>
      <para>As with a clinical MRI department, it should be clearly documented in the research facility's policies and procedures, to which the responsibility falls to make the decision for the patient or volunteer subject to undergo the MRI examination if there is a potential safety issue present such as a biomedical device or implant. As the patients and volunteer subjects undergoing MRI research scans are enrolled in a research study, there is typically no benefit versus risk evaluation conducted as is done in a clinical facility. In addition, frequently there is not a formal image or data interpretation by a board-certified radiologist with a report entered into the radiology department database (Radiology Information System or RIS). Research studies are conducted on groups of people (to prove a hypothesis), typically not done to provide diagnoses on individual patients. Because of this, pre-procedure screening becomes much more conservative than what is practiced in the clinical MRI department. Pregnant women and volunteer subjects with pacemakers, even MR Conditional pacemakers, are not scanned unless approved by the IRB and the MRI Safety Committee. If there is any risk at all, the radiologist/MRI clinician makes the final decision (1-5, 7, 12). If neither the MRI Manager nor the radiologist/MRI clinician can be contacted for approval, the patient or volunteer subject is not to enter the MR system room nor undergo the research MRI examination.</para>
      <para>Most biomedical devices and implants are considered "MR Conditional" unless they are made completely from nonmetallic and non-conducting components such as plastic or nylon (1, 3-5, 7). Each manufacturer of a biomedical device or implant determines the specific conditions under which their product can safely undergo an MRI examination. In research studies, the scan parameters are selected and typically maintained across all scans of all individuals participating in that particular research study. Therefore modification of scan parameters in order to adhere to safety conditions may not be acceptable for the aim of the research study. Any alterations to previously set scan parameters may result in the exclusion of certain participants' data in the study.</para>

The shorter screening form for visitors and other similar individuals is completed first and reviewed by the researcher. All metals and potential projectiles including jewelry, watches, hair accessories, external hearing aids, and other related items are removed and secured in a locker.

          <para>MRI pre-procedure screening forms should be comprehensive but the information contained should be easily understood, therefore, not too technical nor should it contain too much medical jargon. The MRI Safety Committee reviews and updates these forms on a regular basis, typically every six months.

        <title>Static Magnetic Field</title>
        <para>Metallic items that are attracted to a magnet are referred to as ferromagnetic (1-9, 15). Examples of ferromagnetic materials include iron and certain types of steel. Some examples of nonferromagnetic materials include aluminum, copper, brass, lead, nickel, titanium, cobalt, mercury, chromium, platinum, and gold. It is important to remember that often metals are a mixture (alloy) that makes it difficult to easily determine if a given item is ferromagnetic even if the percentage of each element present is known. Testing by very strong handheld magnet is typically the only way to determine if a specific item will be attracted to the magnet of the MR system, remembering that handheld magnets are generally never as strong as the MRI, such as 1.5 T or 3 T (1-5).</para>
        <para>Every precaution must be taken to ensure that ferromagnetic items are not taken into the MR system room. Given the shielding present in most scanners, the spatial magnetic field gradient of the static magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>) can be quite short and steep. Therefore, the distance traversed between a ferromagnetic item feeling no attraction, to quickly being pulled into the MR system can be quite small. This translational attraction is dependent upon several conditions including the strength and spatial gradient of the static magnetic field, magnet design (e.g., long-bore versus short-bore), the degree of attraction due to mass and geometry of the object, the type of retention, location, orientation, time in place (i.e., for implants), and other factors.</para>
        <para>Items in the patient preparation room or any rooms located close (Zones 2 and 3) to the MR system room (Zone 4) must be clearly identified with labels indicating that they may not be taken into the scanner room at any time for any reason (1-4, 6, 7). Some of these items may include emergency (i.e., crash) carts, laundry carts, storage cabinets, and chairs. Recommended items that reside in the patient preparation room should be identified and labeled as MR Safe, MR Conditional, or MR Unsafe. In a MRI research facility, it is realistic to expect that some items that reside in the control room as well as the volunteer subject/patient preparation room will be MR Unsafe. This is especially true because in the research setting there is often hardware and devices that are under development (prototypes). Therefore, labels indicating MR Unsafe are absolutely necessary for such items. The labels used for this purpose should be those defined by the ASTM International (1-4, 6, 9). Figure 4 shows the proper labels for marking purposes related to MR Safe, MR Conditional, and MR Unsafe.</para>

        <para>Heating of the patient and potential subsequent burns are serious concerns in the MRI examination. Because patients are not well, it is imperative that everything is done to ensure that precautions are put into place prior to scans beginning, and also that communication with the patient is ongoing during the examination. Concerns range from an increased sensation of overall warmth adding to the already present feeling of discomfort due to their condition to local (focal) thermal injury. Three different values are currently reported in the scanner's software to the operators including SAR, B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>, and SAE (specific absorbed energy) or SED (specific energy dose).</para>
        <para>The specific absorption rate (SAR) is a means of characterizing the absorption of radiofrequency (RF) energy in human tissue and is typically reported in watts per kilogram (W/kg) (1-6, 10, 16). SAR is primarily dependent on the following parameters: imaging frequency, type and number per repetition time (TR) of RF pulses, type of transmit RF coil, anatomy exposed to the transmitting RF coil, and patient weight (and height on some MR systems). The measurement of SAR is typically reported on MR systems as whole body averaged and peak values. In general, as SAR increases, the number of slices available in a given imaging sequence is reduced in order to decrease the whole body averaged SAR level. Realistically, the only modifiable parameters available to the MRI operator to reduce SAR are the repetition time, degree of flip angle(s), number of flip angles per TR (echo train or turbo factor) including presaturation bands and chemical presaturation, and/or number of slices, unless the researcher can change the transmit RF coil or move to a lower static</para>
        <para>magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>) MR system. Entering the incorrect weight of the patient or volunteer subject is risky and could result in increased RF energy being deposited into the patient, potentially resulting in a burn (10).</para>
        <para>B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> values have recently been added to the RF and heating parameters being reported in the MR system software and also to the list of conditions for biomedical implants and devices. "B<subscript>1+</subscript>" (B<subscript>1</subscript> plus) is the part of the applied RF that is used in imaging as opposed to "B<subscript>1-</subscript>" (B<subscript>1</subscript> negative) that is not used in imaging but contributes to heating. "RMS" (root mean squared) is an averaging technique. B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is part of the equation determining the SAR for a given scan but it is also a potentially more accurate means of reporting the RF power that is being transferred by the RF transmit coil. For that reason, it may be more important as an indicator of heating in the presence of biomedical devices and implants. SAR, however, should always be monitored to minimize discomfort for patients especially in those individuals who cannot properly regulate their heating due to disease conditions present and any pharmaceutical therapies they may be undergoing (4).</para>
        <para>SAE (specific absorbed dose) or SED (specific energy dose) have historically been set to a limit of 60 minutes for a maximum of 14.4 kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg). These RF limitations are in place due to longer MRI examination times. The maximum is calculated by 4 watts per kilogram (W/kg) multiplied by one hour (3600 seconds) (6).</para>
        <para>Risks surrounding the RF electromagnetic fields (B<subscript>1</subscript>) include the heating of metallic objects or devices, associated components, and/or the surrounding tissues. The increased heating can result in burns to the patient or volunteer subject, and/or damage to the MR system and RF coils. Burn scenarios include the exposure (close proximity) to a transmit RF coil, focus of RF energy in a specific area (i.e., the antenna effect), currents being induced in conductors (e.g., cables, metallic devices of certain lengths and human beings), reflected power (using RF shields, mylar/space blankets or aluminum foil), and an inappropriate use of an RF coil (1-7, 10).</para>
        <para>Procedures to prevent currents being induced in conductors, and the proper positioning and insulation of cables, RF coils, devices and human subjects must be utilized for all MRI examinations especially those using the RF body coil to transmit RF energy (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>). In addition, all loop formations must be prevented including cables forming loops, cables forming loops with other cables, and cables forming loops with human subjects (1-7, 10). Loops can be defined as crossing and/or touching, or changing direction within the scanner (e.g., a cable runs through the bore, then turns and runs back through the bore a second time) (1-7, 10, 11). Loops in cables present in the MR system bore become a greater risk as the loop becomes larger. For example, if an ECG cable is attached to a patient or volunteer subject via electrodes, the cable runs then out the back of the magnet, turns and returns through the scanner bore to its electrical connection at the front of the scanner. This forms a very large and potentially dangerous loop. Cables on RF coils are sometimes too long. Placing a sponge or pad to separate the smaller unpreventable loops of the cable should prevent induced currents.</para>
        <para>Attention must be given to the potential for patient burns occurring due to the human body acting as a conductor. A gap 1-cm of air must be guaranteed between anatomy within the confines of the transmitting RF coil using sponges and pads to separate and insulate (1-</para>
        <para>7, 10, 11). For example, during any scan in which the RF body coil is used as the transmit RF coil, hands should not be clasped together, hands should not rest on forehead during breast MRI examinations, hands should not rest against hips, and calves (lower leg) should not touch. Pads or sponges may need to be positioned between the legs from upper thigh to feet to ensure no loops are formed. In addition to the potential for peripheral nerve stimulation due to time-varying gradient magnetic fields, these types of contact or any other combinations should be avoided due to the risk of providing a route for induced currents to flow.</para>
        <para>In the research environment, many prototype devices are designed and constructed to be used while imaging patients and volunteer subjects. These are either used alone or simultaneously with other product or prototype devices. Individuals possessing the appropriate expertise must complete extensive testing to ensure these prototype devices can be used safely within the magnetic environment. The device design and safety risks, if present, are described in the human study protocol to be approved by the IRB prior to use. In addition, consultation with the MRI Manager is required before use in the scanner room.</para>
        <para>Utilizing different static magnetic field strengths within the same research facility necessitates the possession of knowledge regarding RF bandwidth, its dependence upon the static magnetic field, and interaction with certain lead lengths (as applicable) as well as the human body. This is critical in the prevention of not only image artifacts but also potential risks for burns. For example, imaging the brain at 3-T versus that of 1.5-T means the RF frequency is 128-MHz versus 64-MHz. The brain then encounters more "half wavelengths" at 3-T resulting in a B<subscript>1</subscript> inhomogeneity (dielectric resonance) that is seen as brightness in the center of the axial brain images (1-10, 17, 18). While SAR (RF energy deposited into the human body) increases by the square root of 2 at 3-T versus that at 1.5-T resulting in increased patient heating. However, increased SAR is not always present in the event of a patient burn due to induced currents. For example, dependent upon a given lead length, there may be less resultant heating due to standing waves at 3-T (128-MHz) versus 1.5-T (64-MHz), as reported by Shellock, et al. (19).</para>
        <para>Due to the many different designs of RF coils from major MR system manufacturers and third-party vendors, it is critical that specific instructions be followed when utilizing these coils. This is especially true of the so-called "array" coils available as product versions since the early 1990s. Various designs of RF array coils include coupled, isolated, or phased. Some of these designed to image large areas of the body (e.g., cardiac, torso and abdomen) are manufactured as two parts, one to be positioned anteriorly and the other, posteriorly. Preventing these particular RF coils from overlapping at the sides of the patient or volunteer subject may be a requirement to prevent interactions resulting in excessive heating and possible burns. Sponges or pads must always be present or placed between the RF coil and the anatomy being imaged, some of which are provided by the manufacturer. This is to prevent inappropriate loading that can potentially result in malfunction of the RF coil and subsequent disproportionate heating.</para>
        <para>Positioning one RF coil inside of another for MR imaging is generally something that should never be done unless the coils are specifically designed by the manufacturer to do so safely. For example, an earlier version of the endorectal coil was used to image the prostate in conjunction with a pelvic phased array coil. To proceed safely, researchers must</para>
        <para>first consult the MRI Manager, MRI research technologist, or lab director (MRI scientist or Ph.D.) of the research facility. Finally, an RF coil should never be left unplugged and in the bore of the scanner during an MRI examination which may result in heating of the unplugged RF coil and resulting in a burn to the subject or patient and/or damage to the hardware and scanner.</para>

      <title>Time-Varying Gradient Magnetic Fields</title>
      <para>Risks associated with the time-varying gradient magnetic fields are due to the rapid switching to spatially localize during MR imaging (1-5, 7, 19, 20). This rapid switching is made up of two parts, the size [maximum amplitude measured in milliTesla per meter (mT/m)] and the speed [slew rate measured in milliTesla per meter per millisecond (mT/m/msec)]. As a current is made to flow in a conductor moving through a static magnetic field, a flowing current can also be induced in a static conductor when exposed to a rapidly changing magnetic field.</para>
      <para>Other risks include peripheral nerve stimulation and auditory effects that are associated with the time-varying gradient magnetic fields (1-5, 7, 19, 20). While peripheral nerve stimulation due to the slew rate is a reality, it is subjective and, therefore, difficult to determine exactly which patients and volunteer subjects will experience this sensation. While it can be perceived as painful or extreme pressure, it has not been reported to result in residual effects. Some of the MR systems offer options to image under reduced slew rates, thereby minimizing the risk.</para>
      <para>Manufacturers of MR systems continue to devise methods to reduce the acoustic noise generated by gradient magnetic fields and this topic is covered in detail in another chapter in this textbook. New imaging sequences, especially those being designed in research facilities are often rapid, increasing the noise level. Therefore, it is essential to use earplugs or other hearing protection accessories and devices rated appropriately by the noise reduction ratings (NRR). In addition, it is of equal importance that the earplugs be placed correctly within the ear canal. Researchers are to check the placement of the earplugs before moving the patient or volunteer into the scanner's bore. Headphones (earmuffs) are recommended for use in conjunction with earplugs to provide maximum protection during scans of the body and extremities. Researchers are required to instruct their patients and volunteer subjects to notify them using the squeeze bulb or verbally through the intercom system if the earplugs become loose, fall out, or if the noise of the scanner is bothersome or painful so that the examination can be immediately stopped. Posters demonstrating the procedure for correct placement of earplugs should be posted within each of the research MR system rooms for easy referral for researchers and their patients and volunteer subjects. If earplugs cannot be positioned appropriately, the patient or volunteer subject should not be scanned. If headphones are used alone, the NRR should be at least 30-dB of protection that is provided including any earplugs that fit inside of the headphones, some of which deliver audio instructions during research studies.</para>

Note that ECG (EKG) cables should not be looped and must exit the bore of the MR system directly away from the patient.</para>

      <para>Having general policies for managing individuals with biomedical devices and implants are never a good idea because testing has not been conducted on all implants, there tend to be exceptions, new devices are being developed on an ongoing basis, and implants and devices are approved for safe scanning under different MR conditions (4, 5).</para>
      <para>Risks are dependent upon many criteria including the static magnetic field strength, spatial gradient of the static magnetic field, ferromagnetic properties of the implant or device [composition, mass and geometry, passive versus active, and method of activation (electrically, magnetically, or mechanically)], and/or location and orientation of the implant or device [type of tissue, retention means (scarring, sutures, cement, etc.)], adjacent vital anatomic structures, and other factors (1-4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21-23).</para>
      <para>To accurately evaluate the conditions under which a patient or volunteer subject with an implant or device can safely undergo an MRI examination, specific information must be</para>
      <para>obtained including the name of the manufacturer of the device or implant, composition of the material, date surgically placed, anatomical location, name of surgeon and hospital, and/or reason for placement of implant or device (1-4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21-23). The more information that can be obtained about the implant or device, the easier it will be to make a knowledgeable and accurate decision. Patients are sometimes given cards to carry with information from the manufacturer about the implant or device. In addition, contacting manufacturers or reviewing their website can provide the necessary information. The decision to undergo the MRI examination, however, should never be made from a verbal reply only (e.g., "The surgeon said it was ok to scan."). Dependent upon the type of implant or device, the MRI Manager or the radiologist/MRI clinician from the MRI Safety Committee should make the decision for the patient or volunteer subject to undergo the MRI procedure. For more complex devices such as cardiac pacemakers and neurostimulation systems, it is the radiologist/MRI clinician who must make the final decision not the MRI Manager or MRI facility manager (1-4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 19, 21-23). As stated earlier, the patients and volunteer subjects undergoing MRI procedures are enrolled in a research study, therefore, they are considered "volunteers" for the research study. Thus, there is typically no benefit versus risk evaluation conducted as is done in a clinical facility.</para>
      <para>If the implant or device is identified to be MR Conditional, then the set of MRI scan parameters as set down in the research protocol must be reviewed to ensure it is capable of being modified to ensure that the specific conditions are met for safe scanning without affecting the outcome of the research study. These modifications to the scan parameters and protocol must be accepted and approved by the principal investigator (PI) of the research study.</para>
      <para>Body piercing jewelry and cosmetic jewelry may pose a hazard to a study subject or patient undergoing MRI (24-26). Therefore, in general, all individuals must remove metallic body piercing and cosmetic jewelry before being involved in research MRI examinations (24-26). Because there is no benefit versus risk evaluation conducted for research scans, even the smallest amount of risk must be removed. Patients and volunteer subjects with body piercing jewelry and cosmetic jewelry that cannot be removed are not permitted to undergo research MRI examinations.</para>

      <title>Screening Tools</title>
      <para>A list of common projectiles that have made their way into MR systems should be provided to researchers to ensure that they remember what items could be problematic. For example, paper clips, staples, hairpins, barrettes and other hair accessories, jewelry and watches, keys, hearing aids, scissors, pocketknives, tools, flashlights, metal pens, clipboards, notebooks, money clips, cell phones, and other similar objects.</para>
      <para>Quality handheld magnets are another valuable investment to be made for checking equipment, imaging accessories, and hair accessories and jewelry (worn by researchers) (1-4, 7). To check any of these items, they must be removed from the body and placed on a hard surface over which the handheld magnet is placed. Handheld magnets should never be used to detect the presence of ferrous metal in or on the body (1-4, 7). Strong handheld magnets are available in several forms. The most valuable is a neodymium magnet (1200-Gauss or higher). The use of a handheld magnet of a lower strength is discouraged.</para>
      <para>Reference materials including books and websites can be very helpful in the gathering of current information concerning many aspects of MRI safety and screening. Publications from the American College of Radiology (ACR) are comprehensive documents that should be carefully reviewed by the MRI Safety Committee members (1). Utilizing reference materials and websites are especially helpful for the evaluation of biomedical devices and implants. It should be remembered, however, that these are for reference only and should never be used as the sole piece of evidence to decide whether the patient or volunteer subject should undergo the MRI examination. This decision is made by the radiologist or MRI clinician.</para>
      <para>Websites to consult are those from the manufacturer of the biomedical device or implant which provide information and conditions under which a particular device can safely be exposed to all parts of the MRI examination involving the respective electromagnetic fields. Websites such as www.mrisafety.com (created and maintained by Frank G. Shellock, Ph.D.) provide educational documents and testing results for thousands of biomedical devices and implants (13). In addition, other websites such as www.imrser.org, provide a wealth of information about safety and pre-procedure screening in the MRI environment that can be used by those on the MRI Safety Committee to keep their knowledge of MRI safety current (14). A textbook entitled, "Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices," is an information resource that is fully updated on an annual basis (3). This is an extremely valuable yet inexpensive investment for all MRI departments, both research and clinical.</para>
      <para>Participation in a worldwide MRI technologist automatic email list server is also helpful in adding to one's arsenal of knowledge in MRI safety and screening (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). Questions are answered, suggestions made, and issues discussed on a daily basis. In this manner, a wealth of information is being shared freely without cost to the participants. However, time is required to triage the emails and read the ones particularly valuable to a given research facility.</para>
      <para>Ferromagnetic detections systems (FMDS), devices that identify ferromagnetic materials, have recently replaced the metal detectors initially thought to be an important part of the fully equipped MRI department in the 1980s. Conventional metal detectors quickly became viewed as a waste of funds given the many issues surrounding them including overdependence by users, the generation of false-positives and false-negatives, the function-related dependence upon size and mass of the metallic object, the sensitivity setting of the device, and other issues. Currently there are several different companies manufacturing a variety of designs for FMDS and a chapter is devoted to this topic in this textbook. These devices can be very helpful in preventing injuries from larger ferromagnetic objects such as oxygen tanks, IV poles, infusion machines, gurneys, hospital beds, and many other items that have found their way into MRI environments over the years. Most of these situations resulted in expensive damage to the MR systems and RF coils. Others resulted in injuries to healthcare workers and patients and at least one death involving a patient. A report by Shellock and Karacozoff (27) indicated that a FMDS may also be used to identify ferromagnetic implants and foreign bodies.</para>

If approved to enter the scanner room, the visitor completes the appropriate screening form that is then reviewed by an MRI safety-trained individual. The visitor then checks all pockets by placing their hands inside of each and removes all potential projectiles in addition to jewelry, watches, hair accessories and hearing aids.</para>

Having an MRI technologist present not only ensures safety for individuals present and the MR systems, it prevents modifications from being made to the MRI suite and its contained equipment.

Housekeeping and maintenance staff are never to enter the MR system rooms (Zone 4) at any time. Dependent upon the location of the fringe field in the scanner control room (Zone 3), housekeeping and maintenance may not be given automatic access to that area. Cleaning and maintenance are scheduled for each of the MRI suites when the MRI Manager, building manager, or MRI technologist is available to provide full time monitoring.</para>

      <title>PREPARATION OF PATIENTS AND VOLUNTEER SUBJECTS</title>
      <para>During the scheduling process for patients and volunteer subjects, it should be communicated clearly that specific items should be left at home including all jewelry, body piercing jewelry, hair accessories, and undergarments with metallic fibers or components. Facial</para>
      <para>makeup should not be worn because some can result in an irritation to the skin from tiny metallic particles and/or cause an imaging artifact. Hair products can also contain components of metallic glitter or other compounds that pose a problem for MRI (e.g., hair concealment spray). Artificial hair extensions have proven to be problematic for imaging of the brain due to the resulting lack of homogeneity and failure of magnetic field shimming due to the presence of the synthetic material that is present. Wigs and hairpieces should be removed or closely checked underneath for any hairpins that may be in place.</para>
      <para>Having all patients and volunteer subjects change out of street clothes into scrubs or gowns that do not have pockets is required for all MR examinations (1-6). This policy takes pockets out of the equation and allows easier visual access to ensure that items that may be problematic have been removed. Street clothing that contains antimicrobial solutions can act as a conductor in the bore of the MR system resulting in patient heating and subsequent burns. It is also a way to remind the patients and volunteer subjects that preparation for entering the MRI environment is a serious issue and that their safety is considered paramount by the researchers conducting the MRI examinations. Compare the costs associated with the purchase of disposable scrubs and those provided by a laundry service. It can be the case that disposable scrubs are less expensive over time. Disposable foot covers are also a requirement for patients and volunteer subjects. Whether placed over bare feet or socks, it ensures some additional cleanliness in the MRI area but, more importantly, the dots on the bottom of the foot covers assist in the prevention of slipping and possible injuries.</para>
      <para>All personal items belonging to patients and volunteer subjects must be secured in a locker within the MRI suite. This process facilitates a conversation between the researchers and the patient or volunteer subject to ensure that items will not be taken into the scanner</para>

      <para>room or the MR system. Leaving personal items of any kind out on counters, especially jewelry or wallets, can be problematic. This can lead to a patient or volunteer subject making a claim that "something is missing". Glasses can be worn into the scanner room but should never be worn by the patient or volunteer subject into the bore of the MR system due to the metallic components (e.g. small screws) that will result in artifacts in images and data acquired. Pillows or toys from home should never be allowed in the scanner room nor scanner bore unless fully checked with a strong handheld magnet first. Items such as these can easily hide the presence of a piece of ferromagnetic material.</para>
      <para>It is valuable to have a checklist present and a "stop, look, and feel" policy and procedure before entering the MR system room with the patient or volunteer subject (1-4, 6). This is especially important in research facilities that may have patients and volunteer subjects arriving by wheelchair or gurney, and/or with IV poles and/or infusion devices. If the MR system table does not undock to be moved to the patient preparation room for transfer of the patient or volunteer subject, an acceptable (i.e., MR Safe or MR Conditional) wheelchair and/or gurney should also be available. All of these items should be included on the checklist to ensure no unsafe items from the outside make their way into the scanner room and that all conditions are mets. In addition, checking under sheets and blankets is also a requirement before entering the scanner room.</para>
      <para>Policies and procedures must also be in place for patient and volunteer subject transfers from wheelchairs and gurneys to the MR system table. Only those individuals trained in the proper techniques should perform lifts and transfer of human subjects in order to prevent injuries. Depending on the number of patient/volunteer transfers necessary, purchasing a patient lift sling may prove to be indispensable.</para>
      <para>Patients and volunteer subjects participating in a research study that requires the administration of a contrast media intravenously undergoes the intra-catheter placement in the patient preparation room immediately prior to the MRI examination. This prevents using valuable MR system time for this type of preparation that can be time consuming in the event that veins are not easily accessed. It also allows for safe intervention in the event the patient experiences syncope (fainting) or other difficulties with the placement of the intra-catheter or needle.</para>
      <para>As previously mentioned, specific instruction for the preparation and placement of earplugs or other hearing protection must be given as well as checking to ensure necessary hearing protection is positioned effectively (1-5). If the MRI examination includes audio delivery via headphones (e.g., fMRI), sanitary covers are required. As hearing damage from exposure to loud noise is cumulative and typically irreversible, this procedure should be given adequate time to complete successfully.</para>
      <para>Research MRI studies may involve more than one individual in a family. There may be times when an entire family is present for the MRI examination. If there are small children being imaged, the entire family may be waiting in the patient preparation room or control room in the MRI suite. Therefore, researchers must be on constant alert, monitoring the whereabouts of each of the family members, especially the children. It is helpful to point out to each family member the areas they can and cannot access. For example, "that is the door into the MR system room, so no one enters that room without one of the researchers</para>
      <para>taking you in." Additionally, it is a good idea to remind parents and spouses who are not going into the scanner room that they cannot enter the area without being properly screened and prepared even if their child or spouse calls out for them. Keeping the scanner room door closed during these studies is always important to ensure that family members are not accidentally "lured" in by the sight of their child or spouse on the table of the MR system. They should be reminded they are to wait in the patient preparation room or in the control room and not wander about the MRI suite.</para>

      <title>POSITIONING AND IMMOBILIZING OF PATIENTS AND VOLUNTEER SUBJECTS</title>
      <para>An explanation pertaining to the MR system and the planned examination is highly recommended for all patients and volunteer subjects. This is the critical first step in securing their trust and compliance. This should include a brief explanation describing the scanner, the room, lighting, fan control, intercom system, and use of the emergency squeeze ball.</para>
      <para>Instructions should also include the value of maintaining position of the anatomy plus control of breathing and swallowing, if pertinent to the anatomy being imaged. Patients and volunteer subjects should be reminded not to rearrange any of the devices or accessories placed in the MR system (Figure 7). If modifications are necessary, the researchers should be immediately notified via the intercom system or squeeze ball to make the requested changes for the patient or volunteer subject. This is especially important for many items including cables and RF coils, mirrors and/or screens used in fMRI studies, GSR (galvanic skin response) or EDA (electrodermal activity) cables, eye trackers, EEG caps and cables, and TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) coils.</para>
      <para>Pads and sponges are strategically placed to immobilize and comfort the patient or volunteer subject. They are also used to provide safety and prevent burns as previously described (1-6). These procedures are especially critical if the RF body coil is being used to transmit RF energy.</para>
      <para>Whenever the patient or volunteer subject is moving into or out of the MR system, the researchers are to closely observe the process to ensure it is completed without injury to the person being scanned or damage to the equipment or accessories. Furthermore, the patients and volunteer subjects should be instructed to notify the researchers via the intercom system and/or squeeze ball if they feel or experience anything uncomfortable or painful. They should be reminded that the fan can be turned on or the speed increased if they become too warm, or blankets can be added if they become too cold.</para>
      <para>After leaving the MR system room and returning to the control room, the researcher is to immediately check in with the patient or volunteer subject using the intercom system to inquire about their present state. Continually notifying the patient or volunteer of the upcoming scan time, table (cradle) motion, and pre-scan (tuning) procedure is very important as part of maintaining communication. This will reassure the individual that he or she has not been left alone or abandoned. This communication should take place at the end of each scan to inquire about the patient's or volunteer subject's condition as well as immediately before each subsequent scan, coaching the individual to remain still, breathe quietly, and to</para>

        <title>EMERGENCY PROCEDURES</title>
        <para>Instruction in emergency procedures is provided to researchers as part of the training for the MRI Safety Policies and Procedures (5). This includes fire and earthquake training but is particularly focused on emergent removal of the patient or volunteer subject from the MR system and the room, itself (e.g., in the event of a magnet quench or patient failure to respond).</para>
        <para>The researchers are instructed in the proper evacuation techniques to follow if the patient or volunteer subject should become unresponsive. This includes removing the cradle (table top) from the scanner using the emergency handle that releases it from the "trolley unit" that pulls and pushes the cradle in and out of the scanner. Importantly, for some MR systems</para>
        <para>with detachable tables, the cradle must be in the "home" position (moved out of the bore to the end of the table) before the table can be undocked from the front of the MR system and moved out of the room. If the research scanner does not have a patient table that undocks and rolls away from the scanner, an appropriate gurney (i.e., MR Safe or MR Conditional) must be readily available in the MRI suite as well as an appropriate transport board or roller system. The transport board or roller system allows the researchers to safely and quickly move the patient or volunteer subject from the table onto the gurney without experiencing possible injuries.</para>
        <para>Selecting the appropriate pedal at the foot end of the table undocks the MRI patient table. On some MR systems, there exists a backup release handle typically located under or near the docking unit at the housing of the scanner. Arm rails should be raised to prevent the patient or volunteer subject from falling off of the table during the transport out of the room to the patient preparation room.</para>
        <para>In the case of a serious emergency, one researcher is responsible for calling first responders (e.g., 911) if the MRI research facility is a stand-alone building and not attached to a hospital. This researcher then promptly goes to the front door of the MRI research facility to receive the paramedics and quickly direct them to the appropriate MRI area. The second researcher is responsible for moving the patient or volunteer subject out of the MR system, undocking the table and moving the table into the patient preparation room, closing the scanner room door, and monitoring the individual until the paramedics arrive. Emergent care must never be conducted in the scanner room due to the increased risk of metal objects being brought into the MRI environment, as previously stated. The MRI pre-procedure screening form that was completed by the subject should be made available to the paramedics when they arrive as they will need information regarding current conditions and medications.</para>
        <para>For a quench, the procedures include information for a deliberate (controlled) quench (e.g., in a 'life or death' situation) and a spontaneous quench (e.g., in the event of an earthquake or substantial problem with the magnet of the MR system) (1-5). Researchers would be responsible to deliberately activate a quench if an individual, for example, is pinned to the magnet by a large metal object and is unable to get loose, and/or has experienced life-threatening injuries. A comprehensive set of instructions with easy-to-follow bullets is posted in the MRI suites for a quench. During hands-on training, the location and function of the quench button is reviewed with researchers. In the event of a spontaneous quench, researchers are instructed to quickly remove the patient or volunteer subject from the scanner and turn on the emergency exhaust fan in the room to remove any collection of helium gas that may form.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>Potential risks exist in the MRI environment for, not only the patient or volunteer subject, but also for MRI technologists, healthcare professionals, physicians, and others who only intermittently access the MR system room. This becomes a more complex issue in the research setting because there is often more freedom for a wide variety of individuals present in the facility including researchers and scientists, research assistants, students and postdocs, physicians, visiting scholars, and research and administrative staff. Intermittent but routine visitors to the research MRI facility include manufacturer representatives and scientists from various companies developing products, camera and photography personnel taping for television programs and documentaries, and other specialized healthcare professionals from nursing, anesthesia and respiratory therapy. Insofar as many of these individuals may not be healthcare professionals but investigators engaging in a systematic activity to acquire knowledge, it is often difficult to successfully manage all MRI safety policies and procedures that are set down by the MRI Safety Committee. This requires ongoing moni-</para>
      <para>toring of all those using the research scanners including regular verbal and written reminders. This continued one-on-one communication should convey to the researchers a genuine interest in their safety, as well as the patients and volunteer subjects, and the MR system, ancillary equipment, and ultimately, an interest in the successful completion of the research study.</para>
      <para>Continuing communication, both facilitated and offered, is a critical tool in maintaining safety in the MRI environment. In addition, any and all assumptions must be entirely removed, as they are certainly the beginning of a dangerous and risky path for all present. As George Bernard Shaw (Irish playwright and a co-founder of the London School of Economics, 1856 to 1950) said, "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place".</para>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <para>During the last three decades, interventional and intraoperative uses of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have evolved into important applications for image-guided therapy and surgical procedures (1, 2). These two unique uses of MRI technology will be referred to as interventional MRI or "iMRI" in this chapter. Because iMRI involves toolsets unlike those used in diagnostic MRI, it presents multiple challenges in designing a safe work environment (3). The complex and unique workflow of therapeutic and surgical procedures performed in the iMRI suite may involve anesthesia and new approaches for perioperative and intraoperative care. These departures from standard uses of MRI requires the safe translation of clinical applications from the interventional suite and the operating room (OR) into the iMRI setting. For example, percutaneous needle-based procedures and thermal ablations (4-6), catheter-based intravascular interventions (7, 8), endoscopies (9, 10), and "open" surgeries (11-14) have special instrumentation and access requirements. The therapy-related armamentarium for each type of procedure can introduce challenges for effective integration into the iMRI environment (15, 16), but also for safe operation. In this active and potentially chaotic setting, assuring safety for patients and staff members is paramount. This chapter presents the most important aspects of safety in the iMRI environment which is based on more than twenty years of experience with multiple types of iMR systems spanning a large number of clinical applications at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH).</para>
        <para>The design of interventional suites and operating rooms requires consideration of various workflow paradigms related to the procedures. If image-guidance is involved, the imaging systems should be closely integrated with the procedural workflow (17). However, since many imaging systems can potentially injure or harm the patient and staff, careful consideration of the unique safety issues are central to the design of safe and effective paradigms. This concern is particularly true in the iMRI environment. Several unique factors must be considered when an iMRI suite is designed and built. Furthermore, when an MR system is located in an OR environment, the requirements are even more complex, since MRI safety must be combined with other patient safety measures (18). If an MR system is co-located with an X-ray system (XMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) system, or computed tomography (CT) system, then MRI safety issues are compounded with concerns regarding system interactions and the use of ionizing radiation (19).</para>
        <para>The Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) Suite at the BWH consists of three procedure rooms: (1) the central OR housing the operating table, a ceiling-mounted single-plane X-ray system, a surgical navigation system, surgical microscope, and an ultrasound system, flanked by (2) a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) room on one side, and (3) an MR system room on the other side with integrated cryotherapy, ablative laser, and targeting systems. The 3-T Siemens Verio MR scanner was modified by IMRIS (Minnetonka, MN) to move into the OR via ceiling rails. Sliding "barn" doors separate the PET/CT and MR system rooms from the central OR (20). Each procedure room has a separate entrance to the control corridor and support spaces (Figure 1). The complexity of this space results in the inclusion of nearly every safety challenge experienced by other iMRI facilities.</para>

        <para>Minimally invasive procedures performed entirely in the MR system room are conducted iteratively, with the patient scanned at isocenter in the scanner, then withdrawn partially from the bore of the MR system in order to undergo the intervention with an "in-and-out" approach. All devices and instruments used in this setting must be MR Safe or MR Conditional.</para>
        <para>In contradistinction, a combination of conventional MR Unsafe, ferromagnetic surgical instruments and devices are used in the central OR. Prior to translation of the mobile 3-Tesla iMR system into the central OR for the imaging portion of the procedure, these tools and devices are moved outside of the 5-gauss line or removed from the room, entirely.</para>
        <para>To acquire a PET/CT scan during an OR procedure, the patient is shuttled along a removable bridge that connects the OR table with the PET/CT table, through the sliding doors that adjoin the rooms, and into the adjacent stationary PET/CT scanner. Although the MRI risks are absent, the hazards associated with moving an intubated patient with intravenous access are present.</para>
        <para>The AMIGO Suite will be used in this chapter as an example to illustrate the safety issues for iMR systems and to propose solutions. The valuable perspectives of other groups related to this topic have been previously published (21-27), and various competing para-</para>
        <para>digms have emerged for suite design and procedural workflow (28). Notably, the scope of iMRI procedures are expanding (29). The facilities built to support iMRI are often unique, reflecting design elements required by the specific purpose of the space. Although safety issues related to iMRI can be challenging, they can be minimized and managed through effective policies, procedures, staff training, access controls, and facility design to promote best practices and the correction of safety lapses.</para>

      <title>DESIGNING FOR SAFETY</title>
      <para>Architectural design is one useful means of facilitating desired behaviors for MRI safety. Selecting a space remote from the main OR enables the staff to enter the mindset that they are not in their usual working environment and, thus, they must adapt their habits to the iMRI setting. A remote location further limits the flow of staff members, not involved with the procedure, into this particular space. In emergency situations such as codes, the location has both positive and negative attributes. The advantage is that it affords the opportunity to post an MRI Safety Screener at the entrance to ensure that members of the responding team do not enter into the space unless they have undergone screening and determined that they can safely enter the area. The disadvantage of a remote location is the potential delay in the</para>

      <para>arrival time of the first responders. This can be overcome by local policies such as in the AMIGO Suite, which is located near a cardiology recovery room, where anesthesia staff members from that space, rather than from the more remote hospital OR, are assigned as first responders.</para>
      <para>The AMIGO Suite was laid out in accordance with recommendations from the American College of Radiology (ACR) document (30) pertaining to the MRI environment by which the first layer of swipe-card access enables staff members to enter from Zone I (public space) into Zone II (a restricted staff members, gowning area) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>). A second swipe-card access point (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3A</emphasis>) is located at the entrance to Zone III (the control room corridor). Access points into Zone II and III are monitored by security cameras connected to the Flow Coordinator's desk and to the hospital's security department.</para>
      <para>The MR system room is classified as Zone IV, mandating that MR Unsafe equipment is not allowed to enter the area. Depending on the current location of the MR scanner, the central OR shifts between Zone III (MRI sequestered), where ferromagnetic objects are permitted, and Zone IV (MR system deployed). Before the MR scanner is moved into the central OR, the sliding door that separates the OR from the MR system room is opened to create a single, large radiofrequency (RF) shielded space. Conjoining the spaces enables the MR scanner to move along the ceiling-mounted rails from the MR system room into the central OR. Upon opening the sliding doors, the door between the control corridor and the MR system room automatically locks to prevent staff members from entering the scanner</para>

        <para>room, resulting in a single entry pathway from the control corridor into the conjoined OR/MR system room.</para>
        <para>Additional oversight of this space due to this design results from patients transiting into the appropriate procedure room via the control corridor. This practice is different from typical interventional spaces, such as angiography labs, in which a second doorway into the procedure spaces allows the control rooms to be free of patient traffic. A second entry point in an iMRI suite represents a potential vulnerability, especially if proper line-of-site from the control corridor to the door is obscured and, thus, the desired restriction of staff members' access would be compromised. The complexity of controlling access into the MR system room (Zone IV) is increased at sites (i.e., unlike the AMIGO Suite), where a single scanner services more than one OR.</para>
        <para>The doors into the procedure rooms have two operating modes: (1) activation by a push plate, or (2) activation by a keypad code entry. The keypad code is held by only a few core staff members. Controlling or eliminating pathways for the flow of staff members helps to ensure that no MR Unsafe devices or instruments are brought into the room with the MR system, particularly during off hours.</para>
        <para>With regard to the AMIGO Suite, a dual-stage ferromagnetic detection (FMD) system was added to the the Zone III control corridor (Figure 3B). Although not standard at the time of initial design and construction, the use of such systems has become a standard Facilities Guideline Institute requirement for all future iMRI installations. A screening FMD system is located near the flow coordinator's desk that is used for first-stage screening. The second stage screening is accomplished via FMD gates placed near the doors to the procedure spaces.</para>

Indicator lights above the doors inform staff members regarding which room the MR system is "parked" in, and when the X-ray machine or the laser is in use<emphasis role="bold">(Figure 3B)</emphasis>. Retractable yellow caution belts bar the door when the respective room is not being utilized. While signage is necessary, in reality, it is seldom effective. Physical barriers such as locked doors and limiting entrances are crucial to mitigate risk in the iMRI environment.</para>

      <title>SAFETY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</title>
      <para>Policies and procedures, which can be difficult to standardize, are tailored for site appropriateness. An issue all facilities have in common is the daunting risk inherent to combining medical procedures and iMRI. It has now been many years since the patient fatality (31, 32) that galvanized the MRI community to deal with safety issues centered on diagnostic MRI. Despite policy recommendations and raised awareness since that event (33), there has been an increase in the number of reported accidents related to the MRI environment (34). Recent accidents highlight the continued risk. For example, an experienced staff member was injured at one site (35) and a visitor was fatally wounded at another (36). Risks tend to be greater in the iMRI environment, where ferromagnetic materials such as interventional devices and surgical support equipment are purposely introduced into the environment to facilitate mission critical tasks. In addition to projectile risks, the improper use of necessary equipment can increase the risk of patient burns in association with MRI.</para>

      <para>Whereas suite design can help facilitate safety by limiting or directing the flow within the suite, design alone is incapable of eliminating all hazards. Thus, safety policies and ongoing safety training are required to establish a desired set of acceptable behaviors. As with all policy-based approaches, they are subject to the fallibility of the individual. A clear and effective safety policy is a valuable tool to reduce risk. Establishing a dedicated multidisciplinary core team assigned daily to the iMRI environment is an important factor to formalize, promulgate, and enforce policies and procedures that help to ensure safety within the suite. Primary issues that should be addressed by all iMRI sites include training, access, and safety checklists. Policy governing site-specific issues such as the shared use of space for clinical and research purposes as well as the management of tour groups and vendors should be considered. Other centers have site-specific issues such as the shared use of the installation for interventional and/or intraoperative use and diagnostic imaging (26).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Training and Accreditation</emphasis>All staff members who work in or have duties that require them to have access to the AMIGO Suite must complete highly specific safety training prior to receiving access to the area. Training and testing ensure that all staff members and vendors working in the suite have a clear understanding of policy and procedures and fully comprehend the potential risks associated with MRI, as well as ionizing radiation hazards in the AMIGO Suite environment. Training modules include a general suite orientation, MRI safety, and general radiation safety. Staff members must pass a written exam on MRI safety and have no contraindications to working in the MRI environment, as documented on an MRI safety</para>

        <para>An accredited staff member will have badge access to gain entry to Zone II. In this area, cell phones, pagers, and other ferromagnetic objects are placed in a day locker. A non-ferromagnetic key to the locker remains with the staff member. Badge access is then used to gain entry into Zone III, at which point it is required to sign in at the Flow Coordinator desk and use the FMD system for screening. After substantiating that no ferromagnetic objects are in their possession, the staff members are provided with orange bouffant hats to wear over their existing OR hat, to indicate that they have been screened and may enter Zone IV (Figure 3C). This hat is discarded upon leaving the suite.</para>

        </para>
        <para>In a typical diagnostic MRI environment, the MRI technologists are the primary staff members tasked with ensuring safety. In the iMRI setting, safety challenges require the inclusion and expertise of a larger, more diverse group. In addition to our core team members who have specific roles for each procedure, it has been necessary to create two new roles whose focus is entirely on safety and compliance within the suite during a procedure.</para>
        <para>The first new role is a Safety Screener, stationed at the entrance to the suite between Zone II and Zone III. This team member's job is to ensure that entering staff have complied with requirements to place ferromagnetic items in the day locker. The Flow Coordinator sits at a central location in the suite, and has camera views of the Zone I to Zone II transition, as well as the Zone II to Zone III transition. The Flow Coordinator is responsible for maintaining a sign-in list of all staff members present for a procedure and verifies that individuals entering the AMIGO Suite have undergone all necessary training (by cross-reference to a training database), are properly attired, have removed ferromagnetic items from their person, and have undergone screening using the ferromagnetic detection system. This team member also screens vendors and visitors for contraindications to be in the MRI environment. Another core staff member is stationed facing the entrance into Zone IV to ensure the approved workflow is not broken and no non-approved items are brought into the OR or MR system rooms. The Safety Nurse is responsible for knowing the roles and background of all staff members in the procedure and adjoining space. The Safety Nurse is charged with tracking when and why each device and instrument kit is introduced into the procedure, and ensuring that unneeded equipment is not admitted into the area. He or she administrates the safety checklists in conjunction with the MRI Technologist.</para>
        <para>In addition to the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Pause performed at intervals in all surgeries (37), an MRI Safety Pause has been instituted to mitigate risks prior to bringing the patient into the MR system room or the adjoining OR, as well as prior to transferring the MR scanner into the OR. Figure 4 shows the respective checklists. Each procedure has a checklist tailored to the attending equipment and instruments and is modified to adapt to changes in the procedure as it evolves. The MRI status of each device is noted and</para>

        <para>due to the conductive foil backing. The checklist mandates an accurate instrument count, since consequences of an inaccurate count are increased in the iMRI environment. A ferromagnetic tool left in the surgical field can become a projectile when the patient enters the bore of the scanner. If a metallic tool is touching the patient, an image artifact or even a burn can occur. Although not implemented at our facilities, technology is evolving for automated counting of instruments that can help identify errors (38, 39).</para>
        <para>The MRI Technologist is also tasked with screening the patient prior to the procedure, with the help of nurses and the surgical team. The MRI technologist may reference literature and established criteria to confirm that an implant can be safely imaged. He or she may consult the institutional MRI Safety Team, including the MR Medical Director (Physician), MR Safety Expert (Physicist), and MR Safety Officer (Technologist), as needed. Another role of the MRI technologist is to collect MRI data, sometimes in conjunction with an MRI physicist, and to gather vendor claims about a new device for review by an internal committee before it is used in proximity to the MR system.</para>
        <para>The watchful eyes and constant communication involving the Safety Screener, Flow Coordinator, MRI Technologist, Safety Nurse and other staff members associated with the procedure have prevented many potential errors in the ten years of operation of the AMIGO Suite to build on the successful twenty-six year iMRI history at BWH.</para>

        <para>Staff members including anesthesiologists, nurses, surgeons, interventionalists, radiologists, and MRI technologists should be trained to respond to cardiopulmonary emergencies that may occur either in the MR scanner room or in the OR when the MR system is present. Mock emergency code drills (e.g., code blue) are important for refining the processes and to gain comfort levels surrounding the different situations. Policy and education should exist to prevent responders from other areas from bringing ferromagnetic materials and equipment into any space in which the MR scanner is deployed. Conversely, first responders should not be delayed from assisting the medical team if the MR system is safely sequestered.</para>
        <para>In the AMIGO Suite, the emergency code button has a different meaning from the code button in other areas of the hospital. A special MRI-trained team with swipe-card access responds to the emergency. Although there are devices in development for resuscitation in the MR system room, none are yet commercially available (40, 41). Therefore, the patient undergoing an intervention in the MR system room (Zone IV) is immediately removed from the room and brought to a designated resuscitation area within the suite in Zone III. Some scanners have break-away tables that can serve as a transport table. Scanners with fixed tables require that the patient is transferred to an MR Safe or MR Conditional stretcher. A designated team member should be responsible for shutting and locking the door to the MR system room and maintaining access restrictions, while other staff members expeditiously move the patient to the resuscitation area. The area should have adequate space, monitoring equipment, oxygen, suction, and electrical outlets to facilitate resuscitation and management of the patient.</para>

Staff members who work in the iMRI suite should be subjected to the same screening procedure. However, since the staff members will not be imaged, some contraindications (e.g., body piercing jewelry, joint replacement, etc.) do not need to be considered. Screening forms designed for patients and other individuals (i.e., staff members, visitors, etc.) may be obtained from the website, www.MRIsafety.com.

      <title>Labeling</title>
      <para>The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International has designated definitions (i.e., terminology) for labeling devices, as follows MR Safe, MR Conditional, and MR Unsafe (44). At our institution, candidate instruments for a procedure are tested with a powerful handheld magnet by the nurse, MRI technologist, or MRI physicist before being added to the instrument kit. Instruments used in the OR can be ferromagnetic since they can be safely positioned before the MR scanner is transferred into the OR. In the AMIGO Suite, instruments used in the MR system room must pass ASTM International standard F2052 testing (45), which determines if a handheld instrument or device has the potential to become a projectile in the presence of the magnetic field and involves testing for translational attraction (Figure 5). While the worst-case location is specific to the model of the MR system, even for scanners operating at the same field strength (e.g., Siemens 3-Tesla Skyra versus Siemens 3-Tesla Prisma), this position tends to be in the proximity of the opening of the bore of the MR system.</para>

Although these standards are useful for implants, specific standards and procedures are needed for the task of evaluating items used in iMRI (e.g., robotic actuators, head fixation systems, infusion pumps, AC/DC power adaptors, biopsy trajectory devices, patient positioning devices, etc.) but, at the present time, they do not exist. The MR system manufacturers have their own tests for device evaluation. Accordingly, the end-user is largely reliant on the vendor for providing information for a given device. This information may be distributed by various means including the device user manual, vendor-issued bulletins, and labels on the device, itself. As always, the term MR Conditional has specific meaning on a per device basis, requiring the user to be sophisticated enough to understand the meanings.</para>
      <para>In the AMIGO Suite, a dedicated anesthesia technologist manages and appropriately positions MR Conditional and MR Unsafe anesthesia equipment and devices. As an example of the complexity, a device console may have a different maximum permissible field strength where it can be safely used, which is different from the limit for the AC/DC adaptor that powers it. It is the nature of some surgeries that the anesthesia set-up may be at the patient's left or right based on the surgical approach. As such, equipment is regularly moved. Human vigilance is essential for preventing error. If this process were managed by a larger non-dedicated group of staff members, the likelihood of error would increase.</para>

Practices at the AMIGO Suite reflect an amplification of this recommendation but verify even written vendor claims, because some claims are inaccurate or do not apply to a given MRI setting. If in-house expertise exists, a set of tests can be performed to confirm vendor claims or establish the level of safety of an instrument or device (52).</para>

        <title>Static Magnetic Field-Related Issues</title>
        <para>Although the adverse events associated with diagnostic MRI that are most frequently reported in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and in the United Kingdom (53) are due to burns, the greatest safety concern in environments where MRI-guided open surgeries (e.g., breast, brain, and spine) are performed is the static magnetic field. Such procedures may require the use of MR Unsafe items such as surgical microscopes, electrosurgical units, and light sources. The effect of the static magnetic field drastically increases with proximity to the bore of the MR system. This sudden change in translational attraction gives little warning to a staff member holding a ferromagnetic object as he or she approaches the scanner. Lines indicating the fringe field levels associated with the MR system can be marked on the floor around the scanner to serve as a visual reminder to staff members. In the AMIGO Suite, the 5-gauss fringe field is marked on the floor. The 400-gauss field line is also shown to indicate the limit for the particular anesthesia machine utilized in this setting. The MR system used in the AMIGO Suite can be offset and rotated 180-degrees to enable additional procedural workflows in the scanner room. Therefore, the fringe field markings on the floor are a worst-case superposition of the lines for the two different imaging locations. A second set of lines is present in the OR to depict the fringe field when the scanner is at its third imaging location (Figure 5A). The relationship between the isogauss lines and the force exerted on an object has been carefully studied at our institution (54).</para>
        <para>Translational attraction and torque constitute the greatest risks in the MRI setting. An object may become a projectile as it accelerates in the direction of the spatial gradient of the static magnetic field. Large objects can generate incredible force as they are rapidly drawn into the magnet. As previously stated, our practice is to test all devices, even with MR Safe labels, using a powerful handheld magnet. Additionally, we cautiously introduce larger items into the MR system room with a tether, if necessary, and follow other appropriate procedures to conduct a proper evaluation of magnetic field interactions.</para>

Titanium alloy and ceramic materials are not subjected to magnetic field interactions and cause relatively small artifacts that are the direct result of their negligible magnetic susceptibilities. Various vendors at points in time have produced instruments for the iMRI market (15). Understandably, costs and lead times for these instruments are higher than for conventional instruments. Fortunately, some conventional off-the-shelf instruments are constructed from titanium due to the material's inherent advantage of being lower in weight compared to steel.</para>

          <emphasis role="bold">Image Artifacts Caused by a Device</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) emanating from an active device can manifest in the MR image as a zipper artifact or increased noise across the entire image, depending on the bandwidth of the noise and of the MR system's receiver bandwidth. Vendors may erroneously assume that because their device passes EMI tests at a higher field strength/frequency, their test results can be extended to lower field strengths/frequencies. However, EMI harmonics may be present in the imaging bandwidth at one field strength, but not another. The user may learn this when a patient is undergoing MRI and a zipper artifact obscures the critical anatomy of interest.</para>
        <para>EMI testing may be performed by running the MR system manufacturer's quality assurance scans for noise with and without the device present. The device can be activated, in a stand-by mode, or "off" but plugged in, depending on its state in the clinical setting during imaging. The frequency of the zipper can be identified and can be useful in tracing the source in the electronics. A zipper drifting in frequency usually indicates the source of EMI is the electronics associated with a digital clock in the device. The EMI revealed by such scans may have low enough energy as to not be clinically relevant, so scans from a clinical protocol should also be tested. At our institution, variations in shielding of MR Conditional devices has yielded one instance of a device that did not emit EMI and another that was problematic. A complicated issue, however, is the interactivity of multiple devices. EMI from one device can be carried or amplified by another device resulting in image artifacts when the devices used individually are not problematic. Moreover, EMI from a device may be a function of position within the room. The device may pick up and amplify EMI from a leaky penetration panel, window, or other vulnerable point in the RF shielding. A device placed in the line-of-site of the receive RF coil may induce a zipper artifact, whereas the same device placed on the side of the scanner may not be problematic. A spectrum analyzer with a sniffer loop is a valuable tool in identifying EMI sources. These analyzers are not MR Safe, so long cables are required.</para>
        <para>Image artifacts can be assessed in phantoms by imaging with and without the device under test present. Distortion or signal void due to susceptibility mismatch between the object and the surrounding medium can be evaluated (55). An artifact observed on an MR image is a function of field strength/frequency, pulse sequence parameters (mainly receiver bandwidth and echo time), and the orientation of the object to the static magnetic field of the MR system. Artifacts can change the apparent location of the device, which for example can give rise to inaccurate or unsafe needle targeting associated with a biopsy procedure (56). In open surgery, the susceptibility mismatch between air and tissue can appear as a region of hyperintensity that can mimic contrast-enhanced tissue (57).</para>

      <para>Currents induced by the imaging gradients can interact with the static magnetic field and cause vibrations in a device, which can create ghosting in the image.

Such RF-related artifacts can compromise visualization of the lumen in the presence of a vascular stent (58).</para>
      <para>Artifacts can lead to image misinterpretation due to distortion of geometry, or regionally obscuring or obliterating signal from tissue. The degree of acceptable artifact is subject to the judgment of the physician performing the procedure and the radiologist interpreting the images. If contrast administration during brain tumor resection is repeated, images may be difficult to interpret due to the continued spread of contrast throughout the edematous brain. This problem is not experienced in a comparatively brief diagnostic MRI session. To avoid this problem, some centers reserve the administration of an intravenous contrast agent until the tumor has been resected and then use imaging to assess the completeness of the surgery (59).</para>

Long-term exposure to the static magnetic field impacted the motor's performance and resulted in the feature being unusable.</para>
        <para>The imaging gradients can create a field switching at about 100-Hz to several kilohertz. For the time-varying, gradient magnetic fields, the worst-case scenario location for testing is not at isocenter of the MR system. The fields due to the imaging gradients increase proportional to the distance from isocenter and then fall off outside of the field of view. The peak field is about 30-cm from isocenter and varies across different scanners depending on the features of the gradient coils. The time-varying, gradient magnetic fields can induce eddy currents in the patient and in conducting materials, but is generally not a concern for substantial heating. However, the induced currents in devices can interact with the static magnetic field, creating forces and torques on the device. If the device vibrates and is in contact with the patient, image artifacts can occur. If the device is a part of a positioning stage for needle targeting and the gradients cause vibrations in a component of the device, inaccuracies may occur.</para>

Current safety guidelines for patients that do not consider the presence of devices limit temperature increases in the torso to 2°C or a peak specific absorption rate (SAR) of 8°C to 10-W/kg. The whole-body-averaged SAR is limited to 4-W/kg in the body, and 3.2-W/kg in the head over a 15-minute period (60, 61). RF energy associated with MRI is a concern for heating due to ohmic heating. As previously indicated, most MRI-related adverse events are due to RF-induced patient burns (62).</para>

The worst-case locations occur where the electric field (as opposed to the magnetic field used to create the MR image) is highest.

Any conductor in or near the transmit RF coil, including the patient, has the potential to be involved in RF-induced heating.</para>

As a preventive measure, a cold compress or ice pack can be applied to areas potentially affected by heating. While rare, skin-to-skin contact points should be avoided, since these have been reported to be associated with burns (63). Precautions to prevent excessive heating are of particular importance for patients under sedation or general anesthesia who are unable to notice or report pain. Heating may be minimized with the use of a local transmit RF coil (e.g., quadrature head coil) instead of the body RF coil and judicious selection of pulse sequences and parameters to limit the SAR (65).</para>
        <para>A fiber-optic temperature measurement device with multiple probes is necessary to accurately test for heating. When evaluating MRI-related heated for an implant or device, probes should be placed on or near corners and tips, as well as other discontinuities where the electric field tends to be the highest (66). The design that is used for the phantom to simulate the patient for a proper heating assessment is critical. Importantly, a device in free space will behave differently than a device that is in contact with the patient. For example, our team assessed a carbon-fiber, Jackson table used for positioning patients undergoing spine surgery. No heating was measured with the square piece of material in isolation. When a tissue equivalent load was placed at the corner, a notable temperature elevation was observed.</para>
        <para>Temperature elevations that occur in long conducting wires of a certain length can be sudden and extreme, especially at the tip of the wire.

        <para>that the procedure room is a more familiar setting to the surgeon or interventionalist. In the absence of the static magnetic field, conventional MR Unsafe equipment like a surgical microscope, ultrasound system, and steel instruments can be used. Great care must be taken to manage all devices and instruments before performing MR imaging. As in the AMIGO Suite, before the mobile MR system is translated on ceiling rails into the procedure room, MR Unsafe ceiling-mounted booms, lights, and monitors are pivoted to the walls and other MR Unsafe items are either brought out of the room or moved outside the 5-gauss line (Figure 6).</para>
        <para>Alternatively, with other approaches, the patient can be moved from the OR into the MR system room. The same time out and procedure-specific checklists must be completed prior to moving the patient from the OR into the MR scanner room. In addition to the risk of unaccounted for items becoming projectiles when the patient is moved, there is a risk of extubation or extravasation due to tension on the breathing circuit or intravenous lines, respectively. The anesthesia machine and physiological monitor are tethered by interfaces to the patient and, therefore, these devices must move as a unit with the patient table. A solution to mount the cable connection point for the physiological monitor to the patient table is available. Efforts have also been made to couple a defeatured anesthesia machine to the table to avoid cable tension during transfer (73).</para>
        <para>A commonality across original equipment manufacturers is that the patient stays on a rigid transfer board for the entire procedure. The transfer board is MR Safe and is integrated with both the MR system platform and the surgical table platform. Multiple vendors have variants on the transfer approach. In one case, a manually moved transfer table end-docks with the surgical table, collects the transfer board/patient, then moves into the MR system</para>
        <para>room where it docks with the scanner for imaging (Figure 7). In another variant, the surgical table moves along a floor track to dock with the MRI table before transferring the patient from one table to the other with the transfer board (26) (Figure 8). Single room approaches use a similar transfer concept or have a table that pivots out of the scanner into an area with a relatively low fringe field, where surgery is performed (46, 74) (Figure 9).</para>
        <para>The advantage of the single room solution is the rapid turn around between imaging and intervention. This also comes at the expense of using MR Safe or MR Conditional equipment and regaining needed functionality through ingenuity, or omitting the functionality, potentially compromising the procedure. Alternatively, MR Unsafe devices can be used while managing risk. To minimize patient movement, neurosurgical procedures can be performed with the in-and-out paradigm, in which the patient's head extends from the back of the bore of the scanner to permit the surgical procedure and then back into the MR system for imaging. MR imaging can be achieved by moving the patient approximately one-meter to isocenter (75) (Figure 10). Similarly, abdominal interventions can be performed with this same in-and-out paradigm.</para>

        <title>MR Conditional Equipment</title>
        <para>Although MR Conditional anesthesia machines, ventilators, drug infusion pumps, and physiological monitors are available, the development of MR Conditional anesthesia support equipment is not keeping pace with the development of new procedure enabling devices. While simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring during functional MRI (fMRI) is now common (83), there is no commercially available MR Conditional bi-spectral index device nor peripheral nerve stimulator for assessing the depth of anesthesia. If MR Unsafe devices are used, they must be removed before the MR system is transported into the OR. Furthermore, at the present time, there is no commercially-available, external defibrillator that is MR Conditional. If either cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac instability is noted during an iMRI procedure, the patient must be removed from the MR system room (i.e., Zone IV) before using an external defibrillator. In situations where there is the likelihood of cardiac instability or arrhythmia in non-iMRI environments, external defibrillator/pacing pads may be placed on the patient before the induction of anesthesia. This precaution cannot be done in the MR system room because the metallic foil backing on the pads increases the potential for skin burns, where the pads contact the patient. In this case, the risk of instability or arrhythmia may outweigh the potential benefit of proceeding with the procedure. Although MR Conditional, core body temperature measurement devices are now available, there are no MR Conditional temperature control devices for patients. For example, at BWH, the air blower is removed prior to the MR scanner entering the OR. In the MR system room, a blower is positioned in an RF shielded closet built into the room. An MR Safe extension hose is used to replace the MR Unsafe hose packaged with the device. Although there is some loss due to heat transfer through the hose, it is still possible to warm or cool the patient.</para>
        <para>Intubation near the MR scanner is enabled by laryngoscope designs with MR Conditional batteries. To our knowledge, to date, no video laryngoscopes are marketed for use in the MRI setting. However, we have tested devices that show promise for use outside the bore of the scanner. MR Conditional steerable endoscopes have been constructed by several research groups (84, 85) The inadvertent placement of a certain type of endotracheal tube (Fastrach ETT, LMA/Teleflex) at our institution during a diagnostic MRI examination of a patient with a difficult airway resulted in images with substantial signal losses (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>). No injury occurred to the patient. The packaging for this particular ETT had no indication of its level of MRI-related issues. This endotracheal tube has a reinforcing metallic coil running the length of the device, which is magnetic. This incident led to an appraisal of this and other items in the conventional armamentarium for anesthesia delivery, some of which are listed in the <emphasis role="italics">Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices</emphasis> and posted online at www.MRIsafety.com.</para>

          <para>in the ECG that can mimic malignant arrhythmia. Additionally, the static magnetic field can induce apparent ST-segment abnormalities, as well as other alterations in the waveform (87). The benefit of image-guidance, therefore, should be weighed against the risk of anesthetizing a patient at risk of further cardiac injury during ischemic stress.</para>
          <para>There are efforts to improve ECG monitoring. Adaptive filters have been shown to be successful in removing noise induced by the imaging gradients, which are present only during scanning (89). ECG monitoring in the static magnetic field, however, is problematic even when images are not being acquired. A dominant QRS complex and undistorted S-T segment are important for both cardiac-gated MRI examinations and to permit physiological monitoring for cardiac ischemia, especially during cardiac interventions (90). The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect arises when blood, which is conductive, flows in the presence of a static magnetic field. The MHD effect generates a voltage that distorts the "real" electrocardiogram, especially with respect to the S-T segment when blood flow occurs from the left ventricle into the aorta (91). It is possible to remove the MHD artifact by processing ECG signals using a baseline ECG collected outside the bore of the MR system in conjunction with an adaptive filter (92).</para>
          <para>There are multiple efforts underway to develop an iMRI treatment for arrhythmias using RF ablation (93, 94) and cryoablation catheters (95). This procedure, and others, will benefit from enabling developments to overcome current limitations in cardiac monitoring. Treatment of members of the patient population with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), are also a hurdle in iMRI.</para>

      <title>Safety Issues for Interventional MR Systems</title>
      <para>Historically, CIEDs (e.g., cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillator, ICD) have been considered contraindications for MRI (96, 97). For more than 15 years, a variety of reports have supported the safety of scanning patients with "standard" cardiac pacemakers and ICDs. With appropriate screening and device programming, many investigations have demonstrated patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs can be scanned without significant clinical risks (98-113). Based upon the guidelines published in the peer-reviewed literature, institutions have developed programs for performing MR imaging in patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs. These programs are typically administered under combined leadership of both cardiology and radiology departments with participation from the vendors.</para>
      <para>Fortunately, five major vendors (LivaNova/Sorin, Boston Scientific, Abbott/St.Jude Medical, Medtronic, and Biotronic) now offer FDA or CE mark approved, MR Conditional CIEDs that include cardiac pacemakers, ICDs, and recorder devices. Patients implanted with these devices can safely undergo MRI at 1.5 Tesla and, with certain MR Conditional CIEDs, 3 Tesla scanning is also allowed (112).</para>
      <sect3 id="ch0031s0000s0012s0001">
        <title>Remote Monitoring</title>
        <para>Acoustic noise from the gradient magnetic fields, especially at 3-Tesla, can prohibit the anesthesiologist from hearing the physiological monitor's alarms and ECG tones when more than a few feet from the equipment. Although developing technologies with active noise cancellation will allow transmission of monitoring equipment alarms and tones into the anesthesiologist's headphones, this technology is not widely available. As an alternative, remote monitoring is routinely performed at our institution.</para>
        <para>Primarily because of the acoustic noise associated with MRI, the anesthesiologist in the AMIGO Suite remotely monitors the patient after the onset of anesthesia and the patient is stable. Remote monitoring is accomplished with another physiological monitor placed in the control corridor that displays information for the patient's vital signs and end tidal gases; a view of the anesthesia machine's ventilator and its settings by either direct line-of-site or remote camera; and a camera view of the patient in the bore of the MR system. Line-of-site to the patient is limited when the patient is inside the scanner's bore, even when the anesthesiologist is at the bedside. If an intervention by the anesthesiologist is needed during imaging, the scan is halted until the issue is resolved. MR Conditional volume infusion pumps are available with remote consoles outside the room. Alternatively, conventional infusion pumps can be stationed outside the MR system room with an extension set of IV tubing penetrating the room via the waveguide. The disadvantage of this setup is that pump alarms are not audible when the care provider is at the bedside. Recently, a commercially available MR Conditional caddy has been developed to house ferrous pumps in the MR system room. This device has an alarm to indicate when the gauss limit is exceeded. The caddy's alarm indicator is more readily visible than the alarms on each pump, permitting visualization by MRI users outside the scanner room.</para>

      <title>SAFE USE OF MRI PULSE SEQUENCES FOR MRI</title>
      <para>The type of pulse sequence that is used during iMRI is generally more constrained than it is for diagnostic imaging. Real-time, interactive imaging can be employed, which demands high acquisition rates, while sacrificing some contrast and resolution. Special fast-imaging pulse sequences used in iMRI are more likely to make use of fast gradient switching and/or may employ RF pulsing rates that are substantially greater than those used in routine clinical MR imaging and, thus, are more likely to push the limits of safe use. Safety concerns related to pulse sequence choice are also heightened in iMRI because of the possibility of interaction with implants or interventional devices that are in place during the MRI procedure, resulting in a greater potential for dangerous levels of heating from RF fields or induction of currents from gradient magnetic field switching.</para>
      <para>The primary biological effects in MRI are tissue heating due to RF exposure, nerve stimulation due to currents induced by gradient switching and sensations such as vertigo caused by rapid movement in the static magnetic field (43, 113). Pulse sequences that tend to cause the greatest heating due to RF exposure are those with a high temporal density of RF pulsing, such as fast (or turbo) spin echo sequences, which employ multiple high-flip-angle refocusing pulses as well as steady-state sequences such as FIESTA (or True FISP), which have very short repetition times (114). These pulse sequence types are commonly used in iMRI and may be referred to as "high-SAR" pulse sequences. Pulse sequences that involve rapid gradient switching, such as echo planar imaging sequences, may induce currents that can cause peripheral nerve stimulation or interfere with implantable device operation, may be referred to as "high-dB/dt" sequences. Safety concerns in iMRI, as with standard MR imaging, involve the use of high-SAR and/or high-dB/dt pulse sequences. Artifacts such as signal loss and distortion caused by imaging in the presence of metallic objects such as biopsy needles can also be considered a safety issue because they diminish or confuse MR-guidance capabilities during interventional procedures. Gradient echo pulse sequences, especially multi-echo sequences such as echo planar imaging, are especially subject to exhibit artifacts caused by the susceptibility effects due to the presence of metallic objects in tissues (115, 116). High bandwidth spin echo sequences and special sequence adaptations may be employed to minimize such artifacts (114, 115).</para>
      <para>Regulatory bodies such as the FDA have placed limits on the allowable exposures for patients to RF energy and gradient magnetic fields. MR system manufacturers include monitoring software and hardware to ensure that these exposures are not exceeded when their MR scanners are running in routine operating modes. In the absence of metallic implants, devices, or foreign objects present during the scanning, MR systems that are set in routine operating modes (i.e., the Normal Operating Mode or First Level Controlled Operating Mode) should not be of concern for safety. Even when high-SAR or high-dB/dt sequences are used, limitations by the MR system on the setting of parameters such as the number of slices or the repetition time will ensure that exposures remain within the defined limits. It may be possible to supercede the limits as set by regulatory bodies, although Institutional Review Board approval and informed patient consent is required in such cases. As long as system SAR and dB/dt monitoring remains in place, the degree of exposure can be assessed and a decision whether or not to proceed based on risk versus benefit assessment can be</para>
      <para>made for the patient. Involving an MRI physicist to assess these risks is advisable in such cases.</para>
      <para>Of greater concern when using high-SAR or high-dB/dt sequences is when implants catheters, needles or other foreign objects are present during scanning because heating can be enhanced by the presence of the device, and it is much more difficult to predict the degree of the effects. Ideally, information is available from the manufacturer of the device in terms of specifying conditions of use. For example, perhaps a given device is limited with respect to the strength of the static magnetic field and the Normal Operating Mode must be used.</para>
      <para>Workflows can be developed that are designed to enable safe guidance. For example, non-metallic stylets are first placed with MRI-guidance prior to deploying a deep brain stimulating electrodes, which are at risk of MRI-induced heating. Post-operative CT can be performed instead of MRI to evaluate for complications such as hematoma.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>The need to use strong magnets, high spatial gradients, RF energy and cryogens for performing diagnostic MRI results in an inherent level of risk, and the possibility of accidents should not be underestimated. In the iMRI environment, the potential risk is exacerbated by the introduction of additional tools and devices required to perform the intervention. Moreover, the presence of individuals less experienced with the MRI environment could lead to additional risk. However, through the appropriate facility design, education and safety policies, risk can be managed such that it is outweighed by the benefit of performing the procedure in the MRI environment. Furthermore, a culture of teamwork and safety can be engrained in staff members by ongoing training, and policy enforcement and iterative improvement. Together, these approaches act in concert to ensure safety.</para>
      <para>Since the early 1990s when iMRI was first introduced, it has rapidly developed and the number of users and procedures have increased. iMRI expanded through the introduction of new surgical approaches and/or techniques in open surgery, vascular and cardiac applications, and minimally-invasive endoscopies. Efforts now focus on the development of new, more advanced imaging methods, navigational techniques, surgical instruments and devices, the more efficient use of computing technologies, and the integration of diagnostic and therapy devices with navigational tools to expand iMRI applications.</para>
      <para>Safety measures must keep pace with this increasingly complex environment as the number of installations also increases. Patient and staff member safety is the concern of a large multimodality and multidisciplinary infrastructure like that which exists in the BWH AMIGO Suite, where iMRI is complimented with newly developed, multiple molecular probes (e.g., nuclear, optical, mass spectrometer, etc.) that also must be used safely. A primary concern for the operation of the suite is how to provide a safe environment for clinical and research activity in iMRI that incorporates multimodal imaging. The workflows in the suite should be designed to suit the way that multidisciplinary teams work while understanding and mitigating safety risks.</para>
      <para>Most of the centers involved in iMRI report no serious adverse incidents. In our more than 25 years of experience with a 0.5-Tesla iMRI (23) and, more recently, with 3-Tesla, we</para>
      <para>also have a major incident-free operation. The occurrence of near misses and the ensuing safety reviews have demonstrated that ongoing review of safety policies and continuous training should be a hallmark of any safety program, similar to any other place within the medical environment. With appropriate control, a strong safety record can be maintained. The main reason for this successful and safe operation is continuous vigilance, policy enforcement, and a serious attitude towards safety.</para>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>With the growth of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), large cohorts of patients and staff members are now routinely exposed to the static, time-varying, and radiofrequency (RF) fields integral to the imaging procedure. For the millions of MRI examinations performed each year, the majority are conducted on 1.5-Tesla or 3-Tesla scanners with a smaller number of 7-Tesla scanners installed in research or clinical, academic health centers around the world. Increasing technical advances have resulted in the magnitude of exposures to electromagnetic fields (EMF) to steadily grow during the use of clinical MRI, which began in the early 1980s.</para>
      <para>Many voluntary international (1-4) and national (5-7) standards or guidelines for occupational and public exposure to EMF are in existence and reviewed elsewhere in this textbook. In the European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) the Physical Agents (electromagnetic fields) Directive 2013/35/EC regulates occupational exposure limits for EMF through national laws (8). Although patient safety in MRI has always been paramount within the MRI community (9, 10), with exposure guidelines (11-14) and operational safety standards (1, 14-16), the EU regulations brought a renewed focus on MRI healthcare worker exposures (17).</para>
      <para>Staff exposures mainly involve the static magnetic field and its associated spatial gradient magnetic field that are responsible for the projectile force acting on ferromagnetic objects. The time-varying magnetic fields from the imaging gradients and the radiofrequency (RF) excitation field are substantially confined to within the bore of the MR system and, thus, only become significant for staff members if they remain close to or enter the bore during the scan acquisition (17).</para>

      <title>DEFINITIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL LIMITS</title>
      <para>Biological effects of electromagnetic fields and their underlying physical and physiological mechanisms are described elsewhere in this textbook. In occupational exposure or hygiene it is commonplace to consider the<emphasis role="italics">incident</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">induced</emphasis> EMFs: the former are those generated directly from the scanner (e.g., static magnetic, B<subscript>0</subscript>; gradient magnetic, dB/dt; and RF fields, B<subscript>1</subscript>), the latter are those generated in tissue as a consequence of the incident exposure (e.g., induced electric fields, current densities or specific absorption rate, SAR) and that are considered to be responsible for acute effects, such as vertigo, metallic taste sensations, peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), and tissue heating. Accurate dosimetry for both incident and induced EMF is an essential prerequisite in occupational exposure studies.</para>
      <sect3 id="ch0032s0000s0002s0001">
        <title>Incident Fields</title>
        <para>In occupational hygiene, static magnetic fields are sometimes denoted by the abbreviation SMF, and time-varying magnetic fields by TVMF. The magnetic field intensity, H, is indicated in units of amperes per meter (A/m). However, in MRI it is more usual to consider magnetic induction or flux density, commonly called "magnetic field strength", B<subscript>0</subscript>, measured in Tesla (T). In a linear, isotropic medium the magnetic flux density <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> is:</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> = μ<subscript>0</subscript> (1 + χ)<emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>                    (1)</para>
        <para>where μ<subscript>0</subscript>, the permeability of vacuum, has a value 4π × 10<superscript>-7</superscript> henry/m and χ is the dimensionless magnetic susceptibility. Beyond the bore of the MR system, the fringe field of B<subscript>0</subscript> varies spatially with a gradient dB/dz in Tesla per meter (T/m). A time-weighted average (TWA) SMF over a duration T is defined as:</para>
        <para>B<subscript>TWA</subscript> = 1/T ∫<subscript>0</subscript><superscript>T</superscript> B(t)dt                    (2)</para>
        <para>The gradient magnetic fields are defined as linear spatial variations in B<subscript>z</subscript>:</para>
        <para>G<subscript>x</subscript> = ∂B<subscript>z</subscript>/∂x ;     G<subscript>y</subscript> = ∂B<subscript>z</subscript>/∂y ;     G<subscript>z</subscript> = ∂B<subscript>z</subscript>/∂z                    (3)</para>
        <para>and are specified in milli-Tesla per meter (mT/m). The gradient slew rate (SR), or maximum switching speed is defined in Tesla per meter per second (T/m/s). The rate of change of B (dB/dt) or the step change in B (ΔB) is physiologically significant for acute sensory effects.</para>
        <para>The RF field, B<subscript>1</subscript>, is measured in micro-Tesla (μT) but is also specified as H<subscript>1</subscript> [Equation (1)] and has an electric field component E<subscript>1</subscript>. Electric fields (E) are measured in volts per meter (V/m). For a plane wave in the far field, the ratio of E/H has a constant value of 337-ohms and the power density is:</para>
        <para>P = E B/ μ<subscript>0</subscript> = E<superscript>2</superscript> / 337                    (4)</para>
        <para>measured in watts per square meter (W/m<superscript>2</superscript>). The specific absorption rate (SAR) is the RF power absorbed per unit body mass (W/kg). An SAR value may apply for the whole or as a partial body (e.g., head or extremities) exposure. For more information please refer to the relevant chapters in this textbook.</para>
        <para>The incident fields (B, H, and their time derivatives) are vectors and may have directional components which are not utilized in the image formation process but which, nevertheless, contribute to occupational exposures. For both patient and occupational exposures, it is important to consider the magnitude of these vector fields, e.g., for B:</para>
        <para>|B| = √(B<subscript>x</subscript><superscript>2</superscript> + B<subscript>y</subscript><superscript>2</superscript> + B<subscript>z</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>)                    (5)</para>
        <para>Exposure limits are often expressed as root mean square (RMS) values. The RMS value of a time-varying function (e.g., B<subscript>1</subscript> and the imaging gradients) is:</para>
        <para>B<subscript>RMS</subscript> = lim<subscript>T→∞</subscript> √(1/T ∫<subscript>0</subscript><superscript>T</superscript> B(t)<superscript>2</superscript> dt)                    (6)</para>
        <para>For a sinusoidal waveform, the peak value is √2 times the RMS value.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Induced Fields</emphasis>The generation of the induced fields in tissue is determined by Faraday's law of Induction:</para>
        <para>∮ E<subscript>i</subscript> · dl = - d/dt ∫<subscript>S</subscript> B · dS                    (7)</para>
        <para>where E<subscript>i</subscript> is the induced electric field around a closed path and dS is the differential area vector normal to the applied field. For a circular loop of radius, r, in a uniform medium normal to the applied field this simplifies to (18):</para>
        <para>E<subscript>i</subscript> = r dB/2 dt                                                                                                                    (8)</para>
        <para>The induced electric field generates a current density J<subscript>i</subscript> (A/m<superscript>2</superscript>) in tissue:</para>
        <para>J<subscript>i</subscript> = σ E<subscript>i</subscript>                                                                                                   (9)</para>
        <para>where σ is the electrical conductivity of the tissue in siemens per meter (S/m). Both induced E<subscript>i</subscript> and J<subscript>i</subscript> vary linearly with the loop radius, and therefore increase with body size. For an elliptical body cross section perpendicular to the magnetic field, the maximum current density is (19):</para>
        <para>J<subscript>max</subscript> = a<superscript>2</superscript>b/(a<superscript>2</superscript> + b<superscript>2</superscript>) σ dB/dt                    (10)</para>
        <para>where a is the semi-major axial length and b the semi-minor. The choice of axes will depend upon the orientation of the subject within the field. For a person standing close to the bore of the MR system, a would be in the head-foot direction, and b left-right, and with typical values of 0.4-m and 0.2-m, the geometric multiplier would be 0.16.</para>
        <para>Movement through the gradient of the static field (i.e., through the fringe field spatial gradient) effectively acts as a time-varying magnetic field. In the simplest case of a uniform body moving with a constant velocity v (m/s):</para>
        <para>E<subscript>i</subscript> = v r dB/2 dz                                                                                                                  (11)</para>
        <para>and, therefore, moving more slowly will result in lower induced fields in tissues. The elliptical geometry [Equation (10)] may also be used in place of r, with appropriate values of a and b.</para>
        <para>Concerning the RF field, B<subscript>1</subscript>, for a spatially uniform rectangular RF pulse with duty cycle D and a uniform spherical medium of density ρ (kg/m<superscript>3</superscript>) the maximum SAR is (20):</para>
        <para>SAR = 0.5 σ π<superscript>2</superscript> r<superscript>2</superscript> f<superscript>2</superscript> B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>2</superscript> D / ρ                                                                                                                    (12)</para>
        <para>and, thus, SAR has a square dependence upon Larmor frequency or B<subscript>0</subscript>, B<subscript>1</subscript>, patient 'radius' and a linear dependence upon duty cycle or reciprocal repetition time, 1/TR.</para>

      <title>Occupational Exposure Standards and Limits</title>
      <para>The numerous occupational exposure guidelines for electromagnetic fields in the frequency range 0-Hz to 300-GHz cover all aspects of work-related exposures, not just those related to MRI. Most guidelines operate under two regimes: Basic Restrictions, also known as "Exposure Limit Values" (ELV), "Exposure Reference Values" (ERV), or "Dosimetric Reference Values" (DRL), are set to avoid short term acute adverse effects and are defined in terms of RMS induced electric field, E<subscript>i</subscript>, in tissue. As the induced fields are not directly measurable, compliance can be demonstrated using derived Reference Levels (RL), also known as "Dosimetric Reference Levels" (DRL), "Action Levels" (AL), "Exposure Reference Levels" (ERL) or "Action Values" (AV), specified in terms of the incident fields. Some standards include higher limits for "controlled" or "restricted" situations. These apply in highly organized settings with appropriately trained staff and would, therefore, be applicable in the MRI environment.</para>
      <para>For situations where an incident field limit (e.g., RL) is not exceeded, it can be assumed that the induced field limit (e.g., BR) will not be exceeded. Compliance with a Reference Level ensures compliance with the underlying Basic Restriction or equivalent limit. However, when an incident limit is exceeded, it is necessary for the employer to establish that the relevant induced field limit is not exceeded. This would normally entail modeling of the induced fields. The derivation of the incident field limits is often based upon algebraic calculations, that is, from Equations (7) to (12) using idealized body geometries with homogeneous electrical properties.</para>
      <para>Within the EU and UK, Directive 2013/35/EC contains a derogation for MRI from the limits defined in the Directive: ELVs<emphasis role="italics">may</emphasis> be exceeded for the exposures related to the installation, testing, use, development, maintenance of, or research related to MRI for patients in the health sector, subject to a number of conditions. EU Directive limits are based upon current International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) values.</para>
      <para>MR system manufacturers follow the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 60601-2-33 that includes limits for occupational exposure specifically for MRI workers (1). Other chapters in this textbook review patient exposure guidelines in greater detail.</para>

This approach may result in overly conservative limits because it assumes coherent phase between the spectral components (23). For frequency ranges where the incident field limit, B<subscript>L</subscript>, has an inverse relationship to frequency, its time derivative, dB/dt, is constant and may be used to test compliance even for complex waveforms (22, 23):</para>

      <para>Applying this approach, the ICNIRP Reference Level becomes 2.6-T/s over the frequency range 300 to 3000-Hz. Similarly, the IEEE head and trunk MPEs below 20-Hz become 0.48-T/s and, for the heart, 18.4-T/s below 3.325-kHz. This methodology is particularly useful for MRI where gradient waveforms are usually of trapezoidal form with multiple harmonics but a single peak dB/dt.<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> shows Reference Levels up to 100-kHz.</para>

Induced field limits are specified as SAR, with a whole-body limit of 0.4-W/kg time averaged over six minutes, chosen to restrict a core body temperature rise to not more than 0.1°C. This is one tenth of the upper limit for patients. The IEEE incident field limits have a frequency and, therefore, a dependence on the strength of the static magnetic field of the scanner. The IEC uses the same limit both for workers and patients, that is, a whole-body SAR of up to 4-W/kg (1). Also specified are local (surface) RF transmit coil SAR limits of 10-W/kg for the head and trunk and 20-W/kg for the limbs.</para>

      <title>STUDIES OF INCIDENT FIELDS</title>
      <para>Studies of occupational exposures have utilized a number of approaches. The most direct is to issue magnetic dosimeters to staff members and to record their exposures to static and time-varying magnetic fields during the working day (24-30). The second approach is to record the movements of staff members during real activities and correlate these with field maps, either from the manufacturers' data sheets, theoretical calculations, or environmental electromagnetic field (EMF) measurements (31-32). The third approach is to simulate staff member activities while measuring the magnetic field exposure. This has the advantage of being predictive, such that worst-case movements can be investigated and peak exposures may be estimated (33-37). In a more generalized approach to occupational exposure in MRI, one can identify specific tasks and their temporal and magnitude exposures to formulate a Job Evaluation Matrix (38). This can then be used predictively to estimate occupational exposures for different staff groups over a prolonged period of time.</para>

The exposure values scale with various factors including pixel size, field-of-view (31), slice thickness and orientation, bandwidth, echo time and acoustic noise reduction (37). Figure 6 shows the instantaneous |dB/dt| (vector sum for all gradients) for various pulse sequences from one scanner measured at the entrance to the bore.</para>

      <title>Motion in the Static Magnetic Field</title>
      <para>Studies of linear motion of workers around MR system magnets (1.5- to 7-T) have confirmed that induced field limits may be exceeded for motion at 1-m/s within 0.5- to 1-m of the MR system (42, 43). The induced electric field and current density scaled with B<subscript>0</subscript> (Figure 9). The worst-case situations associated with these occurred for motion parallel to the z-axis towards the magnet. The ICNIRP 1-Hz Basic Restrictions was exceeded in the spine and brain for 4-T and 7-T, and the IEEE basic restriction for brain was exceeded in every case. A further study of bending towards high field strength scanners revealed similar E<subscript>i</subscript> in CSF with 0.16 to 0.56-V/m in the brain but much less in the spine (44).</para>

Cleaning the bore of the MR system gave values up to 16.7-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript>.

      <para>Crozier, et al. (45) considered a 1-kHz trapezoidal gradient similar to that used in an EPI sequence normalized to 1-mT/m with a 0.1-ms rise time. Care is required when scaling up to higher levels because the full gradient strength assumed in this study of 40-mT/m is not typical for most clinical scans and would result in an unrealistically high slew rate. However, assuming this as a worst-case, peak E<subscript>i</subscript> greater than 2.2-V/m (J<subscript>max</subscript> = 815-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript>) in the spinal cord was calculated on axis close to the end of the coil for combined G<subscript>x</subscript>, G<subscript>y</subscript> and G<subscript>z</subscript>. For a more realistic gradient amplitude of 20-mT/m the ICNIRP head central nervous tissues Basic Restriction was only exceeded within 0.01-m of the end of the coil. However, other tissues also exceeded tissue limits: skin up to 0.4-m, fat 0.3-m, muscle 0.25-m and heart 0.1-m.</para>
      <para>In a more realistically representative model, with the subject positioned 0.35-m off-axis laterally, 0.19-m from the end of the coil and exposed to a G<subscript>z</subscript> of 10-mT/m at 1-kHz, Li, et al. (46), estimated E<subscript>i</subscript> of 32-mV/m RMS in CNS tissue (J<subscript>i</subscript> = 20.6-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript> , 1-cm<superscript>2</superscript> average) with a maximum J<subscript>i</subscript> of 59-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript> in muscle tissue and maximum E<subscript>i</subscript> of 4.1-V/m in skin.</para>
      <para>The European study (31, 47) calculated induced current densities of 60-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript> RMS for any tissue and 10-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript> RMS for neural tissue for real clinical tasks such as performing tactile fMRI and general anesthesia monitoring near closed bore 1.5- and 3-T scanners. The maximum E<subscript>i</subscript> of 1.05-V/m RMS from the x-gradient occurred in the skin of the head (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>The exposure to the interventional radiologist within the bore of a 1-T open MR system (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11</emphasis>) produced up to 220-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript> RMS averaged over 1-cm<superscript>2</superscript> in any tissue, with 140-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript> RMS in neural tissue. The peak E<subscript>i</subscript> was 0.74-V/m RMS in the skin of the head. As tissue conductivities vary considerably the maximum J<subscript>i</subscript> does not necessarily coincide with the maximum E<subscript>i</subscript>, nevertheless, these simulations suggest compliance with both the IEEE and ICNIRP Basic Restrictions.</para>

      </para>
      <para>Some studies have specifically concentrated on detecting bioeffects amongst MR and magnet factory workers as a consequence of their work activities. De Vocht, et al. (48) noted light dizziness, slight or mild headache, and eye strain occurring during 4% of the measured shifts from 104 MR workers in the UK. Schaap, et al. (49) reported incidences of vertigo amongst Netherlands MR workers at 1.5, 3, and 7T as 3.5%, 7.6%, and 22.6%, and with nausea incidences of 1.2, 1.5 and 3.2%. Minor changes in hearing threshold (1-5 decibels) amongst MRI factory workers who have undergone up to 60 scans as volunteers has been reported (50), but were only significant for the right ear. Cognitive testing on MR system engineers showed that the speed of movement for particular actions correlated with the occurrence of sensory effects (51). A study of 538 workers in a MRI manufacturing facility reported a cautious possible link of prolonged cumulative exposure to SMF with hypertension; however, dosimetry data was unavailable and the conclusions were tentative (52). These results warrant further research.</para>

        <title>PREGNANT STAFF</title>
        <para>The current advice for pregnant staff members is to avoid being in the MR system room during scan acquisition, principally because of the potential risk to fetal hearing from acoustic noise (15, 16, 53). Specific dosimetric studies for pregnant staff have not been carried out, although incident field exposures are expected to be similar to those for other staff members. Kanal, et al. (54) conducted a limited epidemiological study of pregnant MRI healthcare workers, concluding that there was no adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. Studies of pregnancy outcomes from patients who have undergone first trimester MRI have shown no adverse effect on neonatal and infant hearing function, birthweight, nor increased incidence of stillbirth, neonatal death, congenital anomalies, neoplasms, or vision loss (55, 56).</para>

        <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <para>Outside the bore of the MR system, exposure from the imaging gradients and RF is generally well below most incident and induced field limits. Careful consideration needs to be given to movement around high field strength magnets for MR systems. Most activities that occur during clinical MRI will only result in significant occupational exposure in association with the static field. Special cases of particular importance include pregnant staff members, and those who must remain close to the bore of the MR system during scanning (e.g., anesthesiologists, intervention radiologists, nurses and researchers).</para>
        <para>Time-averaged static field exposures to clinical staff are relatively low, in the region of 5- to 7-mT, with peak static magnetic field exposures of about 40% of B<subscript>0</subscript>. These figures may be higher for engineering staff and researchers. Dosimetric surveys of dB/dt for clinical and research staff indicate that they receive peak dB/dt of around 1- to 3-T/s arising from movement in the static magnetic field gradient.</para>
        <para>For higher static magnetic field strengths, induced fields due to movement may exceed those generated by the gradients and, because of the lower limits in the low frequency range, routine activity around scanners will frequently result in the exceeding of one or more limits. For high field strength MR systems, the occurrence of sensory effects (e.g., nausea, vertigo, metallic taste, etc.) is evidence that limits are being exceeded. These induced field exposures can be minimized through staff training and appropriate control measures, such as moving slowly.</para>
        <para>Definitive proof that EMF exposures associated with MRI to staff members are biologically safe remains elusive, although there is no evidence to the contrary. The occurrence of some acute effects confirms the validity and importance of occupational exposure limits, staff education and training, and the conducting of appropriate risk assessments relating to EMF exposure. Whether national regulatory requirements intensify or reduce, occupational exposure is a topic that the MR community needs to continually review.</para>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>In 1976, the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was given the authority to regulate medical devices through the Medical Device Amendments to the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act. The FDA's regulation of medical devices roughly coincided with the first experimental uses of nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) systems in 1979. The FDA develops guidance documents to communicate its current thinking on medical device review and policy and participates in the development of voluntary consensus standards by national and international standards development organizations (SDOs) to promote methods important to the evaluation of medical devices. Following the publication of consensus standards, the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) utilizes a process to publicly recognize all, or parts, of a consensus standard that is helpful to assess the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. CDRH updates the list of FDA-recognized consensus standards periodically, adding newly recognized consensus standards for medical devices and radiation-emitting electronic products, while replacing certain recognized consensus standards with newly approved revisions.The FDA believes that conformance with recognized consensus standards can provide sound performance characteristics, testing methodologies, manufacturing practices, scientific protocols, compliance criteria, and labeling as part of the data used to establish a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of a medical device. However, conformance with recognized consensus standards may not always provide enough information to establish safety and effectiveness and, thus, additional data or information may be necessary. Conformance with</para>

      <title>MRI Standards and Guidance Documents from FDA</title>
      <para>recognized consensus standards is strictly voluntary for a medical device manufacturer. Therefore, a manufacturer may choose to conform to applicable consensus standards or may choose to obtain evidence about safety and effectiveness in another manner. It should be noted that relevant and up-to-date information for medical device and radiation-emitting product standards can be found at CDRH's Standard website (1).</para>
      <para>This chapter provides an overview of FDA's statutory authority, and subsequent regulatory interpretations, over magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices in the United States. Furthermore, it describes the procedures that have been developed to facilitate the medical device review mechanisms, followed by a discussion of current FDA guidance documents related to MRI (2), current international consensus standards for MRI equipment safety (also referred to as the "MR system" or "scanner"), and consensus standards for the safety of medical devices in the MRI environment, including some discussion of possible future developments in the field of MRI safety.</para>
      <para>Importantly, the content of this chapter does not establish new FDA policies or make changes to existing policies. Furthermore, the content in this chapter is valid only at the time of publication and subject to change. The reader is referred to pertinent FDA and SDO websites to obtain comprehensive and up-to-date information regarding FDA policies, guidance documents, submissions of medical devices, and consensus standards updates.</para>

      <title>FDA AUTHORITY AND REGULATORY MECHANISMS</title>
      <para>The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the FD&amp;C Act provide the statutory authority for FDA regulation of medical devices, including those involving MRI equipment. The Medical Device Amendments established three classes of devices, which are differentiated by the degree of risk and the amount of regulatory control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. The three classifications are, as follows: (1) Class I devices, which are generally low risk and require only general controls; (2) Class II devices, which are devices for which general controls alone are insufficient for reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, but for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls to provide such assurance; and (3) Class III devices, which are the highest risk and are those devices for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls.</para>
      <para>Most Class II devices require premarket notification, that is, a 510(k) submission (3), prior to marketing. A 510(k) is a premarket submission to demonstrate that the device is at least as safe and effective or "substantially equivalent (SE)", to a legally marketed device (21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)). A legally marketed device (also known as a predicate device) is a device that was (1) legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (preamendments device), (2) a device which has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, (3) a device which has been found to be SE through the 510(k) process, or (4) a device that was granted marketing authorization via the de novo classification process under section 513(f)(2) of the Federal FD&amp;C Act. Although devices recently cleared under 510(k) are often selected as the predicate to which equivalence is claimed, any legally marketed device may be used as a predicate.</para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     895</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>Class III devices are those that (1) support or sustain human life, (2) are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or (3) which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Manufacturers of Class III devices must submit a premarket approval (PMA) application demonstrating that the device is safe and effective. Clinical data is generally needed to support a PMA. If a study for an investigational device involves a significant risk to patients, the manufacturer must submit an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to the FDA prior to beginning clinical trials in the U.S.</para>
      <para>A Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) designation may be requested for devices that are intended for use in treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affect 8,000 or less individuals per year in the United States. A HUD designation must be obtained prior to submitting a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application.</para>
      <para>Since the 1976 Medical Device Amendments, new mechanisms have been developed to facilitate the introduction of medical devices into the marketplace. These mechanisms include alternatives to the traditional 510(k) pathway: (1) the Special 510(k) Program, (2) the Abbreviated 510(k) Program, and (3) the Third-Party Review. The Special 510(k) Program is used for devices with modifications or changes and utilizes design controls to show substantial equivalence of the modified device to the manufacturer's own legally marketed predicate device. (3). If a new 510(k) is needed for the modification, then summary information that results from the design control process can serve as the basis for clearing the application. Under the Special 510(k) review, 510(k) holders who intend to modify their own legally marketed devices shall conduct a risk analysis and the necessary verification and validation activities to demonstrate that the design outputs of the modified device meet the design input requirements. The Abbreviated 510(k) Program is an alternative approach that uses guidance documents, special controls and voluntary consensus standards to aid FDA's premarket review of 510(k) submissions. An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21 CFR 807.87 (information required in a premarket notification submission). However, in an Abbreviated 510(k) submission, device manufacturers elect to provide summary reports on the use of guidance documents, special controls, or declarations of conformity to FDA-recognized consensus standards. Effective February 1, 1989 MRDDs were reclassified by the FDA from Class III to Class II as described in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 (4). As Class II devices MRDDs are granted marketing authorization in the U.S. using a regular premarket notification (510(k)). However, an Abbreviated 510(k) can be appropriate for an MR system because there are several applicable consensus standards, such as IEC 60601-2-33 Edition 3.2 (5) and the standards developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) (6).</para>
      <para>The FDA's regulatory authority applies to medical device manufacturers, including medical device distributors. For example, the FDA can ask MR system manufacturers to provide information regarding the spatial distribution of the static magnetic field associated with the MR system and to establish a controlled access zone at the 5-Gauss line in the instruction manuals provided with the scanner.

      <para>Over the last decade, CDRH has developed and published five guidance documents related to MRI for industry and the FDA's staff members: two related to Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices (MRDDs) and three related to the safety and compatibility of passive implants in the MRI environment. The following two sections provide summaries regarding the purpose and content of these guidance documents. The FDA guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.

      <para>The purpose of this guidance is to provide a detailed description of the information needed in a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, for a MRDD submitted to the FDA. This guidance is applicable to premarket notifications not only for MRI, but also for magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) systems, MR system components of dual-modality devices, for example positron emission tomography (PET)/MR systems, components, and accessories, which could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the MRDD. It describes FDA-recognized consensus standards which can be used to help demonstrate substantial equivalence and defines the information needed to adequately describe the MRDD in the submission. Related to electrical, mechanical, structural, and system safety it guides the user to specific FDA-recognized consensus standards to be used to evaluate these safety aspects. Furthermore, it defines the physical laboratory testing related to safety and performance to demonstrate substantial equivalence. It describes the details needed for sample clinical images to support the ability of the MRDD to generate diagnostic quality images. Finally, it provides examples to better understand possible changes in a previously-cleared MRDD which would trigger the requirement for a new 510(k) and gives detailed instructions of what information the labeling should include.</para>

      </para>
      <para>This guidance describes MRDD operations that the FDA considers significant risk for the purposes of determining whether a clinical study requires the FDA approval of an IDE. The FDA believes that an MRDD used under specific conditions and exposure limits of the operating conditions is a significant risk and, therefore, studies involving such a device do not qualify for the abbreviated IDE. A sponsor should consider the following operating conditions when assessing whether a clinical study may be considered significant risk: (1) the main static magnetic field; (2) the specific absorption rate (SAR), (3) the gradient, timevarying fields, rate of change; and (4) the sound level, that is, the acoustic noise. For each</para>

      <para>
        <emphasis role="italics">Establishing Safety and Compatibility of Passive Implants in the MR Environment</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>This guidance addresses testing and labeling of passive implants for MRI safety, that is, "MR Safe" or "MR Conditional" labeling, in the MRI environment. More information about labeling of implants can be found in (7). This guidance document gives recommendations for MRI-related language to be included in the labeling of passive implants only, which are implants without the supply of electronic power or electronic circuits, that are submitted through PMA, IDE, or 510(k). Active implants, or devices that are not implants, do not fall within the scope of this guidance. The main safety concerns affecting the "MR Safe" or "MR Conditional" labeling of a passive implant in the MRI environment are magnetically induced displacement force and torque, radiofrequency (RF) heating, and image artifacts. The static magnetic field induces displacement forces and torque on magnetic materials. The RF fields may induce substantial heating in tissues near metallic implants. The presence of an implant may also produce image artifacts that can appear as region or signal loss, or as a geometric distortion of the MR image. If the image artifact is near the area of interest, the artifact could render the MR image non-diagnostic or may lead to an erroneous clinical diagnosis, potentially leading to inappropriate medical action.</para>
      <para>The guidance recommends non-clinical testing for PMA, IDE, or 510(k) submissions to establish the MR status of the passive implant in the MRI environment. Testing should encompass the entire range of sizes of the implant or device, particularly the size or implant combinations that represent the worst-case scenario. The guidance further recommends the marking terminology defined in ASTM F2503,<emphasis role="italics">Standard Practice for Marking Medical Devices and Other Items for Safety in the Magnetic Resonance Environment</emphasis> (8), for defining the safety of items in the MRI environment: "MR Safe", "MR Conditional", and "MR Unsafe". If a passive implant is labeled as "MR Safe", the premarket submission should include a scientific rationale or adequate test results supporting the "MR Safe" labeling. For "MR Conditional" labeling of passive implants, the premarket submission should include MRI test results indicating the safety and efficacy of the implant under the proposed labeling conditions. For "MR Unsafe" labeling of passive implants, a scientific rationale or MRI test results should be provided to support the implant as "MR Unsafe".</para>

All ASTM consensus standards will be discussed in detail below. Importantly, if a medical device which is deemed "MR Safe" or "MR Conditional" in a 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz MR system, it may not be "MR Safe" or "MR Conditional" in an MR system with a higher or lower static magnetic field/RF frequency.</para>

        </para>
        <para>This guidance provides an assessment paradigm for RF-induced heating for multi-configuration passive medical devices in the MRI environment (2). Certain passive devices are not single-configuration devices, but rather multi-configuration devices, such as orthopedic implants. Multi-configuration implants are either multi-component devices or single-component devices with various dimensions and shapes. Multi-component passive devices, such as orthopedic external or internal fixation devices, may result in a very large number of possible device configurations and combinations of individual components. Single-component devices, such as cardiovascular stents, are also frequently available in multiple sizes or shapes. For these multi-configuration passive devices, it can be challenging to leverage RF-induced heating test results from one device configuration or combination to other device configurations or combinations, because the geometry or configuration of the device can affect the heating in an unknown manner. As a result, the total number of possible configurations or combinations that need to be assessed for RF-induced heating can be very large. Importantly, the paradigm presented in this guidance provides an approach to reduce the total number of possible device configurations or combinations to a manageable number for testing the RF-induced heating in the MRI environment. Additionally, this guidance document provides recommendations on how to assess RF-induced device heating for multi-configuration passive medical devices.</para>

According to NEMA mandates, these standards must be reviewed every five years and either re-approved, updated and re-approved, or withdrawn.

        </para>
        <para>NEMA MS 1-2008 (R2014) defines four test methods for measuring the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under a specific set of conditions, using head and body radiofrequency (RF) coils. NEMA MS 1-2008 (R2014) does not address the use of surface RF coils, chemical shift imaging, or spectroscopy.</para>
        <para>The major feature of the first method is that the SNR performance of the MR system is evaluated using a standard clinical scan sequence. However, this method involves the subtraction of two images, and therefore it can be very sensitive to MR system instabilities that may occur during the data acquisition process. If the results are highly variable, the MS 1 recommends performing the alternative calculation of the standard deviation, described in the first method, or using one of the other methods. These alternative methods have been designed to be less susceptible to MR system instabilities and can be used to determine if any variability in the SNR is due to the scanner instability or genuinely poor SNR. All methods are intended to measure thermal and other broadband noise, and specifically do not address low frequency variations in an image or artifacts.</para>

This standard evaluates the geometric distortion in three orthogonal planes passing through the center of the specification volume. The purpose of the defined procedure is to provide a standardized method of measuring and reporting two-dimensional geometric distortion in an MR system (i.e., the maximum percent difference between the measured distances in an image and the actual corresponding phantom dimensions). Radial measurements, those that are between points spanning the geometric center of the test object, are used to characterize the geometric distortion. Measurements should be evenly spaced with an angular separation less than 45-degrees to sample sufficiently the angular variation of the geometric distortion.</para>

        <para>NEMA MS 3-2008 (R2014) defines a test method for measuring image-uniformity performance of MRDDs using head and body RF coils. NEMA MS 3-2008 (R2014) does not address the use of surface RF coils, chemical shift imaging, or spectroscopy. Image uniformity can be characterized in different ways. The choice of a measurement and reporting method was guided by a desire for simplicity, accuracy, and ease of implementation on all MR systems. The peak deviation method represents a single image test that can quickly determine and report uniformity with a single number. It works best with very high SNR images. The gray-scale uniformity map image represents a single image test that can visually describe image uniformity. Both the American College of Radiology (ACR) MR Accreditation Procedure method and the Normalized Absolute Average Deviation method resolve some of the image SNR issues of the peak deviation method. Measurements are made over a volume that is representative of the region used for typical clinical studies. Due to the difficulty in handling large phantoms, it is permitted to use a test phantom that only covers 85% of the specification area. This document does not address the use of special purpose RF coils (see MS 6) or RF coils that require multiple receiver channels for operation (see MS 9).</para>

        <para>NEMA MS 5-2010 defines two methods for determining slice or section thickness in diagnostic MRI. The methods presented are essentially numerical in character and, consequently, will require the preparation and use of supplementary dedicated computer software to perform the computations. The methods are based on determining the slice profile, from which the slice thickness is obtained as the full width at half maximum. The slice profile is obtained either by direct measurement with a thin inclined slab of signal-producing material, or by numerical differentiation of the measured edge response function from an inclined surface of a wedge immersed in signal producing material. A correction technique is provided to compensate for errors caused by tilting the phantom. With the inclined slab approach, better SNR can be realized. However, the extremely thin slabs required for measurement of very thin slices are not practical to fabricate. Differentiation of the edge response function degrades the SNR that is obtained for the slice profile and usually requires the averaging of several measurements. Slices of any thickness, which can provide adequate</para>

Both receive-only and transmit-receive RF coils are included. Head and body RF coils, and single-channel volume specialty RF coils, are excluded (see NEMA MS 1 and NEMA MS 3), as are RF coils requiring multiple receiver channels for operation (i.e., array RF coils, see NEMA MS 9) (5). R2014 presently permits the analysis of one channel of a multi-channel coil. These RF coils are used to receive signals from a limited region of interest and include linear or quadrature combined surface RF coils, flexible coils, pairs of coils such as Helmholtz coils, or RF coils that partially surround a specific tissue such as the calf or other extremity. NEMA MS 6-2008 (R2014) refers to these coils as "surface coils." These RF coils achieve good SNR performance because of their increased filling factor. The purpose of the defined test procedure is to provide a standard means for measuring and reporting the SNR and uniformity of signal intensity in images acquired with surface RF coils. These quantities are helpful in evaluating RF coil performance and effectiveness. Evaluations are performed on phantom images generated using standard clinical MRI sequences.</para>

Both methods were based on the maximum peak dB/dt that the gradient system can produce, when using pulsed waveforms.

This standard does not define a relationship between the SAR and the body temperature increase. Two procedures for WB-SAR measurements, the calorimetric method and the pulse-energy method are defined. The document does not apply to gradient (low-frequency time-varying magnetic fields) safety where nerve and possible cardiac excitation are the primary safety issues. It is also not intended to apply to spatial peak or local average SAR, nor does it address other factors involved with patient heating. The tests are specifically developed for volume RF transmit coils that produce relatively homogeneous RF fields. In 2016 NEMA MS 8 has been significantly revised. Changes were made to clarify the measurement methods and to make them easier for use by those who are not MR manufacturers. Specifically, the methods to consider the</para>

These quantities are helpful in evaluating the impact of MR system changes on performance or in demonstrating effectiveness for FDA applications. Other RF coil configurations have been addressed in MS 1, MS 3, and MS 6. Phased array RF coils consist of multiple receive-only coils that are used to detect signals from a limited portion of the patient's anatomy. The output of each RF coil element, or combined set of elements, is connected to the input of an independent receiver chain. Phased array RF coils may be composed of surface coils, flexible coils, pairs of coils such as Helmholtz coils, or RF coils that surround a specific anatomical region as well as combinations of these coils. Phased array RF coils achieve good SNR performance because of their increased filling factor and the use of smaller, higher SNR, receive coils. Major changes to R2014 are additional information related to noise statistics for coils with more than one channel and a table with the channel count dependent noise statistics.</para>

The measurement method requires construction of a radiofrequency phantom for a given frequency and the use of radiofrequency transparent thermometry. The procedure is intended for local SAR measurements only and specifically does not address whole-body SAR. Local SAR is a parameter that relates to the safety of MRI scanners. The primary safety concern with transmit surface coils involves local SAR which may be highest near electrical conductors.

The measurement method requires construction of electric field dipoles, spacers, a phantom, and the use of a high impedance device for measuring voltages. The electric field measurements are done in a solution with a conductivity value similar to that of the human body. Numerical methods of estimating the electric field are discussed in an appendix to NEMA MS 11-2010. Gradient-induced electric fields may affect the safety and comfort of patients.

      <para>MS 12-2016 defines test methods for measuring the absolute spatial variation of geometric accuracy within MR images. The methods present an absolute geometric accuracy as a map, graph, or table throughout the imaging region rather than as simple figures of merit such as average or worst-case error. This standard deals exclusively with absolute error measurements, because it is assumed the end user will need geometric distortion error measurements in absolute terms. While the intent of this standard is to quantify equipment induced geometric errors only, the phantom used for these measurements will also introduce some geometric errors. It is not possible to remove the phantom-induced errors within the scope of this standard, and this standard assumes that the measured errors are exclusively equipment errors. Therefore, it is necessary for the user of this standard to be able to differentiate between geometric errors due to the MR system and errors that arise from measuring geometric distortion with a test object. The user should attempt to estimate the error the phantom introduces for the specific test conditions used.</para>
      <para>This standard also recognizes that the measurements are ideally performed with three-dimensional acquisitions and large volume phantoms, but the cost, weight, and size of the required phantom may be prohibitive in certain situations. Therefore, this standard permits the use of a substantially two-dimensional phantom in conjunction with a set of two-dimensional image acquisitions in different orientations. These procedures could also be helpful in evaluating the impact of system changes on performance, for quality control programs that seek to continually reaffirm system performance, or in demonstrating effectiveness for FDA applications. However, this standard does not supersede NEMA MS 2 Determination of Two-Dimensional Geometric Distortion in Diagnostic Magnetic Resonance Images. MS 2 is designed to produce simple figures of merit that describe basic geometric distortions, or image field of view errors, that could arise from imaging gradient amplitude scaling errors.

Based on this request, the ASTM formed the task group F04.15.11 on the safety and compatibility of implant materials and medical devices in the MRI environment. Task group F04.15.11 developed test methods for evaluating magnetically induced displacement force and torque, radiofrequency (RF) heating, image artifacts, and MR labeling.

This displacement force is responsible for the projectile effect that continues to cause injuries in the MRI environment.</para>

      </orderedlist>
      <para>ASTM F2052 requires the test object to be suspended by a thin string, less than 1% of the weight of the tested device and moved to the position in the magnetic field that produces the greatest displacement. The angular deflection of the device from the vertical is measured and the deflection force is calculated. If the angular deflection is less than 45°, and the magnetic force is in the horizontal direction, then the deflection force is less than the device's weight and it is assumed that the risk imposed by the magnetically-induced deflection force is no greater than the risk due to the gravitational force. However, counter-forces may also need to be considered, because these can act on an implant and prevent movement or displacement of the object. ASTM F2052 was revised in 2015 to require the test be performed in a MR system and change the test location to a location along the axis of the scanner's bore where the static magnetic field and spatial gradient of the magnetic field have components in the z direction only. A method was added to Appendix X3 for calculating the maximum allowable spatial gradient of the magnetic field for an implant or device.</para>

The static magnetic field produces a torque on an object and forces it to align the long-axis of the object with the magnetic field. For this test procedure, the medical device with one principal axis aligned in the vertical direction is placed on a holder suspended on a torsional spring. The test fixture is then placed in the center of the MR system where the effect of torque is at a maximum. The angular deflection of the holder from its equilibrium position is recorded and the torque is calculated. The frame supporting the spring and holder is rotated through 360-degrees, and the torque, as a function of the angle of the device is determined. This measurement is repeated for the other two principal axes of the device to determine the maximum torque. According to ASTM F2213, the torque is acceptable if the maximum torque induced by the MR system is less than the product of the longest dimension of the implant and its weight. For medical devices within the acceptance criteria, the magnetically induced torque is less than the worst-case torque on the implant due to gravity. Again, counter-forces may also need to be considered because these can act on an implant and prevent movement or displacement of the object associated with torque. ASTM F2213 was revised in 2017 to add the Low Friction Surface Method, the Pulley Method, the Suspension Method, and the Calculation Based on Measured Displacement Force Method.</para>

The specific absorption rate (SAR), reported in Watts per kilogram (W/kg), is the mass normalized rate at which RF energy is absorbed to biological tissue, which, if a metallic implant is present, is an important parameter to prevent excessive heating that may result in patient injury. According to ASTM F2182, the implant to be tested is placed in a phantom filled with a medium that simulates the electrical and thermal properties of the human body. The implant is placed at a location with well-characterized exposure conditions. The phantom material is a gelled-saline consisting of a saline solution and a gelling agent. Temperature probes, which are typically fluoroptic thermometry probes, are placed at locations where the induced implant heating is expected to be the greatest (this may require pilot experiments to determine the proper placement of the temperature probes). The phantom is then placed in an MR system or an apparatus that reproduces just the RF field. ASTM F2182 recommends using an RF field producing a whole-body averaged SAR of about 2 W/kg applied for approximately 15-minutes (or other time sufficient to characterize the temperature rise and the local SAR). The test procedure is divided into two steps: (1) the temperature rise on or near the implant at several locations is measured using the temperature probes during approximately 15-minutes of RF application. The temperature rise is also measured at a reference location during Step 1. (2) The implant is removed, and the same RF application is repeated while the temperature measurements are obtained at the same probe locations as in Step 1 (i.e., at the positions applied to the implant that is undergoing evaluation). From these measurements, the local SAR is calculated for each probe, including the reference location. The local SAR at the temperature reference probe is used to verify that the same RF exposure conditions are applied during Steps 1 and 2 of the test procedure.</para>
      <para>ASTM F2182 underwent a major revision and ASTM published a new version end of 2019 (11). This new version has less emphasis on scaling the measured temperature rise to the average whole-body (WB) SAR. Instead of WB-SAR scaling, which is no longer required, the heating results are scaled to the local RF background exposure. The local RF background exposure can be characterized with either temperature probes (as it was done before) or with electric field measurements. The phantom shape changed by removing the "head" section from the phantom. The head section of the phantom was confusing because it suggested the idea that the phantom was an acceptable replica of the human anatomy. The new version emphasizes that the shape of the phantom is not specifically required. One example of phantom size and shape is provided in the document, but other types of phantoms are also allowed, as long as the local exposure is well characterized and that there is at least 2 cm distance between the implant and the phantom surface. Further changes included removing the requirement for intermediate conductivity measurements when building the phantom and revising certain sections regarding the implant holder and multi-configuration devices. The ASTM International committee agreed that a future revision should include computational modeling for passive implants. Notably, such modeling is already performed by many companies and MRI testing experts. This type of modeling uses computer-aided design (CAD) models of the implant to compute the in vitro heating with respect to local SAR, and then calculates the in vivo heating by scaling the in vitro results to the computationally assessed in vivo electric fields.</para>

The particular conditions that define the specified MRI environment include the static magnetic field strength, spatial gradient magnetic field, time-varying magnetic fields, radiofrequency fields, and the specific absorption rate (SAR). Additional conditions, including specific configurations or operational conditions of the implants or device, may also be defined.</para>

      <para>In addition to these definitions, ASTM F2503 defines icons for the three definitions. The icons are intended for use on implants, devices, and other items that may be brought into, or near, the MRI environment, as well as in product labeling. The icons can be in color or in black and white. The MR Safe icon consists of the letters "MR" in green in a white square with a green border, or the letters "MR" in white within a green square. The MR Conditional icon consists of the letters "MR" in black inside a yellow triangle with a black border and the MR Unsafe icon consists of the letters "MR" in black on a white field inside a red circle with a diagonal red stripe. The MR Conditional item labeling must include information for the acceptable conditions that are sufficient to characterize the behavior of the item in the MRI setting. This additional information should address magnetic field interactions (i.e., magnetically-induced displacement force and torque) and RF-induced heating. Other possible safety issues may include induced currents/voltages, electromagnetic field-related issues, thermal injury, nerve stimulation, possible acoustic noise issues, interaction among different devices, the safe functioning of the device, and the safe operation of the MR system. Any parameter that affects the safety of the item should be listed and any condition that is known to produce an unsafe condition must be described in the MR Conditional labeling for the item. F2503 was revised in 2013 to create an ASTM International and an IEC standard with identical content.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">THE ISO TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION (TS) 10974 FOR ACTIVE IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICES</emphasis>For many years, scanning a patient with an Active Implantable Medical Device (AIMD) was contraindicated by the MR system and AIMD manufacturers. Because performing MRI procedures in patients with AIMDs, such as cardiac pacemakers, neurostimulation systems, cochlear implants, implantable infusion pumps, and other similar devices, is increasingly necessary for proper patient management, CDRH is faced with increasingly more marketing submissions requesting MR Conditional labeling for AIMDs. The issue of AIMDs in patients referred for MRI examinations became even more apparent because of anecdotal re-</para>
      <para>ports of off-label scanning and the possible perception that the risk is not as significant as believed by AIMD manufacturers, MR system manufacturers, and regulatory bodies. Interestingly, FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) (13) database for adverse event reporting still indicates instances of device failures and patient injuries associated with MRI examinations performed on patients with AIMDs. Because of the harsh electromagnetic environment associated with MRI, the testing of AIMDs in these fields is especially challenging. The development of appropriate test methods required detailed technical knowledge of the electromagnetic fields emitted by the MR system.</para>
      <para>In 2005, CDRH held meetings with representatives from both MR system and AIMD manufacturers that led to an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recommendation to form a liaison with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC/SC 62B/MT 40, responsible for the safety standard for MRI equipment, IEC 60601-2-33,<emphasis role="italics">Particular requirements for the basic safety and essential performance of magnetic resonance equipment for medical diagnosis</emphasis>) (5), to consider recommendations that could be used to write MRI-related safety requirements for AIMDs. In April 2018, the joint ISO/IEC working group (JWG) published the second edition of the dual logo Technical Specification (TS) 10974 entitled, "<emphasis role="italics">Assessment of the safety of magnetic resonance imaging for patients with an active implantable medical device</emphasis>" (14). This second edition incorporated experience gained from the first edition of its use in practice and the current understanding of relevant issues and concerns at 1.5 T. Based on information received from the committee the JWG is currently working on converting the TS into an International Standard. By mutual agreement between the JWG and MT 40, all MR scanner-related requirements will be considered by MT 40 and will be released through future amendments and editions of IEC 60601-2-33. It is important to mention that no requirements contained within 60601-2-33, including the use of clinical scanners, construe or imply any obligation for compliance on the part of MR scanner manufacturer. The test methods contained in TS 10974 for evaluating device operation against several hazards are applicable to a broad class of AIMDs. Specific compliance criteria and the determination of risk resulting from device responses during these tests are outside the scope of TS 10974. The test methods in TS 10974 were derived from six known potential hazards to patients with an AIMD undergoing an MR scan. These potential hazards are: device heating due to the RF field and the gradient magnetic fields, vibration due to the gradient magnetic fields, force and torque due to the static magnetic field, unintended stimulation due to the gradient magnetic field-induced lead voltage and the RF field-induced rectified lead voltage, and device malfunction due to the static magnetic field, the RF field, and the gradient magnetic fields. Evaluation of the AIMD for these hazards involves some combination of testing and modeling. Tests may use bench-top testing, modeling, MR scanners, or a combination of these approaches. Implants and devices are subjected to radiated fields or injected voltages in order to elicit device responses. Modeling may be employed to determine appropriate test signal voltage levels or to estimate tissue heating. Major changes planned to be incorporated in the new International Standard (IS) 10974 is the addition of 3 T test methods, enhancement of the combined field test method, and eliminating what is referred to as a Tier 1 approach for RF-induced heating testing. The JWG is attempting to maintain the requirements for IS 10974 backwards compatible with the second edition of TS 10947 so that regulators don't require re-testing legacy devices. The JWG plans to develop the draft for IS 10974 in the near future.</para>

      <title>THE IEC STANDARD 60601-2-33 FOR MR SYSTEMS</title>
      <para>As outlined in detail above the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) has developed standards for the measurement of performance and safety parameters in MRI. Another international standard setting organization, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has developed IEC 60601-2-33 that addresses many of the safety issues associated with MRI examinations. In the early 1990s, work began on IEC 60601-2-33,<emphasis role="italics">Particular Requirements for the Safety of Magnetic Resonance Equipment for Medical Diagnosis</emphasis>, and the first edition was finalized in 1995. The FDA participated in the development of this document, which had a significant influence on current FDA policies and guidance documents relating to MRI. This is particularly important because the FDA has the responsibility of ensuring both the safety and effectiveness of medical devices.</para>
      <para>The latest version of IEC 60601-2-33 Edition 3.2,<emphasis role="italics">Particular Requirements for the Basic Safety and Essential Performance of Magnetic Resonance Equipment for Medical Diagnosis</emphasis>, was published in 2015 (5). Although the title mentions "essential performance", no such requirements have been identified within the scope of the standard. The third edition mainly establishes particular basic safety to provide protection for the patient and the MRI healthcare worker. Because IEC 60601-2-33 does not address performance issues, such as the signal-to-noise ratio, image uniformity, geometric distortion, and slice thickness, the FDA has specified in the guidance titled <emphasis role="italics">Submission of Premarket Notifications for Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices</emphasis> (2) from November 2016, performance tests for MR imaging and spectroscopy.</para>
      <para>Before working on the Fourth Edition of 60601-2-33 the Committee (IEC 62/62B/MT40) released two Amendments to the Third Edition. The first amendment (AMD1) was released in 2013 with formal updates to the latest general and collateral standards, whereas the second amendment (AMD2) was released in 2015. AMD1 was published to adapt IEC 60601-2-33:2010 to the technical corrections introduced to IEC 60601-1:2005. AMD2 was developed to increase the First Level Controlled Operating Mode limit for the static magnetic field from 4 T to 8 T considering the FDA, the ICNIRP (15), and the peer reviewed scientific literature. In addition, a non-compulsory option, called the Fixed Parameter Option B (Basic) (FPO:B) (16), was introduced to limit RF and gradient field outputs (peak and the root mean square, RMS) for scanning patients with MR Conditional implants and devices. Consequently, text was proposed for the Instructions For Use (IFU) to guide users in scanning patients with MR Conditional implants and devices. Plans for the Fourth Edition of 60601-2-33 include the single fault safety of the emergency rundown button, to reestablish acoustic protection, to include reference to the Medical Imaging &amp; Technology Alliance (MITA) RF coil/cable heating test standard, and to reestablish systemic and local RF protection without introducing the CEM43 concept (17, 18).</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>In the past thirty-five years, MRI technology has developed into a major radiological modality to the point where it has become the gold standard or technique of choice for the diagnosis of a number of disorders, conditions, and abnormalities. During this period, there have been major changes in safety standards and guidance documents, particularly in the</para>
      <para>field of AIMD safety, where the TS 10974 was developed and is widely used to assess the safety of AIMDs in relative to the use of MRI technology. In general, recommended patient exposure limits have risen as a result of increased knowledge regarding the biological effects of the static, time-varying magnetic, and RF fields associated with MRI. One of the most important lessons learned is that safety standards and guidance documents, although subject to change over time, provide the most current and generally accepted guidance towards safe use of MRI technology and should be followed, if applicable, to address safety concerns. Any deviations from recommended guidance documents should be accompanied by a detailed and scientifically sound rationale.</para>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>In the period from 2003 to 2013, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) community in Europe was engaged in a campaign related to a portion of the European Union (EU) occupational health and safety legislation, the Physical Agents (Electromagnetic Fields, EMF) Directive (1), which appeared to pose a substantial threat to the use of MRI in clinical practice and research (2, 3, 4). This contentious debate served to highlight the question of how MRI safety issues are currently regulated in Europe. Although there is no single piece of European legislation concerned expressly with MRI safety, there are a number of sets of regulations and official guidance that are relevant in this area and which staff members working with MRI should be aware of to ensure they remain legally compliant and, importantly, to promote a safe environment for both patients and staff members.</para>
      <para>In this chapter, the body of the EU safety legislation, international standards and guidelines that impact the use of MRI in Europe are discussed. Although Europe and the European Union are neither synonymous nor coterminous, this chapter will be concerned mainly with the situation in the EU. Notably, in some policy areas, including occupational health and safety, EU legislation also applies in the wider European Economic Area (EEA) (encompassing Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), often also in Switzerland, and in some in-</para>

      <para>stances even more widely (e.g., the legislation of medical devices as it is applied in Turkey, see below). Since there will be considerable discussion of EU legislation in this chapter, background information is needed for readers outside the EU (and for many within it).</para>
      <sect3 id="ch0034s0000s0002s0001">
        <title>NATIONAL AND SUPRANATIONAL LEGISLATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION</title>
        <para>Currently, the EU is a partnership of 27 sovereign countries¹, each with its own independent government, legislature, and body of law. However, under the treaties establishing the EU, these "member states" have conferred certain powers on the EU collectively, including the power to make laws that are binding on all of them in order to advance the objectives of the treaties. The mechanism by which EU law is made varies between different policy areas but, in general, it involves the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of the EU. The Commission is composed of permanent officials and provides the EU's "civil service". It is headed by the College of Commissioners, a group of politicians forming the "cabinet" of the EU. There is one Commissioner from each member state, each having different policy responsibilities. Only the Commission has the power to propose new legislation, which is then passed to the Parliament and Council for amendment and approval. The European Parliament is composed of members (MEPs) directly elected by citizens of EU member states for terms of five years. Like most national legislatures, it contains a variety of political groupings and carries out much of its work through a system of committees focusing on different policy areas. The Council of the EU is made up of government ministers from each member state, with the attending minister changing depending on the area of policy under discussion. In practice, much of its work is carried out in committees and working parties made up of civil servants and diplomats. The overall political direction of the EU is set by a separate body, rather confusingly called the European Council, made up of member state heads of government. (Even more confusingly, there is also an international organization called the Council of Europe, which is entirely distinct from the EU.)</para>
        <para>Most EU legislation (for our purposes) takes the form of<emphasis role="italics">directives</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">regulations</emphasis>, which become law in member states in different ways. Once the Parliament and Council have adopted a directive, all member state governments are required to implement its provisions in their domestic law (a process known as "transposition") by a fixed date. If a member state fails to meet the transposition deadline, the Commission may take "infraction proceedings" against that country in the Court of Justice of the EU. A regulation, by contrast, is legally binding in all member states as soon as it comes into force, without the need for transposition. EU law takes priority over individual national law, although member states are able to introduce more stringent laws in some policy areas, including worker protection.</para>
        <para>Several EU directives have implications for MRI safety. The most significant of these are discussed below, but others that may need to be taken into account in the context of MRI include the Physical Agents (Noise) Directive (2003/10/EC) and the Pressure Equipment Directive (97/23/EC), as well as more general legislation dealing with issues such as electrical and mechanical safety, manual handling, use of display screens, and others. Most of these issues will not be discussed further in this chapter, where the focus is primarily on</para>

        <title>THE PURPOSE OF STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES: DIRECT AND INDIRECT HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH MRI</title>
        <para>The hazards of MRI are discussed in detail elsewhere in this textbook. Briefly, MRI safety discussions often focus on direct and indirect hazards of EMF.<emphasis role="italics">Direct hazards</emphasis> are those arising directly from exposure of the human body to EMF (the static magnetic field, time-varying magnetic fields and radiofrequency radiation), primarily peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) and radiofrequency (RF) heating. There are also transient sensory effects such as magnetic field-induced vertigo and (rarely in MRI) magnetophosphenes. There has been some debate as to whether or not these phenomena should be regarded as adverse health effects. Most in the MRI community would take the view that they should not, but some commentators argue that the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health as "complete physical, mental and social well-being..." (5) implies that transient disturbances of this kind do constitute adverse effects. Direct hazards are often addressed by setting exposure limits in order to avoid or to minimize the effect in question. These limits may be specific to MRI, or may apply to all sources of EMF exposure.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="italics">Indirect hazards</emphasis> arise when electromagnetic fields interact with an object or device in such a way that it then poses a hazard to patients or workers. Examples are ferromagnetic projectiles attracted by the strong static magnetic field and effects on biomedical implants. By far, these are the more serious type of hazards associated with MRI that are best prevented through the adoption of rules for safe working, worker training, and by other means rather than by imposing exposure limits. This may be an entirely local matter, but in some countries there are national guidelines on MRI safety to provide more effective and uniform protection. Both types of hazard may also be minimized through proper equipment and facility design.</para>

        <title>THE EU HEALTH AND SAFETY FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE: RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</title>
        <para>Most European countries do not have specific laws addressing MRI safety. However, generic legislation to protect worker health and safety exists in each EU member state, based on the health and safety framework directive (89/391/EEC) (6). Under this legislation, employers (which in this context would encompass hospitals, private clinics and universities) have a duty to ensure the safety and health of workers in every aspect related to the work. For example, they must conduct risk assessments of each work process, adopt appropriate protective measures, and provide workers with adequate training. There are also requirements placed on workers to take care of their own health and safety, and that of other persons, and to make correct use of work equipment. However, this is explicitly dependent on the training and instructions received so, again, the primary responsibility rests with the employer. These provisions apply to MRI just as much as to any other occupational setting.</para>

        <para>spections of MRI facilities, requiring risk assessment documentation and other evidence of safe working practices.</para>
        <para>Risk assessment is an important aspect of compliance with the framework directive. A variety of approaches exist for assessing and quantifying risk and the impact of risk mitigation, often taking the form of a matrix in which the risk of an event is categorized (and sometimes quantified) according to its likelihood and the potential severity of its outcome (Table 1). In the case of MRI, a projectile incident, for example, might be categorized as an "extreme risk" event in the absence of appropriate safety procedures and training, but with that mitigation in place might then be downgraded to a "moderate risk".</para>

      <title>THE MEDICAL DEVICES REGULATION</title>
      <para>EU legislation relating to "medical devices" (a broad term that encompasses everything from bandages to MR systems) also creates health and safety responsibilities for both manufacturers and users of MR scanners. Many classes of product require a "CE mark" before they can be placed on the market in the EU. These include products as diverse as gas appliances, refrigerators, weighing instruments, fireworks, and toys. The process of obtaining a CE mark requires the manufacturer to ensure that the product conforms to the requirements of applicable EU regulations and directives. In the case of medical devices, regulation has hitherto taken the form of a series of medical device directives, requiring transposition in each member state and hence providing scope for a degree of nuancing to meet local circumstances. However, in 2017 the EU adopted the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 2017/745) (MDR) (7) in order to create a more robust and uniform regulatory environment across the Union. This regulation was due to come fully into force in May 2020, but has now been delayed until May 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</para>
      <para>One of the most important of the "general safety and performance requirements" set out in the MDR is that "Devices…shall not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patients, or the safety and health of users or, where applicable, other persons". Demonstrating safety is therefore a key aspect of the CE marking process and, hence, a prerequisite for marketing a medical device in Europe.</para>

        <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management    915</title>
        <para>Previous medical device directives contained a provision whereby manufacture or modification of devices within the same health institution in which they were to be used was exempt from all requirements of the directive (known as the health institution exemption, HIE). The term "health institution" in this context includes research laboratories "that support the healthcare system" (e.g., university laboratories). This situation has changed under the new MDR, and such devices will now be required to comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the MDR. In practice, this should not be a major issue, since quite apart from medical device legislation there is already a more general legal requirement for institutions to ensure that devices they manufacture are safe and fit for purpose. However, the MDR also creates a requirement for manufacture<emphasis role="italics">and use</emphasis> of such devices to take place within "appropriate quality management systems". At the time of writing, regulators in member states are still drawing up guidelines as to how this should be interpreted. The new HIE requirements clearly apply to development of new MR systems or components (e.g., RF coils) in research laboratories, but they also affect modification of commercial systems, potentially including pulse programming if this takes the system outside the scope of its original CE mark.</para>

      <title>THE IEC/EN 60601 STANDARD SERIES</title>
      <para>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60601 standard series provides the usual means whereby medical device manufacturers demonstrate compliance with preexisting medical device directives and with the new MDR. The European Commission recognizes these standards as harmonized standards for this purpose, so that satisfying their requirements gives a "presumption of conformity" with relevant legislative requirements. These are global standards, not specific to Europe. They underpin the design and manufacture of MR systems sold throughout the world and are recognized by many national medical device regulatory agencies, including the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, they have a particular importance in Europe because of their close relationship to the MDR and, therefore, are discussed in some detail here. Strictly speaking, it is the version of the IEC standard adopted by the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), known as an EN standard, that is harmonized to the MDD but this is practically identical to the IEC original.</para>
      <para>The IEC/EN 60601 series consists of a general medical device safety standard (60601-1) (8), "collateral standards" covering specific aspects of device performance, some of which are relevant to MRI such as electromagnetic compatibility (60601-1-2) and usability (60601-1-6), and "particular standards" in the 60601-2 series dealing with specific device types. Standard 60601-2-33 is the particular standard for MR systems (9) and is maintained by a group of MRI experts drawn from industry, clinical users, regulators and the academic community.</para>
      <para>IEC/EC 60601-2-33 sets out criteria for equipment safety and details of measurement procedures for manufacturers to demonstrate compliance. Importantly, it also describes the "Instructions for Use" that manufacturers must provide to purchasers of scanners. These include mandatory safety information and create obligations for the end user in areas such as safe system operation, worker training, control of access to the scanner, and patient handling. Much of this material is intended to manage indirect hazards.</para>

        <para>*Default limits are also defined, in terms of induced electric field strength and gradient switching rate, as an alternative to direct determination.</para>
        <para>**Various specific absorption rate (SAR) limits are also defined to ensure compliance with these temperature limits.</para>
        <para>Unusually for a standard of this type, 60601-2-33 also contains EMF exposure limit values, addressing direct hazards. These limits are summarized in<emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>. They apply equally to patients and to MRI workers, with the rationale that the intention to avoid adverse effects in patients ensures that workers are also protected. The standard adopts a tiered approach to EMF exposure limitation, with three operating modes defined by exposure thresholds. In the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis>, there is considered to be no risk of "physiological stress" to patients. In the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>, the threshold for physiological effects may be approached, and medical supervision is recommended. In the <emphasis role="italics">Second Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>, there may be significant risk and local regulatory approval is required (e.g., from a research ethics committee or institutional review board, IRB), which should explicitly state the permitted levels of exposure. The instructions for use passed to the end user must refer to the hazards associated with EMF and to these exposure limits. They must also give advice on worker training to mitigate transient effects, such as vertigo, that may occur at higher exposure levels, and explain that national laws may set lower exposure limits for workers in some countries, as is discussed later in this chapter.</para>
        <para>One point worthy of particular note is that the main approach to limiting exposures to time-varying magnetic fields focuses on direct determination of the physiological threshold for peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) (which is merely a tactile sensation at the onset level) in a group of healthy volunteers, with the<emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> limit set at 80% of this threshold. This differs from most other guidelines in avoiding the unwanted physiological</para>
        <para>effect directly, rather than by means of an exposure limit expressed in terms of physical quantities that is inevitably a conservative proxy. There are also default limits on induced electric field and gradient switching rates for use when direct determination has not been employed, but these are also derived from an empirical equation describing PNS thresholds.</para>

      <title>ICNIRP GUIDELINES ON EMF EXPOSURE</title>
      <para>The EMF exposure limits contained in IEC/EN standard 60601-2-33 are designed specifically for use in MRI and, as far as possible, they are incorporated into MR scanners in the form of hardware and software interlocks and other safety features. There are also international guidelines on EMF exposure of more generally applicability. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is the main organization active in this area and its guidelines have significant influence in Europe.</para>
      <para>The ICNIRP develops guidelines and exposure limits to address adverse health effects of exposure to all forms of non-ionizing radiation, including EMF. The ICNIRP issued guidance on static magnetic field exposure in 1994 (10), which was updated in 2009 (11). Guidance on time-varying magnetic fields in the frequency range up to 300-GHz was published in 1998 (12), and updated in 2010 for the frequency range 1-Hz to 100-kHz (13), and in 2020 for the frequency range 100-kHz to 300-GHz (14). In 2014 ICNIRP issued new guidance on exposure to time-varying magnetic fields with frequencies below 1-Hz (primarily to prevent sensory effects associated with movement in and around static magnetic fields associated with MRI) (15). With the exception of (15), all of these guidelines contain exposure limits for workers, and also lower limits for members of the general public, which do not concern us directly here. There is also a specific statement from the ICNIRP on protection of patients in MRI, published in 2004 (16) and revised in 2009 (17).</para>
      <para>The ICNIRP bases its exposure limits, known as "basic restrictions", on the thresholds for "established adverse effects", determined by critical review of the literature (18). The biological effects of EMF on the human body vary dramatically with frequency. In the low frequency range relevant to the switched gradients in MRI (around 1-kHz), the relevant effect is stimulation of nervous tissue. The obvious manifestation of this is PNS, but historically there has been a tendency to regard magnetophosphenes (which only occur over a narrow frequency range around 10- to 50-Hz) as a possible indication of EMF interactions with the central nervous system over a much wider frequency range (19), resulting in much lower exposure limits than are justified by the desire to avoid PNS alone. This is more of an issue with the 1998 guidelines than with those issued in 2010, where a helpful distinction has been drawn between adverse effects (PNS) and transient disturbances (magnetophosphenes). In the radiofrequency range the critical effect is tissue heating and setting a limit is simply a matter of deciding how much heating is acceptable. Basic restrictions are often expressed in terms of quantities that cannot be readily determined, such as the electric field or current density induced in the body by a time-varying magnetic field, so the ICNIRP also defines "reference levels" in terms of quantities that are easier to measure, such as static magnetic field strength. These are derived from the basic restrictions using conservative models, so that complying with the reference level ensures that the relevant basic restriction is satisfied.</para>

      <para>The ICNIRP's basic restrictions on occupational exposure are often more restrictive than the exposure limits contained in the IEC standard. This is mainly because the ICNIRP applies reduction factors to adverse effect thresholds in order to arrive at the basic restrictions. The rationale is that this reflects uncertainties in scientific knowledge about adverse effects and their thresholds, and also accounts for biological variations in effect thresholds that may exist between individuals. Also, the ICNIRP adopts a broad definition of health, based on that of the WHO (17), so that effects resulting in annoyance or discomfort, affecting a person's wellbeing but otherwise harmless, may be regarded as potential health hazards (18). To add to this, because it is often impractical to demonstrate compliance with the basic restrictions, there is a tendency to treat the more conservative reference levels as default exposure limits.</para>
      <para>Table 3 summarizes the ICNIRP basic restrictions for workers, insofar as they are relevant to MRI. For clarity, reference levels, general public limits and the complexities of frequency dependence have been omitted. Where guidelines allow, it has been assumed that MRI is a "controlled environment" in which workers have been adequately trained. In some instances higher limits apply in such circumstances. In the case of switched gradients, which have complex non-sinusoidal waveforms, the ICNIRP limits at a representative frequency of 1-kHz have been used. Values from the superseded 1994 and 1998 guidelines are included, for reasons that will become clear later.</para>
      <para>Table 4 summarizes the ICNIRP guidance on exposure limits for MRI patients. In its MRI statements, the ICNIRP takes a similar approach to that adopted in IEC 60601-2-33. Three tiers of exposure are defined:<emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italics">Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> (requiring medical supervision) and <emphasis role="italics">Experimental Operating Mode</emphasis> (requiring institutional review board, IRB, approval).

Thus, they are based on actual effect thresholds, although direct determination is not embraced. RF heating limitations are also similar to those in the IEC standard and, again, there are a number of derived SAR limits. However, crucially, these limits apply only to patients undergoing MRI.

      <title>THE EU EMF DIRECTIVE</title>
      <para>Article 16 (1) of the framework directive (6) envisages adoption of additional individual directives to address specific health and safety hazards. In this context, the Physical Agents (EMF) Directive (2004/40/EC) (1) was adopted by the European Parliament and Council on 29<superscript>th</superscript> April 2004, with a deadline of 30<superscript>th</superscript> April 2008 for member state transposition. Its objective was to protect workers from the "known short-term adverse effects in the human body" of exposure to EMF. This document was concerned only with occupational exposure, not exposure of MRI patients or of the general public.</para>
      <para>The directive incorporated the 1998 ICNIRP exposure limits for time-varying magnetic fields, with the intention of making the ICNIRP basic restrictions into legally binding limits throughout the EU.</para>
      <para>Members of the European MRI community became aware of the directive shortly before it was adopted. It was quickly realized that the proposed exposure limits are exceeded in a number of situations in MRI and that the directive would have serious consequences for both clinical and research activity. A lengthy lobbying campaign followed, led by the European Society of Radiology (ESR). There were also campaigns in individual member states and a parliamentary inquiry in the United Kingdom (UK) (20). After considerable effort and the publication of research showing that the limits are indeed exceeded by MRI workers (21, 22), the community's argument about the impact of the directive was accepted. Specifically, research showed that the limit for frequencies below 1-Hz was exceeded by a factor of up to 10 for workers moving through the static magnetic field near the MR system (21), and the ELV in the gradient frequency range by a factor of 20 or more for workers standing close to the scanner during imaging (22) (note, RF exposure is rarely, if ever, a problem). Thus, providing clinical care to a patient during MRI, all forms of interventional MRI, certain research activities, or even walking at a normal speed close to an MR system, would have become illegal throughout the EU following transposition of the directive.</para>
      <para>Of course, this does not mean that workers in these situations are placing themselves at risk of direct EMF effects: IEC 60601-2-33 ensures that this is not the case. The problem is the large safety factors built into the ICNIRP basic restrictions, particularly in the gradient frequency range. These may have a place in industrial settings with highly variable EMF outputs, but are unnecessary and highly problematic in the context of MRI, where EMF outputs are precisely controlled and adverse effects are already addressed under the more specific IEC standard.</para>
      <para>The deadline for transposition of the directive was delayed in 2007 and again in 2012. In 2011, the European Commission proposed a new directive, based on the new 2009 and 2010 ICNIRP Recommendations but also incorporating a "derogation" to exclude MRI workers from the exposure limits, subject to certain conditions. After further lengthy negotiations, this proposal was adopted, and the 2004 directive was repealed (23).</para>
      <para>The MRI derogation in the 2013 directive allows workers to exceed the exposure limit values, when this can be justified, during work related to "installation, testing, use, development, maintenance of or research related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment for patients in the health sector". This rather cumbersome wording was arrived at during negotiation in order to encompass as wide a range of activities as possible. There is a requirement for a risk assessment (already necessary under the framework directive), and for a range of other factors to be taken into account. It must be shown that workers' health and safety is still protected by other means (such as the IEC standards, safe working practices and appropriate training). There is also a provision for member state governments to introduce additional derogations on a time-limited (but renewable) basis where this can be justified.</para>
      <para>Even in this modified form the directive remains controversial. A report produced for the European Commission in 2015 (prior to the 2016 deadline for national transposition)</para>
      <para>recommended that the rationale for retaining the directive should be reconsidered, and that it might be repealed in its entirety (24).</para>

      <title>EXPOSURE LIMITS AND GUIDELINES IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES</title>
      <para>The transposition deadline for the 2013 EMF directive was July 2016. The aim of the directive was that from that date onwards there should be a uniform approach to EMF exposure limitation across the EU. However, historically individual European countries have taken a variety of approaches to EMF exposure limitations. In some cases, 1994 and/or 1998 ICNIRP limits were enforced legally, or there were even more restrictive limits. Whilst no definitive summary of current legislation exists, there was no requirement for those countries to relax their more stringent regulations following adoption of the new directive. To add to the confusion, some EU member states transposed the 2004 directive before it was repealed, although by 2015 some had reversed this process or were simply not enforcing the legislation (24). Other countries had introduced additional requirements in relation to risk assessment or health surveillance, going beyond the requirements of the directive (24). On the other hand, in the UK the HSE adopted as flexible and helpful an approach as possible, with the MRI derogation and associated conditions re-worded in a simplified way in national legislation (25), and the power of derogation at national level exercised to include any MRI activities that were not already encompassed. A commentary on implementation of the UK regulations in the context of MRI has been published (26), and at the time of writing more extensive professional body guidance is awaited.</para>
      <para>In addition to implementing the new EU legislation, some countries have adopted specific guidance on MRI safety. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance covers issues such as safety infrastructure, safe working practices, worker training, and control of access to MRI facilities (27). In the Netherlands, safe working guidance was issued in 2008 with the support of the relevant professional bodies and government agencies (28). The prospect of harmonized EU-wide MRI safety guidelines in the wake of the amended EMF directive has triggered initiatives such as development of standards on the role and training of MRI safety officers in Austria (29, 30).</para>

      <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>Protection of patients and workers from hazards associated with EMF related to MRI requires both appropriate equipment design and use to ensure that the thresholds for direct effects are not exceeded and appropriate working practices and training to minimize the probability of indirect effects. The combination of the Medical Devices Regulation, supported by the IEC 60601 series standards, and the framework health and safety directive should be sufficient to ensure that these conditions are met in Europe. In practice, however, it is unclear how uniformly the obligations created by the framework directive are applied in MRI facilities. The ICNIRP occupational exposure guidelines are a blunt instrument in our context, designed to apply across very wide frequency ranges and incorporating safety factors that are both unnecessary and problematic. A critical difference between the IEC and ICNIRP approaches is that the IEC standard recognizes that MR systems designed to ensure patient safety are also safe for workers at the same exposure levels, whereas the IC-</para>

    <para>Safety is paramount when considering that both demand and utilization rates for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have increased dramatically in the past decade. As such, effective safety training and education are essential, particularly because MRI has increasingly become the modality of choice for a number of medical indications and scanners with higher static magnetic fields, faster gradient magnetic fields, and more intense radiofrequency (RF) fields are frequently being used. Canadian MRI facilities strive to align with relevant standards and with guidelines developed by leading organizations and experts to ensure that policies and procedures function to protect patients, staff members, and others working in and around the MRI environment.</para>

In particular, the time that patients must wait for MRI scans is a politically sensitive issue. Consequently, the number of scanners installed across Canada has steadily increased.</para>

      </para>
      <para>The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology must deliver a practical level of protection for patients and staff by avoiding harm and balancing all risks against the benefits of the examination. While the technology and the potential hazards of the MRI environment are essentially common to the practice of MRI globally, there are jurisdictional and regional differences that impact local differences in practice. These stem from variations in regulatory structures, professional standards and education for radiologists and radiographers, levels of participation in international professional and scientific communities, the implants and devices found in the respective marketplace, legal structures, and local public expectations regarding medical risks. This chapter describes and reviews the relevant documented material underpinning the patterns of clinical MRI safety practices in Australia.</para>

      </para>
      <para>Australia is an island nation covering an area of land similar to that of the continental United States (U.S.) but with a population of approximately 25.4 million people. The population is predominately urban and residing mainly on the east coast. There are also population clusters in the middle of the southern coast (2 million), at the southern and northern extent of the west coast (4 million), as well as a small population center on the northern coast, and on a large island state (Tasmania). Capital cities and regional centers are well serviced by MRI facilities that operate within a modern western healthcare system. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that, in 2011, Australia had 14.1 MR systems per million people (377 scanners) performing approximately 1.2 million examinations per year (1).</para>
      <sect3 id="ch0001s01s01s01">
        <title>MRI Safety Standards and Guidelines in Australia</title>
        <para>The exact size of the Australian MRI installed base is difficult to determine because reporting is influenced by funding arrangements. An Australian Government 2019 report confirmed the OECD figures by listing 356 fully and partially funded scanners (2). Industry groups estimate that there are an additional 250 MR scanners providing medical examinations outside of the Australian universal health funding arrangements. By comparison, the OECD country average is 12.5 MR systems per million people, while the U.S. is equipped with approximately 39 scanners per million individuals (1).</para>
        <para>The majority of the installed scanners are less than 10 years old, generally operating with high-performance gradient systems, comprehensive phased-array radiofrequency (RF) coils, and advanced applications software. Medicare does not fund services performed on MR systems more than 20 years old. Most MRI examinations are performed for clinical indications in hospitals or stand-alone radiology practices using MR systems operating at 1.5-Tesla, but about 40% of scanners operate at 3-Tesla, a substantial increase in proportion since 2012. There are only a few lower field strength and/or vertical-field scanners, none of which are covered by the federal funding arrangements in Australia. There are three clinical and one research driven custom designed MR guided linear accelerators (MR-LINAC) operational, with more installations planned in the future by a private provider. Several clinical centers and research facilities operate human positron emission tomography (PET) MR systems and several have intra-operative MR scanners. Two research centers operate 7-Tesla, whole-body MR systems equipped with high order, parallel transmit RF systems, neither currently provides clinical imaging services.</para>
        <sect4 id="ch0001s01s01s01s01">
          <title>MRI Funding</title>
          <para>Australia operates a "fee for service" healthcare model supported by a universal health insurance system called Medicare. The Australian Federal Department of Health, through Medicare, is the major source of all medical service funding, including MRI examinations performed in public and privately owned facilities. Under the Commonwealth Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) scheme, a fixed fee is paid for a defined range of MRI procedures, carried out by specifically licensed sites, for specified clinical indications. Virtually all of the 345 Medicare funded sites also perform variable numbers of MRI examinations for indications that are not eligible for Medicare payments. Some of those examinations are billed to the patient while others are performed at no charge, depending on local contractual and commercial factors. Currently the MBS fees for MRI examinations are between $201.00 and $1,440.00 Australian dollars, with small additional rebates paid for the use of MR spectroscopy, contrast media, sedation, and general anesthesia support during MRI (3). Many private MRI facilities charge the patient more than the MBS fee and require so-called "gap" payments from the patient. Gap payments are not covered by any private insurance systems in Australia. At many sites, the terms of their Medicare contract prohibits gap billing. MRI exams certain motor vehicle, workers compensation or veterans affairs funded claims fall outside of the Medicare MBS arrangements, but there are similar administrative and legal limitations on examination fees charged for these situations and they generally approximate the MBS fees and typically do not involve gap payments by the patient.</para>

        <title>MRI Facility Ownership</title>
        <para>Clinical MRI facilities are almost exclusively operated within radiology departments and practices. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) has established accreditation of Radiologists performing MRI and operates the Quality Assurance Accreditation program. Each of these elements will be explored in detail later in this chapter. Independent cardiologist-owned MR systems are rare in Australia, although many sites offer time for cardiology-directed examinations on scanners owned by radiology practices. Thus, cardiologists may be the responsible healthcare group for MRI facility and patient safety at certain times. Radiation Therapy providers operate a growing number of MR simulator systems external to Radiology providers. The current numbers are unknown. A small number of commercial veterinary scanners are also operated by the private sector. Arrangements at human research centers associated with universities fall outside clinical arrangements. These particular scanners maybe operated by graduate or undergraduate students with limited training, in conjunction with specialist support staff, such as radiographers. Universities generally follow the recommendations for operating their MRI facilities developed by the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) (4).</para>

        <title>MRI Staffing and Radiographer Training</title>
        <para>In Australia, radiographers are the most engaged healthcare professionals on matters of MRI safety. While there is currently no Australian legal requirement for MRI services to be provided by specifically qualified staff, the majority of clinical MRI exams are performed by radiographers who are nationally registered as Medical Radiation Practitioners (MRP) under a board, the Medical Radiation Practice Board of Australia (MRPBA), and the Australian Health Practitioner Registration Agency (AHPRA) authorized by the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act (2009) (5). The educational requirements for registration are determined by an independent accreditation committee. The original 2013 MRPBA professional capabilities intentionally omitted professional capabilities for ultrasound (US) and MRI (6). In 2019, the MRPBA acknowledged that basic registrants could not be assumed to have the understanding to deliver safe and competent MRI services without the supervision of an undefined "more experienced practitioner" (7).</para>
        <para>New professional capabilities came into effect in 2020 with specific capabilities indicated for ultrasound and MRI (7). Entry-level registrants will need to understand how MRI is employed in clinical situations for diagnosis and radiation therapy planning (7), but are not expected to deliver MRI (or ultrasound, for that matter) services. Practitioners who provide MRI services must demonstrate certain additional capabilities. These include requiring the radiographer to operate the MR system safely by applying knowledge of the principles, equipment, and the clients that they manage during MRI exams. Safety considerations specifically include those associated with contrast agents and other pharmaceuticals used in procedures, site management and the integrity of safety "zones" (i.e., as specified by the American College of Radiology), minimizing MRI-related heating as well as peripheral nerve stimulation, and actively managing risks related to acoustic noise and implant interactions (7). These aforementioned topics form the minimum capabilities the public can expect from any registered Medical Radiation Practitioner who is providing MRI services.</para>
        <para>976    MRI Safety Standards and Guidelines in Australia</para>
        <para>To date, the MRPBA Accreditation Committee, which provides the board with advice on educational programs deemed sufficient to develop the required professional capabilities, has not described or endorsed educational requirements for practitioners performing MRI. In the Australian implementation, this may not occur because, unlike the arrangements in New Zealand, providing MRI services does not require a specific class of registration. The obligation to perform competently arises when the practitioner includes MRI in their activities. A challenge to the competence of a practitioner may only occur following a complaint to the MRPBA by a patient or other individual. Considering the lack of previous enforceable standards in MRI capabilities and the range of practices that may have developed expediently, the capabilities of individual practitioners around MRI safety may come under scrutiny from mandatory notifications to the MRPBA or the Medical Board under the AHPRA system. Registrants are obliged to notify the Board when they believe the public is placed at risk where the practice is a significant departure from accepted professional standards (i.e., section 140(d) of the National Law) (8).</para>
        <para>The degree courses for Medical Radiation Practitioner registration teach MRI principles, safety, and clinical applications at an introductory level, which is obviously insufficient for independently practicing MRI. Therefore, to achieve appropriate MRI competency, radiographers undertake site-based "on the job" training, the basic Australian Society for Medical Imaging &amp; Radiation Therapy (ASMIRT) Level 1 accreditation, or pursue post-graduate education. Unlike graduate level radiography courses, the site and post-graduate training curricula are not standardized or specified by the registration authority. The adequacy of a practitioner's safety skills and competency may initially be decided administratively by the MRI practice following a complaint or incident as the practitioner and carries the responsibility to show competence relative to the new professional capabilities statement.</para>
        <para>At least three Australian universities offer post-graduate courses in MRI technology and clinical practice. The courses are self-funded and students may exit with a post-graduate diploma, up to a Master's degree level. MRI safety is typically addressed in the first year of study along with physics and imaging principles.</para>
        <para>The national radiographic professional body, the Australian Society for Medical Imaging &amp; Radiation Therapy was formerly known as the Australian Institute of Radiography (A.I.R.). ASMIRT operates a two-level MRI certification program amongst a range of modality specific accreditations. Currently, the certification is only open to diagnostic and therapy radiographers at this time and does not specifically offer certification of professional capabilities required by the new document (7).</para>
        <para>Level 1 MRI certification is achieved by passing an online exam and the completion of three hundred MRI examinations in a twelve-month period. Certification is maintained by performing nine hundred MRI examinations in a three-year period. ASMIRT Level 2 MRI certification, intended for MRI supervisors, is granted on presentation of a portfolio of professional development activities and this certification is maintained with continuing evidence of professional activities and a larger number of clinical examinations that must be performed. Details of the program and fees are available at the ASMIRT website and in a recently revised MRI certification manual (9).</para>

          <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management    977</title>
          <para>The MRI safety module of the Level 1 accreditation curriculum requires knowledge of MRI bioeffects and the potential hazards associated with the static, time-varying, and radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields. In combination with general patient care topics, it accounts for 15% of the examination's content and score. However, this is not to say that knowledge of MRI safety topics is examined in depth by the Level 1 certification process. Issues of motion through the static magnetic field, the spatial gradient magnetic field and interactions between medical implants and the scanner are not included. Many experienced MRI radiographers recognize that the ASMIRT Level 1 accreditation represents a relatively low standard of knowledge. Not surprisingly, the ASMIRT currently recommends that radiographers undertaking MRI should undergo further education and certification. Their certification is also supported by the national radiology professional guidelines (10).</para>
          <para>As previously mentioned, Australian MRI radiographers tend to take the lead role in understanding MRI technology, pulse sequences, and imaging principles as well as the comprehensive issues of MRI safety. To a degree, radiographers have attempted to informally fill the gap left by less involved radiologists. A potential pitfall to this is that staff members may be functioning clinically above their knowledge base and beyond their delegated professional roles, resulting in possible risks to themselves and patients.</para>
          <para>There is a high level of membership in the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine's (ISMRM) and the Society for MR Radiographers and Technologists (SMRT) amongst Australian radiographers performing MRI. The International and Australia &amp; New Zealand (ANZ) chapter of the SMRT provides a continuing stream of high quality MRI safety educational programs through annual national and international meetings, and via online educational materials. This provides a core of several hundred highly aware radiographers operating in connection with international sources, although industry mechanisms and practice do not presently appear to value the resource these members represent. Of note is that very few Australian clinical MRI facilities employ medical physicists. The Australian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM) commenced a program of lectures, practical assignments and examination in 2020 to offer professional body certification to the role of an MR Safety Expert. First completions are expected in mid to late 2021.</para>

Australian MR systems have therefore been programmed to observe the global limits for the static magnetic field strength, RF, specific absorption rate</para>

          <para>(SAR), and time-varying, magnetic field limits (TVMF) related to patient exposures rather than old FDA requirements that were replaced by IEC limits in 2014 (12).</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Key MRI Safety Points From AS/NZS 3200.2.33:2005.</emphasis> The IEC model of three-tiered operating modes for the MR system is employed in Australian standards and in clinical practice. The standards specify thresholds for the static magnetic field strength, RF power deposition, and time-varying magnetic fields at each operating mode (Table 1). In the Normal Operating Mode, none of the scanner outputs may cause physiological stress to patients. In the First Level Controlled Operating Mode, one or more of the scanner outputs are at values that may cause physiological stress to patients. Before employing the First Level Controlled Operating Mode, a decision must be made on medical grounds to confirm that the patient can handle the increased exposure level. Medical supervision is required to control any physiological stress caused by the scanner. The standards require scanners operate in a way that needs a deliberate action by the MR system operator before enabling the First Level Controlled Operating Mode. A Second Level Controlled Operating Mode also exists, where one or more of the scanner outputs reach levels that may cause significant risk for patients. Operation of the MR system in this mode requires explicit local ethical approvals. Notably, most clinical MR systems cannot be easily switched to the Second Level Controlled Operating Mode.</para>
          <para>MR system manufacturers bear the primary responsibility of implementing many requirements of the IEC and AS/NZS standards in these regards (13). The AS/NZS 3200.2.33:2005 has not been revised since 2005 and is now out of step with the parent standard (third edition, 2013). Most notably, the Australian and New Zealand standards classify all MRI use above 2-Tesla as the<emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> (i.e., requiring medical decision and supervision). The current European standard IEC60601-2-33:2013 3.1 (9) sets 3-Tesla as the upper limit of the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis>, with 8 Tesla as the upper limit of the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> compared to 4 Tesla in the older standards.</para>
          <para>The AS/NZS and IEC standards can be purchased on-line or accessed through academic libraries. However, because of its age, it is not a useful document in practice. The current IEC standard is a wiser investment. Libraries may offer access to the equivalent document under the British Standards (15). Despite their technically dry language, the international standards contain substantial appendices and discussions addressing the rationale of the selected patient exposure limits. They also provide insights into occupational exposure issues, specific requirements for the documentation provided with scanners, patient screening, acoustic noise levels, and several test methodologies that make them important reading material for advanced MRI practitioners.</para>

          <para>*Via TGA approval of IEC 60601-2-33:2015 compliance.</para>
          <para>All MR systems must obtain registration on the TGA's Australian Registry of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be imported or sold in Australia. Certified conformance with the IEC60601-2-33:2013 or AS/NZS 3200.2.33.2005 can be accepted as evidence to place an MR scanner on the ARTG. The harmonization of FDA MR equipment safety standards with the IEC in 2014 has removed the potential for the differences from scanners built to comply with older FDA standards.</para>
          <para>The ARTG system also approves all implanted medical devices used in Australia. The registration process assesses information provided by a device sponsor against a set of defined "essential principles". The essential principles require that use of the sponsored device does not compromise health and safety, that it has been designed and constructed to comply with safety principles, that the device remains safe throughout its useful life, and that the benefits of the device outweigh any undesirable effects. There are also additional "essential principles" regarding design and construction that include specific information to be supplied by the manufacturer. These requirements define the content of Australian Information for Use, (IFU) documents for implants and medical devices, requiring them to include "Any warnings, restrictions on use, or precautions that should be taken in relation to the device." The TGA regulations are similar to those of the European Union (EU). The TGA will accept conformity assessments issued by specific EU Notified Bodies or other evidence of compliance with Australian or international standards, as evidence of compliance with many of the essential principles. The ARTG requirements to provide warnings, restrictions on use, and precautions, includes exposure to MR systems, but the TGA does not prescribe a format for information regarding MRI and device interactions in the way that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has done since 2005. As a result, the information concerning interactions between implants or devices and MR systems is variable but most "Instructions for Use" for a medical product include FDA-style statements of the MRI conditions for safe scanning, utilizing the American Society for Testing and Materials International (ASTM)/IEC symbols for MR Safe, MR Conditional, and MR Unsafe.</para>
          <para>The TGA relies upon the Advisory Committee on Medical Devices (ACMD) to consider the information for an implant or device. Most of the 15 members of the advisory committee are surgeons, with one competent biomedical engineer, but no medical physicists or members familiar with MRI safety. In 2017, the ACMD assumed the responsibilities of the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Medical Devices. The ACMD is reactive, collaborating closely with industry on problems that have been identified through complaints and incidents. Notably, a review of the guidelines commenced in 2016 but has not been completed at the time of writing. Several submissions regarding standardizing information for MRI-related interactions were received. Early reports suggest that the scope of the MRI section will be reduced in length (16). In the initial responses to professional and industry submissions contained some concerning signs (17, 18). The ACMD decided to disregard the International Organization for Standardization Technical Standard (ISO TS) 10974 and to remove requirements for MRI-specific labeling as well as patient identification cards for implants, although they recognized that such information would be helpful to the TGA to grant device approval (16). New guidelines will need close review to determine if they decrease rather than increase the information provided about devices in the MRI environment.</para>

        <title>PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS</title>
        <para>Radiologists are medical practitioners registered by the Medical Board of Australia. Active assurance of safe practice is one of the five elements of a 2017 "Professional Performance Framework" designed by the Medical Board to ensure that medical practitioners deliver services competently and ethically (19). This document requires all medical practitioners to actively assure safety as a central pillar of their professional activities.</para>
        <para>The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) Standards of Practice for Clinical Radiology details the professional standards expected for participation in their Medical Imaging Accreditation Program (20). Members of the RANZCR are expected to respect the Standards of Practice. Non-observance can lead to professional consequences or may open a practice to censure by, or complaint to the Medical Practitioners Board. Medicare funding is conditional on the observance of these professional standards through the RANZCR Quality Assurance Program. For these reasons, the Standards of Practice arguably define the Australian minimum acceptable position on MRI safety, although the level of legal liability is unclear.</para>
        <para>Section 13 of the document includes several specific standards and indicators regarding MRI safety. A practice must ensure that all sedation, anesthesia, and monitoring equipment used in the MR system room is certified "MRI-compatible" (sic) by the manufacturer. Despite the error in terminology, this suggests that such equipment must be used in accordance with specific MR Conditional labeling in order to ensure safety use monitoring devices. Safety training for staff members is not specifically addressed in this document. The reporting radiologist must be credentialed as an "MR Radiologist", usually by virtue of the general registration or education processes in RANZCR since January 1995.</para>
        <para>RANZCR requires that the radiographers who conduct MRI exams have appropriate training. In the absence of stipulations by the radiographer registration board (MRPBA), the Level 1 ASMIRT MR accreditation is represented by RANZCR as the standard level for</para>
        <para>MRI radiographers. The RANZCR clinical standards require that Level 1 staff performing MR scanning are supervised by a Level 2 ASMIRT MR accredited radiographer. The new professional capabilities required for registered radiographers providing MRI services, issued by the Medical Radiation Practitioner Board (7) take legal superiority as of March 2020, and the RANZCR standards are likely to require revision.</para>
        <para>Specific MRI safety standards are listed in section 13.4 of the RANZCR standards. The primary requirement is that "MRI safety practices and policies must be documented, enforced and periodically reviewed by the supervising radiologist(s)". The MR Radiologist is primarily responsible for the safe operation and administration of MRI service. The use of several titles (MR Radiologist, supervising radiologist, Liason MRI Radiologist, etc.) clouds the identification of this healthcare professional, but could be clarified, along with delegations, in site-specific MR safety policies. Reviews of policies are required at least annually. Additionally, policies must protect patients and personnel in the MRI area from potential hazardous interactions, but the standard only focusses on ferromagnetic interactions associated with the static magnetic field of the scanner. Furthermore, the standard identifies the document from the IEC, (IEC 60601-2-33), as the main MRI safety standard while endorsing the American College of Radiology (ACR) guidance document as well as the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) MRI safety guidelines as recommended resources. Previous standards on the availability of an MRI radiologist for consultation on safety questions and the maintenance of a registry of unauthorized objects entering the MR system room have been removed since the 2012 version. Beyond these general points, the Standards of Practice refer to the RANZCR Guidelines on MRI Safety.</para>
        <para>Anecdotally, these requirements are not universally observed, with reports of non-radiographers preparing and positioning patients and solo operation of scanners by non-accredited radiographers. Whether these practices remain defensible or tolerated under new practitioner registration requirements remains to be seen. The RANZCR document is intended to apply in New Zealand and Australia, yet there is no mention of the specific registration category and the post-graduate educational requirements required for a registered radiographer under the New Zealand Medical Radiation Technologists Registration Board (21).</para>

        <title>Section 3: Administrative Aspects and Roles</title>
        <para>Important administrative aspects of MRI safety open the guidelines, stressing the importance of planning for the delivery safe practices as a fundamental element of the MRI examination. The three tiers of MRI safety personnel described in international consensus is interpreted for the Australian clinical model (24). A radiologist must be explicitly designated for each MRI facility making the suggested title of "Medical Director of MRI" analogous to the consensus title of MR Medical Director or MRMD. An MRI Safety Officer (MRSO) with the responsibilities for day-to-day implementation of MRI safety policies works with the MRMD to develop a consistent approach to ensure the safety of the site, patients, and staff members. This MRSO is described as a designated position, which implies greater knowledge and responsibility than the operational MRI radiographers. Notably, there is no suggestion in the document that the term "MRSO" is prescriptive of the MRSO designation registered by the American Board of Magnetic Resonance Safety, or that a specific MRI safety training curriculum or accreditation is supported by the guidelines. The RANZCR guidelines recommend that MRI sites have access to an "expert third party" who would be invited to offer advice on specific matters such as reviewing facility policies, procedures, and planning. The MR Safety Expert (MRSE) may simply be an MRMD or an MRSO from another site, but these individuals are expected to possess in-depth knowledge of the technical and engineering aspects of MRI equipment and interactions of MRI-related electromagnetic fields with human subjects. Diagnostic imaging physicians (or medical physicists) with specific MRI training are likely to be the best fit for the role of MRSE.</para>
        <para>It is suggested that larger facilities establish MRI safety committees to manage policies and to review and examine incidents. A site-specific MRI safety manual is specifically required, along with an incident reporting system. Incidents must be reported internally within 24 hours, with a documented review and response that analyze root causes, providing recommendations for improvement. An active review and monitoring process is central to active provision of safe practices. The clear documentation of annual training of staff working within the MRI facility is another key administrative tool relied upon by the guidelines.</para>
        <para>RANZCR has opted for the terms Junior and Senior MRI personnel, instead of Level 1 and 2 MR Personnel as indicated by the ACR, but the patterns of responsibility are similar. Junior personnel have basic training on-site security and rules involving MRI technology, as well as emergency procedures, screening, and hearing protection. These staff members can work within the ACR designated Zones 3 and 4 (i.e., the MR system room) in order to perform initial patient screening. The senior staff members are additionally trained in the physical principles of MRI safety including exposure limits, cryogen hazards, and management of patients with implants and devices. Furthermore, Senior MRI personnel are responsible for signing off the final MRI safety screening procedure and for supervising the other staff members, including non-MRI trained personnel.</para>

        <para>In this section of the document, there are certain departures from the TGA position that place the RANZCR guidelines closer to current international standards. Equipment output limits and the MR system's operating modes are drawn directly from the IEC 60601-2-33 2013 edition, appropriately sidelining the relevance of the AS/NZ standard. Some details that conflict with the current IEC standard seem to have been retained from earlier versions, including interest in room humidity (no longer a controlled element relevant to SAR as specified by the IEC), the identification of 7 Tesla scanners as research devices (now considered First Level Controlled Operating Mode MR systems; notably, these very high field strength scanners have been approved for clinical use in Europe and the U.S.), and the limit on specific absorbed energy of 14.4Kj/kg (replaced by manufacturer specific risk guidelines in the IEC standard).</para>

The RANZCR guidance has a clear preference for ACR's four-zone strategy and requires all new construction of MRI facilities to implement this means of controlling access of the MRI environment on the basis that zones are stipulated in the Australian Health Facility Guidelines 2016 (25). Designated areas outside the MR system room are required for resuscitation activity, anesthetic induction and recovery, and cryogen storage. Access to all areas in a static magnetic field above 0.5 mT must be controlled by MRI personnel. The guideline also contains specific requirements limiting access to areas of the quench pipe discharge. MRI facilities are required to supply MR appropriate fire extinguishers, room temperature and humidity monitors, patient stretchers and wheelchairs, scanner room oxygen monitors, patients call buttons, and to have direct vision of patients and all MR system room access doors from the control desk.</para>

        <title>Sections 9 &amp; 10: Patient/Individual Screening and Scan Room Access</title>
        <para>Screening patients and other individuals for implants and foreign bodies is required for all individuals entering the MR system room. Those entering zone 3 must have basic checks for cardiac pacemakers (interestingly, without mention of other implanted "active" devices), plus appropriate restrictions on their access to zone 4, the scanner room. Patient screening is expected on three occasions in addition to statements from the referrer on the MRI request form regarding implants and the suitability for an MRI exam. The first screening by MRI staff can be carried out remotely during scheduling, while the second and third screenings must be conducted on-site by MRI personnel, directly. At least one screening should involve the use of a written screening form and one should involve review of the information on the form along with a verbal screening by Senior MRI personnel who must confirm and identify themselves on the screening form. Section 9 of the guidelines provides a strong discussion of how to document and to make scanning decisions.</para>
        <para>If implants are identified during the screening process, further investigation is performed which involves a review of case notes, past imaging studies, a physical examination, an assessment of the implant information provided by the manufacturer (e.g., a review of the Instructions for Use), and possibly additional imaging to help determine the conditions for</para>
        <para>safe scanning. Concerns regarding safety must be resolved carefully, in consultation with an MR safety expert, as needed. The final decision to proceed with an MRI exam is a clinical one and, thus, is made by the radiologist. Scanning a patient with an implant using conditions that are outside those specified by the manufacturer must be covered by a written policy from the facility and be approved by the MRI Medical Director. Furthermore, this action requires written and verbal informed consent of the patient. These afore-mentioned requirements obviously limit the potential for site-specific, policies for implants and devices.</para>
        <para>Scan room access during scanning operations is considered specifically by section 10. The door to the MR system room must be kept closed unless individuals are walking through it and, when the entryway is open, it must be visually monitored. All objects entering the scanner room must be labeled with appropriate ASTM F2503 icons: MR Safe or MR Conditional). Only essential non-patients (e.g., support personnel such as nurses, respiratory therapists, or anesthesiologists) are allowed into the MR system room during examinations.</para>

Therefore, the guidelines reinforce the responsibility of the MRI radiologist and the need to a patient-specific, examination-specific prescription of GBCA use. This statement is additional to the 2017 RANZCR statement on gadolinium retention, supported by the TGA (26), in which they noted that routine use of GBCA in some patients "where there is not a specific indication" should be reviewed by a medical professional (27).</para>

The management of the use of a GBCA in a pregnant patient is discussed in section 15.2 of the guidelines with an uncited opinion and the statement that no adverse effects have been convincingly demonstrated. Notably, the RANZCR position is in conflict with a large-scale Canadian study that identified GBCA as a potential significant source of health effects in the fetus, but not with respect to exposures to MRI-related, electromagnetic fields during gestation (29), despite this investigation being explicitly referred to for other conclusions.</para>

Patients at risk and the heating of internal metal are well-described for information purposes. The conventional measures to reduce the potential for MRI-related burns, removal of conductive leads, padding to the bore, not crossing the patient's limbs, and using padding between skin surfaces are included. The document relies on patient feedback related to heating. It does not discuss possible "deep" burns from RF hotspots related to modified and parallel transmit RF systems, or nonstandard transmit RF coil designs.

          <title>Patient, Public, and Occupational Exposure Limits</title>
          <para>Exposure limits for static magnetic, time-varying magnetic fields, and RF fields have been defined in Australian standards for the patient undergoing an MRI procedure, where the patient receives some benefit from undergoing the examination. Exposure limits for the general public or occupational exposures are often set lower than a patient limit to reflect the lack of benefit from that exposure.</para>
          <para>In the early period of MRI use in Australia, prior to adoption of the IEC standards, the primary Australian scientific body, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) commissioned production of the "Safety guidelines for magnetic resonance diagnostic facilities" (30). Such publications were in line with the NHMRC objective to "advise the Australian community on the achievement and maintenance of the highest practicable standards of individual and public health" (30). The NHMRC guidelines were</para>
          <para>published in a radiation health series and placed the responsibility for MRI safety in the hands of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA). ARPANSA is the body responsible for monitoring ionizing radiation from medical exposure, solar radiation exposure, environmental non-ionizing radiation (such as microwaves and low frequency electromagnetic fields), the uranium mining industry, and Australian nuclear reactors. This delegation mirrors similar decisions in the United Kingdom and Europe.</para>
          <para>The 1991 document drew its material largely from early publications and international scientific bodies of the period. It recognized a paucity of information regarding repeated exposure to the electromagnetic fields used by MR systems and, thus, established somewhat conservative recommendations. After a period of public comment, it was published and then seemed to be largely ignored or to go unnoticed by the clinical MRI community.</para>
          <para>In 2004, the document was withdrawn by ARPANSA and replaced with a "trusted international document", the 2004 International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) statement on medical magnetic resonance procedures (31). The creation of the AS/NZS 3200.2.33 standard released ARPANSA from direct responsibility for setting MRI exposure limits.</para>
          <para>The ARPANSA returned obliquely to matters that impacted MRI exposures with its work to establish an Australian radiation protection standard establishing maximum exposure levels for electric and magnetic fields 0 Hz (static) to 3 Hz. This work was initially intended to address public concerns regarding the safety of proximity to electrical power lines and was to replace a 1989 statement on 50/60 Hz field exposures (32). The working group responsible for drafting the radiation protection standard was dominated by representatives of the power generation and distribution industry. A draft was released for public comment in late 2006 (33). The document was focused on power line field exposure, but also set out to establish mandatory restrictions for the general public and occupational exposure over the full range of activities that produce extremely low frequency (ELF) fields. In another chapter in this textbook which pertains to MRI safety in Europe, Dr. Stephen Keevil illustrates how efforts to address safety concerns public concerns over exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) time-varying electrical and magnetic fields (EMF) from sources such as power transmission lines, and specific industrial exposures can impact the practice of MRI. Scientific consideration of an extensive literature review in the draft focused on certain information on peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS).</para>
          <para>The 2006 consultation document did not recognize any potential impact on the practice of MRI (even though it included an occupational limit of 2 Tesla at a time when 3 Tesla MR systems were being installed) and the committee responsible for the proposed exposure limits failed to make any connection with the European Union (EU) debate raging at that time. MRI professional organizations including the ISMRM, SMRT, and RANZCR (34) were mobilized and approximately one-third of all submissions made to the ARPANSA working group came from MRI professionals and MRI equipment suppliers concerned that the proposed exposure limits would interfere with important diagnostic technology and practice. By February 2008, the ARPANSA was taking note of the concerns regarding MRI (35) and apparently considered increasing the static magnetic field limits and adopting the</para>

          <para>The release of a final radiation protection standard was expected by the middle of 2010 but with public consultation and the release of international reviews of the scientific literature, the ARPANSA stepped away from producing a radiation protection standard in the ELF range. The ARPANSA moved to adopt the ICNIRP 2010 statement on limiting ELF exposures (36) in line with a policy of adopting international best practices. In 2017, the ICNIRP published a paper describing existing regulations on diagnostic devices using nonionizing radiations, suggesting incorrectly that the 1991 document remains in use in Australia with regulatory strength. ARPANSA has confirmed that this is not the case (37).</para>

          <title>Research Regarding Australian MRI Safety Practice</title>
          <para>There have only been two published attempts to research the practice of MRI safety in Australia. Ferris, et al. (43) published a survey of Australian MRI safety practices following the release of the first RANZCR MRI Safety Guidelines in 2004. A series of questions was sent to supervising MRI radiologists at all known MRI facilities in Australia seeking to examine general and difficult aspects of MRI safe practices in the field through anonymous or attributed responses. Ninety-two of 115 sites (80%) responded after diligent follow up. The study reported selected results including the observation that the new RANZCR and ACR guidelines were considered equally influential (38% each) and ten sites reported using external consultation to review their MRI safety procedures (34).</para>
          <para>Seven sites reported inadvertent scanning of eight cardiac pacemaker patients. One of these events resulted in a death in 2000. Eight MRI facilities were willing to accept requests to scan patients with non-MR Conditional cardiac pacemakers but did not specify their precautions. Four sites had intentionally imaged cardiac pacemaker patients with undisclosed precautions. There was a general refusal to scan patients with retained pacemaker leads (77 sites) and twenty MRI facilities refused to scan patients with any type of intracranial aneurysm clip. Of the seventy-one MRI facilities that would scan patients with intracranial aneurysm clips, virtually all (70/71) relied on documented evidence of the clip's identity. Additionally, ten sites insisted that the aneurysm clip was in its original packaging before insertion, and four MRI facilities reported that they did their own testing on clips prior to implantation. With regard to patients with metallic implants, the manufacturer's product information and third-party sources were used equally to justify the decision to perform an MRI examination (34).</para>
          <para>The variations in MRI safety practices prompted discussions between the radiology and neurosurgical professional bodies, as well as with the TGA, but there were no concrete results from these interactions. The study method did not probe the site's understanding or use of ASTM F2503 and FDA-style statements of conditions for performing safe MRI examinations in patients with implants and devices. Eighty-six percent of the sites reported procedural delays while MRI safety issues were resolved and these situations occurred frequently and on a constant basis. The investigators concluded that dealing with MRI safety questions continues to be difficult and increased vigilance including requiring the referring physician to supply critical MRI safety information at the time of the examination request is required to prevent the inadvertent scanning of cardiac pacemaker patients (34). Ferris, et al. (43) also indicated there may be a role for an MRI safety advisor providing an external audit of site policies and procedures.</para>
          <para>In 2007, Burwell and Davidson (44) offered another insight into MRI safety policy and procedures in Australia. Their qualitative questionnaire explored who established site safety</para>
          <para>policies, who was considered the local final authority, requested details pertaining to pre-scan screening, and determined how often policies were reviewed. This study also asked about safety breaches, although many participants chose not to respond to that section. A total of 110 surveys were sent out and 46 were returned. Considering the growth of MRI in Australia and the similarity in the number of sites identified by these two studies, it is quite likely that data for the Burwell and Davidson report was collected in 2005, about the time of the survey by Ferris, et al. (43).</para>
          <para>The Burwell and Davidson survey reported that experienced MRI radiographers and radiologists created site safety policies independently or collaboratively. In contrast to Ferris, et al. (43), this survey indicated that the ACR white paper on MRI safety and the various peer-reviewed and other published works by Dr. Frank G. Shellock were most commonly used when creating a site policy. Screening, which RANZCR requires to be conducted at four points before the examination, was typically performed only two or three times. Only 62% of the sites reported using written processes to follow up questions raised by the patient screening questionnaire.</para>
          <para>In general, safety policies were reviewed "as required" rather than on a regular schedule. Eighty percent of respondents claimed to maintain the required log of safety violations and near misses, but few were prepared to respond to a question that asked if there had been an incident during which a patient was harmed. The undisclosed number who did respond reported that ten contrast reactions occurred, eight MRI-related burns, two problems related to "incompatible" or otherwise unsafe medical implants, and there was one projectile injury. This report concluded, without clear justification, that a large number of sites did not meet the simple RANZCR safety standards of the time.</para>

        <title>MRI Safety Education for Radiologists</title>
        <para>Australian radiologists who completed their training after January 2005 are automatically certified as MRI radiologists for as long as they maintained MRI-specific continuing professional development (CPD) credits. The standards of their profession, and elements of their registration mean that the MRI radiologist has the primary responsibility for the safety of patients, and others at their facilities.</para>
        <para>MRI safety is addressed in the Applied Imaging Technology (AIT) syllabus of the RANZCR radio-diagnosis curriculum (45), the training program for radiologists. Patient and staff safety are considered "special knowledge" relevant to the radiologist's status as "an expert in the field". An understanding of MRI safety issues, specifically missile effects and heating issues relating to implants or devices are described in the highest category of the curriculum and given the same importance as that of radiation exposure minimization to decrease cancer risk (i.e., Category 1, Must Know). The AIT curriculum also covers MRI hardware and imaging principles.</para>
        <para>There is no indication that radiology trainees receive structured education on MRI safety-related clinical decision-making taught by radiologists. These matters would only be observed in the MRI section of a trainees' clinical work. This lack of didactic instruction from the available body of literature and practice has resulted in a prolonged weakness in the central professional group. MRI safety practice relies upon informed radiologists dele-</para>
        <para>gating appropriately to educated staff members, but the training of radiologists is not addressing this need with any great urgency.</para>
        <para>Evidence suggests that the radiology trainee's understanding of MRI safety is not closely tested. Review of the twenty-eight AIT exam papers since 2004 demonstrated that questions probing MRI safety knowledge had been used only five times and that candidates had been tested on safety far less than on basic knowledge of image production. MRI safety questions may appear in multiple-choice AIT exams, but these are not publicly accessible. Post qualification MRI safety education available from the College is also sparse. There are no MRI safety resources in the RANZCR public presentation archive (46), but members may have access to a wide selection from those that are readily available (e.g., peer-reviewed journals, websites, etc.). Interestingly, the programs of RANZCR Annual Scientific meetings from 2007 to 2019 have only included two presentations on MRI safety issues - one international expert reviewing implant and MRI interactions and a local expert providing a review of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) literature in 2007. These points combined make it difficult to determine where and Australian radiologists obtain their knowledge of MRI safety.</para>

        </para>
        <para>Australia has an MRI safety system, standards, and regulatory strategy that are aligned more closely with European models than those of the United States. A change in approach is slowly developing with a generation of experienced clinical MRI physicians from the United Kingdom influencing the radiology and medical physics training curricula.</para>
        <para>Australian MRI facilities make regular use of the statements of conditions for safe scanning of implants and devices required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Limited research on the practice of MRI safety in Australia confirmed that the ACR guidance documents on MRI safe practice and the resources published by an independent, U.S.-based expert and his website (i.e., Frank G. Shellock, Ph.D., www.MRIsafety.com) were apparently more influential on MRI practitioners than the local professional guidelines. However, specific research has not reflected the strong anecdotal experience that, at many MRI facilities, radiologists are only marginally involved in MRI safety decisions and that the radiographers strongly influence the assimilation of evolving knowledge.</para>
        <para>Radiologists and radiographers accessing information at international conferences, in print, and online appear to have the greatest impact on appropriate MRI safety practices. By comparison, a local active MRI safety discussion seems absent apart from regular sessions at the annual meeting of the ANZ Chapter of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Technologists (SMRT). Hopefully, the foundation of an ANZ Chapter of the ISMRM will ultimately provide another vehicle to generate cross-disciplinary education and discussion.</para>
        <para>The imminent changes the professional capabilities of radiographers will increase the expected level of knowledge providing the public with greater protection against underperforming staff members. Alignment of the RANZCR guidelines and standards are needed to recognize this new legislative backed reality. At the same time, opening MRI services to nuclear medicine and radiation therapy radiographers and the expansion of services into</para>
        <para>rural areas will result in a growth in the number of practitioners who will need to manage MRI safety issues effectively. New professional capability standards place a direct obligation on the radiographer to provide the public with a safe and effective imaging service, while the radiologists consider themselves experts in the field and retain the medical responsibility for the examination. Mobilization and training of the medical physicists could provide an extra dimension to the MRI safety dialogue by introducing better scientific perspectives and a departure from the power imbalance of the employer/employee relationship between radiologists and radiographers.</para>
        <para>The RANZCR could consider the use of MRI facility policies that produce consistent decisions on commonly encountered implants and devices in the Australian market place. MRI practitioners should also urgently consider delegating common MRI safety decisions to appropriately experienced and educated MRI personnel such as advanced MRI radiographers and medical physicists, working in conjunction with the clinical aims expressed by radiologists, and working with appropriate recognition and remuneration for their skills and responsibilities. This last initiative will require that MRI facilities develop much clearer statements of reasoned decision-making than are currently found. The specific training needs for radiologists, radiographers, or physicists should also be revisited, with improvements made at all levels.</para>
        <para>In this author's view, the need to clarify roles, improve education and more significantly improve daily practice has been chronic and must be openly addressed. This needs far greater engagement from radiologists than has been observed in the field, to date.</para>
        <para>Radiographers at all MRI sites will need to improve their technical knowledge and strategic thinking skills to help guide a structured approach to facility's policies and decisions. Above all, professionals need to deliver on the existing guidelines. Folklore, hearsay, and hero worship must be replaced by factual clear reasoning for practices to improve as MRI moves from first-generation enthusiasts to second-generation learners . MRI safety is a scientific and clinical endeavor that requires knowledge and literacy in both domains. Educated specialist voices need to be valued over those without qualifications or experience. The ultimate goal of the MRI community is to reasonably maintain the extremely high safety record of MRI while maximizing the benefit of the technology to patients.</para>
