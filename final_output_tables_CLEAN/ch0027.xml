      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>No matter what the structure of the facility, be it an academic medical center, a com- munity hospital, or a small rural hospital, the overriding mandate is to maintain a safe en- vironment for the patients and employees. To this end, with specific regard to magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI), facilities must “establish, implement, and maintain current MRI  safety policies and procedures,” often referred to as a “Safety Manual”, to ensure the safety  of patients, visitors, and staff members (1). These policies and procedures dictate the desires  of the organization and how they are to be implemented. In consideration of the above, the  objective of this chapter is to focus on policies and procedures, the nature of how these are  developed, implemented, reviewed and distributed, and the legal implications with an em- phasis on MRI safety in the setting of a hospital or medical center.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="ch0027s03">
      <title>GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
      <para>Policies and procedures are written for a variety of reasons. Some are designed to be  the institution’s response to regulatory and governing body requirements (2). This is less  true with MRI than it is for modalities that use ionizing radiation (e.g., X-ray and nuclear  medicine) due to differing levels of governmental oversight and regulation. Some policies  and procedures are written as a means of ensuring consistency across similar entities within  a larger organization, as is the case with larger academic and regional institutions with small  satellite campuses and diagnostic imaging centers. Policies and procedures can also be writ- ten in response to events.  For example, before 2001, few facilities had a formal policy on  the use of portable oxygen cylinders or other tanks used for gases utilized in the MRI envi-</para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 749-1002_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:45 PM  Page 749</para>
      <para>ronment (3, 4). By far, the most common reason policies and procedures are written is to  ensure compliance with industry best practices. Some believe that the current <emphasis role="italics">de facto</emphasis>, best  practice standard for MRI is the American College of Radiology (ACR) Guidance Docu- ment on MR Safe Practices: 2013 (1). The ACR document rapidly changed the manner in  which the clinical MRI setting operated. The MRI industry, self-governed since the begin- ning, suddenly had a written document to use as a template to guide MRI safety procedures.  As far as written documentation was concerned, while this document had no enforceability,  it almost overnight prompted significant changes.</para>
      <para>One key concept of the ACR document, and the only element to be detailed in this chap- ter, is the concept of dividing the imaging facility into four discrete zones with increasingly  restricted access as the zones progress from Zones I to IV. The zone model is intended to  help control access to the MRI environment and, thus, facilitate safety in this setting. Zone  I represents the public space and is essentially unregulated. Zone II represents the public  interface and can be defined as the public space within the MRI department such as the  waiting, changing, and interview areas as well as the areas for the restrooms and similar  spaces. Zone III represents the limited access, technical workspace between Zone II and  the MR system room and as such is under the constant supervision of trained MR personnel.  Zone IV is the scanner room and is the most tightly controlled space. In Zone IV, the po- tential problems exist whereby ferromagnetic implants, foreign bodies, and external devices  will be affected. Failure to restrict access to those personnel without proper training and  the use of support equipment specifically designed for use in the MRI setting can result in  significant injury or death to patients, visitors, and staff members. The only other published  standard, and one which dovetails nicely with the ACR guidance document, is the Sentinel  Event Alert #38, published by The Joint Commission (5, 6).</para>
      <para>When creating policies and procedures based on industry best practices, it is important  to carefully search the published literature on the topic. Drafting a policy and procedure  with outdated information or improper terminology (e.g., using “MRI compatible” versus  “MR Conditional” for MRI labeling purposes) offers little in the way of guidance or pro- tection for any of the parties involved. It is also important when formulating policies based  on best practices, to create a comprehensive manual of policies and procedures to ensure  that all aspects of operations are covered. A sample outline for a comprehensive MRI Safety  Manual presented in Appendix I.</para>
      <para>Some MRI facilities in the hospital or medical center setting use the ACR guidance  document as single blanket policy covering all general operations within the department or  as a road map to drafting individual policies. Other facilities use the guidance document as  a starting point and draft additional policies and procedures to narrow the focus of opera- tional issues in key areas, as needed, or if there are persistent concerns, such as a pattern of  MRI-safety related events that occur during the preparation of patients for the MRI exam- inations.</para>
      <para>The scope with which policies and procedures are written can be very broad and appli- cable to everyone within the organization or narrowly focused to apply to a very limited  target audience. Whatever the reason for writing the policy and procedure, it is vital that  the policy works toward the goals of the organization without placing undue burden on op-</para>

      <para>erations. The global scope and application of policies and procedures is beyond the bound- aries of this chapter, which will instead focus on the basics as they pertain to MRI.</para>
      <para>In general terms, the hospital or medical center policy and procedure manuals operate  on a “trickle down” approach whereby the top institutional policies and procedures apply  to all those lower down the organizational and operational chain. The lower you go, the  more narrow the scope of the policy. For example, an institutional policy and procedure on  Infant Safe Haven Laws applies to everyone in the institution regardless of department or  position, while a policy and procedure pertaining to screening patients prior to entering the  MRI environment applies only to those individuals employed in and empowered to enter  the MRI setting. With this in mind, the policies and procedures used in MRI are generally  quite specific and require a basic understanding of the safe operation of the MR systems in  use today.</para>

      <title>POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Policy and Procedure: Definitions </emphasis></para>
      <para>Policy and procedure manuals are an essential component of all institutions. They con- vey the desires of senior leadership with respect to common departmental operations. Ad- ditionally, they instruct the staff on how issues are to be handled during routine operations  and unexpected events. Policy and procedure manuals also set the cultural tone of the de- partment and allow the vision of the organization’s leadership to manifest itself in daily op- erations while protecting the institution from undue risk (7). In the broadest terms, the policy  and procedure manual is the “owner’s manual” for the hospital or medical center and the  standard to which the facility holds itself and to which it will be held by others.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Policy and Procedure: Essential Elements</emphasis></para>
      <para>There are many formats that policies and procedures can follow.  Some take the form  of detailed memos, position statements, or papers that narrate how specific situations or  comprehensive operations are to be handled within the department. Others utilize a formal- ized layout specifically optimized for hospital policies. Lastly, policies can take on the form  of a MRI Safety Manual that governs all relevant operational items and activities within  the department. Regardless of which format is selected there are a few basic needs that each  should have in some form.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Policy  </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>The “policy” is the name of the document or file pertaining to a specific situation, con- dition, or scenario. The following is an example:</para>

      <para>ensure that all patients, visitors, and non-MRI employees undergo comprehensive screening  for the presence of contraindicated materials on or in the body that could result in injury to  self or others if taken into the MR system room (i.e., Zone IV).</para>
      <para>Scope: The section of the policy referred to as the “scope” defines the policy’s intended  audience. Some policies are very limited to a specific piece of equipment, room, or depart- ment, while others are all encompassing and apply to an entire organization. Accurately  defining the scope helps to ensure that the policy will be followed by those who need it and  not lost in the realm of non-applicable policies. If properly worded, the scope of the policy  will not need to be revised when capabilities are changed, hardware is upgraded, or scanners  are added unless they involve entirely new departments.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Procedure  </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>While the policy dictates the desires of the institution, the procedure details the methods  by which the policy is carried out. Using Example 1 above, the MRI Screening Policy, the  procedure would detail the necessary steps to be taken to screen patients, visitors, or non- MRI personnel so that they may safely enter the scanner room. The procedure will vary in  detail depending on facility type, patient mix, and level of complexity of the MRI exami- nations that are performed. The procedure for all MRI facilities should include the core el- ements of what is to be done, how it is to be done, who is responsible for performing the  procedure, and what, if any, resources should be utilized.</para>
      <para>Additionally, the procedure should contain sufficient detail so that it can be easily un- derstood by those covered in the “scope” section of the document. It should not contain ex- cessive details that do not provide clinical relevance. For example, a venipuncture policy  that specifies the size of catheter to be used includes a detail that serves no purpose except  to limit the type of departmental flexibility needed for efficient operations, since the size of  catheter can vary depending on the status of the patient, size of the patient, and examination  to be performed. An effective venipuncture policy should instead specify that a suitable  sized catheter should be inserted based on the examination to be performed. The choice of  catheter size should be at the discretion of the hospital or medical center personnel estab- lishing the venous access. While this type of attention to detail may seem trivial and lead  to frustration, we must remember that overly detailed policies make compliance difficult  and lead to routine deviations. Deviations from policy are to be expected occasionally and,  if clinically justifiable, do not pose a problem. On the other hand, regular deviations suggest  a poorly conceived and worded policy and should be avoided.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Implementation and Revision Date for Policies and Procedures </emphasis></para>
      <para>MRI safety policies and procedures developed for MRI facilities in hospitals and med- ical centers should contain a minimum of two dates, one for the date of creation and/or im- plementation and the other indicating the date of the last revision. The implementation date  can be a single date for all policies that commence on the day a new facility begins opera- tions or the dates can vary if policies are added over time in established facilities. The im- plementation date should not be edited in later revisions.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">754</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Policies and Procedures - Hospital / Medical Center</emphasis></para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 749-1002_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:45 PM  Page 754</para>
      <para>The revision date indicates the date the policy was last reviewed. The preferred method  for documenting revision history is with multiple date lines progressing chronologically.  While this is a slightly more “busy” effect visually, it allows the full revision history to be  established. A single date that changes at subsequent revisions, while satisfying the basic  need to keep policies and procedures current, does not indicate any temporal frequency or  periodicity with respect to the review process. This is, of course, academic with a fully dig- ital manual that can take advantage of revision history and version control features of the  software.  In general, the frequency of review and revision should be annually. Additionally,  if there is a substantial change in operations such as the addition of a new scanner, new op- erating locations, or a major upgrade with respect to the equipment (e.g., software or hard- ware), this also warrants a review of the policies and procedures that specifically apply to  MRI safety (1, 13).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Signatures </emphasis></para>
      <para>All policies and procedures should be signed. The signature can be a line item on all  policy and procedure documents in facilities that have numerous individual documents or  a single signature on the revision page of a comprehensive MRI Safety Manual. Exactly  who signs the policies is up to each individual facility operating within a hospital or medical  center. At the very least, the signature should be that of the modality, section, or department  chief. Ideally, the document would claim multiple signatures from an administration repre- sentative, the MRI Safety Officer or Chairperson of the MRI Safety Committee, and the  party responsible for daily operations within the department, usually the MRI Manager. The  use of electronic signatures for electronic policy and procedure manuals is well established  and is acceptable as long as it complies with established hospital security protocols.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Managing the Policy and Procedure Manual </emphasis></para>
      <para>The need for a comprehensive policy and procedure manual is evident. There are situ- ations though, in which the responsibility for the manual becomes less obvious. For most  hospitals and medical centers, the lines are well defined. The departmental policy and pro- cedure manual is created and maintained by the departmental leadership. In certain cases,  this is not always possible, such as when MRI examinations are provided as a contracted  service through a third-party company. These arrangements are overall quite common,  though the service delivery model can vary considerably.Sometimes MRI service is pro- vided one or more days per week via a visiting mobile MRI unit or the unit can be parked  full-time as a lower-cost “imaging center”.  It is also possible to have a fully functional,  fixed MRI center within the confines of the hospital that is operationalized and managed  by a third-party who provides staff and operational support. Regardless of the arrangement,  the policy and procedure manual needs to be agreed upon by all parties and should be dis- cussed as a matter of course during any negotiations for provided services. Adherence to  policy and procedure standards by contracted personnel should also be considered an inte- gral part of the contracted service and any violation should be treated as a material breech  of the contracted terms. It is critical to remember that the hospital or medical center is re- sponsible for the care of their patients even if a component of the care is outsourced to a  third-party.</para>

      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 749-1002_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:45 PM  Page 755</para>
      <para>When MRI procedures are provided via a contracted mobile service, there are additional  safety policies and procedures that need to be considered. In a mobile arrangement, the zone  model described by the ACR (1), while not mandatory, is less easily achieved and, therefore,  it may be necessary to build docking structures, temporary shelters, or other adaptable  spaces. The regulations governing the use of these spaces varies greatly from state to state  with some municipalities requiring electricity, plumbing, HVAC (i.e., heating, ventilation,  and air conditioning) and even fire suppression. Whatever the type of structure, it is impor- tant that the policy and procedure manual matches the delivery model.</para>
      <para>The policy and procedure manual is also only as good as the data it contains and it is  important to keep the information as current as possible, as previously stated regardless of  MRI facility type, it is essential that the policy and procedure documents be maintained as  a “living document” (1, 2). The old policies should be compared with any departmental  changes and equipment upgrades to see if it still satisfies the original purpose. All facilities  should be familiar with governmental, agency, or regulatory mandated review requirements,  though at present few, if any exist with particular regard to MRI safety. As an example, the  State of Pennsylvania mandates that all radiology policies be reviewed annually (8). Other  states recommend a two-year review while still others have no formal provision for review- ing policies and procedures (9-11). On the agency side, The Joint Commission (TJC) has  no formal standard, but a policy review date older than three years would raise concerns  and lead the inspector to question what other areas of operations have not been reviewed or  revised in greater than a three-year period (Personal Communication, The Joint Commission  Standards Interpretation Group, December 27, 2012).</para>
      <para>Policy and procedure review on an annual basis can be time consuming but the time is  well spent. There are different strategies for managing the manual. Some hospitals and med- ical centers use a formal committee to review, revise, and manage the policy and procedure  manual. Others delegate management of specific sections of the manual (e.g., MRI, com- puted tomography, ultrasound, etc.) to the department managers and/or modality chiefs.  Whichever technique a hospital or medical center chooses to follow, it is essential that they  follow a regimented schedule of review and document the process with updated signatures  and dates.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Implementing New Policies and Procedures </emphasis></para>
      <para>When developing and implementing new policies and procedures for MRI safety, it is  essential that the process be based on careful research and deliberate thought as well as a  focused review of industry best practices in order to be the most effective (2, 6-7). The pro- posed policy and procedure should be initiated as a preliminary document with an imple- mentation date and proposed review date. The preliminary document should be revisited  after the third month of implementation to assess the clinical impact and to revise, as needed.  When initially written, policies and procedures tend to be either too specific or too vague.  Therefore, implementing them as preliminary for a period of three months allows the de- partment to better assess the impact of the policy and procedure on the overall operation of  the department and to correct problems with the wording of the policy or the “mechanics”  of the procedure. Once final and fully operationalized, there is usually no need for further  revision unless mandated by departmental changes.</para>

      <title>DISTRIBUTION OF THE POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL</title>
      <para>Once a hospital or medical center has a workable version of the policy and procedure  manual, it needs to be available to all entities within the organization. For a small hospital  with a single scanner this is a relatively simple task. A university-level hospital with several  departments and affiliated smaller centers faces a greater challenge. Irrespective of facility  type, there are two basic choices for the distribution method of the policy and procedure  manual. Both have benefits and complications and the ultimate distribution choice depends  on the needs of the hospital or medical center.</para>
      <para>Hard copy distribution of the policy and procedure manual has been the standard for  many years. It is basic and, once the manual is written, quite effective. The policy and pro- cedure manual is copied and a copy is then provided to key locations where it can be ac- cessed, such as the MRI center. Typically, there is one copy of the MRI safety policies and  procedures manual provided to the MRI department and another maintained in the admin- istrative area where it resides in a larger manual of global radiology documents covering  the other imaging or therapeutic modalities. Manual distribution is low cost and requires  very little time commitment. For a larger hospital or medical center with more entities and  locations, or even when a few locations are geographically distant from the main facility,  the manual distribution method becomes much less desirable. A major disadvantage of hard  copy manuals is the intricacies of the revision process. A change in a policy and procedure,  regardless of the magnitude of the change, requires that the old version be physically re- placed with the newer version in all manuals. This process requires diligence and attention  to detail and, thus, it is a frequent weak link in the process.</para>
      <para>Many modern-day hospitals and medical centers and certainly most facilities with mul- tiple clinical areas, campuses, and affiliated centers opt instead for an electronic policy man- ual distribution. Maintaining an electronic manual of policies and procedures offers  significant benefits over hard copy manuals. For example, the master manual can be up- dated, as needed, and the changes applied to all subordinate documents immediately and  universally. The same applies to updates for signatures and revision dates. A single source  policy and procedure manual, once edited, passes through to all locations and entities en- suring consistency and minimizes the chances that an outdated document will remain in a  forgotten manual. Another feature of electronic manuals is that there are few limits on what  can be included. Some hospitals and medical centers include photographs that serve as  visual aids for the policy and procedure or even links to videos that reinforce certain ele- ments of the document. Notably, the greatest benefit of an electronic policy and procedure  manual is the ability of it to be linked together with other documents. In an electronic man- ual, it is easy to include a hyperlink to another policy and procedure in the same department  or any department in the organization. This is extremely important when dealing with com- plex policies and procedures that may contain important elements that not only directly im- pact the safety of the MRI department but are also associated with nursing policies and  those involved in safety.</para>
      <para>Examples of policies and procedures that have a high degree of commonality with other  departments include any such document that discusses the administration of non-contrast  medications, which relate very closely to nursing policies, or any document that discusses</para>

      <para>conscious sedation or anesthesia in the MRI department, which ties in heavily to anesthesia  policies. With electronic-based policies and procedures, the referenced nursing or anesthesia  policy is instantly available, making the manual far more effective overall. The drawback  of this increased effectiveness is that the manual requires an increased level of commitment  in terms of time and resources. While it is preferred to have references to other departments,  it is imperative that the reference links be maintained and that the referenced policies are  current and accurate. This increased complexity requires a high-level commitment at the  administrative level to devote the time and resources necessary to create and maintain the  electronic manual. It is also imperative to maintain the electronic policies and procedure  manual in a way that is accessible in the event of a connectivity failure, since patient care  continues even in the absence of the hospital’s or medical center’s intranet. If the manual is  copied to local computer hard drives as part of the update process, it should be readily avail- able at all times as long as there is electrical power to the department. If the facility relies  heavily on cloud-based technology the situation becomes more complicated as access to  data could be compromised in the event of a connectivity failure. Generally, Information  Technology departments have systems in place for maintaining data and allowing for con- tinuation of care during a communication blackout or emergency. With respect to an elec- tronic policy and procedure manual, it can be as simple as a periodic hard disk backup of  the manual that is available in the command center or on strategically placed hard drives.  The details can vary but what is important is the need to have all relevant departments in- volved from the beginning.</para>

      <title>LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF POLICIES</title>
      <para>The rule of law is that everyone must obey the law. If people violate the law, they are  subject to the consequences depending on the nature and severity of the violation. The con- tent of the policy and procedure manual can be viewed as the “law” of the department. All  employees must follow the law and no employee is exempt. As such, policy and procedure  manuals are designed to clearly define the responsibilities of the healthcare professional  and set the standards to which employees are held (12). Ideally, each hospital and medical  center will have an up-to-date, comprehensive manual covering all aspects of departmental  operations for both routine and non-routine situations. A facility without a policy and pro- cedure manual is declaring, “I cannot meet the standard of care so I have no policy for it”  and, unfortunately, that facility starts on the defensive in any legal action (Personal com- munication, Emanuel Kanal, M.D., November 06, 2012).</para>
      <para>In the broadest general terms, the key to any policy and procedure is its ability to be  defended. The range of variation in a policy and procedure from one facility to another  within the same industry may be significant. Where any facility falls within the range from  conservative to liberal is based primarily on the culture of the organization. Therefore, es- pecially with respect to MRI safety matters, it is critical that the facility constructs the poli- cies and procedures with sound judgment and that they meet the basic standard of care set  forth in the industry (1). For example, a small community hospital typically does not possess  the infrastructure to scan patients with MR Conditional pacemakers and, therefore, it should  have a policy stating that these devices are not to be scanned at the MRI center. As the hos- pital grows and the level of sophistication of the department increases, the policy and pro- cedure needs to grow as well to reflect any changes it desires. If the policy is that</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">758</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Policies and Procedures - Hospital / Medical Center</emphasis></para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 749-1002_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:45 PM  Page 758</para>
      <para>pacemakers are still absolute contraindications, then an exclusion policy will suffice. If the  hospital or medical center decides to allow scanning of patients with MR Conditional pace- makers only, then the policy and procedure needs to be amended to reflect specifically which  pacemakers can be scanned, which cannot, and the exact procedure to be followed to safely  do so. This is a key point in that whatever policy and procedure the department chooses, it  will remain as the standard they are held to until the document is changed.</para>
      <para>Consider the following fictionalized example. In this example, there will be two patients  with cardiac pacemakers who undergo MRI examinations at two separate but equally ca- pable, hospitals (Facility A and Facility B). Both MRI facilities in these hospitals are pre- pared to scan these complicated patients with all of the necessary collateral support from  nursing and cardiology. Unfortunately, both patients experience negative consequences that  require the cardiac pacemakers be replaced after the MRI examinations. Facility A has a  policy and procedure detailing how pacemaker patients are to be scanned and follows that  information to the letter. Therefore, Facility A’s liability is limited with respect to the dam- aged pacemaker. Facility B performs exactly as Facility A, but their policy and procedure  is outdated and states than cardiac pacemakers are an absolute contraindication to MRI and  patients with these devices are not allowed into the MR system room (Zone IV). Facility  B’s liability is greater because, although they had the same negative outcome as Facility A,  Facility B violated their own policy. This example is exaggerated to illustrate the point that  each facility dictates the standards to which it will be held within the range of common  practice. It is important that those standards be appropriate for the protection of patients,  staff, and visitors without limiting the functionality of the department. Failing to keep poli- cies current and accurate is like announcing, “I did not know the problem existed and, there- fore, I have not thought about it” (Personal communication, Emanuel Kanal, M.D.,  November 06, 2012).</para>
      <para>There is also a delicate balance between a policy and procedure that is too restrictive  and one that is too vague. A policy and procedure that contains too many details can nega- tively impact the department on several levels. The policy will ultimately be difficult to fol- low, as flexibility is lost in the presence of overly tedious details. Additionally, any issues  arising from failure to follow the policy and procedure place the department in a defensive  posture. An overly restrictive policy and procedure, particularly in the realm of MRI safety,  slows the delivery of care and will surely be violated on a regular basis, neither of which is  good news for the patient, department, or facility in general.</para>
      <para>There are times when extremely specific details are necessary for patient safety. For  example, implanted devices approved for use in patients referred for MRI examinations  under specific conditions are labeled MR Conditional and the specific conditions under  which these devices can be safely scanned are specified in writing by the manufacturer,  usually presented in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis>. The difference between scanning the patient  safely and risking injury relies squarely on the details, which are clearly spelled out in the  product literature. Accordingly, any policy and procedure concerning the device must clearly  state what needs to be done in step-by-step fashion with all possible details intact.</para>
      <para>When drafting policies and procedures, the choice of language is also a factor. Words  like “shall, “must”, and “will” should be avoided as they suggest absolutes. The policy</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">759</emphasis></para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 749-1002_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:45 PM  Page 759</para>
      <para>should opt for “should” instead as it allows for a bit more flexibility. Improper language,  poor choice of words, absolutes, and colloquialisms are all potential problems when the  policy is viewed by non-imaging professionals, opposing counsel, and in the worst case, a  jury.</para>
      <para>In the event of a legal case there are a few things to be considered. First, the policies  and procedures manual will be requested by opposing counsel as part of the discovery  process. A good attorney knows that the manual contains the type of details that can be used  to validate or discredit a witness. Second, the contents of the policy and procedure manual  will be used by opposing counsel to assess fundamental knowledge during depositions and  not knowing that the policy and procedure existed or what information it contains will not  make the situation better. All staff members are held to the standards contained within the  manual and, thus, need to know the entire content, where to find it, and what information  it contains. Lastly, policies and procedures may be used during a trial. If the legal case in- volves a loss suffered as a result of a violation of a policy and procedure, it will certainly  feature prominently in the trial process.</para>
      <para>In the end, violating a policy and procedure of a hospital or medical center by itself is  not going to result in legal action. Depending on the violation, it could result in disciplinary  action as defined in the employee handbook but it is not, in and of itself, a legal issue. If the  violation of the policy and procedure is determined to be the proximate cause of an injury,  illness, or negative outcome for a patient, visitor, or co-worker then the situation has changed  and is more likely to involve the legal system.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>Healthcare providers must make patient, visitor, and employee safety a prime concern  and take the necessary steps to create a comprehensive culture of safety within the organi- zation. Policies and procedures serve as a sound foundation for any safety program, espe- cially with regard to MRI safety. A policy and procedure manual can be a single document  detailing that an industry standard or guideline (e.g., the ACR guidance document) is utilized  as the <emphasis role="italics">de facto</emphasis> operational policy for the department, a collection of individual documents  tailored to specific operational issues in the department, or a comprehensive Safety Manual  for MRI As long as the policies and procedures are based on industry best practices and un- derstood by all involved parties to be the standard to which they are held, they will be an  effective tool for improving safety without limiting operational agility.</para>
