      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>During the last three decades, interventional and intraoperative uses of magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) have evolved into important applications for image-guided therapy  and surgical procedures (1, 2). These two unique uses of MRI technology will be referred  to as interventional MRI or “iMRI” in this chapter. Because iMRI involves toolsets unlike  those used in diagnostic MRI, it presents multiple challenges in designing a safe work en- vironment (3). The complex and unique workflow of therapeutic and surgical procedures  performed in the iMRI suite may involve anesthesia and new approaches for perioperative  and intraoperative care. These departures from standard uses of MRI requires the safe trans- lation of clinical applications from the interventional suite and the operating room (OR)  into the iMRI setting. For example, percutaneous needle-based procedures and thermal ab- lations (4-6), catheter-based intravascular interventions (7, 8), endoscopies (9, 10), and  “open” surgeries (11-14) have special instrumentation and access requirements. The ther- apy-related armamentarium for each type of procedure can introduce challenges for effective  integration into the iMRI environment (15, 16), but also for safe operation. In this active  and potentially chaotic setting, assuring safety for patients and staff members is paramount.  This chapter presents the most important aspects of safety in the iMRI environment which  is based on more than twenty years of experience with multiple types of iMR systems span- ning a large number of clinical applications at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH).</para>
      <para>The design of interventional suites and operating rooms requires consideration of var- ious workflow paradigms related to the procedures. If image-guidance is involved, the im- aging systems should be closely integrated with the procedural workflow (17). However,  since many imaging systems can potentially injure or harm the patient and staff, careful  consideration of the unique safety issues are central to the design of safe and effective par- adigms. This concern is particularly true in the iMRI environment. Several unique factors  must be considered when an iMRI suite is designed and built. Furthermore, when an MR  system is located in an OR environment, the requirements are even more complex, since  MRI safety must be combined with other patient safety measures (18). If an MR system is  co-located with an X-ray system (XMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) system, or  computed tomography (CT) system, then MRI safety issues are compounded with concerns  regarding system interactions and the use of ionizing radiation (19).</para>
      <para>The Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) Suite at the BWH  consists of three procedure rooms: (1) the central OR housing the operating table, a ceil- ing-mounted single-plane X-ray system, a surgical navigation system, surgical microscope,  and an ultrasound system, flanked by (2) a positron emission tomography/computed to- mography (PET/CT) room on one side, and (3) an MR system room on the other side with  integrated cryotherapy, ablative laser, and targeting systems. The 3-T Siemens Verio MR  scanner was modified by IMRIS (Minnetonka, MN) to move into the OR via ceiling rails.  Sliding “barn” doors separate the PET/CT and MR system rooms from the central OR (20).  Each procedure room has a separate entrance to the control corridor and support spaces  (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>). The complexity of this space results in the inclusion of nearly every safety chal- lenge experienced by other iMRI facilities.</para>

      <para>Minimally invasive procedures performed entirely in the MR system room are con- ducted iteratively, with the patient scanned at isocenter in the scanner, then withdrawn par- tially from the bore of the MR system in order to undergo the intervention with an  “in-and-out” approach. All devices and instruments used in this setting must be MR Safe  or MR Conditional.</para>
      <para>In contradistinction, a combination of conventional MR Unsafe, ferromagnetic surgical  instruments and devices are used in the central OR. Prior to translation of the mobile 3- Tesla iMR system into the central OR for the imaging portion of the procedure, these tools  and devices are moved outside of the 5-gauss line or removed from the room, entirely.</para>
      <para>To acquire a PET/CT scan during an OR procedure, the patient is shuttled along a re- movable bridge that connects the OR table with the PET/CT table, through the sliding doors  that adjoin the rooms, and into the adjacent stationary PET/CT scanner. Although the MRI  risks are absent, the hazards associated with moving an intubated patient with intravenous  access are present.</para>
      <para>The AMIGO Suite will be used in this chapter as an example to illustrate the safety is- sues for iMR systems and to propose solutions. The valuable perspectives of other groups  related to this topic have been previously published (21-27), and various competing para-</para>

      <para>digms have emerged for suite design and procedural workflow (28). Notably, the scope of  iMRI procedures are expanding (29). The facilities built to support iMRI are often unique,  reflecting design elements required by the specific purpose of the space. Although safety  issues related to iMRI can be challenging, they can be minimized and managed through ef- fective policies, procedures, staff training, access controls, and facility design to promote  best practices and the correction of safety lapses.</para>

      <title>DESIGNING FOR SAFETY</title>
      <para>Architectural design is one useful means of facilitating desired behaviors for MRI safety.  Selecting a space remote from the main OR enables the staff to enter the mindset that they  are not in their usual working environment and, thus, they must adapt their habits to the  iMRI setting. A remote location further limits the flow of staff members, not involved with  the procedure, into this particular space. In emergency situations such as codes, the location  has both positive and negative attributes. The advantage is that it affords the opportunity to  post an MRI Safety Screener at the entrance to ensure that members of the responding team  do not enter into the space unless they have undergone screening and determined that they  can safely enter the area. The disadvantage of a remote location is the potential delay in the</para>

This can be overcome by local policies such as in the  AMIGO Suite, which is located near a cardiology recovery room, where anesthesia staff  members from that space, rather than from the more remote hospital OR, are assigned as  first responders.</para>
      <para>The AMIGO Suite was laid out in accordance with recommendations from the American  College of Radiology (ACR) document (30) pertaining to the MRI environment by which  the first layer of swipe-card access enables staff members to enter from Zone I (public space)  into Zone II (a restricted staff members, gowning area) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>). A second swipe-card  access point (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3A</emphasis>) is located at the entrance to Zone III (the control room corridor).  Access points into Zone II and III are monitored by security cameras connected to the Flow  Coordinator’s desk and to the hospital’s security department.</para>
      <para>The MR system room is classified as Zone IV, mandating that MR Unsafe equipment  is not allowed to enter the area. Depending on the current location of the MR scanner, the  central OR shifts between Zone III (MRI sequestered), where ferromagnetic objects are  permitted, and Zone IV (MR system deployed). Before the MR scanner is moved into the  central OR, the sliding door that separates the OR from the MR system room is opened to  create a single, large radiofrequency (RF) shielded space. Conjoining the spaces enables  the MR scanner to move along the ceiling-mounted rails from the MR system room into  the central OR. Upon opening the sliding doors, the door between the control corridor and  the MR system room automatically locks to prevent staff members from entering the scanner</para>

      <para>room, resulting in a single entry pathway from the control corridor into the conjoined  OR/MR system room.</para>
      <para>Additional oversight of this space due to this design results from patients transiting into  the appropriate procedure room via the control corridor. This practice is different from typ- ical interventional spaces, such as angiography labs, in which a second doorway into the  procedure spaces allows the control rooms to be free of patient traffic. A second entry point  in an iMRI suite represents a potential vulnerability, especially if proper line-of-site from  the control corridor to the door is obscured and, thus, the desired restriction of staff mem- bers’ access would be compromised. The complexity of controlling access into the MR sys- tem room (Zone IV) is increased at sites (i.e., unlike the AMIGO Suite), where a single  scanner services more than one OR.</para>
      <para>The doors into the procedure rooms have two operating modes: (1) activation by a push  plate, or (2) activation by a keypad code entry. The keypad code is held by only a few core  staff members. Controlling or eliminating pathways for the flow of staff members helps to  ensure that no MR Unsafe devices or instruments are brought into the room with the MR  system, particularly during off hours.</para>
      <para>With regard to the AMIGO Suite, a dual-stage ferromagnetic detection (FMD) system  was added to the the Zone III control corridor (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3B</emphasis>). Although not standard at the  time of initial design and construction, the use of such systems has become a standard Fa- cilities Guideline Institute requirement for all future MRI installations. A screening FMD  system is located near the flow coordinator’s desk that is used for first-stage screening. The  second stage screening is accomplished via FMD gates placed near the doors to the proce- dure spaces.</para>

Indicator lights above the doors inform  staff members regarding which room the MR system is “parked” in, and when the X-ray  machine or the laser is in use (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3B</emphasis>). Retractable yellow caution belts bar the door  when the respective room is not being utilized. While signage is necessary, in reality, it is  seldom effective. Physical barriers such as locked doors and limiting entrances are crucial  to mitigate risk in the iMRI environment.</para>

      <title>SAFETY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</title>
      <para>Policies and procedures, which can be difficult to standardize, are tailored for site ap- propriateness. An issue all facilities have in common is the daunting risk inherent to com- bining medical procedures and iMRI. It has now been many years since the patient fatality  (31, 32) that galvanized the MRI community to deal with safety issues centered on diag- nostic MRI. Despite policy recommendations and raised awareness since that event (33),  there has been an increase in the number of reported accidents related to the MRI environ- ment (34). Recent accidents highlight the continued risk. For example, an experienced staff  member was injured at one site (35) and a visitor was fatally wounded at another (36). Risks  tend to be greater in the iMRI environment, where ferromagnetic materials such as inter- ventional devices and surgical support equipment are purposely introduced into the envi- ronment to facilitate mission critical tasks. In additional to projectile risks, the improper  use of necessary equipment can increase the risk of patient burns in association with MRI.</para>

      <para>Whereas suite design can help facilitate safety by limiting or directing the flow within  the suite, design alone is incapable of eliminating all hazards. Thus, safety policies and on- going safety training are required to establish a desired set of acceptable behaviors. As with  all policy-based approaches, they are subject to the fallibility of the individual. A clear and  effective safety policy is a valuable tool to reduce risk. Establishing a dedicated multidis- ciplinary core team assigned daily to the iMRI environment is an important factor to for- malize, promulgate, and enforce policies and procedures that help to ensure safety within  the suite. Primary issues that should be addressed by all iMRI sites include training, access,  and safety checklists. Policy governing site-specific issues such as the shared use of space  for clinical and research purposes as well as the management of tour groups and vendors  should be considered. Other centers have site-specific issues such as the shared use of the  installation for interventional and/or intraoperative use and diagnostic imaging (26).</para>

Training modules include a general suite orientation, MRI safety, and general ra- diation safety. Staff members must pass a written exam on MRI safety and have no  contraindications to working in the MRI environment, as documented on an MRI safety</para>

A non-fer- romagnetic key to the locker remains with the staff member. Badge access is then used to  gain entry into Zone III, at which point it is required to sign in at the Flow Coordinator desk  and use the FMD system for screening. After substantiating that no ferromagnetic objects  are in their possession, the staff members are provided with orange bouffant hats to wear  over their existing OR hat, to indicate that they have been screened and may enter Zone IV  (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3C</emphasis>). This hat is discarded upon leaving the suite.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Tailored Checklists and Tailored Roles </emphasis></para>
      <para>In a typical diagnostic MRI environment, the MRI technologists are the primary staff  members tasked with ensuring safety. In the iMRI setting, safety challenges require the in- clusion and expertise of a larger, more diverse group. In addition to our core team members  who have specific roles for each procedure, it has been necessary to create two new roles  whose focus is entirely on safety and compliance within the suite during a procedure.</para>
      <para>The first new role is a Safety Screener, stationed at the entrance to the suite between  Zone II and Zone III. This team member’s job is to ensure that entering staff have complied  with requirements to place ferromagnetic items in the day locker. The Flow Coordinator  sits at a central location in the suite, and has camera views of the Zone I to Zone II transition,  as well as the Zone II to Zone III transition. The Flow Coordinator is responsible for main- taining a sign-in list of all staff members present for a procedure and verifies that individuals  entering the AMIGO Suite have undergone all necessary training (by cross-reference to a  training database), are properly attired, have removed ferromagnetic items from their person,  and have undergone screening using the ferromagnetic detection system. This team member  also screens vendors and visitors for contraindications to be in the MRI environment. An- other core staff member is stationed facing the entrance into Zone IV to ensure the approved  workflow is not broken and no non-approved items are brought into the OR or MR system  rooms. The Safety Nurse is responsible for knowing the roles and background of all staff  members in the procedure and adjoining space. The Safety Nurse is charged with tracking  when and why each device and instrument kit is introduced into the procedure, and ensuring  that unneeded equipment is not admitted into the area. He or she administrates the safety  checklists in conjunction with the MRI Technologist.</para>
      <para>In addition to the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Pause performed at inter- vals in all surgeries (37), an MRI Safety Pause has been instituted to mitigate risks prior to  bringing the patient into the MR system room or the adjoining OR, as well as prior to trans- ferring the MR scanner into the OR. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis> shows the respective checklists. Each proce- dure has a checklist tailored to the attending equipment and instruments and is modified to  adapt to changes in the procedure as it evolves.

A ferro- magnetic tool left in the surgical field can become a projectile when the patient enters the  bore of the scanner. If a metallic tool is touching the patient, an image artifact or even a  burn can occur. Although not implemented at our facilitys, technology is evolving for au- tomated counting of instruments that can help identify errors (38, 39).</para>
      <para>The MRI Technologist is also tasked with screening the patient prior to the procedure,  with the help of nurses and the surgical team. The MRI technologist may reference literature  and established criteria to confirm that an implant can be safely imaged. He or she may  consult the institutional MRI Safety Team, including the MR Medical Director (Physician),  MR Safety Expert (Physicist), and MR Safety Officer (Technologist), as needed. Another  role of the MRI technologist is to collect MRI data, sometimes in conjunction with an MRI  physicist, and to gather vendor claims about a new device for review by an internal com- mittee before it is used in proximity to the MR system.</para>
      <para>The watchful eyes and constant communication involving the Safety Screener, Flow  Coordinator, MRI Technologist, Safety Nurse and other staff members associated with the  procedure have prevented many potential errors in the ten years of operation of the AMIGO  Suite to build on the successful twenty-six year iMRI history at BWH.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Emergency Response </emphasis></para>
      <para>Staff members including anesthesiologists, nurses, surgeons, interventionalists, radiol- ogists, and MRI technologists should be trained to respond to cardiopulmonary emergencies  that may occur either in the MR scanner room or in the OR when the MR system is present.  Mock emergency code drills (e.g., code blue) are important for refining the processes and  to gain comfort levels surrounding the different situations. Policy and education should  exist to prevent responders from other areas from bringing ferromagnetic materials and  equipment into any space in which the MR scanner is deployed. Conversely, first responders  should not be delayed from assisting the medical team if the MR system is safely se- questered.</para>
      <para>In the AMIGO Suite, the emergency code button has a different meaning from the code  button in other areas of the hosptial. A special MRI-trained team with swipe-card access  responds to the emergency. Although there are devices in development for resuscitation in  the MR system room, none are yet commercially available (40, 41). Therefore, the patient  undergoing an intervention in the MR system room (Zone IV) is immediately removed from  the room and brought to a designated resuscitation area within the suite in Zone III. Some  scanners have break-away tables that can serve as a transport table. Scanners with fixed ta- bles require that the patient is transferred to an MR Safe or MR Conditional stretcher. A  designated team member should be responsible for shutting and locking the door to the MR  system room and maintaining access restrictions, while other staff members expeditiously  move the patient to the resuscitation area. The area should have adequate space, monitoring  equipment, oxygen, suction, and electrical outlets to facilitate resuscitation and management  of the patient.</para>

      <para>Although known difficult intubation or prior history of allergic reaction to medication  or a contrast agent can be addressed prior to entering the MR system room (Zone IV), unan- ticipated difficult intubation or an anaphylactic reaction that the patient may experience re- quires rapid action and exit from this area.</para>
      <para>The oxygen used in the OR setting as well as therapeutic heat sources (e.g., laser) in- crease the risk of fire. Non-ferromagnetic fire extinguishers are available for management  of small fires. In the rare event of a magnet quench, out gassing of cryogens (helium) can  displace the oxygen in the adjacent spaces. Sites should have a plan for rapid removal of  patients in these life-threatening situations, even when there is no time to close a surgical  wound. To minimize this risk, inspection of the quench line should be performed at intervals,  similar to diagnostic MR systems.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Screening  </emphasis></para>
      <para>Patient screening must be conducted by a Level 2 MR Personnel, MRI safety-trained  staff member (42, 43), and potential contraindications should be reviewed by the institution’s  MRI safety team. The screening form combined with a verbal interview will help to rule  out contraindications for MRI procedures such as certain electronically-actived implants  and ferromagnetic aneurysm clips. Staff members who work in the iMRI suite should be  subjected to the same screening procedure. However, since the staff members will not be  imaged, some contraindications (e.g., body piercing jewelry, joint replacement, etc.) do not  need to be considered. Screening forms designed for patients and other individuals (i.e.,  staff members, visitors, etc.) may be obtained from the website, www.MRIsafety.com. Pa- tients should change into a hospital gown as per surgical standard of care. External hearing  aids, hairpins, barrettes, jewelry (including body piercings), analog watches, metal-based  medication patches, MR Unsafe electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes from previous inpa- tient examinations, and similar items should be removed prior to entering the MR system  room or central OR.</para>

      <para>All procedures in the AMIGO Suite are performed under Institutional Review Board  (IRB) approval. An application describing the procedure, focusing on the impact that image  guidance is likely to have on patient outcomes, is required. An internal and external panel  reviews the application and refines the proposed procedure. This process forces clinicians  to invest their time learning about the MRI environment.</para>
      <para>The next step in preparation for a new iMRI procedure is to conduct multiple mock  procedures to refine workflow, decrease procedure time, and to do a gap analysis on devices  and instruments.

These safety checklists are reviewed in the OR before the MR system enters  the room.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Patient Positioning </emphasis></para>
      <para>There is often a compromise between the ideal imaging position and the ideal surgical  or interventional position for the patient. The ideal positioning centers the anatomy in the  “sweet spot” of the magnet to enable imaging without distortion artifacts related to off- isocenter positioning. Sweet spot dimensions vary across MR systems but are typically 30-  to 50-cm ellipsoids.</para>
      <para>In many iMRI cases, the patient will be under general anesthesia and unable to move.  Therefore, it is essential that the patient be positioned properly and placed in a suitable  alignment. All pressure points should be appropriately padded to maintain good circulation  for the patient. Padding must be used to eliminate closed loops created by skin-to-skin con- tact areas or contact between the skin and an ECG lead or the cable used with the RF coil  (43). The integrity of the insulation and/or housing of all components, including RF coils,  leads, cables, and wires need to be regularly checked.</para>

      <title>SAFETY STANDARDS AND TESTING</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Labeling </emphasis></para>
      <para>The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International has designated  definitions (i.e., terminology) for labeling devices, as follows MR Safe, MR Conditional,  and MR Unsafe (44). At our institution, candidate instruments for a procedure are tested  with a powerful handheld magnet by the nurse, MRI technologist, or MRI physicist before  being added to the instrument kit. Instruments used in the OR can be ferromagnetic since  they can be safely positioned before the MR scanner is transferred into the OR. In the  AMIGO Suite, instruments used in the MR system room must pass ASTM International  standard F2052 testing (45), which determines if a handheld instrument or device has the  potential to become a projectile in the presence of the magnetic field and involves testing  for translational attraction (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>). While the worst-case location is specific to the model  of the MR system, even for scanners operating at the same field strength (e.g., Siemens 3- Tesla Skyra versus Siemens 3-Tesla Prisma), this position tends to be in the proximity of  the opening of the bore of the MR system.</para>
      <para>Many of the devices used in the OR are MR Unsafe but are appropriately managed be- fore the MR system enters the room. In the scanner room, an RF enclosure recessed in the  wall was designed into the architecture to house MR Unsafe equipment. Waveguides in this  enclosure provide an opening for intravenous (IV) tubing, a patient temperature control,  hot air hose, and pneumatic tubing for deep vein thrombosis prevention boots. Devices in  proximity to the scanner’s bore must be MR Safe or MR Conditional. Sites that perform  procedures in the periphery of the MR system room on a second table using MR Unsafe in-</para>

      <para>Other international standards are used to test biomedical implants for torque (47), ra- diofrequency (RF)-induced heating (48), image artifact (49), and safety for active implants  such cardiac pacemakers and neuromodulation systems (50). Although these standards are  useful for implants, specific standards and procedures are needed for the task of evaluating  items used in iMRI (e.g., robotic actuators, head fixation systems, infusion pumps, AC/DC  power adaptors, biopsy trajectory devices, patient positioning devices, etc.) but, at the pres- ent time, they do not exist. The MR system manufacturers have their own tests for device  evaluation. Accordingly, the end-user is largely reliant on the vendor for providing infor- mation for a given device. This information may be distributed by various means including  the device user manual, vendor-issued bulletins, and labels on the device, itself. As always,  the term MR Conditional has specific meaning on a per device basis, requiring the user to  be sophisticated enough to understand the meanings.</para>
      <para>In the AMIGO Suite, a dedicated anesthesia technologist manages and appropriately  positions MR Conditional and MR Unsafe anesthesia equipment and devices. As an example  of the complexity, a device console may have a different maximum permissible field  strength where it can be safely used, which is different from the limit for the AC/DC adaptor  that powers it. It is the nature of some surgeries that the anesthesia set-up may be at the pa- tient’s left or right based on the surgical approach. As such, equipment is regularly moved.  Human vigilance is essential for preventing error. If this process were managed by a larger  non-dedicated group of staff members, the likelihood of error would increase.</para>

      <para>Labeling claims are frequently specific to tested conditions, such as the strength of the  static magnetic field, the spatial gradient of the magnetic field, imaging gradient slew rate  and amplitude, specific absorption rate (SAR), and configuration or position of the device  (e.g., parallel or perpendicular to the bore, proximity to the wall of the bore, routing for ca- bles, etc.). Notably, after an equipment upgrade or change to the environment, testing results  may no longer be applicable. Kugal (51) has reviewed the risks inherent to the static mag- netic field, gradient fields, RF field, and cryogens through the lens of iMRI safety.</para>
      <para>The American College of Radiology (ACR) takes the position that, “… users need to  recognize that one should never assume MR compatibility or safety information about a  device if it is not clearly documented in writing” (30). Practices at the AMIGO Suite reflect  an amplification of this recommendation but verify even written vendor claims, because  some claims are inaccurate or do not apply to a given MRI setting. If in-house expertise  exists, a set of tests can be performed to confirm vendor claims or establish the level of  safety of an instrument or device (52).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Static Magnetic Field-Related Issues </emphasis></para>
      <para>Although the adverse events associated with diagnostic MRI that are most frequently  reported in the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility De- vice Experience (MAUDE) database and in the United Kingdom (53) are due to burns, the  greatest safety concern in environments where MRI-guided open surgeries (e.g., breast,  brain, and spine) are performed is the static magnetic field. Such procedures may require  the use of MR Unsafe items such as surgical microscopes, electrosurgical units, and light  sources. The effect of the static magnetic field drastically increases with proximity to the  bore of the MR system. This sudden change in translational attraction gives little warning  to a staff member holding a ferromagnetic object as he or she approaches the scanner. Lines  indicting the fringe field levels associated with the MR system can be marked on the floor  around the scanner to serve as a visual reminder to staff members. In the AMIGO Suite, the  5-gauss fringe field is marked on the floor. The 400-gauss field line is also shown to indicate  the limit for the particular anesthesia machine utilized in this setting. The MR system used  in the AMIGO Suite can be offset and rotated 180-degrees to enable additional procedural  workflows in the scanner room. Therefore, the fringe field markings on the floor are a worst- case superposition of the lines for the two different imaging locations. A second set of lines  is present in the OR to depict the fringe field when the scanner is at its third imaging location  (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5A</emphasis>). The relationship between the isogauss lines and the force exerted on an object  has been carefully studied at our institution (54).</para>
      <para>Translational attraction and torque constitute the greatest risks in the MRI setting. An  object may become a projectile as it accelerates in the direction of the spatial gradient of  the static magnetic field. Large objects can generate incredible force as they are rapidly  drawn into the magnet. As previously stated, our practice is to test all devices, even with  MR Safe labels, using a powerful handheld magnet. Additionally, we cautiously introduce  larger items into the MR system room with a tether, if necessary, and follow other appro- priate procedures to conduct a proper evaluation of magnetic field interactions.</para>

Titanium alloy and ceramic materials are not subjected to magnetic field interactions  and cause relatively small artifacts that are the direct result of their negligible magnetic sus- ceptibilities. Various vendors at points in time have produced instruments for the iMRI mar- ket (15). Understandably, costs and lead times for these instruments are higher than for  conventional instruments. Fortunately, some conventional off-the-shelf instruments are con- structed from titanium due to the material’s inherent advantage of being lower in weight  compared to steel.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Image Artifacts Caused by a Device </emphasis></para>
      <para>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) emanating from an active device can manifest in  the MR image as a zipper artifact or increased noise across the entire image, depending on  the bandwidth of the noise and of the MR system’s receiver bandwidth. Vendors may erro- neously assume that because their device passes EMI tests at a higher field strength/fre- quency, their test results can be extended to lower field strengths/frequencies. However,  EMI harmonics may be present in the imaging bandwidth at one field strength, but not an- other. The user may learn this when a patient is undergoing MRI and a zipper artifact ob- scures the critical anatomy of interest.</para>
      <para>EMI testing may be performed by running the MR system manufacturer’s quality as- surance scans for noise with and without the device present. The device can be activated,  in a stand-by mode, or “off” but plugged in, depending on its state in the clinical setting  during imaging. The frequency of the zipper can be identified and can be useful in tracing  the source in the electronics. A zipper drifting in frequency usually indicates the source of  EMI is the electronics associated with a digital clock in the device. The EMI revealed by  such scans may have low enough energy as to not be clinically relevant, so scans from a  clinical protocol should also be tested. At our institution, variations in shielding of MR Con- ditional devices has yielded one instance of a device that did not emit EMI and another that  was problematic. A complicated issue, however, is the interactivity of multiple devices.  EMI from one device can be carried or amplified by another device resulting in image ar- tifacts when the devices used individually are not problematic. Moreover, EMI from a device  may be a function of position within the room. The device may pick up and amplify EMI  from a leaky penetration panel, window, or other vulnerable point in the RF shielding. A  device placed in the line-of-site of the receive RF coil may induce a zipper artifact, whereas  the same device placed on the side of the scanner may not be problematic. A spectrum an- alyzer with a sniffer loop is a valuable tool in identifying EMI sources. These analyzers are  not MR Safe, so long cables are required.</para>
      <para>Image artifacts can be assessed in phantoms by imaging with and without the device  under test present. Distortion or signal void due to susceptibility mismatch between the ob- ject and the surrounding medium can be evaluated (55). An artifact observed on an MR  image is a function of field strength/frequency, pulse sequence parameters (mainly receiver  bandwidth and echo time), and the orientation of the object to the static magnetic field of  the MR system. Artifacts can change the apparent location of the device, which for example  can give rise to inaccurate or unsafe needle targeting associated with a biopsy procedure  (56). In open surgery, the susceptibility mismatch between air and tissue can appear as a  region of hyperintensity that can mimic contrast-enhanced tissue (57).</para>

      <para>Currents induced by the imaging gradients can interact with the static magnetic field  and cause vibrations in a device, which can create ghosting in the image. The coupling of  electrically conductive structures with the electromagnetic field can result in signal shield- ing. Such RF-relateds artifacts can compromise visualization of the lumen in the presence  of a vascular stent (58).</para>
      <para>Artifacts can lead to image misinterpretation due to distortion of geometry, or regionally  obscuring or obliterating the signal from tissue. The degree of acceptable artifact is subject  to the judgment of the physician performing the procedure and the radiologist interpreting  the images. If contrast administration during brain tumor resection is repeated, images may  be difficult to interpret due to the continued spread of contrast throughout the edematous  brain. This problem is not experienced in a comparatively brief diagnostic MRI session. To  avoid this problem, some centers reserve the administration of an intravenous contrast agent  until the tumor has been resected and then use imaging to assess the completeness of the  surgery (59).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Unintentional Output and Operational Inhibition of Devices </emphasis></para>
      <para>It should be confirmed that the static magnetic field, imaging gradients, and RF pulses  do not impact the function of the device. For example, one model of an MR Conditional  physiological monitor had design issues with the motor that inflates the blood pressure cuff.  Long-term exposure to the static magnetic field impacted the motor’s performance and re- sulted in the feature being unusable.</para>
      <para>The imaging gradients can create a field switching at about 100-Hz to several kilohertz.  For the time-varying, gradient magnetic fields, the worst-case scenario location for testing  is not at isocenter of the MR system. The fields due to the imaging gradients increase pro- portional to the distance from isocenter and then fall off outside of the field of view. The  peak field is about 30-cm from isocenter and varies across different scanners depending on  the features of the gradient coils. The time-varying, gradient magnetic fields can induce  eddy currents in the patient and in conducting materials, but is generally not a concern for  substantial heating. However, the induced currents in devices can interact with the static  magnetic field, creating forces and torques on the device. If the device vibrates and is in  contact with the patient, image artifacts can occur. If the device is a part of a positioning  stage for needle targeting and the gradients cause vibrations in a component of the device,  inaccuracies may occur.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Heating </emphasis></para>
      <para>Devices and instruments that are left in contact with the patient during scanning must  be tested for MRI-induced heating. Current safety guidelines for patients that do not consider  the presence of devices limit temperature increases in the torso to 2°C or a peak specific  absorption rate (SAR) of 8- to 10-W/kg. The whole-body-averaged SAR is limited to 4- W/kg in the body, and 3.2-W/kg in the head over a 15-minute period (60, 61). RF energy  associated with MRI is a concern for heating due to ohmic heating. As previously indicated,  most MRI-related adverse events are due to RF-induced patient burns (62).</para>

      <para>The transmit RF body coil runs almost the entire length of the bore of the MR system.  The worst-case locations occur where the electric field (as opposed to the magnetic field  used to create the MR image) is highest. This field tends to be highest closest to the con- ductors and is impacted by RF coil geometry. Any conductor in or near the transmit RF  coil, including the patient, has the potential to be involved in RF-induced heating.</para>
      <para>Cables should be padded to eliminate contact with the patient’s skin or, if possible, re- moved during scanning. As a preventive measure, a cold compress or ice pack can be applied  to areas potentially affected by heating. While rare, skin-to-skin contact points should be  avoided, since these have been reported to be associated with burns (63). Precautions to  prevent excessive heating are of particular importance for patients under sedation or general  anesthesia who are unable to notice or report pain. Heating may be minimized with the use  of a local transmit RF coil (e.g., quadrature head coil) instead of the body RF coil and ju- dicious selection of pulse sequences and parameters to limit the SAR (65).</para>
      <para>A fiber-optic temperature measurement device with multiple probes is necessary to ac- curately test for heating. When evaluating MRI-related heated for an implant or device,  probes should be placed on or near corners and tips, as well as other discontinuities where  the electric field tends to be the highest (66). The design that is used for the phantom to  simulate the patient for a proper heating assessment is critical. Importantly, a device in free  space will behave differently than a device that is in contact with the patient. For example,  our team assessed a carbon-fiber, Jackson table used for positioning patients undergoing  spine surgery. No heating was measured with the square piece of material in isolation. When  a tissue equivalent load was placed at the corner, a notable temperature elevation was ob- served.</para>
      <para>Temperature elevations that occur in long conducting wires of a certain length can be  sudden and extreme, especially at the tip of the wire. Our team observed a 50°C temperature  elevation after five seconds of MR imaging in the cable of a non-MR Conditional RF abla- tion probe. Obviously, solutions to this problem are needed to enable the use of devices for  vascular interventions and other procedures (67-69).</para>

Therefore, clinicians planning to perform iMRI procedures should  be assessed for these possible issues to determine if such sensations will be problematic.  Legislation in the European Union initially placed constraints that would prohibit real-time  intervention close to the bore of the MR scanner. Fortunately, after an appeal by the MRI  community (70, 71), it was replaced by legislation providing a provision for iMRI (72).</para>

      <para>that the procedure room is a more familiar setting to the surgeon or interventionalist. In the  absence of the static magnetic field, conventional MR Unsafe equipment like a surgical mi- croscope, ultrasound system, and steel instruments can be used. Great care must be taken  to manage all devices and instruments before performing MR imaging. As in the AMIGO  Suite, before the mobile MR system is translated on ceiling rails into the procedure room,  MR Unsafe ceiling-mounted booms, lights, and monitors are pivoted to the walls and other  MR Unsafe items are either brought out of the room or moved outside the 5-gauss line (<emphasis role="bold">Fig-</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">ure 6</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>Alternatively, with other approaches, the patient can be moved from the OR into the  MR system room. The same time out and procedure-specific checklists must be completed  prior to moving the patient from the OR into the MR scanner room. In addition to the risk  of unaccounted for items becoming projectiles when the patient is moved, there is a risk of  extubation or extravasation due to tension on the breathing circuit or intravenous lines, re- spectively. The anesthesia machine and physiological monitor are tethered by interfaces to  the patient and, therefore, these devices must move as a unit with the patient table. A solution  to mount the cable connection point for the physiological monitor to the patient table is  available. Efforts have also been made to couple a defeatured anesthesia machine to the  table to avoid cable tension during transfer (73).</para>
      <para>A commonality across original equipment manufacturers is that the patient stays on a  rigid transfer board for the entire procedure. The transfer board is MR Safe and is integrated  with both the MR system platform and the surgical table platform. Multiple vendors have  variants on the transfer approach. In one case, a manually moved transfer table end-docks  with the surgical table, collects the transfer board/patient, then moves into the MR system</para>

In another variant, the surgical  table moves along a floor track to dock with the MRI table before transfering the patient  from one table to the other with the tranfer board (26) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>). Single room approaches  use a similar transfer concept or have a table that pivots out of the scanner into an area with  a relatively low fringe field, where surgery is performed (46, 74) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>The advantage of the single room solution is the rapid turn around between imaging  and intervention. This gain comes at the expense of using MR Safe or MR Conditional  equipment and regaining needed functionality through ingenuity, or omitting the function- ality, potentially compromising the procedure. Alternatively, MR Unsafe devices can be  used while managing risk. To minimize patient movement, neurosurgical procedures can  be performed with the in-and-out paradigm, in which the patient’s head extends from the  back of the bore of the scanner to permit the surgical procedure and then back into the MR  system for imaging. MR imaging can be achieved by moving the patient approximately  one-meter to isocenter (75) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>). Similarly, abdominal interventions can be per- formed with this same in-and-out paradigm.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">MR Conditional Equipment </emphasis></para>
      <para>Although MR Conditional anesthesia machines, ventilators, drug infusion pumps, and  physiological monitors are available, the development of MR Conditional anesthesia support  equipment is not keeping pace with the development of new procedure enabling devices.  While simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring during functional MRI  (fMRI) is now common (83), there is no commercially available MR Conditional bi-spectral  index device nor peripheral nerve stimulator for assessing the depth of anesthesia. If MR  Unsafe devices are used, they must be removed before the MR system is transported into  the OR. Furthermore, at the present time, there is no commercially-available, external de- fibrillator that is MR Conditional. If either cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac instability is noted  during an iMRI procedure, the patient must be removed from the MR system room (i.e.,  Zone IV) before using an external defibrillator. In situations where there is the likelihood  of cardiac instability or arrhythmia in non-MRI environments, external defibrillator/pacing  pads may be placed on the patient before the induction of anesthesia. This precaution cannot  be done in the MR system room because the metallic foil backing on the pads increases the  potential for skin burns, where the pads contact the patient. In this case, the risk of instability  or arrhythmia may outweigh the potential benefit of proceeding with the procedure. Al- though MR Conditional, core body temperature measurement devices are now available,  there are no MR Conditional temperature control devices for patients. For example, at BWH,  the air blower is removed prior to the MR scanner entering the OR. In the MR system room,  a blower is positioned in an RF shielded closet built into the room. An MR Safe extension  hose is used to replace the MR Unsafe hose packaged with the device. Although there is  some loss due to heat transfer through the hose, it is still possible to warm or cool the patient.</para>
      <para>Intubation near the MR scanner is enabled by laryngoscope designs with MR Condi- tional batteries. To our knowledge, to date, no video laryngoscopes are marketed for use in  the MRI setting. However, we have tested devices that show promise for use outside the  bore of the scanner. MR Conditional steerable endoscopes have been constructed by several  research groups (84, 85) The inadvertent placement of a certain type of endotracheal tube  (Fastrach ETT, LMA/Teleflex) at our institution during a diagnostic MRI examination of a  patient with a difficult airway resulted in images with substantial signal losses (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>).  No injury occurred to the patient. The packaging for this particular ETT had no indication  of its level of MRI-related issues. This endotracheal tube has a reinforcing metallic coil  running the length of the device, which is magnetic. This incident led to an appraisal of this  and other items in the conventional armamentarium for anesthesia delivery, some of which  are listed in the <emphasis role="italics">Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices</emphasis>  and posted online at www.MRIsafety.com.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Cardiac Issues </emphasis></para>
      <para>Patients that are candidates for intervention and intraoperative procedures often have  cardiac comorbidities. The poor quality of continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings  when the patient is in the MR system is the most serious limitation in monitoring an anes- thetized patient.

      <para>in the ECG that can mimic malignant arrhythmia. Additionally, the static magnetic field  can induce apparent ST-segment abnormalities, as well as other alterations in the waveform  (87). The benefit of image-guidance, therefore, should be weighed against the risk of anes- thetizing a patient at risk of further cardiac injury during ischemic stress.</para>
      <para>There are efforts to improve ECG monitoring. Adaptive filters have been shown to be  successful in removing noise induced by the imaging gradients, which are present only dur- ing scanning (89). ECG monitoring in the static magnetic field, however, is problematic  even when images are not being acquired. A dominant QRS complex and undistorted S-T  segment are important for both cardiac-gated MRI examinations and to permit physiological  monitoring for cardiac ischemia, especially during cardiac interventions (90). The magne- tohydrodynamic (MHD) effect arises when blood, which is conductive, flows in the pres- ence of a static magnetic field. The MHD effect generates a voltage that distorts the “real”  electrocardiogram, especially with respect to the S-T segment when blood flow occurs from  the left ventricle into the aorta (91). It is possible to remove the MHD artifact by processing  ECG signals using a baseline ECG collected outside the bore of the MR system in conjunc- tion with an adaptive filter (92).</para>
      <para>There are multiple efforts underway to develop an iMRI treatment for arrhythmias using  RF ablation (93, 94) and cryoablation catheters (95). This procedure, and others, will benefit  from enabling developments to overcome current limitations in cardiac monitoring. Treat- ment of members of the patient population with cardiac implantable electronic devices  (CIED), are also a hurdle in iMRI.</para>

      <para>Historically, CIEDs (e.g., cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillator,  ICD) have been considered contraindications for MRI (96, 97). For more than 15 years, a  variety of reports have supported the safety of scanning patients with “standard” cardiac  pacemakers and ICDs. With appropriate screening and device programming, many inves- tigations have demonstrated patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs can be scanned with- out significant clinical risks (98-113). Based upon the guidelines published in the  peer-reviewed literature, institutions have developed programs for performing MR imaging  in patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs. These programs are typically administered  under combined leadership of both cardiology and radiology departments with participation  from the vendors.</para>
      <para>Fortunately, five major vendors (LivaNova/Sorin, Boston Scientific, Abbott/St.Jude  Medical, Medtronic, and Biotronic) now offer FDA or CE mark approved, MR Conditional  CIEDs that include cardiac pacemakers, ICDs, and recorder devices. Patients implanted  with these devices can safely undergo MRI at 1.5 Tesla and, with certain MR Conditional  CIEDs, 3 Tesla scanning is also allowed (112).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Remote Monitoring </emphasis></para>
      <para>Acoustic noise from the gradient magnetic fields, especially at 3-Tesla, can prohibit the  anesthesiologist from hearing the physiological monitor’s alarms and ECG tones when more  than a few feet from the equipment. Although developing technologies with active noise  cancellation will allow transmission of monitoring equipment alarms and tones into the  anesthesiologist’s headphones, this technology is not widely available. As an alternative,  remote monitoring is routinely performed at our institution.</para>
      <para>Primarily because of the acoustic noise associated with MRI, the anesthesiologist in  the AMIGO Suite remotely monitors the patient after the onset of anesthesia and the patient  is stable. Remote monitoring is accomplished with another physiological monitor placed  in the control corridor that displays information for the patient’s vital signs and end tidal  gases; a view of the anesthesia machine’s ventilator and its settings by either direct line-of- site or remote camera; and a camera view of the patient in the bore of the MR system. Line- of-site to the patient is limited when the patient is inside the scanner’s bore, even when the  anesthesiologist is at the bedside. If an intervention by the anesthesiologist is needed during  imaging, the scan is halted until the issue is resolved. MR Conditional volume infusion  pumps are available with remote consoles outside the room. Alternatively, conventional in- fusion pumps can be stationed outside the MR system room with an extension set of IV  tubing penetrating the room via the waveguide. The disadvantage of this setup is that pump  alarms are not audible when the care provider is at the bedside. Recently, a commercially  available MR Conditional caddy has been developed to house ferrous pumps in the MR  system room. This device has an alarm to indicate when the gauss limit is exceeded. The  caddy’s alarm indicator is more readily visible than the alarms on each pump, permitting  visualization by MRI users outside the scanner room.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">SAFE USE OF MRI PULSE SEQUENCES FOR iMRI </emphasis></para>
      <para>The type of pulse sequence that is used during iMRI is generally more constrained than  it is for diagnostic imaging. Real-time, interactive imaging can be employed, which de- mands high acquisition rates, while sacrificing some contrast and resolution. Special fast- imaging pulse sequences used in iMRI are more likely to make use of fast gradient switching  and/or may employ RF pulsing rates that are substantially greater than those used in routine  clinical MR imaging and, thus, are more likely to push the limits of safe use. Safety concerns  related to pulse sequence choice are also heightened in iMRI because of the possibility of  interaction with implants or interventional devices that are in place during the MRI proce- dure, resulting in a greater potential for dangerous levels of heating from RF fields or in- duction of currents from gradient magnetic field switching.</para>
      <para>The primary biological effects in MRI are tissue heating due to RF exposure, nerve  stimulation due to currents induced by gradient switching and sensations such as vertigo  caused by rapid movement in the static magnetic field (43, 113). Pulse sequences that tend  to cause the greatest heating due to RF exposure are those with a high temporal density of  RF pulsing, such as fast (or turbo) spin echo sequences, which employ multiple high-flip- angle refocusing pulses as well as steady-state sequences such as FIESTA (or True FISP),  which have very short repetition times (114). These pulse sequence types are commonly  used in iMRI and may be referred to as “high-SAR” pulse sequences. Pulse sequences that  involve rapid gradient switching, such as echo planar imaging sequences, may induce cur- rents that can cause peripheral nerve stimulation or interfere with implantable device oper- ation, may be referred to as “high-dB/dt” sequences. Safety concerns in iMRI, as with  standard MR imaging, involve the use of high-SAR and/or high-dB/dt pulse sequences. Ar- tifacts such as signal loss and distortion caused by imaging in the presence of metallic ob- jects such as biopsy needles can also be considered a safety issue because they diminish or  confuse MR-guidance capabilities during interventional procedures. Gradient echo pulse  sequences, especially multi-echo sequences such as echo planar imaging, are especially  subject to exhibit artifacts caused by the susceptibility effects due to the presence of metallic  objects in tissues (115, 116). High bandwidth spin echo sequences and special sequence  adaptations may be employed to minimize such artifacts (114, 115).</para>
      <para>Regulatory bodies such as the FDA have placed limits on the allowable exposures for  patients to RF energy and gradient magnetic fields. MR system manufacturers include mon- itoring software and hardware to ensure that these exposures are not exceeded when their  MR scanners are running in routine operating modes. In the absence of metallic implants,  devices, or foreign objects present during the scanning, MR systems that are set in routine  operating modes (i.e., the Normal Operating Mode or First Level Controlled Operating  Mode) should not be of concern for safety. Even when high-SAR or high-dB/dt sequences  are used, limitations by the MR system on the setting of parameters such as the number of  slices or the repetition time will ensure that exposures remain within the defined limits. It  may be possible to supercede the limits as set by regulatory bodies, although Institutional  Review Board approval and informed patient consent is required in such cases. As long as  system SAR and dB/dt monitoring remains in place, the degree of exposure can be assessed  and a decision whether or not to proceed based on risk versus benefit assessment can be</para>

      <para>Of greater concern when using high-SAR or high-dB/dt sequences is when implants  catheters, needles or other foreign objects are present during scanning because heating can  be enhanced by the presence of the device, and it is much more difficult to predict the degree  of the effects. Ideally, information is available from the manufacturer of the device in terms  of specifying conditions of use. For example, perhaps a given device is limited with respect  to the strength of the static magnetic field and the Normal Operating Mode must be used.</para>
      <para>Workflows can be developed that are designed to enable safe guidance. For example,  non-metallic stylets are first placed with MRI-guidance prior to deploying a deep brain  stimulating electrodes, which are at risk of MRI-induced heating. Post-operative CT can be  performed instead of MRI to evaluate for complications such as hematoma.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>The need to use strong magnets, high spatial gradients, RF energy and cryogens for  performing diagnostic MRI results in an inherent level of risk, and the possibility of acci- dents should not be underestimated. In the iMRI environment, the potential risk is exacer- bated by the introduction of additional tools and devices required to perfom the intervention.  Moreover, the presence of individuals less experienced with the MRI environment could  lead to additional risk. However, through the appropriate facility design, education and  safety policies, risk can be managed such that it is outweighed by the benefit of performing  the procedure in the MRI environment. Furthermore, a culture of teamwork and safety can  be engrained in staff members by ongoing training, and policy enforcement and iterative  improvement. Together, these approaches act in concert to ensure safety.</para>
      <para>Since the early 1990s when iMRI was first introduced, it has rapidly developed and the  number of users and procedures have increased. iMRI expanded through the introduction  of new surgical approaches and/or techniques in open surgery, vascular and cardiac appli- cations, and minimally-invasive endoscopies. Efforts now focus on the development of new,  more advanced imaging methods, navigational techniques, surgical instruments and devices,  the more efficient use of computing technologies, and the integration of diagnostic and ther- apy devices with navigational tools to expand iMRI applications.</para>
      <para>Safety measures must keep pace with this increasingly complex environment as the  number of installations also increases. Patient and staff member safety is the concern of a  large multimodality and multidisciplinary infrastructure like that which exists in the BWH  AMIGO Suite, where iMRI is complimented with newly developed, multiple molecular  probes (e.g., nuclear, optical, mass spectrometer, etc.) that also must be used safely. A pri- mary concern for the operation of the suite is how to provide a safe environment for clinical  and research activity in iMRI that incorporates multimodal imaging. The workflows in the  suite should be designed to suit the way that multidisciplinary teams work while under- standing and mitigating safety risks.</para>

The occurrence of near misses and the ensuing  safety reviews have demonstrated that ongoing review of safety policies and continuous  training should be a hallmark of any safety program, similar to any other place within the  medical environment. With appropriate control, a strong safety record can be maintained.  The main reason for this successful and safe operation is continuous vigilance, policy en- forcement, and a serious attitude towards safety.</para>
