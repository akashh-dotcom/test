      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>The number of active implanted medical devices available for treatment of medical  conditions continues to increase rapidly. These devices are implanted frequently to address  significant clinical conditions, and it is this group of patients that typically has need for  clinical imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since these implants contain  metallic components, by definition they cannot be considered MR Safe; they can be con- sidered only MR Conditional or MR Unsafe. An active implantable medical device (AIMD)  is a “medical device relying for its function on a source of electrical energy or any source  of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity”. In contrast, a  passive medical device is one that serves its function without any source of power other  than that generated by the human body or gravity (1). Notably, manufacturers are increas- ingly engineering their AIMDs to be MR Conditional, recognizing the commercial com- petitive advantage this can offer by permitting patients the ability to avail themselves of the  diagnostic power of MRI.</para>

      <para>Performing MRI examinations safely demands accurate identification of the precise  make and model of any AIMD. Failure to identify an AIMD in a patient undergoing MRI  can lead to severe risks. There is a well-known case in which a patient with a deep brain  stimulation system suffered a severe radiofrequency (RF)-related burn to the thalami, re- sulting in a permanent neurological deficit (2). Undisclosed cardiac pacemakers have been  associated with patient deaths in associating with the use of MRI. In 2020, the Emergency  Care Research Institute (ECRI) foundation declared incomplete AIMD information in MRI  patients as one of the top ten patient safety risks (3). Also in 2020, a panel of ten radiologists  with expertise in MRI safety from nine high-volume academic centers was formed, with  the objective of providing clarity on safety issues for the ten most frequently questioned  devices (4). This panel reviewed the relevant peer-reviewed literature that was focused on  key MRI-related issues regarding screening and adverse event reports, in addition to the  manufacturer’s Instructions For Use for various products. Using a Delphi-inspired method,  36 practical recommendations were generated with 100% consensus that should aid the  clinical MRI community with respect to screening patients with biomedical implants (4).</para>
      <para>Sound, comprehensive screening processes are essential (5), and patients and/or their  medical providers should be questioned at the time of ordering MRI exams about the pres- ence of implanted devices. As an adjunct, electronic medical records are increasingly in- corporating “implanted devices” modules that maintain important device-specific  information (6). By identifying any device-specific MRI-related conditions prior to the pa- tient’s arrival at the facility, this can enhance efficiency by scheduling the patient on the  proper 1.5-T or 3-T MR system, ensure timely availability of proper equipment such as  transmit/receive RF head coils, and appropriate personnel (e.g., MR Safety Officers or  MRSOs, specially-trained MRI technologists, MRI physicists, AIMD programming staff,  etc). This device-specific information should be reconciled when the patient reports to the  MRI facility. Frequently, the patient will have an implant identification card from the device  manufacturer that identifies the particular device. If the device was implanted at another  institution, surgical records should be provided by written means, frequently by fax or sim- ilar alternative, to obtain the relevant information including the particular type of AIMD  that is present and its component parts (e.g., the models of the implantable pulse generator  and leads). It should be noted that verbal relaying of important device-specific information  should not be permitted due to potential errors in accurately conveying the information. As  an example, three different types of Yasargil aneurysm clips (Aesculap, www.aesculap.com)  exist. The model FD, FE, and FT - all of which rhyme, and if the information for the clip  model were conveyed only by telephone, and it was misinterpreted, there could be severe  safety consequences insofar as the FE and FT models are MR Conditional, while the FD is  MR Unsafe. Similarly, blanket statements from an outside facility purporting to claim that  all their implants are “MRI compatible” or “MRI Safe” is unacceptable. As part of the  screening process at the MRI facility, a ferromagnetic detection system can assist in dis- closing the presence of certain implanted devices (7, 8).</para>
      <para>With positive identification of the device-specific make and model of the AIMD, several  sources exist to identify whether a device is MR Unsafe or MR Conditional, with associated  conditions. These include MRISafety.com, MagResource, Global Unique Device Identifi- cation Database (GUDID), and the specific device manufacturer’s websites. The Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the GUDID, which is a compilation of every device</para>

      <para>that has a unique device identifier (UDI). With the UDI number, the GUDID website pro- vides the manufacturer, name of the device and, in some cases, the MRI safety information  as to whether the device is MR Conditional, MR Unsafe, or MR Safe. Other possible sources  can then be consulted regarding the necessary conditions for safe scanning. For example,  the MagnetVision app is a tool that is designed to help MRI healthcare professionals assess  anticipated risks for patients with implants prior to performing MRI examinations (9).</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Implant Movement </emphasis></para>
      <para>The MRI environment poses multiple challenges to safe scanning in a patient with an  AIMD (<emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>). First, ferromagnetic content in the device is subject to translational at- traction and torque from magnetic field interactions. Of note is that, typically, only limited  ferromagnetic material remains in today’s AIMDs, primarily associated with the power  source (e.g., batteries). As the patient enters the MR system and moves through the spatial  gradient magnetic field, nonferromagnetic metals are subjected to Lorentz forces that can  produce slight displacement and vibration of the implanted metallic object. As such, it can  be helpful for MRI staff members to alert the patient with an AIMD of this non-harmful  possibility prior to entering the MR scanner to allay any concerns or fears if such minor  movement is perceived. The potential mobility of the device is related to the degree to which  it is encased by fibrous scar tissue or surgically fixed in place. Particularly for devices that  are implanted off the central axis of the body, there is increasing tendency for these to be</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Heating of Device Components </emphasis></para>
      <para>Heating of device components primarily from the RF field is a major concern with re- spect to the leads associated with AIMDs. Conductive materials may act as resonant anten- nae, locally amplifying the RF energy used for MR image formation. Particularly in the  context of neurostimulation systems, RF-related heating of leads in close proximity to sen- sitive tissues can potentially produce severe damage (2). In insulated leads where induced  current is not dissipated over the length of the lead, heating is concentrated at the tip. Tem- peratures below 43°C are not associated with the long-term damage. However, at 60°C,  there is instant protein denaturation and tissue coagulation. At temperatures between 44°  and 60°C, tissue death is time-dependent.</para>
      <para>Particularly in insulated leads, the lead length exposed to the RF field is an important  variable because heating is associated with the resonant frequency, with maximal heating  related to the one-half wavelength. MR systems operating at 1.5-T and 3-T detect the nuclear  magnetic resonance signal of <superscript>1</superscript>H nuclei at 64-MHz (wavelength 52 cm, one-half wave- length - 26 cm) and 128-MHz (wavelength 26 cm, one-half wavelength - 13 cm) resonance  frequency, respectively. It should be noted that in body tissue, the effective wavelength is  affected also by tissue permittivity as well as other factors (10).</para>
      <para>The physical length of the lead specified by the manufacturer may not correspond to  the total length of the conductive material within the lead, making it difficult to predict  which leads may create resonant conditions. Importantly, the attachment of a lead to an im- plantable pulse generator (IPG) can have a large influence on heating at the lead tip, with  the possibility for temperatures being greatly elevated if the lead is unattached or abandoned.  As result, there may be an increased risk of heating when scanning in the presence of aban- doned leads, or when leads are unattached to an IPG (11).</para>
      <para>Other factors that can influence RF energy-related current deposition and heat produc- tion include the type of transmit RF coil employed for imaging and the position of the metal- lic implant, as well as its “path” or configuration, relative to the transmitted RF. The majority  of clinically utilized receive-only RF coils rely on an integrated body transmit RF coil for  RF excitation, exposing the majority of the patient’s body to RF energy. Smaller transmit/re- ceive (T/R) RF coils (e.g., the T/R head RF coil, T/R knee RF coil, etc.) that both broadcast  RF and detect the emitted signals, are readily available on MR systems for head or extremity  imaging. The smaller head or extremity transmit/receive RF coils typically deposit the ma- jority of RF within the volume of the coil, only. Notably, the MRI-related conditions for  AIMDs may specify eligible types of transmit RF coils and/or acceptable distances of the  AIMD away from the transmit RF coil in order to limit or prevent exposure to RF energy  during MRI.</para>
      <para>It is important to emphasize that MRI-related conditions, particularly related to RF-in- duced heating, cannot be presumed at different static magnetic field strengths or for multi- nuclear (i.e., non-proton) imaging, because the frequency and the frequency and  wavelengths of the RF pulses are field strength dependent. For example, conditional safety</para>

      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 435-748_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:30 PM  Page 501</para>
      <para>for an AIMD at 3-T/128-MHz at a specific SAR level does not imply conditional safety at  1.5-T/64-MHz (10). Induced currents, particularly within AIMDs, is also a possibility due  to exposure to the rapidly switching gradient magnetic fields associated with MRI.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Device Malfunction  </emphasis></para>
      <para>Time-varying gradient magnetic fields and RF can induce currents within the AIMD,  which may interfere with the control electronics. Thus, when exposed to the RF and gradient  fields, AIMDs may improperly function or “reset”. The static magnetic field can also interact  with certain devices, especially those with moving metallic components. For example, im- plantable infusion pumps with rotor mechanisms can slow down or stop as a result of ex- posure to the static magnetic field of the MR system (see section on <emphasis role="bold">Implantable Infusion </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Pumps</emphasis>).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">PERFORMING MRI IN PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">DEVICES  </emphasis></para>
      <para>Active implanted medical devices include cardiac devices (cardiac pacemakers, im- plantable cardioverter defibrillators, loop recorders and others) and neurostimulation sys- tems (deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation systems, vagus nerve stimulation  systems, sacral nerve stimulation systems, hypoglossal nerve stimulation systems, peripheral  nerve stimulation systems, auditory brainstem implants, cochlear implants, and others), im- plantable infusion pumps, ingestible video endoscopy capsules, and others devices. An ex- haustive discussion of each of these is well beyond the scope of this chapter, however, other  chapters in this textbook provide relevant information for AIMDs.</para>
      <para>Because conditions for scanning frequently change and new devices are constantly be- coming available, it is essential that MRI healthcare workers ensure that they are using the  most up-to-date information that is available. As always, it is essential to not fall prey to  “satisfied search” recognizing that patients may present with multiple implanted devices,  any of which could be dangerous if not scanned with the appropriate MRI-related condi- tions.</para>
      <para>It is also important to understand that, within a particular model of AIMD, there may  be multiple configurations using various components or lead models. In general, the eval- uation of an AIMD for MRI-related issues is highly specific to the complete system and  particular to a given IPG and leads. As such, the MRI-related conditions to perform an MRI  exam safely may have different limits, depending on which components are present in the  patient. Each component of the AIMD must be carefully identified to ensure that the com- plete system is MR Conditional. In some cases, an AIMD may involve MR Conditional  components from different manufacturers and, as a result, the safety of scanning the patient  is unknown because that scenario was never tested.</para>

A patient undergoing an MRI of the lumbar spine using  a body transmit system suffered a significant lesion in the thalamus on the side ipsilateral  to the relatively long lead connected to an IPG implanted in the abdomen area, resulting in  a hemiparesis (2)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>). Whereas cardiac tissue is highly perfused and difficult to ther- mally injure in relation to MRI, neural tissues are extremely sensitive to even modest tem- perature elevations.</para>
      <para>MRI safety conditions for scanning patients with certain DBS systems are generally  associated with a strictly limited, whole-body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of  0.1 W/kg or a B1+Root Mean Squared (B1+RMS) value of 2.0 μT (13, 14). It is essential that, when  performing MRI in patients with DBS systems, that the MRI safety conditions are followed  in their entirety without deviations, and are considered with the entire system recognized  (13, 14). Limiting the assessment of conditions for safe scanning only to those related, for  example, to the IPG, without appreciating conditions associated with the implanted leads  could pose substantial hazards for the patient. By way of example, for certain DBS systems  from Medtronic, the presence of a pocket adapter associated with the IPG precludes the use  of the transmit body RF coil, limiting the MRI exam to transmit/receive RF coils because  pocket adaptors permit older style leads with low impedance (i.e., unsuitable for use of the</para>

The RNS consists of a small neurostimulation device that is im- planted in the skull that delivers stimulation to brain sites and is activated when sensing  leads detect brain activity that is predictive of impending seizure activity (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>). Earlier  versions of this technology from NeuroPace Corporation (e.g., Model RNS-300M) were  labeled MR Unsafe (13). The more recent version, Model RNS-320, is now 1.5-T, full-body  eligible with defined conditions of scanning, thus, permitting patients to benefit from the  diagnostic capabilities afforded by MRI. Similar to other devices, the associated device pro- grammers and monitors are MR Unsafe and should not be allowed into the MR system  room.</para>

This patient sustained a lesion on  the left side of the brain, corresponding with the left-sided lead and the implantation of  the left pulse generator in the abdominal area (i.e., which resulted in a longer length for  the lead on the left side compared to the right side). No lesion was produced on the right  side, where the pulse generator was in the standard infraclavicular position and the lead  had a shorter, more commonly used length.

      <para>Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) technology is increasingly providing therapeutic options  particularly for patients suffering from chronic pain syndromes (13-16)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). SCS  systems are available from multiple manufacturers (13-16). Typically, older versions are  MR Unsafe, while newer versions are MR Conditional. The MRI-related conditions for  SCS systems may include important requirements related to the type of transmit RF coil  that is allowed (e.g., transmit body RF coil combined with any type of receive-only RF coil  or T/R head or extremity RF coils), as well as possible limitations for the whole-body av- eraged SAR or B1+RMS values that are required to ensure patient safety (13). As with other  AIMDs involving the combination of an IPG and leads, the entire “system” must exist in  order to comprise its MR Conditional status. An MR Conditional IPG attached to non-MR  Conditional leads renders the SCS device or any other AIMD for that matter, MR Unsafe.</para>
      <para>Because the spinal cord level at which SCS electrodes are placed is variable and de- pendent on the patient’s clinical symptoms and the particular anatomic segment needing  treatment, the “antenna-effect” of the lead system is similarly variable from patient-to-pa- tient, posing additional challenges to safely performing MRI. Interestingly, some MR Con- ditional SCS systems have adopted technologies to “shield” their leads, such as the SureScan</para>

RF energy that is con- veyed back towards the IPG is shunted to its case, where it is dispersed over the surrounding  soft tissues. The Precision Montage SCS system which uses Avisa leads from Boston Sci- entific utilizes a technology termed, “billabong current suppression”, in which wires wound  around the stimulation lead have short-reversed coil sections that suppress induced currents  (13-15).</para>

      <para>Prior to MRI, the stimulation parameters should be assessed for the VNS system, and  several device outputs are set to 0 mA. VNS devices from LivaNova fall into either “Group  A” or “Group B”, with Group A permitting the use of the transmit body RF coil and scanning  outside of the “exclusion zone” of C7 to L3, and Group B permitting the use of the T/R  head or extremity RF coils and scanning outside of the “exclusion zone” of C7 to T8.</para>
      <para>Not infrequently, VNS systems are explanted if that patient’s epilepsy does not respond  to VNS therapy. While explanation of the IPG is relatively simple, full explantation of the  entire VNS lead is a complex procedure with the potential for causing considerable damage  to the nerve due to scarring and tissue alterations associated with the distal end of the lead  coiled around the vagus nerve. Damage to the vagus nerve can result in serious conse- quences that impact speech, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and other functions. Thus, in practice,  the lead is cut, leaving a length of lead that is variable, along with the portion coiled around  the vagus nerve. Fortunately, MR Conditional labeling exists for this situation. In these  cases, it is important to obtain radiographs to determine the length of the retained lead be- cause a length greater than 2 cm precludes the use of the transmit body RF coil for MRI.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Sacral Nerve Stimulation Systems </emphasis></para>
      <para>Sacral nerve stimulation (SNM) has been shown to be efficacious for urinary bladder  and bowel control and, thus, this device is used to treat patients affected by overactive blad- ders, urinary urge incontinence, unobstructed urinary retention, and fecal incontinence. The  SNM system consists of an IPG that is typically implanted subcutaneously, posterior to the  upper margin of the buttocks (13, 14, 18-20). A lead is implanted adjacent to the sacral  nerves (S2, S3, and S4). Previously, the available MR Conditional sacral nerve stimulation  systems did not permit the use of the transmit body RF coil and, thus, were limited to the  use of the T/R head or extremity RF coils. Those particular devices were the Interstim and  the Interstim II neuromodulation systems used for SNM (Medtronic, www.medtronic.com)  (13, 14). One manufacturer, Medtronic, now has attained FDA approval of its InterStim  Micro System and its InterStim II System permitting full body MRI exams using the trans- mit body RF coil of the MR system. Verification of the model of the IPG and lead is imper- ative in order to determine the MR Conditional status of the device considering that the  different models have different MRI-related conditions that must be followed to ensure pa- tient safety.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation Systems </emphasis></para>
      <para>A new type of neuromodulation system has become available to treat patients with ob- structive sleep apnea. This device called Inspire Upper Airway Stimulation (Inspire, Inc.,  www.inspiresleep.com), is used to treat a subset of patients with moderate to severe ob- structive sleep apnea and is primarily used in patients that fail or cannot tolerate continuous  positive airway pressure (CPAP) and that do not have a complete concentric collapse of the  upper air at the soft palate level. The Inspire Upper Airway Stimulation system employs a  lead directed at sensing the onset of a diaphragmatic inspiratory effort, with subsequent</para>

      <para>For the Inspire Upper Airway Stimulation device, one model is labeled MR Unsafe,  Model 3024, while the other, Model 3028, is MR Conditional. The MR Conditional version  requires the MRI examination to be performed at 1.5-T, operating in the Normal Operating  Mode (i.e., limiting the whole-body averaged SAR to 2 W/kg or less or a particular B1+RMS  limits depending on the positioning of the T/R head RF coil), using the T/R head or extrem- ity RF coils. Once again, this illustrates the need for absolute precision in terms of accurately  identifying the make and model of the patient’s AIMD, especially in instances when MR  Unsafe and MR Conditional versions exist.</para>

These AIMDs are associated with scanning parameters permitting MRI examinations  to be performed in patients under highly-specific conditions.

While an option exists to surgically remove  the internal magnet prior to MRI and then to replace it following the exam, as with any sur- gical procedure, there is a risk of infection or other complication. Particularly in CI patients  that are in need of multiple MRIs, including those with neurofibromatosis 2 in which growth  of multiple tumors must be constantly assessed, the repeated surgeries for magnet removal  can pose a substantial risk.</para>
      <para>When performing MRI in patients with cochlear implants, the alternative to magnet re- moval is to tightly wrap the patient’s head using a special compression dressing in an effort  to prevent magnet movement or displacement. Unfortunately, head wrapping is associated  with patient discomfort, and despite this procedure, some magnets still dislodge (21-23).  In addition, the presence of the magnet imparts significant susceptibility artifact, although  techniques are available to mitigate these (23-25). Increasingly, efforts by CI manufacturers  have addressed the aforementioned MRI-related issues, with at least three manufacturers  that now have cochlear implants that incorporate magnetic components that self-align to  the direction of the static magnetic field of the MR system: the MED-EL Synchrony (MED- EL, www.medel.com (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7B</emphasis>), the Advanced Bionics HiRes Ultra 3D (Advanced Bion- ics, www.advancedbionics.com), and the Cochlear Nucleus System (Cochlear,  www.cochlear.com). This important design feature does away with the need for head wrap- ping because it reduces or eliminates the substantial force and torque experienced by older</para>

This de- vice consists of an externally-attached auditory microphone processor and transmitter  system that is affixed transcranially to the implanted receiver that delivers stimulation  through an electrode implanted into the cochlea to produce sound perception for the pa- tient.  The attachment of the cochlear implant is typically accomplished by metallic ele- ments in the external component that couple with one or more magnets that are an  inherent part of the internally implanted component.  Newer generations of MR Condi- tional cochlear implants (<emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>) feature rotating magnets that align with the direction of the  MR system’s static magnetic field, reducing or eliminating the substantial attractive force  and torque that earlier generations of these devices typically experienced.

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Implantable Infusion Pumps </emphasis></para>
      <para>Implantable infusion pumps allow controlled delivery of medications into the subarach- noid space at the spinal canal. The most commonly infused medications are morphine, or  its derivatives for pain control and baclofen, or its derivatives for control of spasticity. Im- plantable infusion pumps that have undergone proper testing are labeled MR Unsafe, while  others, including several different versions from Medtronic, are labeled MR Conditional.</para>
      <para>While the patient undergoes an MRI examination, drug infusion by the pump is typically  suspended in order to prevent problems related to the dispensing of the medication. After  MRI, it is essential to assess the operational aspects of the implantable infusion pump be- cause the gears within the pump’s motor may temporarily bind, and prevent the pump from  restarting. This scenario could potentially lead to opioid withdrawal, or baclofen withdrawal  syndrome, both of which are serious conditions (29).</para>
      <para>Similar to other AIMDs, it is important to note the specific conditions for scanning as- sociated with each type of implantable infusion pump, especially with respect to the name  of the product and model number. Importantly, although labeled MR Conditional, conditions  associated with safe scanning of the two different versions of the implantable infusion  pumps from Flowonics Medical Inc. (www.flowonics.com), the Prometra and Prometra II,  require that the drug reservoir be entirely emptied prior to permitting the patient entry into  the MR system room. This is crucial because these devices can dispense medications in an  uncontrolled manner during MRI. Notably, MRI-related safety issues for implantable infu- sion pumps were the subject of an FDA Safety Communication in 2017 (30).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Ingestible Video Capsule Endoscopy Devices </emphasis></para>
      <para>Ingestible, video capsule endoscopy devices are AIMDs that take images that are wire- lessly conveyed as they pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) system. These devices include  the various models of the PillCam (Medtronic, www.medtronic.com), the CapsoCam  (CapsoVision, capsovision.com), the Mirocam (IntoMedic, www.intromedic.com), and the  ENDOCAPSULE (Olympus, www.olympusamerica.com). Each one of these is MR Unsafe  and exposure to MRI environment can corrupt or erase the data. Occasionally ingestible,  video capsule endoscopy devices are not passed from the GI system in a timely manner,  particularly when they enter a diverticulum pocket on the wall of the intestine, and are re- tained. The battery contains a small amount of ferromagnetic material that can experience  translational attraction and torque in association with MRI. To date, no known clinically  adverse events have been reported in association with inadvertent scanning of patients with  these AIMDs, but they are associated with substantial susceptibility artifact.</para>

      <para>with these AIMDs can have safe access to the diagnostic benefits afforded by MRI as long  as the conditions are carefully followed. Diligent pre-MRI patient screening is essential to  ensure that each and every AIMD is identified in its entirety, and conditions for scanning  are strictly complied with because severe injury to the patient or substantial damage to the  device can result if improper MRI-related conditions are applied.</para>
      <para>In the coming years, a host of new innovative devices is likely. With the awareness of  the concurrent needs of implant recipients to need access to MRI, the science behind de- signing and testing MR Conditional systems can be expected to rapidly advance. Because  the MRI-related conditions of any particular AIMD may change or otherwise evolve over  time, MRI healthcare professionals must be cognizant of the need to utilize the latest infor- mation prior to performing the MRI examinations. In this manner, patients will be protected  from possible adverse events.</para>
