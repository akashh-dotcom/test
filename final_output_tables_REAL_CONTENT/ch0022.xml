      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Active implants may pose hazards to patients referred for magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) procedures. An active implant is defined as one that relies on its function from a  source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the  human body or gravity (1). In contrast, a passive implant, such as a coronary artery stent,  hemostatic clip, or hip prosthesis, does not require electrical power or other external energy  in its operation or during its intended use. Some active implants have external leads and  electrodes for delivery of electric current for therapy and/or for physiologic sensing. Ex- amples of active implants include cardiac pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrilla- tors (ICDs), neurostimulation systems, bone growth stimulators, and cochlear implants.  Other types of active implants, such as implantable drug infusion pumps, use electrical  power for operation but may not have attached metallic leads and electrodes.</para>

      <title>IN-VITRO TESTS OF HEATING</title>
      <para>Implants with conducting leads have been referred to as “MR Critical” with respect to  radiofrequency (RF) heating because of the length of the metallic materials (2). Testing in  phantoms has demonstrated the potential for significant temperature rises at the electrodes  of leads that are part of an active implant system (3). For example, Rezai, et al. (4) measured  a temperature rise of 25.3°C on the tip of a deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead in a phantom</para>

      <para>at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz in association with an MR system reported, whole-body averaged SAR  of 3.9-W/kg. Achenbach, et al. (5) reported a temperature increase of 63.1°C at the electrode  tip for a cardiac pacing lead not connected to a pulse generator (PG) under 1.5-Tesla/64- MHz conditions. Luechinger (6) measured an RF-induced temperature rise in laboratory  animals (pigs). A maximum temperature increase of 15°C was measured for a passive fix- ation lead and a temperature rise in excess of 30°C was measured for a “cork-screw” fixation  lead (6). No significant threshold or impedance changes of the cardiac pacing leads were  measured nor did pathology indicate any heat-related damage under the conditions used in  this investigation.</para>

      <title>CLINICAL RELEVANCE</title>
      <para>An understanding of heating behavior for active implant-related leads is crucial to es- tablishing patient safety in association with the use of MRI. Excessive heating at the elec- trode could damage the surrounding tissue, which may be particularly serious for  neurological or cardiac tissue.  Active implants with lead wires are mostly contraindicated  for MRI primarily because of the large temperature rises that have been reported in labora- tory testing. Before an implant manufacturer can receive regulatory approval for a given  product relative to the use of MRI, tests and analyses must be undertaken to document that  a patient with the implant can safely undergo an MRI procedure. This is particularly im- portant for active implants.</para>
      <para>Several active implants have labeling approved for patients needing MRI examinations  including cardiac devices, neurostimulation systems, cochlear implants, and others.  For  example, the first cardiac pacemaker approved in the United States (U.S.) for MRI was the  Revo MRI SureScan Pacing System (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) (7). Patients with the  Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) System (Cyberonics,  Inc. and LivaNova) and the Activa Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System (Medtronic, Min- neapolis, MN) may safely undergo MRI by following highly specific conditions (8, 9).</para>
      <para>MRI-related heating of active implants without external leads is expected to be similar  for a passive implant with similar geometry and materials (10). However, interactions of  the electromagnetic fields with the device circuitry could result in heating or other issues.  For example, magnetic saturation of a transformer core by the static magnetic field of the  scanner may result in additional power delivery by a battery.</para>

      <title>MECHANISM OF RADIOFREQUENCY FIELD-RELATED HEATING</title>
      <para>The radiofrequency (RF) field used during MRI induces an electric field in the patient  or the phantom (i.e., in the case of evaluating heating for implants and devices). The fre- quency of the RF electric field is the same as that of the RF magnetic field, 64-MHz for  1.5-T and 128-MHz for 3-T. The electric field results in power deposition from the ohmic  heating of tissues. The specific absorption rate (SAR) with units of W/kg is the metric for  the RF power.</para>
      <para>The mechanism for heating of an implant during MRI is coupling of the metal with the  electric fields. The tangential component of the electric field along the length of the lead</para>

      <para>induces waves of electric current on the lead (11). These waves produce an electric field in  the vicinity of the electrode, which produces heating of the tissue. There may also be meas- urable temperature rises due to ohmic heating by the induced RF current through the con- ducting wires in a lead.</para>
      <para>Thus, the temperature rise at an electrode is due to the tangential electric field along  the entire length of the lead. This concept was quantified by Park, et al. (12) using a transfer  function (TF) method. The temperature rise may be expressed as</para>
      <para>In Equation (1), A is a constant with units of °C/(V/m)<superscript>2</superscript>, <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">tan</emphasis> is the tangential electric  field, distance <emphasis role="italics">τ</emphasis> = 0 at the electrode and <emphasis role="italics">τ</emphasis> = <emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis> at the generator, and <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis> is the transfer function  (i.e., the lead model) between the incident <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">tan</emphasis> and the scattered electric field near the elec- trode. The dimensions of <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis> are inverse length. Both <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">tan</emphasis> are complex, that is, they  have magnitude and phase.</para>
      <para>Due to phase effects, it is possible to have a high or low temperature rise for different  lead paths in the phantom with similar magnitude of <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">tan</emphasis>. This phenomenon was demon- strated by Mattei, et al. (13) who measured temperature rises for leads in a phantom for 374  different configurations. This group reported that the observed temperature rise at the tip  of a pacemaker lead depended on the path in the phantom and whether or not the pulse gen- erator was attached to the lead. In tests conducted in a circular phantom, Langman, et al.  (14) also found that heating depended on the termination conditions at the generator end of  the lead. Importantly, heating of a lead will also depend on how it is constructed. Nordbeck,  et al. (15) measured RF heating of unipolar and bipolar pacing lead assemblies in a rectan- gular phantom. It was concluded that heating could be reduced by changes in the configu- ration of the lead. Mattei, et al. (16) tested the role of lead structure by <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> measurements  on 30 commercial cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads in a  rectangular phantom. At a whole-body averaged exposure SAR of 1-W/kg, the recorded  temperature rises ranged from 2.4°C to 15°C. These tests were conducted for straight-line  placement of the lead in the phantom and, thus, it is possible that greater rises would be  measured for other lead paths.</para>

      <title>CALCULATION OF RADIOFREQUENCY FIELD-RELATED HEATING</title>
      <para>The temperature rise of a passive implant in a phantom, such as a spine prosthesis or  fixation device can be accurately calculated (17) and these types of simulations are described  elsewhere in this textbook. Calculation of the transfer function and consequent temperature  rise for an implanted lead is difficult because of the intricate and complicated geometry of  the lead. The lead conductors have a minimum feature of the order of tens of microns, which  is of the order of 10<superscript>5</superscript> greater than the length of the lead. Park, et al. (12) calculated <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis> and  RF-induced temperature rises for bare and insulated wires using method of moments.  Neufeld, et al. (18) calculated heating for a straight insulated wire and for a helical wire</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION ISO/TS 10974 FOR MRI AND ACTIVE  </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">IMPLANTS </emphasis></para>
      <para>A joint working group commissioned by the International Organization for Standardi- zation (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) developed a draft Inter- national Technical Specification ISO/TS 10974:2018 that provides test methods for  MRI-related hazards associated with an active implantable medical device (AIMD) includ- ing RF-induced heating (1). The technical specification (TS) presents an approach with four  tiers for assessment of RF heating of active implants. Tier 1 has the simplest test and com- putation requirements, but also requires the most conservative assumptions on incident RF  energy. Tiers 2 and 3 progressively require more measurements and simulations, but are  able to use successively less overestimation of test field magnitudes. Tier 4 requires the  most stringent computational analysis and utilizes the least overestimation of test field mag- nitudes.</para>
      <para>Cabot, et al. (19) evaluated RF heating of a generic deep brain stimulator in 1.5-T/64- MHz as a vehicle to test the four tiers of ISO/TSO 10974. The model implant consisted of  a stainless steel “can”, a dielectric header, and leads consisting of either an insulating helical  copper lead or an insulated straight copper lead. Lead lengths of 50-, 100-, 150-, and 200- mm were evaluated. Simulations for this implant, which is much simpler than an actual  DBS device, required as many as 500 x 10<superscript>6</superscript> mesh cells. Simulations were run on an accel- erated cluster and it was projected that carrying out the estimated 12,000 simulations for a  Tier 4 analysis would take several decades. Cabot, et al. (19) concluded with a suggestion  for a procedure that follows a test strategy between Tier 3 and Tier 4.</para>
      <para>In consideration of the above, the following information should be considered regarding  MRI-related heating and active implants: (1) Heating at the electrode of an implanted lead  used for a cardiac pacemaker, neurostimulation system, or other similar device that has an  active lead may be significantly greater than the threshold rise of approximately 6 to 7°C  for tissue injury (20).  (2) Heating at the electrode is a complicated function of the magnitude  and phase of the incident <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">tan</emphasis> over the entire length of the lead.  If only phantom tests are  used to characterize lead heating behavior, a significant number of these tests may be re- quired.  (3) Current computational methods are not capable of accurately calculating the  temperature rise for a clinically relevant lead wire.  (4) A combined approach of innovative  measurements and complementary computations will improve the accuracy and efficiency  of determining the temperature rise of the lead over the clinically relevant range of incident  <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">tan</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>A primary purpose of this chapter is to describe test methods and analyses to predict  the heating that an active implant would undergo during MRI.  The test case is a commercial  neurostimulation system used for vagus nerve stimulation (Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS),  NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) System (Cyberonics, Inc. and LivaNova).

Second, the <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>  temperature rise is calculated based on the electric fields along the path of the lead in the  patient during MRI and the transfer function. Thus, a focus of this chapter is on computer  simulations and laboratory tests. More clinically oriented perspectives on performing MRI  in patients with active implants are presented in other chapters of this textbook.</para>

      <para>netic field. Plots of the calculated electric field for the phantom in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis> have been pre- sented by Amjad, et al. (22). At the sides of the phantom and in the region of the landmark  for MRI (i.e., the center of the body RF coil), the electric field in a vertical plane is parallel  to the wall and is uniform in magnitude over a distance of approximately 20-cm. Passive  implants are generally tested for heating in the region of a relatively uniform field, although  the measurement accuracy may be impacted for larger implants by the variation of the elec- tric field in the vertical direction of the phantom. The <emphasis role="italics">γ</emphasis> factor in Equation (6) may be derived  from the phantom test. Since the standard specifies a fixed conductivity (i.e., 0.47-S/m) for  the phantom filled with gelled-saline, the temperature rise normalized to the local back- ground SAR will be proportional to <emphasis role="italics">γ</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>The non-uniform distribution in magnitude and direction of electric field in the phantom  can be useful for testing heating of active implants. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis> illustrates two paths for a heat- ing test on a lead with a pulse generator.

      <para>It is desired that the tangential electric field <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">tan</emphasis> (ϕ component) have uniform magnitude  and phase around the circumference of the phantom.

This  geometry of B1 could be achieved using a vertical polarized birdcage coil, a single loop cir- cular coil that surrounds the phantom, or other appropriate method.</para>
      <para>Temperature probes are placed at the electrodes or other relevant locations. The tem- perature rise is measured as a function of the foldback distance (FBD) between the generator  and the 180° turns in the lead. Let L0 be the lead length. Then:</para>

      <para>A possible procedure for the foldback test is as follows: (1) Measure the temperature  rise for different values of FBD. A useful step size in FBD will be in the range of 3- to 5- cm. (2) Remove the lead and measure the background SAR along the path of the lead with  one of the methods specified in ASTM F2182 (21) or other appropriate technique. (3) De- termine ΔT1(max), which is the maximum rise for any of the foldback tests divided by the  local background SAR. Units of ΔT1(max) are °C/(W/kg).</para>

      <para>Potential use of the measured temperature rises for different FBD is as follows: The  measurements of ΔT can be used to validate <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis> that was obtained by calculation or a separate  measurement.

      <para><emphasis role="bold">RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIC </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">FIELD TRANSFER FUNCTION </emphasis></para>
      <para>The measurement of the electric field transfer function is now an established method  in the process of determining RF-induced heating at the electrodes of the lead of an active  implant system. Recent developments in the measurements of the transfer function are de- scribed in this section.</para>
      <para>Feng, et al. (26) described a reciprocity approach for measurement of the transfer func- tion. The apparatus in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis> depicts the use of the tangential electric field (<emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">tan</emphasis>) method  along the length of the lead by application of current to the transmitter antenna from port 1  of the network analyzer and the signal from the electric field near the electrode is sensed  by port 2. With the reciprocity method, current is induced in the lead by attaching the elec- trode to port 1 and port 2 is connected to a current sensor, such as a ferromagnetic toroid,  that is translated along the length of the lead. Due to electromagnetic reciprocity, both meth- ods yield the current electric field transfer function.</para>
      <para>The advantages of the use of the reciprocal method for transfer function calculation and  measurement include, the following:</para>
      <para>(1) Computation of the transfer function is simplified because the only source is the current  applied to the electrode and it is necessary to make only one calculation of current along  the lead. For the non-reciprocal method, the current source must be applied a number of  locations along the length of the lead and the current distribution along lead must be cal- culated for each of the placements.</para>
      <para>(2) The reciprocal method may provide more flexibility on the type of sensor that is used to  measure the current along the lead.</para>
      <para>Missofe and Aisans  (27) describe in detail the design of an apparatus for measurement  of the transfer function, including details on the ferrite core that can serve as either the trans- mitter for induction of current into the lead or for the sensing of current in the lead wire.  The apparatus was validated with insulated wires. The measured and calculated electric  field transfer functions were in good agreement (27).</para>

      <para>Tokaya, et al. (28) reported on a method in which the transfer function (TF) was meas- ured in association with MRI. There was good agreement between measured and calculated  transfer functions for linear and helical implants using relatively quick MRI acquisitions  with millimeter spatial resolution. The authors concluded that the proposed MRI-based  method allows for TF determination in more realistic exposure scenarios and solid media.</para>

      <para>Time-varying gradient magnetic fields used during MRI will induce eddy currents when  incident on a planar surface of an implant or device. These eddy currents can produce a  power dissipation that may produce a measurable temperature rise. Heating will tend to be  greatest for implants that are relatively large, that have a geometry that provides easy path- ways for flow of eddy currents, that have a high electrical conductivity, and that have a  thickness that is approximately the same or greater than electrical skin depth. Examples of  implants with the greatest potential for gradient magnetic field-induced heating include a  large pulse generator associated with an active implant and the large acetabular shell of a  hip prosthesis (i.e., a passive implant).</para>
      <para>Note that the metal of the implant is directly heated by the time-varying gradient mag- netic fields, which have frequencies in the range of a few hundred Hz to a few kHz.  In con- trast, in RF-induced heating, the tissue in the vicinity of an implant is heated and there is  little direct heating of metal by the time-varying RF magnetic field (29). Calculation of gra- dient magnetic field induced-heating of model implants has been described in a Master’s  thesis by B. Stem (30).</para>

Note that (dB/dt)rms is the root mean square value  of time-varying magnetic field from the gradients. (dB/dt)rms is proportional to the rms slew  rate, which can be obtained from the pulse sequence parametrs. (dB/dt)rms can also measured  with a search coil and a digitizing oscilloscope.</para>
      <para>In the bore of an MR system, the dB/dt is the highest at an axial distance approximately  30 cm from iso-center and near the wall of the bore. Generally speaking, the maximum  dB/dt (in T/s) on a bore axis is about 0.25 times the slew rate (in T/m/s). dB/dt is around 30  to 50% greater at (z, r) = (0.3 m, 0.2 m) compared to its value at (z, r)  (0.3 m, 0)(32, 33).</para>
      <para>Notably, for gradient magnetic field-induced heating of an implant to be of clinical im- portance, all of the following conditions must be present.</para>
      <para>1) The implant has a large, symmetric surface area. Heating also increases with increasing  metal thickness and increasing metal conductivity.  2) The dB/dt is normally incident on the large surface of the implant.  3) There is a large sustained (&gt; 5 minutes) rms gradient slew rate Srms. Annex D of Refer- ence 1 lists a most conservative (Tier 1) test (dBrms/dt) of 42 T/s.   4) The implant is positioned in a region of the bore where dB/dt is most intense. (dB/dt is  near zero at isocenter and maximum at |z| approximately 30 cm and at a radial distance  close to the wall of the bore.).</para>
      <para>Considering the simultaneous requirements indicated above, it is not surprising that  there have been few, if any, adverse event reports due to gradient magnetic field-induced  heating of either active or passive implants. At this time, certain manufacturers of active  implants may specify a maximum hardware slew rate in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis> (IFU) for  the implant with respect to MRI labeling. Notably, the IFUs for passive implants generally  do not present maximum gradient magnetic field parameters, though regulatory guidance  may require this information in the future for certain implants. In the absence of guidance  from the manufacturer, a prudent precaution would appear to be not apply a long-duration  and intense dB/dt sequence if the patient has a relatively large metallic implant.</para>
      <para>The focus in this section was on heating due to interaction of a metallic implant with  MRI-related, gradient magnetic fields.  Both gradient magnetic field-induced heating and  vibration arise from the eddy currents induced in the metal of the implant. Gradient vibration  occurs from the torque induced on the implant due to the magnetic force exerted by the  static magnetic field on the gradient current density. The same factors presented above that  must be met for gradient magnetic field-induced heating of implants to be of clinical im- portance are also required for maximum gradient vibration. In addition, the maximum torque  occurs when the static magnetic field is perpendicular to the gradient current density. Clause  10 of Reference 1 describes in some detail the mechanism and consequences of gradient- induced vibration.</para>

      <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>A procedure is described in this chapter for the determination of <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> temperature  rises of an AIMD during MRI. Four complementary measurements for the determination  of the transfer function, <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis>, are presented. The overlapping results of the measurements pro- vide confidence that the lead model presented herein has been accurately determined.</para>
      <para>The analysis is focused on heating at 64-MHz (1.5-T). A similar methodology could be  used for 3-T/128-MHz MRI conditions. The transfer function for 128-MHz is shown in  <emphasis role="bold">Figure 21</emphasis>. Of note is that the characteristics of lead heating will be different at 3-T/128- MHz because the wavelengths associated with the current waves at 3-T (128-MHz) are ap- proximately half of those at 1.5-T (64-MHz).</para>
      <para>The transfer function for a lead incorporates the sensitivity of the lead to the magnitude  and phase of the incident field along the length of the lead. After phase and relative magni- tude measurements are made with a network analyzer, as few as one measurement of the  temperature rise in a phantom is needed to determine the scaling factor, <emphasis role="italics">K</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis>. However, it  will be appropriate to measure the temperature rise for more than one path in the phantom  in order to demonstrate the validity of the transfer function, as Equation (1) should predict  the temperature rise for any path in the phantom. The procedure outlined here does not re- quire the calculation of <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis> based on the construction of the lead. An accurate calculation of  <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis> for an actual clinical lead would be extremely challenging as the wire diameter, pitch, and  insulation thickness of a typical lead are several orders of magnitude smaller than the length.  Nonetheless, it would be interesting to compare measured and calculated <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis> for such a lead.</para>
      <para>The procedure presented in this chapter does require the knowledge of magnitude and  phase of the electric field in the phantom and in the human placed in the transmit RF coil  of the MR system. These calculations are straightforward, being performed with FDTD and  have been previously described (34). These calculations may be conducted at a modest res- olution such as 5-mm. If needed, a locally finer resolution could be achieved in the human  model with variable gridding and the Huygens box method (18).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">In-vivo</emphasis> temperature rises presented herein for the Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), Neu- roCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) System (Cyberonics, Inc. and LivaNova) are shown to il- lustrate the overall procedure for determining RF heating. No recommendations have been  made for acceptable MRI conditions. A more comprehensive assessment of the <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> tem- perature rises would include: (1) An assessment to determine whether the electrical con- ductivity of the phantom materials are appropriate for the impedance conditions at the  electrode; (2) An evaluation of the impact on temperature rises of the different tissue con- ductivities along the path of the VNS lead; (3) An assessment of the sensitivity of the tem- perature rises to variation in the path of the lead; and (4) A determination of <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>  temperature rises in additional human models, such as those in the virtual population from  the IT’IS Foundation (35). Nevertheless the RF-induced temperature rises shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">19</emphasis> are consistent with the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis> for the Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS),  NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) System (Cyberonics, Inc. and LivaNova), which limit  MRI procedures to those involving the use of a transmit/receive head RF coil and other  similar RF coils (8).</para>

      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 435-748_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:32 PM  Page 606</para>
      <para>The standard ISO/TS 10974 should be carefully studied when evaluating an active im- plant for MRI issues (1). In addition to RF heating, an assessment should be made whether  other interactions associated with MRI, including magnetic field interactions, gradient stim- ulation, and electromagnetic interference are safe for the patient and the implant.</para>
      <para>The calculation of the background electric field in the body during MRI and the meas- urement of local background SAR in the phantom are made with no implant. The calculation  of temperature rise at the electrode is made assuming that the lead does not appreciably  change the incident RF energy. This assumption should be fulfilled in MRI since the energy  scattered by the lead should be at least two orders of magnitude less than the energy input  to the RF coil. Experiments on model implants for which the measured temperature rises  agree well with the calculated rises further demonstrate the validity of the computational  procedure described herein (36).</para>
      <para>Nyenhuis (37) has calculated the spatial distribution during MRI of the temperature rise  surrounding the electrodes of a spinal cord stimulation system. It was determined that the  region of greatest temperature rise was localized to approximately 2 mm around the elec- trodes. The approach was a computational extension to the transfer function approach, which  is now possible due to improved computational software and hardware.</para>
      <para>Informal tests that were made with the transfer function apparatus indicate that smooth  curves in the path have minimal impact on <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis>. This observation is supported by results in  <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> were the same transfer function yields calculated temperature rises  that agree well with measurements for both the straight- and U-paths of the lead. Nyenhuis,  et al. (38) presented details on the influence of phantom boundaries and media parameters  on the transfer function.</para>
      <para>The measurements and calculations demonstrate that the temperature rise at the elec- trode of the VNS System (Cyberonics, Inc. and LivaNova) depends greatly on the termina- tion state at the pulse generator. This suggests that heating of an active implant might be  mitigated by optimizing the value of the termination impedance.</para>
      <para>The methods presented in this chapter can be used to establish the SAR levels under  which a patient with an active implant may undergo MRI. If the tests and analysis indicate  the potential for harmful heating, then MRI may be safe only for SAR levels below the Nor- mal Operating Mode limit of a whole-body averaged SAR of 2-W/kg or an SAR of 3.2- W/kg in the head (39). If the lead is found to heat excessively, then it may be deemed to be  unsafe for a patient undergoing MRI. A summary of the results from the heating tests is  typically presented in the MRI labeling information section of the device’s <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Use</emphasis> (8, 40).</para>
      <para>In addition to safety with respect to RF heating, device and patient safety with respect  to magnetic field interactions, pulsed gradient fields, and electromagnetic interference must  be established before patients with the device may safely undergo MRI. Regulatory bodies  such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration review submissions by implant manufac- turers prior to approval of the MRI-related labeling (40).</para>
