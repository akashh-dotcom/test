      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Medical imaging remains a common requirement in pregnant patients. Because of the  increased scrutiny for possible radiation effects associated with pregnancy (1-4), it is not  surprising that the question of whether a patient should undergo a magnetic resonance im- aging (MRI) examination during pregnancy frequently arises. While a 1988 survey by  Kanal, et al. (5) showed that 36% of sites did not perform MRI procedures in pregnant pa- tients, a subsequent publication by De Wilde, et al. (6) indicated that 91% of 352 MRI fa- cilities in the United Kingdom performed MRI examinations in second and third trimester  patients, and 8% had protocols for selective fetal imaging (6).  Of further note is that Kwan,  et al. (7) reported that “magnetic resonance imaging rates increased steadily from 1.0/1,000  pregnancies in 1996 to 11.9/1,000 pregnancies in 2016 in the United States and from  0.5/1,000 pregnancies in 1996 to 9.8/1,000 pregnancies in 2016 in Ontario, surpassing CT  rates in 2013 in the United States and in 2007 in Ontario.”</para>
      <para>Although advice from regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) is limited, the International Society for Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (ISMRM), the American College of Radiology (ACR), and other organizations have pro- vided useful clarifications, as follows (8-13):</para>
      <para>1989, FDA: “The safety of MRI when used to image fetuses and infants has not  • been established” (8).</para>
      <para>1991, Safety Committee for the Society of Magnetic Resonance Imaging  • (SMRI): “MR imaging may be used in pregnant women if other non-ionizing  forms of diagnostic imaging are inadequate or if the examination provides impor-</para>
      <para>tant information that would otherwise require exposure to ionizing radiation...”,  and there is “… no indication that the use of clinical MR imaging during preg- nancy has produce deleterious effects” (9). This policy adopted by the American  College of Radiology was considered a “standard of care” with reference to preg- nant patients (10).</para>
      <para>2002, the American College of Radiology (ACR) White Paper on MR Safety:  • “Pregnant patients can … undergo MR scans at any stage of pregnancy if, in the  determination of a Level Two MR Personnel–designated attending radiologist,  the risk–benefit ratio to the patient warrants that the study be performed” (11).</para>
      <para>2007, the ACR Guidance Document for Safe MR Practices: “Present data have  • not conclusively documented any deleterious effects of MR imaging exposure on  the developing fetus”, and; “… no special consideration is recommended for the  first, versus any other, trimester in pregnancy” (12). It is, therefore, “prudent” to  document pregnancy and consult with the patient and her physician regarding the  clinical urgency for immediate MRI versus waiting for MRI until after delivery.</para>
      <para>2013, the ACR updated the information for the use of MRI in pregnancy, as fol- • lows: “Present data have not conclusively documented any deleterious effects of  MR imaging exposure on the developing fetus. Therefore, no special considera- tion is recommended for the first, versus any other, trimester in pregnancy. Nev- ertheless, as with all interventions during pregnancy, it is prudent to screen  females of reproductive age for pregnancy before permitting them access to MR  imaging environments. If pregnancy is established consideration should be given  to reassessing the potential risks versus benefits of the pending study in determin- ing whether the requested MR examination could safely wait to the end of the  pregnancy before being performed.</para>
      <para>A. Pregnant patients can be accepted to undergo MR scans at any stage of preg- nancy if, in the determination of a Level 2 MR Personnel-designated attend- ing radiologist, the risk–benefit ratio to the patient warrants that the study be  performed. The radiologist should confer with the referring physician and  document the following in the radiology report or the patient’s medical  record:</para>
      <para>1. The information requested from the MR study cannot be acquired by  means of nonionizing means (e.g., ultrasonography).</para>
      <para>2. The data is needed to potentially affect the care of the patient or fetus  during the pregnancy.</para>
      <para>3. The referring physician believes that it is not prudent to wait until the pa- tient is no longer pregnant to obtain this data.</para>
      <para>B. MR contrast agents should not be routinely provided to pregnant patients.  This decision too, is one that must be made on a case-by-case basis by the  covering Level 2 MR Personnel-designated attending radiologist who will as- sess the risk–benefit ratio for that particular patient.” Notably, the 2013 docu- ment from the ACR does not indicate that there is a need for informed  consent for the use of MRI in pregnant patients (13).</para>

      <para>2018, the ACR Manual On Contrast Media Version 10.3 states that if GBCAs are  • to be given to a pregnant patient: “It is recommended that informed consent be  obtained from the patient after discussion with the referring physician (14).”</para>

      <para>MRI exposes the patient and fetus to a powerful static magnetic field, rapidly changing,  gradient magnetic fields, acoustic noise, and radiofrequency (RF) radiation.  The effects of  these electromagnetic fields on the human fetus are not easily determined. Consider the fol- lowing:</para>
      <para>The strength of the static magnetic field is well known (e.g., 1.5-Tesla, 3-Tesla,  • etc.).</para>
      <para>The gradient amplitude (e.g., 20-mT/m) and slew rate, dB/dt (i.e., 3-T/s) can be  • determined at the location of the fetus for a given pulse sequence.</para>
      <para>RF energy power deposition or the specific absorption rate (SAR) level (e.g.,  • whole body averaged SAR, 2.0-W/kg with the MR system operating in the Nor- mal Operating Mode) will vary considerably with the type of transmit RF coil  that is used and system configuration, as well as the pulse sequences that are se- lected for the procedure. Popular sequences for fast fetal imaging, such as fast  spin echo, employ multiple rapid RF pulses, and would be expected to deposit  more RF energy compared to gradient echo techniques.</para>
      <para>Using computer modeling, Murbach, et al. (15) described the potential risks asso- • ciated with the use of two-port radiofrequency (RF) shimming when examining a  pregnant woman at 3-T. They stated: “Although RF shimmed configurations may  lower the local RF exposure for the mother, they can increase the thermal load on  the fetus. In worst-case configurations, whole-body exposure and local peak tem- peratures-up to 40.8°C-are equal in fetus and mother”. Of course, this finding has  not been verified in human subjects undergoing MRI and there are well-known  issues when using modeling to predict temperature elevations in patients in asso- ciation with MRI.</para>
      <para>RF power deposition varies considerably with the body part undergoing MRI.  • While Schaefer (16) concluded that approximately 87% of the RF energy would  likely be deposited in the outer 1/3 of the body (16), Hand, et al. (17) predicted  that the fetus would be exposed to a peak of approximately 40 to 60% of the ma- ternal peak value at 64-MHz (1.5-Tesla), increasing to approximately 50 to 70%  at 128-MHz (3-Tesla). Thus, in most instances, the embryo or fetus would re- ceive relatively small RF exposures (18-20).</para>
      <para>Heating is the only well-established mechanism for bioeffects related to RF en- • ergy (21). Interestingly, the fetus may be heat energy tolerant due to a large fetal  surface area-to-volume ratio. In addition, amniotic fluid, with its relatively high  heat capacity, would be expected to sufficiently absorb heat transferred by con- vection. Kikuchi, et al. (22) used a thermal model to predict that 40-minutes of</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">308</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Procedures and Pregnancy</emphasis></para>
      <para>scanning at a whole-body averaged SAR of 2-W/kg may increase fetal tempera- ture more than the 0.5°C, as recommended by the International Commission on  Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, but less than the proposed teratogenic cutoff  value of 1.5 °C (22).</para>
      <para>The anatomically “deep” position of the fetus and the surrounding amniotic fluid  • could reduce the effects of gradient field-related, acoustic noise.</para>
      <para>While the stage of pregnancy may be important with regard to the potential risk  • to the embryo or fetus, it should be noted that spontaneous adverse outcomes are  common (23) (<emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>).</para>

      <para>Bird, et al. (52) have “identified 1.2 gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) exposures  per 1,000 live births, or one exposure for every 860 pregnancies especially during the first  few weeks of pregnancy compared with the later weeks of pregnancy, suggesting inadvertent  exposure to GBCAs might occur before pregnancy is recognized (52).”</para>
      <para>While some moieties are transferred across the placenta by active transporters located  on both the fetal and maternal side of the trophoblast layer, most substances administered  during pregnancy will, to a certain degree, traverse the placenta and enter the fetus via pas- sive diffusion. Transplacental passive diffusion is affected by molecular properties such as  molecular weight, the acid dissociation constant (pKa), lipid solubility, and plasma protein  binding (53, 54). Polar molecules with a molecular weight of less than 500-D are more  likely to traverse the placenta.

      <para>Most currently approved gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents have a relatively low  molecular weight and, thus, would be expected to readily cross the placental barrier (52- 72) (<emphasis role="bold">Table 5</emphasis>).

From there, the fetus would swallow some of the contrast  material and it would pass through the fetal gut, eventually reentering the amniotic fluid  (67-72).  Based on postnatal animal studies that demonstrated less than 1% intestinal  gadolinium chelate absorption (72-76), significant fetal intestinal absorption of gadolin- ium-based contrast agents might not be expected. Conversely, fetal amniotic circulation  may participate unpredictably in the breakdown and absorption of intact contrast agents  and free gadolinium. Excess chelating ligand may be absorbed with potential fetotoxic ef- fects as shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 6</emphasis>.  It is predictable that the dissociation of the gadolinium chelate  bond will be greater with thermodynamically less stable MRI contrast agents (e.g., OmniS- can, OptiMARK, and Magnevist) as compared to more stable agents (e.g., ProHance,  Gadovist, and Doterem) and, thus, the latter three would be better choices for use when re- quired in pregnant patients (77-78).</para>

      <para>Non-Pelvic ImagingThe pregnant patient is subject to most of the same brain, spine,  body, and musculoskeletal conditions as the non-pregnant patient (80).  In addition, abnor- malities associated with pregnancy, such as toxemia and sagittal sinus thrombosis can occur.   Furthermore, pituitary adenomas may show growth during pregnancy.  Therefore, diagnostic  imaging is frequently required with these conditions.  Because MRI used nonionizing radi- ation, it is particularly suited as an alternative to computed tomography (CT) in situations  where ultrasound is either unsatisfactory or inappropriate.</para>

These are also best  evaluated using MRI. MRI contrast agents should be reserved for patients in whom diag- nosis (i.e., metastasis) or therapy (i.e., brain tumor therapy prior to surgery) is urgently  needed (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 4</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">5</emphasis>).

Fetal sedation is no longer considered necessary to ob- tain good fetal MR images. While gross fetal motion may cause image degradation (<emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">11</emphasis>), much of the difficulty in performing fetal MRI is due to maternal respiration. Current  imaging strategies generally utilize breath-held MRI with single-shot, fast spin echo tech- niques (ssFSE) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 12</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>) along with fast gradient refocused echo or fast  spoiled gradient echo MRI techniques (110-142).

Subtle anomalies,  such as limb abnormalities are more difficult to detect, but even these are demonstrated oc- casionally with current imaging techniques.  MRI provides information that is not readily  apparent on sonography in approximately 10% of cases.  This is most often seen in exam- ination of the fetal brain but, again, with current techniques, occasionally fetal lungs, fetal  diaphragm, fetal liver, and fetal kidneys may be better visualized using MRI.</para>
      <para>It is particularly important to consider the added stress perceived by pregnant women  undergoing MRI for the evaluation of possible fetal abnormalities. Ideally, comfortable po- sitioning of pregnant patients should be individualized during the MRI examination. Noise  protection should be optimized and rapid, efficient scanning should be carefully planned  (143).</para>

      <title>PREGNANT HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN THE MRI ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <para>Pregnant healthcare workers may need to perform duties in the scanner room during  the performance of an MRI examination.  Generally, there is little or no exposure to the  time-varying and RF electromagnetic fields associated with MRI.  The main exposure of  the pregnant healthcare worker is to the powerful static magnetic field, with time and dis- tance from the magnet being the major variations. For example, a pregnant MRI technologist  might be within a static magnetic field of several hundred gauss or higher during each work- ing day for prolonged periods of time.  Although Kanal, et al. (42) reported that there is no  increase in adverse outcomes of pregnancies in MRI workers, it may be reasonable to limit  the amount of time spent by the pregnant worker within the MR system room.  Thus, the  pregnant physician or nurse anesthetist probably would be advised against monitoring the  patient from within the scanner room or inside of the bore of the MR system during image  acquisition. Particularly with field strengths of 3-Tesla or greater, MRI healthcare workers  may experience vertigo-like sensations (144), especially when passing rapidly through spa- tial gradient magnetic fields near the magnet. While no evidence for injury has been demon- strated, it is reasonable to minimize such activities during pregnancy in consideration of  taking a cautious approach to such situations.</para>
      <para>Therefore, a policy is recommended that permits a pregnant MRI technologist and other  healthcare worker to perform MRI, as well as to enter the MR system room, and attend to  the patient, regardless of the trimester of the pregnancy. Importantly, MRI technologists  and healthcare workers should not remain within the bore of the scanner during the its op- eration. This later recommendation is especially important for those healthcare workers in- volved in patient management or interventional MRI procedures, since it may be necessary  for them to be directly exposed to the scanner's electromagnetic fields at levels similar to  those used for patients. These recommendations are not based on indications of adverse ef- fects, but rather, from a conservative point of view and the fact that there are insufficient  data pertaining to the effects of the other electromagnetic fields of the MR system to support  or allow unnecessary exposures (13, 42).</para>
