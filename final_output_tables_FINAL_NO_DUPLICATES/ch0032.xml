      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>With the growth of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), large cohorts of patients and  staff members are now routinely exposed to the static, time-varying, and radiofrequency  (RF) fields integral to the imaging procedure. For the millions of MRI examinations per- formed each year, the majority are conducted on 1.5-Tesla or 3-Tesla scanners with a smaller  number of 7-Tesla scanners installed in research or clinical, academic health centers around  the world. Increasing technical advances have resulted in the magnitude of exposures to  electromagnetic fields (EMF) to steadily grow during the use of clinical MRI, which began  in the early 1980s.</para>
      <para>Many voluntary international (1-4) and national (5-7) standards or guidelines for occu- pational and public exposure to EMF are in existence and reviewed elsewhere in this text- book. In the European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) the Physical Agents  (electromagnetic fields) Directive 2013/35/EC regulates occupational exposure limits for  EMF through national laws (8). Although patient safety in MRI has always been paramount  within the MRI community (9, 10), with exposure guidelines (11-14) and operational safety  standards (1, 14-16), the EU regulations brought a renewed focus on MRI healthcare worker  exposures (17).</para>
      <para>Staff exposures mainly involve the static magnetic field and its associated spatial gra- dient magnetic field that are responsible for the projectile force acting on ferromagnetic ob- jects. The time-varying magnetic fields from the imaging gradients and the radiofrequency  (RF) excitation field are substantially confined to within the bore of the MR system and,  thus, only become significant for staff members if they remain close to or enter the bore  during the scan acquisition (17).</para>

      <title>DEFINITIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL LIMITS</title>
      <para>Biological effects of electromagnetic fields and their underlying physical and physio- logical mechanisms are described elsewhere in this textbook. In occupational exposure or  hygiene it is commonplace to consider the <emphasis role="italics">incident</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">induced</emphasis> EMFs: the former are those  generated directly from the scanner (e.g., static magnetic, B0; gradient magnetic, dB/dt; and  RF fields, B1), the latter are those generated in tissue as a consequence of the incident ex- posure (e.g., induced electric fields, current densities or specific absorption rate, SAR) and  that are considered to be responsible for acute effects, such as vertigo, metallic taste sensa- tions, peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), and tissue heating. Accurate dosimetry for both  incident and induced EMF is an essential prerequisite in occupational exposure studies.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Incident Fields </emphasis></para>
      <para>In occupational hygiene, static magnetic fields are sometimes denoted by the abbrevi- ation SMF, and time-varying magnetic fields by TVMF. The magnetic field intensity, <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>, is  indicated in units of amperes per meter (A/m). However, in MRI it is more usual to consider  magnetic induction or flux density, commonly called “magnetic field strength”, B0, meas- ured in Tesla (T). In a linear, isotropic medium the magnetic flux density <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> is:</para>
      <para>where μ0, the permeability of vacuum, has a value 4π × 10<superscript>-7</superscript> henry/m and χ is the di- mensionless magnetic susceptibility. Beyond the bore of the MR system, the fringe field of  B0 varies spatially with a gradient dB/dz in Tesla per meter (T/m). A time-weighted average  (TWA) SMF over a duration T is defined as:</para>
      <para>The gradient magnetic fields are defined as linear spatial variations in Bz:</para>
      <para>and are specified in milli-Tesla per meter (mT/m). The gradient slew rate (SR), or max- imum switching speed is defined in Tesla per meter per second (T/m/s). The rate of change  of B (dB/dt) or the step change in B (ΔB) is physiologically significant for acute sensory  effects.</para>

      <para>The RF field, B1, is measured in micro-Tesla (μT) but is also specified as H1 [Equation  (1)] and has an electric field component E1. Electric fields (E) are measured in volts per  meter (V/m).  For a plane wave in the far field, the ratio of E/H has a constant value of 337- ohms and the power density is:</para>
      <para>measured in watts per square meter (W/m<superscript>2</superscript>). The specific absorption rate (SAR) is the  RF power absorbed per unit body mass (W/kg). An SAR value may apply for the whole or  as a partial body (e.g., head or extremities) exposure. For more information please refer to  the relevant chapters in this textbook.</para>
      <para>The incident fields (B, H, and their time derivatives) are vectors and may have direc- tional components which are not utilized in the image formation process but which, never- theless, contribute to occupational exposures. For both patient and occupational exposures,  it is important to consider the magnitude of these vector fields, e.g., for B:</para>
      <para>Exposure limits are often expressed as root mean square (RMS) values. The RMS value  of a time-varying function (e.g., B1 and the imaging gradients) is:</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Occupational Exposure Standards and Limits </emphasis></para>
      <para>The numerous occupational exposure guidelines for electromagnetic fields in the fre- quency range 0-Hz to 300-GHz cover all aspects of work-related exposures, not just those  related to MRI. Most guidelines operate under two regimes: Basic Restrictions, also known  as “Exposure Limit Values” (ELV), “Exposure Reference Values” (ERV), or “Dosimetric  Reference Values” (DRL), are set to avoid short term acute adverse effects and are defined  in terms of RMS induced electric field, Ei, in tissue. As the induced fields are not directly  measurable, compliance can be demonstrated using derived Reference Levels (RL), also  known as “Dosimetric Reference Levels” (DRL), “Action Levels” (AL), “Exposure Refer- ence Levels” (ERL) or “Action Values” (AV), specified in terms of the incident fields. Some  standards include higher limits for “controlled” or “restricted” situations. These apply in  highly organized settings with appropriately trained staff and would, therefore, be applicable  in the MRI environment.</para>
      <para>For situations where an incident field limit (e.g., RL) is not exceeded, it can be assumed  that the induced field limit (e.g., BR) will not be exceeded. Compliance with a Reference  Level ensures compliance with the underlying Basic Restriction or equivalent limit. How- ever, when an incident limit is exceeded, it is necessary for the employer to establish that  the relevant induced field limit is not exceeded. This would normally entail modeling of  the induced fields. The derivation of the incident field limits is often based upon algebraic  calculations, that is, from Equations (7) to (12) using idealized body geometries with ho- mogeneous electrical properties.</para>
      <para>Within the EU and UK, Directive 2013/35/EC contains a derogation for MRI from the  limits defined in the Directive: ELVs <emphasis role="italics">may</emphasis> be exceeded for the exposures related to the in- stallation, testing, use, development, maintenance of, or research related to MRI for patients  in the health sector, subject to a number of conditions. EU Directive limits are based upon  current International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) values.</para>
      <para>MR system manufacturers follow the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)  standard 60601-2-33 that includes limits for occupational exposure specifically for MRI  workers (1). Other chapters in this textbook review patient exposure guidelines in greater  detail.</para>

      <title>STUDIES OF INCIDENT FIELDS</title>
      <para>Studies of occupational exposures have utilized a number of approaches. The most di- rect is to issue magnetic dosimeters to staff members and to record their exposures to static  and time-varying magnetic fields during the working day (24-30). The second approach is  to record the movements of staff members during real activities and correlate these with  field maps, either from the manufacturers’ data sheets, theoretical calculations, or environ- mental electromagnetic field (EMF) measurements (31-32). The third approach is to simu- late staff member activities while measuring the magnetic field exposure. This has the  advantage of being predictive, such that worst-case movements can be investigated and  peak exposures may be estimated (33-37). In a more generalized approach to occupational  exposure in MRI, one can identify specific tasks and their temporal and magnitude expo- sures to formulate a Job Evaluation Matrix (38). This can then be used predictively to esti- mate occupational exposures for different staff groups over a prolonged period of time.</para>

      <para>Personal magnetic dosimeters utilize a combination of three-axis Hall effect probes (B)  and search coils (dB/dt), sometimes in conjunction with an integrator to give B readings.  <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis> shows typical readings of instantaneous B and dB/dt over a whole shift on a 1.5- T clinical system. <emphasis role="bold">Table 4</emphasis> summarizes the results from various studies.

The induced electric field and current density scaled with B0 (<emphasis role="bold">Fig-</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">ure 9</emphasis>). The worst-case situations associated with these occurred for motion parallel to the  z-axis towards the magnet. The ICNIRP 1-Hz Basic Restrictions was exceeded in the spine  and brain for 4-T and 7-T, and the IEEE basic restriction for brain was exceeded in every  case. A further study of bending towards high field strength scanners revealed similar Ei in  CSF with 0.16 to 0.56-V/m in the brain but much less in the spine (44).</para>
      <para>In the study of Capstick, et al.

      <para>Crozier, et al. (45) considered a 1-kHz trapezoidal gradient similar to that used in an  EPI sequence normalized to 1-mT/m with a 0.1-ms rise time. Care is required when scaling  up to higher levels because the full gradient strength assumed in this study of 40-mT/m is  not typical for most clinical scans and would result in an unrealistically high slew rate.  However, assuming this as a worst-case, peak Ei greater than 2.2-V/m (Jmax = 815-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript>)  in the spinal cord was calculated on axis close to the end of the coil for combined Gx, Gy  and Gz. For a more realistic gradient amplitude of 20-mT/m the ICNIRP head central nerv- ous tissues Basic Restriction was only exceeded within 0.01-m of the end of the coil. How- ever, other tissues also exceeded tissue limits: skin up to 0.4-m, fat 0.3-m, muscle 0.25-m  and heart 0.1-m.</para>
      <para>In a more realistically representative model, with the subject positioned 0.35-m off- axis laterally, 0.19-m from the end of the coil and exposed to a Gz of 10-mT/m at 1-kHz,  Li, et al.

      <para>The European study (31, 47) calculated induced current densities of 60-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript> RMS  for any tissue and 10-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript> RMS for neural tissue for real clinical tasks such as performing  tactile fMRI and general anesthesia monitoring near closed bore 1.5- and 3-T scanners. The  maximum Ei of 1.05-V/m RMS from the x-gradient occurred in the skin of the head (<emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">10</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>The exposure to the interventional radiologist within the bore of a 1-T open MR system  (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11</emphasis>) produced up to 220-mA/m<superscript>2</superscript> RMS averaged over 1-cm<superscript>2</superscript> in any tissue, with 140-  mA/m<superscript>2</superscript> RMS in neural tissue. The peak Ei was 0.74-V/m RMS in the skin of the head. As  tissue conductivities vary considerably the maximum Ji does not necessarily coincide with  the maximum Ei, nevertheless, these simulations suggest compliance with both the IEEE  and ICNIRP Basic Restrictions.</para>

(49) reported incidences of vertigo  amongst Netherlands MR workers at 1.5, 3, and 7T as 3.5%, 7.6%, and 22.6%, and with  nausea incidences of 1.2, 1.5 and 3.2%. Minor changes in hearing threshold (1-5 decibels)  amongst MRI factory workers who have undergone up to 60 scans as volunteers has been  reported (50), but were only significant for the right ear. Cognitive testing on MR system  engineers showed that the speed of movement for particular actions correlated with the oc- currence of sensory effects (51). A study of 538 workers in a MRI manufacturing facility  reported a cautious possible link of prolonged cumulative exposure to SMF with hyperten- sion; however, dosimetry data was unavailable and the conclusions were tentative (52).  These results warrant further research.</para>

      <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>Outside the bore of the MR system, exposure from the imaging gradients and RF is  generally well below most incident and induced field limits. Careful consideration needs  to be given to movement around high field strength magnets for MR systems. Most activities  that occur during clinical MRI will only result in significant occupational exposure in as- sociation with the static field. Special cases of particular importance include pregnant staff  members, and those who must remain close to the bore of the MR system during scanning  (e.g., anesthesiologists, intervention radiologists, nurses and researchers).</para>
      <para>Time-averaged static field exposures to clinical staff are relatively low, in the region of  5- to 7-mT, with peak static magnetic field exposures of about 40% of B0. These figures  may be higher for engineering staff and researchers. Dosimetric surveys of dB/dt for clinical  and research staff indicate that they receive peak dB/dt of around 1- to 3-T/s arising from  movement in the static magnetic field gradient.</para>
      <para>For higher static magnetic field strengths, induced fields due to movement may exceed  those generated by the gradients and, because of the lower limits in the low frequency range,  routine activity around scanners will frequently result in the exceeding of one or more limits.  For high field strength MR systems, the occurrence of sensory effects (e.g., nausea, vertigo,  metallic taste, etc.) is evidence that limits are being exceeded. These induced field exposures  can be minimized through staff training and appropriate control measures, such as moving  slowly.</para>
      <para>Definitive proof that EMF exposures associated with MRI to staff members are bio- logically safe remains elusive, although there is no evidence to the contrary. The occurrence  of some acute effects confirms the validity and importance of occupational exposure limits,  staff education and training, and the conducting of appropriate risk assessments relating to  EMF exposure. Whether national regulatory requirements intensify or reduce, occupational  exposure is a topic that the MR community needs to continually review.</para>
