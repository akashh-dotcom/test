      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>During the operation of the magnetic resonance (MR) system, various types of acoustic  noises are produced. The problems associated with acoustic noise for patients and healthcare  workers are wide ranging, from simple annoyance and difficulties in verbal communication  between staff and patients, to heightened anxiety or discomfort, and even potentially per- manent hearing impairment (1-9). Acoustic noise may pose a particular problem for specific  patient groups that may be at increased risk. For example, patients with head injuries or  psychiatric disorders, the elderly, young children, and infants may be confused or suffer  from heightened anxiety during MRI procedures (2). Patients taking medications may ex- perience increased hearing sensitivity (3). Additionally, neonates with immature anatomical  development may be at increased risk for adverse effects associated with acoustic noise.  For example, significant fluctuations in vital signs of newborns have been reported during  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, which may partly be attributable to  acoustic noise (4). High levels of acoustic noise may also impact the quality of the MRI  procedure by causing distress in the patient.</para>
      <para>Due to several of the issues listed above and the more specific issues discussed below,  acoustic noise levels also pose a significant problem for one particular area of MRI: the in- creasing amount of research in functional MRI (fMRI) studies of brain activation. Typically,  patients and volunteer subjects will be provided earplugs to wear during fMRI. However,  these may impair vocal communication with staff members and also the perception of study  stimuli. The acoustic noise associated with fMRI procedures can often be comparatively  loud, as the use of fast acquisition sequences (e.g., echo planar imaging, EPI) are normally  used. Acoustic noise can often lead to motion-related artifacts and degraded image quality.  Furthermore, acoustic noise has been reported to interfere with auditory functional studies,</para>
      <para>and more broadly, with cross modal neural activity (10-14). A summary of the potential is- sues related to the acoustic noise that is associated with fMRI is shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>.</para>

One area of particular interest  is the study of auditory and language function (13). In this work, the response to pure tone  stimuli is analyzed. Therefore, any background levels of unwanted or uncontrolled acoustic  noise can interfere with the delivery of these sound stimuli and affect experimental integrity.  Solutions specific to controlling acoustic noise exposure during fMRI are generally se- quence-related and a full discussion of this topic is presented later in this chapter.</para>
      <para>Acoustic noise levels during echo planar imaging have been reported to significantly  increase pure tone hearing thresholds in the optimal frequency hearing range (0- to 8-kHz)  (15). These effects vary across the frequency range and the threshold changes depend on  the characteristics of the sequence-generated acoustic noise. It may be possible to take into  account, or adjust for, the MR system-induced auditory activation by using a control series</para>

      <para>The problem of acoustic noise may also have implications for the operational costs of  an MRI facility. Notably, there can be a potential decrease in image quality due to patient  movement resulting from the patient being startled or uncomfortable in association with  acoustic noise. This may add to the need to repeat scans or to interrupt studies that can ad- versely impact the efficiency of an MRI facility. For all the above reasons, it is important  that the MRI-related acoustic noise is quantified and characterized as part of a safety and  quality assurance program. Furthermore, any exposure to acoustic noise that is excessive  must be controlled or alleviated.</para>
      <para>Acoustic noise experienced during routine clinical MRI examinations can generally be  confined to levels within permissible limits with relatively little effort by using passive  hearing protection (e.g., disposable earplugs). Several more sophisticated methods are also  under investigation by researchers, offering more comprehensive and elegant solutions with- out the disadvantages of passive methods. This chapter will discuss acoustic noise and hear- ing, describe the common characteristics of MRI-related acoustic noise, explain the current  permissible levels for acoustic noise, and present the main methods used for measurement  and control of this potential hazard.</para>

      <title>ACOUSTIC NOISE AND HEARING</title>
      <para>The ear is a highly sensitive wide-band receiver, with the typical frequency range of 2- Hz to 20-kHz for normal hearing (17). The arrival of sound waves at the ear sets up a fluc- tuating pressure just outside the entrance to the external auditory canal. These fluctuations  are then transmitted as pressure waves along the auditory canal. Normally under slight ten- sion, the eardrum, or tympanic membrane, is physically moved by these pressure waves.</para>
      <para>On the other side of the membrane, three tiny bones known as the ossicles, transmit  this movement across the middle ear cavity to another membrane, the oval window, which  forms the end of the spiral-shaped, fluid-filled cochlea. The vibration of the membrane and  hair cells in the cochlea is transformed, via the auditory nerve, to give a sense of hearing.  <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> shows the main components of the hearing mechanism.</para>
      <para>At high sound intensities, the muscles that control the motion of the ossicles alter their  tension creating the acoustic reflex to protect the ear from damage. However, this reflex  occurs approximately 0.5-milliseconds after the insult, such that the ear is particularly vul- nerable to impact noise of high intensity. The human ear does not tend to discern sound  powers in absolute terms, but assesses how much greater one power is than another. Re- flecting the very wide range of powers that exist, the logarithmic decibel scale, dB, is used  when referring to sound power.</para>
      <para>The sound level that is measured depends not only on the source, but also the environ- ment (e.g., the proximity of surfaces that may reflect sound). Thus, sound levels are usually  quoted in terms of sound pressure level (SPL), which accounts for the environment of the  measurement. <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> displays a range of sound pressure levels for some typical sources  of acoustic noise.</para>

      <para>The sensitivity of the ear is also frequency dependent, as shown is <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> (18). Peak  hearing sensitivity occurs in the region of 4-kHz. This is also the region where potential  maximum hearing loss will occur, with damage spreading into neighboring frequencies.  Since the ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies, measured data may be weighted  using the dBA measurement or “A-weighted” scale, which biases the meter to respond sim- ilarly to the human ear. The quality, or efficiency of hearing, is defined by the audible thresh- old, which is the SPL at which one can just begin to detect a sound. This is normally defined  as 0 (zero)-dB.</para>
      <para>Acoustic noise is defined in terms of frequency spectrum (measured and indicated in  Hz), intensity (indicated in decibels or dB), and duration (or time). Additionally, noise may  be steady state, intermittent, impulsive, or explosive. Time-varying noise is reported in  terms of Leq, which is defined as the continuous SPL that contains the same sound energy  as the time-varying sound over the measurement period. This can be considered as the av- erage noise level. Stimulation of the ear by acoustic noise has three potential effects: 1)  Adaptation, 2) Temporary threshold shift (TTS) (post-stimulation fatigue), and 3) Permanent  threshold shift (PTS) (permanent impairment).</para>
      <para>In hearing adaption, loud sounds cause a small muscle attached to one of the bones of  the inner ear to contract. This attenuates the transmission of sound vibration to the inner  ear, which is a protective mechanism that does not work well for short duration, very intense  sounds. Transient hearing loss may occur following loud noise (&gt;100-dBA), resulting in a  temporary threshold shift (i.e., a shift in audible threshold). With a TTS, subjects may ex- perience a dulling in hearing at the end of the noise and tinnitus in some cases. Recovery  typically occurs quickly (1). However, full recovery can take up to several weeks if the  noise insult is particularly severe. Intense impulsive noises at 650-Hz with cut-offs at 300-  and 1-kHz have also been shown to generate substantial TTS (19). Noise above 100-dBA  can cause disturbances of the microcirculation in the cortical organ and short impulsive  noise at levels of 120- to 130-dBA can lead to mechanical damage in this organ.</para>
      <para>If the noise is sufficiently severe, this may result in a permanent threshold shift at spe- cific frequencies (20, 21). Hearing damage from steady-state noise usually takes the form</para>

      <para>of inner ear damage. That is, destruction of the hair cells that convert acoustic energy to  electrical impulses transmitted via the nervous system to the brain. These cells cannot re- generate and, therefore, the damage is irreversible. This damage is similar to age-related  hearing loss (presbycusis) in that it progresses slowly, with the affected hearing threshold  rising. Mean hearing loss is a function of noise frequency and duration (20). Permanent  damage is primarily a risk for prolonged daily exposure to loud (&gt;85-dB) occupational noise  or short impulsive noise around 140-dB. Excessive noise is known to be one of the most  common causes of hearing loss (20). The risk of hearing damage increases with the noise  level, duration of the noise, the number of exposures to the noise, and the susceptibility of  the individual (20, 21). Along with sensitive groups, children have a lower threshold for  hearing damage and, therefore, restricting exposure levels to around 120-dB or lower is  recommended (22). It is generally accepted that exposure to noise levels up to a maximum  of 75-dBA will not result in PTS irrespective of the duration of exposure (22). Over the  years, several instances of noise-related incidents have been reported in the literature (see  below).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Noise That Is Not Perceived By the Ear Canal </emphasis></para>
      <para>The ear canal is not the only path for transmission of sound to the cochlea. Sound may  be conducted via air and bone conduction, through the ear canal, head, and body. Protection  of the ear canal via earplugs will, thus, never lead to silence, due to the remaining sound  conduction via the other paths. Sound can be conducted directly to the cochlea, to the middle  ear and then to the cochlea, or through the walls of the middle ear, along the ear canal to  the middle ear, and then to the cochlea (23). When the ear canal is relatively unprotected,  this path will be the dominant one for perception of sound. However, as noise is attenuated  along the ear canal, the other paths become increasingly dominant and further hearing pro- tection measures will have little effect on the residual noise. Using a helmet in addition to  conventional earplugs and “defenders”, Ravicz and Melcher, (24) studied the impact of iso- lating the head and ear canal from sound. Isolating the head enabled the original noise at- tenuation of 39- to 41-dB to increase to 55- to 63-dB.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Prenatal and Neonatal Hearing and Acoustic Noise </emphasis></para>
      <para>By around the twentieth week of gestation, the outer, middle, and inner ear of the fetus  appear to be fully formed. The fetus can then begin to detect sounds (25). Indeed, Hepper  and Shahidullah, (26) reported that the responsiveness of the fetus to audio stimuli occurs  between 19 to 35 weeks, with initial responses being to sounds at low frequencies. They  measured an initial response at 20 weeks to a 500-Hz pure tone. As the pregnancy pro- gressed, there was a significant reduction (20- to 30-dB) in the intensity of sound required  to elicit a response. Studies report that maternal tissues and fluid surrounding the fetal head  act as efficient low-pass filters for sound (27-31).</para>
      <para>Acoustic noise is known to be a concern for neonates who generally have sensitive  hearing. Aside from artifacts introduced from involuntary motion related to startle reflexes,  the noise can provoke adverse responses such as autonomic instability (32-36). Neonatal  intensive care unit guidelines often suggest minimizing the risk of physiological stress by  adhering to a limit for exposure to acoustic noise (see below ).</para>

      <title>CHARACTERISTICS OF MRI-RELATED ACOUSTIC NOISE</title>
      <para>Early measurements of MRI-related acoustic noise offered little more than an assess- ment of intensity levels. Over time, researchers began to investigate the noise in more detail  and to characterize it in terms of frequency components, variability with pulse sequences,  and the contribution of individual gradients.</para>
      <para>The gradient magnetic field of the MR system is the primary source of acoustic noise  associated with MRI. This noise occurs during the rapid alterations of currents within the  gradient coils. These currents, in the presence of the strong static magnetic field of the MR  system, produce significant (Lorentz) forces that act upon the gradient coils. From basic  physics, a conductor element dl carrying a current <emphasis role="bold">I</emphasis> = I i placed into a magnetic uniform  field <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> = B k, will experience a Lorentz force <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis> per unit length given by,</para>
      <para>where θ is the angle between the conductor and the field direction and <emphasis role="italics">i</emphasis>  <emphasis role="italics">j</emphasis>  <emphasis role="italics">k</emphasis> are unit  vectors along the conductor, force, and magnetic field direction, respectively. Therefore,  simplistically we would expect acoustic noise to be theoretically linear with the static mag- netic field of the MR system (37). In fact, Moelker, et al. (38) reported on a measured non- linearity, with noise levels measured at high field being lower than that expected with a  linear dependence The noise from these mechanical forces is then transferred into airborne  acoustic noise or sound pressure, due to an acoustic noise transfer function (38).</para>
      <para>Acoustic noise, manifested as loud tapping, knocking, and other sounds is produced  when the forces cause motion or vibration of the gradient coils as they impact against their  mountings, which then also flex and vibrate. All structures have intrinsic resonance fre- quencies and these frequencies have their own modal shapes. In fact, there are several path- ways of noise generation associated with MRI (40).</para>
      <para>If the gradient coil modal shape due to deformation corresponds to the shape of the ex- citing Lorentz force distribution, then large gradient coil displacements occur and result in  the generation of significant acoustic noise. Current designs of gradient coils are often man- ufactured to have a high stiffness, which minimizes coil motion and, thus, the structural  resonances of the coils.</para>
      <para>Various factors have been shown to affect the acoustic noise generated during MRI, in- cluding the strength of the static magnetic field (mentioned above) and alteration of the gra- dient output (i.e., rise time and amplitude). Interestingly, Price, et al. (39) reported that there  is greater impact on acoustic noise levels generated from imaging parameters than the field  strength. Acoustic noise is enhanced by decreases in section thickness, field of view, repe- tition time, and echo time. The physical features of the MR system and its environment as  well as the material and construction of the gradient coils and support structures also affect  the transmission of the acoustic noise and its perception by the patient and MR system op- erators.</para>

      <para>Gradient magnetic field-induced noise levels have been measured during a variety of  pulse sequences for clinical and research MR systems with static magnetic field strengths  ranging from 0.35- to 4-T, with acoustic noise levels of over 130-dB reported (39-54). Ob- viously, since the gradient magnetic field is primarily responsible for acoustic noise, the  ability of the MR system to produce noise is dependent upon the specifications for the gra- dients (amplitudes and slew rates) as well as the types of imaging parameters that are avail- able on the scanner.</para>
      <para>Not surprisingly, fast gradient echo pulse sequences produce, comparatively, louder  noise during MRI than spin echo sequences. Three-dimensional and diffusion MR pulse se- quences, where multiple gradients are applied simultaneously, are among the loudest. Many  studies have focused on assessing the maximum MR system acoustic noise, which is usually  related to using EPI methods, due to the associated high gradient performance inherent in  these ultrafast sequences. Echo planar sequences, in collecting a complete image in one ra- diofrequency (RF) excitation of the spin system, require extremely fast gradient switching  times and high gradient amplitudes. The increased interest in diffusion imaging and fMRI  has meant a heightened interest in using high field strength MR systems (i.e., mostly 3-, 4- , and 7-T) with fast gradient capability (switching rates and high amplitudes) to acquire  multi-slice, EPI images of high quality (see below for more on high field issues).</para>
      <para>Shellock, et al. (43) reported relatively high levels of acoustic noise, up to 102- to 103- dBA on the two 1.5-T MR systems tested when running EPI sequences with parameters se- lected to represent a “worst-case” protocol. Nevertheless, these acoustic noise levels were  within current permissible limits for MR systems. Miyati, et al. (50) conducted an extensive  survey of EPI sequences performed on eleven MR systems. The results of the sound level  measurements reported to be at levels within permissible limits.</para>
      <para>Price, et al. (39) surveyed fifteen MR scanners, with static magnetic field strengths from  0.2-T to 3-T, reporting worst case noise levels in the range 82.5- to 118.3-dBA, but for two- dimensional MRI techniques, only. They reported the lowest noise levels for the lowest  static field strength scanner and the highest noise recorded for the highest field strength  scanner, but noted low levels of acoustic noise recorded for a 1.5-T scanner fitted with vac- uum-encased gradient coils. Higher acoustic noise levels have been reported by Ravicz, et  al. (52) (up to 138-dB for 3-T) and More, et al. (53) (130-dB for 4-T).</para>
      <para>Foster, et al. (54) reported EPI-related acoustic noise levels of 123- to 132-dBA for a  3-T research scanner. Since EPI sequences are significantly shorter in duration than con- ventional sequences, in terms of acoustic noise exposure, higher sound exposure levels are  possible for the shorter times involved. However, these levels, when converted to eight hour  equivalent values (Leq = 108-dBA), are higher than the limits for occupational acoustic  noise exposure used in the United Kingdom (UK) and in the United States (U.S.). Therefore,  hearing protection must be used for patients undergoing MRI procedures under these cir- cumstances. Conventional EPI sequences generally comprise constant readout gradients  and a train of very short high level trapisoidal phase encode gradient ‘blips’. It is not sur- prising that the blipped gradient contributes the larger proportion of the sequence-related  acoustic noise (55). As the gradient blips are at higher frequency than the readout gradient,  the resultant acoustic noise will have a larger proportion of high frequencies.</para>

      <para>Measurements of sound pressure levels offer a limited amount of information with re- gard to the quality of the noise and its impact on hearing. In addition to measurements of  noise level, several groups have recorded and analyzed the acoustic noise. Similar noise  levels and characteristics are found when comparing different clinical MR systems. Fre- quency analysis of the noise shows that noise is pseudo-periodic, with variations in the de- gree of periodicity depending on the pulse sequence used and the vibrational characteristics  of the gradient coils (46).</para>
      <para>For conventional pulse sequences used for MRI, peak noise levels are found at the low  frequency region of the spectra. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis> shows an example of the octave band spectra for  a 1.0-T and 1.5-T MR systems (44, 45). Spectral peaks in the sound levels were found in  the range of 0.2- to 1.5-kHz (22). Cho, et al. (48) have also reported that pre-scan noise  generated high levels (100-dB, C-weighted scale) across a wide spectral range up to 4-kHz  with peaks around 2.4-kHz.</para>
      <para>More, et al. (53) noted that repetition time (TR) had a minimal impact on overall SPL,  while increasing the echo time (TE) increased attenuation, in agreement with Price, et al.  (39). Unlike the use of conventional sequences, EPI-related sound levels have been reported  to contain a larger fraction of high frequency noise (around 4-kHz) with most noise com- prising the fundamental frequency and harmonics in the frequency range of 0.5- to 4-kHz  (52). For EPI sequences, More, et al. (53) also noted considerable non-harmonic noise flank- ing the harmonics. The acoustic noise was also noted to contain a higher proportion of broad  frequency spectrum noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). For their pulse sequence, More, et al. (53) found the  even harmonics to be associated with the phase-encoding gradient, the frequency encoding  gradient generated the odd harmonics and non-harmonic acoustic noise, while the slice-se- lective gradients generated the broad spectrum noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>).</para>

      <para>In addition to the dependence on pulse sequence parameters, MR system hardware and  construction, acoustic noise is dependent on the immediate environment. Spatially, the  acoustic noise will vary along the bore of the scanner. However, how it varies will depend  on the MR system’s structure and design. Price, et al. (39) presents acoustic noise measure- ments across a range of scanner geometries and designs, systems ranging from static mag- netic field strengths of 0.2 to 3-T. Reports providing values of acoustic noise tend to disagree  because of differences related to whether the maximum acoustic noise levels were measured  at the isocenter of the bore or not (39, 47, 49). The noise distributions along radial and axial  directions are also likely to be asymmetric, due to standing wave effects in the scanner’s  bore (53).</para>
      <para>Furthermore, noise levels have been found to vary by as much as 10-dB as a function  of the patient’s position inside the MR system (47) such that the presence and size of the  patient affects the level of acoustic noise. For example, an increase of 1- to 3-dB has been  measured with a patient present inside of the MR system (47), which may be due to pressure  doubling (i.e., the increase in sound pressure close to a solid object, caused when sound  waves reflect and undergo in-phase enhancement).</para>

      <para>Technical developments enable a continuing increase in available research and clinical  static magnetic field strengths, with scanners operating at 7-T or above typically referred  to as ultra-high-field (UHF) systems. Interestingly, research is on-going for possible human  scanning using MR systems operating up to 20-T (56). As mentioned above, knowing that  there is a strong (non-linear) dependence between the acoustic noise levels that are generated  and the strength of the static magnetic field (38), we might expect acoustic noise levels to</para>

      <para>increase significantly for UHF scanners. When increasing the static magnetic field strength  from 1.5-T to 11.7-T, a simple linear model predicts an increase in the acoustic noise level  by approximately 22-dB. But, in fact, in line with earlier results (38), this has not been ob- served in practice (57). Applying a logarithmic scale, changing from 7-T to 20-T, a 9-dB  increase in acoustic noise level would be predicted. However, building in additional effects  such as Lorentz damping (58), results in increases in acoustic noise levels that are actually  lower than expected, and in some cases very similar to reported noise levels at 3-T (59-60).</para>
      <para>Notably, one practical difference (61) is that head coils at 7-T are generally more tightly  fitting that those used at 3-T because they are comprise of a multi-channel insert. This makes  using double passive hearing protection (earplugs and earmuffs) impractical and, thus, the  acoustic noise is only attenuated by earplugs alone.</para>
      <para>Presently, findings obtained at 7-T remain sparse (61-64). Costagli, et al. (62) reported  acoustic noise levels of 89.9 -/+ 0.7-dBA for conventional T1-weighted, fast spoiled gradient  recalled (FSPGR) pulse sequences at 7-T. Speck, et al. (64) reported acoustic noise levels  of 101-dBA for a standard EPI sequence, also at 7-T. Importantly, these levels are consid- erably lower than early measurements recorded on 3- and 4-T scanners.

(67) developed the simulation of a cylindrical whole-body  gradient coil housed in a 4-T MR scanner and driven by triangular and trapezoidal gradient  pulses. The simulation was based on finite element (FE) analysis. Acoustic frequency re- sponses predicted by the simulation were compared to experimental measures, showing  broad agreement. Further reports investigated experiments and simulation of purpose-built  gradient coils, including vibration and acoustic noise measurements (68, 69). In their finite  element model, Lorentz forces were used as the system load, with acoustic radiation mod- eled using the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz equation. These researchers performed the analysis for  a small head geometry gradient coil and achieved reasonable agreement of theory and ex- periment (68, 69).</para>
      <para>Further work in this field has been conducted by Kuijpers, et al. (75), who created a  mathematical model of acoustic noise radiation in finite ducts. Shao and Mechefske (70)  reported on the development of a predictive analytical model, allowing for inclusion of  acoustic liners inside the gradient coil inner wall. They also compared analytic and boundary  element models. The analytical model was comparative in terms of results, but computa- tionally more efficient. Additional papers investigated the dynamic behavior of gradient  coils of varying wall thickness (71-74) and by applying shell theory (76). Investigators have  also investigated the coupling of gradient coils to other associated structures, reporting on  structural analyses (77). Recently (and mentioned above), Winkler, et al.

      <title>ACOUSTIC NOISE LEVELS AND PERMISSIBLE LIMITS</title>
      <para>Several of the available guidance documents discussed below adopt a similar frame- work, referring back to the same source for action levels and permissible limits. Much of  the international guidance is based on occupational exposure limits that assume chronic ex- posures. These are not entirely satisfactory for application to patient exposures associated  with MRI, which can be short but with potentially intense noise, causing discomfort. When  time-averaged, these types of exposures can fall below action levels but still present a haz- ard. For normal individuals, the typical threshold for discomfort related to acoustic noise is  approximately 120-dB in the 1- to 5-kHz range (78), however, those with particular sensi- tivity can experience discomfort at much lower acoustic noise levels (79).</para>
      <para>For acoustic noise exposure involving <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">staff members</emphasis></emphasis>, the current UK occupational  guidelines are based on the Control of Noise at Work legislation, published in 2005 (80).  This document sets out the responsibilities of the employer and makes a number of recom- mendations based on a small set of action levels. Acoustic noise is graded to that which is  below 80-dBA, a lower action level at 80-dBA daily or weekly exposure (peak 135-dBC),  and upper action level at 85-dBA daily or weekly exposure (peak 135-dBC). It should be  noted that values for lower and upper action levels have been reduced by 5-dBA, compared  to previous Noise at Work action levels published in 1989. This document also recommends  that hearing protection should be available for all staff members, and that its use be manda- tory for noise above the upper action level. For MRI healthcare workers, there is generally  little need to be in the MR system room during scanning. Because the acoustic noise levels  that exist outside the scanner’s bore are relatively low, the risks are similarly low.</para>

      <para>The management of exposure to acoustic noise for the <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">general public</emphasis></emphasis> is covered by the  Management of Health and Safety at Work (1999) (81), but, since the general public does  not have access to the controlled area or MR system room, again, the risks are low. European  guidance is published as directive 2013/35/EU (82) and has similar limits and action levels  to those in the UK.</para>
      <para>In the United States (U.S.), occupational limits are mandated by the Occupational Safety  and Health Authority (OSHA) (83) and have also been adopted by the Food and Drug Ad- ministration (FDA) (84). OSHA guidance is geared towards traditional ‘heavy’ industries  where there are very noisy environments and medium-to-high risk to hearing. Their list of  affected industries does not include MRI/Healthcare. Now somewhat outdated, the OSHA  guidelines apply to a slightly raised action level of 90-dBA (daily or eight-hour average) in  line with the older UK guidance (85).</para>
      <para>Current UK guidance on noise exposure limits for MRI <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">patients and volunteer subjects</emphasis></emphasis>  (including staff members) is presented in the MHRA guidelines (86). For patients and vol- unteer subjects, it suggests hearing protection should always be offered unless noise levels  are proven to be below 80-dBA. Hearing protection should reduce levels at the ear to below  85-dBA. The recommended action levels are based on the noise at work regulations (72)  and are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis>. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Pro- tection (ICNIRP) (87, 88) notes the range of guidance from the International Electrotech- nical Commission (IEC) (89), but accepts the need for a conservative approach to protect  vulnerable patient groups, also recommending the MHRA action levels. The MHRA docu- ment shows the relationship between the acoustic noise level and time necessary to reach  the daily action level (86) (<emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis>). Recommendations for acoustic noise and hearing pro- tection are, as follows (86):</para>

      <para>In the U.S., various patient exposure guidelines related to the MRI environment were  initially recommended in a document issued by the American College of Radiology in 2002  (90) and this was updated in 2013 (91). The ACR document makes little mention of the  risks associated with acoustic noise, however, it does recommend that all patients should  be offered hearing protection and that this is mandatory for those undergoing MRI proce- dures using research pulse sequences.</para>
      <para>While the acoustic noise levels suggested for patients exposed during MRI examinations  on an infrequent and short-term temporal basis are considered to be highly conservative,  they may not be appropriate for individuals with underlying health problems who may be  sensitive to noise at certain levels or at particular frequencies.</para>
      <para>Overall, the acoustic noise produced during MRI on a modern-day scanner should rep- resent a minimal risk to patients if good quality hearing protection is used. However, the  possibility exists that substantial gradient magnetic field-induced noise may represent a  heightened risk in certain patients who are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects  of loud noises or for those with poorly fitting hearing protection. In fact, there have been  unconfirmed claims of permanent hearing loss associated with MRI examinations (9).  Therefore, vigilance and care is essential when controlling noise levels associated with MR  procedures.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Limits During Pregnancy and Neonatal Imaging </emphasis></para>
      <para>Due to lack of data and a full understanding of response, UK guidance (86) suggests a  cautious approach to scanning the fetus and pregnant patients. Scanning during the first  trimester is discouraged unless justified by a critical risk assessment. Because acoustic noise  is known to be a concern for neonates who have sensitive hearing, neonatal intensive care  unit (NICU) guidelines suggest minimizing the risk of physiological stress by adhering to  a limit for noise exposure to 65-dBA (92).</para>
      <para>Fetal MRI has become increasingly important, particularly in diagnosis of fetal abnor- malities and for the management of the mother. Although discouraged, if necessary MRI  procedures may be performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. In a survey conducted  by De Wilde, et al. (93), 83% of the clinics that responded suggested that they would scan  patients during the first trimester in cases of clinical need. While the mother may wear hear- ing protection, the fetus is protected only by the attenuation provided by the intra-uterine  fluid and the maternal abdomen. Thus acoustic noise has the ability to impact the fetus (94).  To minimize motion-related artifacts, fast imaging techniques are required for fetal MRI  examinations, which results in the potential for exposures to comparatively high levels of  acoustic noise. Glover, et al. (95) investigated acoustic noise absorption through the ab-</para>

      <para>domen using a hydrophone in the stomach of a (male) volunteer. For scans performed at  0.5-T, these researchers reported a reduction of approximately 30-dB in acoustic noise lev- els. However, this study was a very limited approximation to scanning a pregnant patient  and the associated sound absorption. The strength of the static magnetic field of the MR  system, which directly affects acoustic noise levels generated, was also low (0.5-T) com- pared to the majority of clinical scanners in current use. Certain research has reported high  frequency hearing loss, shortened gestation, and decreased birth weight following exposure  to high levels of acoustic noise (&gt;99-dBA) (96).</para>
      <para>To investigate this particular safety issue, there have been a number of follow-up studies  (97-106). For example, Reeves, et al. (97) investigated the rates of cochlear impairment for  a cohort of second and third trimester neonates who had been exposed to acoustic noise  during 1.5-T MRI examinations. Their data showed no association between exposure to  noise and an increased risk of hearing impairment. General guidelines for managing expo- sure to acoustic noise produced by the United Kingdom (UK), Medicines and Healthcare  products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (86) and based on evidence in several reports (98- 100) suggest that the data on the effects of noise on the health of the fetus is inconclusive.</para>
      <para>Bouissant-Kobar, et al. (101) followed-up (i.e., at approximately 24 months) on a cohort  of 72 pre-school children scanned at 1.5-T during their mothers’ pregnancies (mean gesta- tional age at scanning, 30 weeks). All children were born at term and achieved age-appro- priate scores in the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS) tests. In addition, all study  subjects passed their new-born otoacoustic tests and demonstrated normal hearing at pre- school age. These findings confirmed a lack of MRI-related impact on functional outcomes  or hearing impairment at pre-school age. De vita, et al. (102) and Jaimes, et al. (103) inves- tigated the effects of higher field strength scanning on pre-terms (4.7-T and 3-T, respectiv).  Both groups noted no increase in risks in moving to a higher field strength MR system.  Clements, et al. (104) report similar normal findings, in this case for a smaller cohort (20  cases) whose mothers had been exposed to echo planar imaging (EPI) at 0.5-T four times  between 20 weeks and term. Thus, the current data appears to provide general reassurance  in that there is low risk present when applying MRI in prenatal and neonatal patients (101- 106). An optimized solution for neonatal imaging with clear benefits was reported by Tkach,  et al. (107, 108). This group scanned 15 non-sedated neonates in an adapted small-bore (di- ameter 22- cm) 1.5 -T orthopedic MR system. Although the scanner has approximately  twice the gradient strength (70-mT/m) and slew rate (300-mT/m/s) of conventional full- size MR systems, the gradient coil was smaller and shorter, leading to lower levels of  acoustic noise or equivalent pulse sequences (107). Using specifically designed hearing  protection,, high quality images were obtained for and all MRI examinations that were com- pleted successfully, suggesting minimal impact of the acoustic noise. Of further note is that  De Vita, et al. (102) reported successful imaging of nine ventilated neonates at 4.7-T without  any acute adverse effects.</para>
      <para>Overall, the use of a combination of hearing protection (e.g., earplugs and earmuffs or  headphones) and the additional attenuation of having the neonate placed inside the transmit  RF coil, mean that the acoustic noise at the ear is likely to be lower for neonates than for  adults, which may explain why no adverse effects have been reported, to date.

      <para>As mentioned above, short-term exposure to intense noise (&gt;100-dBA) can induce a  temporary shift in the hearing threshold. Brummett, et al. (1) reported temporary shifts in  hearing thresholds in 43% of the patients scanned without hearing protection or with im- properly fitted earplugs. Normal hearing returned after 15-minutes. Notably, noise levels  during scanning were not measured as part of their study. However, Hurwitz, et al. (42)  made measurements using the same scanner, reporting values for gradient echo sequences  (likely to be some of the loudest sequences on this system) of around 93-dBA. Of the 14  patients scanned without hearing protection in their study, six suffered TTS with threshold  loss greater than 15-dB. For those using hearing protection, only one experienced a TTS. It  should be noted that these data were associated with scans performed on a comparatively  low field strength MR system (0.35-T). A study by Wagner, et al. (109), found conflicting  results.</para>
      <para>Ulmer, et al. (16) measured changes in pure tone thresholds in volunteer subjects wear- ing hearing protection exposed to EPI pulse sequences. Intense impulse noise at 0.65-kHz  with cut-offs at 0.3-kHz and 1.0-kHz were also shown to generate substantial hearing thresh- old shifts. In 2011, Govindaraju, et al. (110) reported a possible incidence of TTS for a man  scanned while wearing earplugs on a 3-T scanner. The patient experienced unilateral hearing  loss and tinnitus immediately following the MRI examination. The hearing loss resolved  completely within 24-hours but the tinnitus persisted. Acoustic noise levels were checked  for the conventional sequences that were performed and found to be in the range of Leq  101- to 112-dBA (Lpeak 115- to 124-dB).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">(B) Permanent Threshold Shifts (PTS) </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>If the noise exposure at intense levels is prolonged, or repeated in close time intervals,  threshold shifts can be permanent. The threshold for permanent hearing damage is approx- imately 140-dB for short impulsive noise and around 85-dB for chronic exposure. Com- mercial MR systems that are designed to be compliant with IEC standards are not able to  generate noise in excess of 140-dB (89). De Wilde, et al. (9) reported one case of excessive  acoustic noise that occurred in the United Kingdom. The patient reported severe headaches,  dizziness, and ear pain following the MRI examination. Importantly, this patient was not  provided hearing protection because the manager of the MRI site was confident that the  noise levels generated by the 0.5-T MR system were not at a level of concern.</para>

      <title>OTHER SOURCES OF MR SYSTEM-RELATED ACOUSTIC NOISE</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Auditory Perception of Radiofrequency (RF) Electromagnetic Fields </emphasis></para>
      <para>When the human head is subjected to pulsed RF radiation at certain frequencies, an au- dible sound perceived as a click or knocking noise may be heard (212-214). This acoustic  phenomenon is referred to as “RF hearing”, “RF sound” or “microwave hearing”. Thermo- elastic expansion is believed to be the mechanism responsible for the production of RF  hearing, whereby there is absorption of RF energy that produces a minute temperature ele- vation (i.e., approximately 1 x 10<superscript>-6</superscript> ˚C) over a brief time period (i.e., approximately 10-mi- croseconds) in the tissue of the head (212-214). Subsequently, a pressure wave is induced  that is sensed by the hair cells of the cochlea via bone conduction. In this manner, the pulse  of RF energy is transferred into an acoustic wave within the human head and sensed by the  hearing organs.</para>
      <para>The sounds that occur with RF hearing appear to originate from within or near the back  of the human head, regardless of the orientation of the head in the RF field. The actual type  of noise that is heard varies with the RF pulse width and repetition rate. The relative loudness  is dependent on the total energy per pulse. RF energy-related acoustic noise has been ob- served at frequencies ranging from 216 to 7500-MHz (212-214).</para>
      <para>RF hearing is mathematically predictable from classical physics and has been studied  and characterized in laboratory animals and human subjects. Individuals involved with the  use of microwaves in industrial and military settings commonly experience RF hearing.  With specific reference to the operation of MR systems, RF hearing has been found to be  associated with frequencies ranging from 2.4- to 170-MHz (212).</para>
      <para>The gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise that occurs during MRI procedures  is significantly louder than the sounds associated with RF hearing. Therefore, noises pro- duced by the RF auditory phenomenon are effectively masked and not perceived by patients  or MR system operators (212). Furthermore, there is no evidence of any detrimental health  effects related to the presence of RF hearing. However, Roschmann, et al. (212) recommends  an upper level limit of 30-kW applied peak pulse power of RF energy for head coils and 6- kW for surface coils used during MR imaging or spectroscopy to avoid RF-evoked sound  pressure levels in the head increasing above the discomfort threshold of 110-dB.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Noise from Subsidiary Systems </emphasis></para>
      <para>Room air conditioners, fans for patient comfort, and cryogen reclamation systems as- sociated with superconducting magnets are the main sources of ambient acoustic noise  found in the MRI environment. Cryogen reclamation systems are devices that are effectively  used to minimize the loss of cryogens and function on a continuous basis, producing sounds  that are considerably less than those associated with the activation of the gradient magnetic  fields during MRI procedures. Therefore, this acoustic noise may, at the very most, be a</para>

      <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>MRI procedures can generate significant levels of acoustic noise under certain condi- tions (41, 54). This noise can be an annoyance, hinder communication with staff members  and, at high levels, presents a potential safety hazard to patients that must be managed and  controlled.</para>
      <para>Many groups have measured and analyzed the acoustic noise associated with MRI.  Acoustic noise levels increase with changes in imaging parameters including a decrease in  section thickness, field-of-view, gradient ramp time, and an increase in the gradient ampli- tude. The environment, hardware design, and the presence of the patient in the MR system  will also affect noise levels.</para>
      <para>Although many options are available for noise control, the use of simple passive pro- tection in the form of earplugs is generally sufficient to decrease noise to levels within per- missible limits for the great majority of patients. However, care must be taken to ensure  passive protection is properly fitted and in good condition (1). Noise measurements or data  for the scanner should also be acquired and checked in association with the attenuation of  the passive protection to ensure resultant noise levels at the ear will be within safe limits.</para>
      <para>Current documents regarding permissible limits vary, but a general consensus appears  to set a permissible average noise level at the patients ear of 85-dBA (80, 88, 96). Noise  levels outside the MR system’s bore are lower and present reduced risks for an MRI health- care worker present during the MRI examination.</para>
      <para>Of course, passive methods have limitations and more elegant and effective solutions  are possible. These methods range from optimizing the MRI pulse sequences in terms of  minimizing gradient activity, to the utilization of active noise control and active vibration  control systems, or entirely redesigning the gradient coils.</para>
      <para>As with many aspects of MRI, the specifications for achieving high noise attenuation  often run counter to fast acquisition of high quality diagnostic images and compromises  must be made. Optimizing procedures to lengthen gradient ramp times, lower amplitudes,  or minimize pulsing can result in sequences with reduced performance (133-135). Designing  gradient coils that are force-balanced to minimize acoustic resonances will compromise  performance in terms of increasing inductance and loss of gradient strength (37, 192-195).</para>
      <para>A solution that presents a minimal impact on the performance of the MR system is  active noise control using anti-noise (114-122). This is a promising technique but an optimal  system has yet to be fully implemented on clinical scanners.</para>
      <para>Over the last decade, the most effective solutions reported, are those involving sequence  optimization. UTE-type sequences which incorporate spiral k-space trajectory acquisition,  and very low gradient activity produce almost silent MR scanning (148-160). Gradient fil-</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">197</emphasis></para>
      <para>tering or re-shaping has also been proven to be very effective. It is no coincidence that two  commercial solutions (Silenz<superscript>TM</superscript>, and Quiet Suite<superscript>TM</superscript>) are based on these approaches.</para>
      <para>These solutions (UTE methods in particular) have not been applied to every MR se- quence, and are not suited to certain applications, such as ultrafast MR. However, given the  comparative low cost and ease of install for these acoustic noise solutions, coupled with  their efficiency, it seems likely that ongoing research in these directions will prove fruitful  and silent MR sequences will multiply on clinical scanners over time.</para>
      <para>Current trends in MRI include increasing static magnetic field strengths and improved  gradient performance for rapid clinical imaging applications. The need for ultrafast se- quences for fMRI and other advanced techniques continues. These developments will result  in increases in MRI-generated acoustic noise levels. This will mean a continuing interest  and evolution in acoustic noise control methods that warrant continued investigation, de- velopment, and commercial implementation of these techniques.</para>
