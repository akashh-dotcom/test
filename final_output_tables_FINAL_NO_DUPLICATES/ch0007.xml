      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Radiofrequency (RF) energy is defined as nonionizing electromagnetic radiation in the  frequency range of 3-kHz to 300-GHz, as distinguished from the very high photon energies  and frequencies associated with ionizing electromagnetic radiation (e.g., gamma and X- rays). The RF spectrum includes radar, ultra-high frequency (UHF), and very high frequency  (VHF) television, AM and FM radio, and microwave communication frequencies. Resonant  radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields are used in magnetic resonance (MR) for imaging and  spectroscopy procedures (1).</para>
      <para>This chapter will present and discuss various important aspects of RF power deposition  associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures with an emphasis on non- clinical, physical factors, calculations, and measurements used to characterize this electro- magnetic field.</para>

      <title>RADIO FREQUENCY MAGNETIC FIELDS AND MRI PROCEDURES</title>
      <para>During an MRI procedure, the patient absorbs a portion of the transmitted RF energy,  which may result in tissue heating (2-16). Thus, whole-body and localized heating are the  primary safety concerns associated with the absorption of RF energy. Notably, the elevation  of core body temperatures to sufficiently high levels may be life-threatening (2, 17, 18).  With local transmit RF coils, the primary safety concern is to prevent burns by limiting lo- calized heating.</para>
      <para>The specific absorption rate, or SAR, is the RF power absorbed per unit mass of tissue  and is the metric for RF power deposition typically reported in W/kg. SAR is believed to  serve as a crude measure of heating potential. It is essential for patient safety to limit whole-</para>

      <para>body-averaged and localized temperatures to appropriate SAR levels (2, 18-23). Therefore,  national and international safety standards (2, 19-21) appropriately limit or recommend  SAR levels for clinical MRI examinations. Heating experienced by the patient during an  MRI examination depends on the RF power deposited per unit mass (or SAR), ambient  temperature, relative humidity, airflow rate, blood flow, sweating rate, and patient insula- tion.</para>
      <para>Resonant frequency scales with the static magnetic field strength and nuclei of interest.  For hydrogen protons, the resonant RF frequency is 42-MHz/Tesla (1). The tip angle is pro- portional to the area under the envelope of the RF waveform. Typically, the amplitude of  the RF pulse (i.e., the tip angle) is adjusted to maximize the received signal. For a given  waveform, RF energy is proportional to the square of the tip angle. Only the magnetic com- ponent of the RF field is useful in MRI. Designs usually reduce electric field coupling to  patients. Since RF power deposition is mostly through magnetic induction, the distribution  of the RF power deposition associated with an MRI procedure tends to be mostly peripheral  or on the surface of the subject’s body (9-11). Plane wave exposures (in non-MRI applica- tions) may lead to higher heating at greater depths (18, 24).</para>
      <para>The average RF power (and SAR) is proportional to the number of images per unit time  and peak RF power. Peak RF power depends on patient dimensions, the RF waveform, flip  angle, and whether the MR system’s transmit RF coil is operating in a linear or quadrature  (i.e., has a circularly polarized magnetic field vector) mode during the transmission of RF  energy. Notably, quadrature excitation lowers RF peak power requirements and SAR by a  factor of two and “stirs” any field inhomogeneities (10). For a given static magnetic field  strength and RF waveform, SAR is independent of the type of nucleus.</para>

      <title>MR SAFETY STANDARDS</title>
      <para>The United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published "Non-Significant  Risk Criteria" for MR systems (22). These criteria state that clinical MRI examinations need  Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) if the SAR exceeds the following levels:</para>
      <para>(1) 4-W/kg (averaged over the whole body over any 15-min. period) or</para>
      <para>(2) 3.2-W/kg (averaged over the head over in any 10-min. period).</para>
      <para>Notably, the FDA’s significant risk criteria also include limits that are unrelated to RF  power deposition.</para>
      <para>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) developed the international MRI  safety standard IEC 60601-2-33 (23). The IEC MRI safety standard is three-tiered. The first  tier is referred to as the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> and is for routine scanning of patients.  The second tier is designated as the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>. The MR system  operator must take a deliberate action (usually using an “accept” button on the MR system  console) to enter the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>. This mode provides higher  MR system performance, but requires the MRI healthcare worker to closely monitor the  patient during the MRI examination. Finally, the third tier is the <emphasis role="italics">Second Level Controlled </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Operating Mode</emphasis>, which is used only for research purposes under limits controlled by an  Investigational Review Board (IRB).</para>

      <para>When the environmental temperature is ≤ 25˚C, the current IEC MRI safety standard  for RF energy during an MRI procedure permits (assuming SAR averaged over any 10-sec- ond period ≤ 2 times the 6-min. average SAR limit) the following limits for volume transmit  RF coils:</para>
      <para>a) Whole-body SAR (averaged over any 6-min period):   1) The Normal Operating Mode - SAR ≤ 2-W/kg;  2) The First Level Controlled Operating Mode - SAR ≤ 4-W/kg;  3) The Second Level Controlled Operating Mode - SAR &lt; IRB limit.  b) Partial Body SAR (averaged over any 6-min. period):  1) The Normal Operating Mode - SAR ≤ 10 W/kg - (8-W/kg * exposed patient mass /  patient mass);  2) The First Level Controlled Operating Mode - SAR ≤ 10-W/kg - (6-W/kg * exposed  patient mass / patient mass);   3) The Second Level Controlled Operating Mode - SAR &lt; IRB limit.  c) Head SAR (averaged over any 6-min. period):  1) The Normal Operating Mode - SAR ≤ 3.2-W/kg;  2) The First Level Controlled Operating Mode - SAR ≤ 3.2-W/kg;  3) The Second Level Controlled Operating Mode - SAR &lt; IRB limit.  The maximum energy limit is to be determined by the risk management file (note, pre- viously this was equivalent to 4-W/kg for one hour). Whole-body SAR limits are de-rated  by 0.25-W/kg for each degree C that the environmental temperature exceeds 25˚C for the  First Level Controlled Operating Mode, only.</para>
      <para>For local transmit RF coils, local SAR limits (averaged over the worst-case 10-grams  for 6- min.) are:</para>
      <para>a) The Normal Operating Mode   1) SAR ≤ 10-W/kg in the head or trunk (provided local temperature rise in the orbits is  limited to a 1˚C).  2) SAR ≤ 20-W/kg in the extremities;  b) The First Level Controlled Operating Mode- SAR ≤ 3.2-W/kg;  1) SAR ≤ 20-W/kg in the head or trunk (provided local temperature rise in the orbits is  limited to a 1˚C).  2) SAR ≤ 40-W/kg in the extremities;  c) The Second Level Controlled Operating Mode - SAR &lt; IRB limit.</para>
      <para>Note that the third edition of IEC 60601-2-33 is current as this is written. Work is con- tinuing on improving the scientific basis for local SAR limits or some equivalent criterion.</para>
      <para>The IEC 60601-2-33 does not require local SAR limits for volume transmit RF coils,  but does require local SAR limits for local transmit RF coils that may produce inhomoge- neous RF electromagnetic fields.  For 3-Tesla MR systems and higher, MR image “shading”  can be a concern.  This issue is apparently associated with the standing waves interfering  at field strengths where electrical lengths in the body that approach, or are less than, the di- mensions of the body.  There are now efforts (known as dual drive, parallel transmit, ellip- tical drive, or RF shimming; parallel transmit will be used here to represent these techniques)  to minimize shading by adjusting excitations on two or more RF channels to improve the  quadrature uniformity in the body (not necessarily in air) for a particular field of view.   These techniques are intended to improve quadrature uniformity in the body and reduce or</para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 001-434_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:19 PM  Page 210</para>
      <para>at least not increase the local SAR over that caused by conventional quadrature (in air) ex- citation.  The local SAR level could increase if the excitation is not properly controlled.  Since there is a long safety record associated with conventional quadrature excitation, there  generally is no concern provided that parallel transmit does not generate a local SAR higher  than conventional quadrature imaging for similar tissues. However, the scientific basis for  local SAR limits (i.e., RF power averaged over the worst case 10 grams) is currently unclear.</para>
      <para>Moritz and Henriques (25, 26) found that the thresholds for local thermal damage to  skin depended non-linearly on local tissue temperature and its duration. Comparisons of  the effectiveness of microwave hyperthermia protocols for cancer therapy with various tem- perature-time courses have been modeled in terms of the equivalent cumulative exposure  minutes at 43 degrees C (27). These values are known as CEM43. A proposal has been  made to use CEM43-derived limits to replace existing SAR safety limits (28). The proposed  CEM43 estimates tissue viability through Arrhenius equations based on temperature due to  local SAR from numerical simulations, duration, mass blood flow, and most sensitive ex- posed tissue type (29, 30).  It is not yet certain whether approximations made in deriving  CEM43 limits to determine thermal safety for MRI and spectroscopy are accurate. Safety  based on whole-body, head, and local SAR limits has been effective for the approximately  35-year history of MRI (30, 31). In addition, a vast array of implants and devices potentially  used in patients undergoing MRI examinations are classified as “MR Conditional” meaning  that they are safe for patients as long as certain specified conditions are followed, which  typically include a particular whole-body-averaged SAR level (32). It is of interest that in  2011 the Health Council of the Netherlands decided there was no need to change their elec- tromagnetic field exposure limits from SAR to time-temperature (33). Perhaps CEM43 or  something similar might find at least indirect use in studying appropriate RF safety limits  for local SAR values.</para>
      <para>Another IEC safety standard, IEC 60601-1, establishes additional safety criteria for  medical devices including electrical, mechanical, and thermal safety (34).  Surface contact  temperatures are limited to 41.0°C (34). Note that during an MRI examination using a high  SAR, the average skin temperature of a human subject approaches 37.0°C (for a 4.0°C mar- gin for temperature rise). During an MRI examination using very low SAR, the average  skin temperature is typically 33.0°C (for a temperature rise margin of 8.0°C).</para>
      <para>In 2013, the American College of Radiology published a useful paper for MRI safety  guidance (35).  This paper is not a regulatory document but, instead, it has various recom- mendations and suggestions for safety procedures for MRI facilities, some of which pertain  to the topic of this chapter.</para>
      <para>The Technical Specification, ISO/TS 10974:2011 (36), is a trial standard available for  active medical implants to aid in determining whether they are MR Conditional devices.  MR Conditional devices are acceptable for patients undergoing MRI examinations only if  certain conditions apply. There are also several American Society for Testing and Materials  (ASTM) International test standards used to determine safe conditions for use for MR Con- ditional implants and devices (32, 37-41). Note that the ASTM International heating test  implicitly assumes quadrature excitation for the RF energy.  Importantly, parallel transmit  excitation might produce different heating results.</para>

      <para>The patient’s RF power absorption during an MRI procedure can be approximated from  quasi static analysis for homogeneous objects, assuming that electric field coupling to the  patient can be neglected as well as the RF phase (42, 43). In practice, quasi-static approxi- mations for whole-body SAR in homogeneous spheres appear to be adequate for MR sys- tems operating up to 1.5-T/64-MHz. Calculation of actual SAR levels at 3-T/128-MHz and  above, and for local SAR at all static magnetic field strengths and frequencies, requires nu- merical techniques. Many commercially available software packages exist at this time.   Quasi-static methods will usually overestimate whole-body and local SARs (under homo- geneous conditions and for certain shapes) when conductor dimensions approach a wave- length.</para>

      <title>SAR “HOT-SPOTS”</title>
      <para>Next, consider localized regions of RF power deposition that might lead to heating,  commonly referred to as SAR "hot spots". Inhomogeneties in the electrical properties of  tissue may result in high local SAR levels. RF-induced biological effects appear to depend  upon temperature rather than on RF power deposition. A region of high local SAR may not  be a region of high temperature due to blood flow or diffusion or other cooling mechanisms.  The distinction between temperature hot spots and SAR hot spots is often ignored or mis- understood.</para>
      <para>What effect do inhomogeneities have on the distribution of RF power deposition? Using  spherical models, Schenck and Hussain (45) demonstrated that production of power depo- sition “hot spots” depends upon both the dielectric constants and the conductivities of the  media. The model was later reformulated and used to investigate several problems involving  worst-case conditions and magnitudes of local power deposition (10). Assume that there is  a small, homogeneous sphere (sphere 1) with permittivity ε1 and conductivity σ1 (Figure  3). Let sphere 2 be a much larger, homogeneous sphere of “standard tissue” representing  the body. Sphere 2 has a permittivity ε2 and conductivity σ2. Sphere 1 may be placed outside  sphere 2 at the pole (tangential electric field location) or at the equator (normal electric field  location). In addition, sphere 1 may be placed inside sphere 2. When sphere 1 is placed near  the pole of sphere 2, the local power deposition is amplified by a factor, Ap, which may be  expressed as:</para>

      <para>When sphere 1 is placed near the equator of sphere 2, the local power deposition am- plification factor, Ae, may be expressed as:</para>
      <para>Finally, if sphere 1 is placed inside sphere 2, the local power deposition amplification  factor, As, may be represented as:</para>
      <para>All the terms in equations (11), (12), and (13) are positive. The electrical properties of  sphere 1 are treated as variables so conditions for maximum amplification of local power  deposition may be determined.</para>
      <para>When sphere 1 is near the pole, amplification of local power deposition, Ap, is greatest  when sphere 1 is a perfect conductor (σ1 ≈ ∞). A perfectly conducting small sphere at the  pole will result in a local amplification factor of Ap = 9. Recall that the spatial peak SAR in  a homogeneous sphere is already 2.5 times average SAR for the sphere. Combining these  results, the peak SAR at the pole is = 22.5 times the SAR averaged over sphere 2. Conduc- tive leads (e.g., used with electrocardiogram monitoring equipment) placed in contact with  the skin of patients may simulate this situation. Note that there is almost no amplification  of local power deposition if sphere 1 is a radius or more from sphere 2. Spacing conductors  well away from patients can dramatically reduce the local heating potential.</para>
      <para>Assume sphere 1 is placed near the equator of sphere 2. Then the greatest amplification  of local power deposition takes place when sphere 1 electrical properties are minimal; i.e.,  σ1 = 0 and ε1 = ε0 (free space value). So for a void, such as an air bubble, Ae = 2.25. Fat or  bone at the equator produces slightly smaller amplifications (10, 37). When a low conduc- tivity sphere is located near the outer edge of the equator of a larger (conductive) sphere,  the local SAR is highest and is limited to 5.625 times the average SAR.</para>
      <para>Finally, assume sphere 1 is placed inside the large sphere. This situation may simulate  an implanted prostheses. While local SAR is amplified the most when σ1 = 2σ2 and ε1 =  2ε2 (not a likely situation), the amplification factor is only As = 1.125. The highest local  SAR works out to 2.8125 times the local average SAR.</para>

      <para>The analyses above assume linearly polarized RF magnetic fields. Notably, if the trans- mit RF coil produces quadrature excitation, then the amplification of local power deposition  is reduced. The reduction in local power deposition results from rotating eddy current loops  during quadrature excitation. Sphere 1 alternates between the equator and the pole of the  larger sphere during quadrature excitation. So, worst-case quadrature local SAR amplifica- tion (assuming inhomogeneous biology) is 0.5 * (2.5 + 2.8125) = 2.66. For maximum SAR  amplification at the equator, the electrical properties of sphere 1 approach those of a void.</para>
      <para>Similarly, for an infinitely conducting sphere 1, during quadrature RF excitation, the  worst-case local power deposition amplification would be 0.5 * (2.5 + 22.5) = 12.5. How- ever, the presence of a conductor may complicate the production of a perfect quadrature  RF field by setting up difficult boundary conditions.</para>
      <para>Currently, many useful electromagnetic simulation packages are commercially available  that can calculate whole-body average, head average, partial body average, and local SAR  (averaged over the worst-case contiguous 10-grams).  As mentioned under the MRI safety  standards section above, it turns out that, in the transmit body RF coil, the ratio of peak  local SAR to the whole-body average SAR may be high (as high as about 13 times) (38).</para>

      <para>Receive-only RF coils, including most surface coils, typically use transmit body RF  coils to transmit RF excitation pulses. Receive-only coils are resonant during RF reception.  However, if these RF coils were resonant during transmission of RF energy, then large cur- rents may be produced in the receive-only coils. These large currents would, by Lenz’s law,  induce opposing RF magnetic fields. Flip angle profiles could be altered by the opposing  RF magnetic fields, degrading image quality. The opposing RF magnetic fields may induce  large electric fields in the body leading to large local SAR levels. Manufacturers use high  impedance blocking networks to detune surface coils and limit surface coil current during  body coil transmit (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>If conductive loops (e.g., associated with the use of monitoring equipment or even a  coiled transmission line) are introduced into the MR system, high local SAR levels may re- sult (39, 40) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>).

      <title>TRANSMIT/RECEIVE SURFACE COILS AND LOCAL SAR</title>
      <para>Planar, surface transmit RF coils are often used in MR spectroscopy studies. The pri- mary safety concern with transmit/receive surface coils involves local SAR issues. While  it is straightforward to calculate local RF power deposition in volume transmit RF coils,  estimation of spatial peak specific absorption rate (SAR) for planar transmit surface coils  is complex. To prevent excessive local RF power deposition, it is imperative to at least es- timate an upper bound for the local SAR. The local SAR is highest near the coil conductors.  For such cases, simplifying assumptions may be made to calculate appropriate design limits  (55).

      <title>MEASUREMENT OF LOCAL SAR IN PHANTOMS</title>
      <para>It is possible to experimentally measure local SAR in phantoms using materials with  electrical properties and density similar to muscle (24, 57-59). To accomplish this, it is  useful to use fiber-optic (non-conductive) temperature probes under the transmit RF coil  conductors in contact with the tissue-phantom and thermally isolated from the RF coil. The  local SAR may be calculated from the early (linear) portion of the heating curve:</para>
      <para>In the equation above, <emphasis role="italics">C</emphasis> is the specific heat of the tissue and <emphasis role="italics">T</emphasis> is the temperature. Equa- tion (24) is expressed in MKS units. Other loss mechanisms (convection, radiation, and  conduction) must be minimized during the experiment. Convection may be limited by using  a gel-filled phantom (49). Conduction losses may be minimized by keeping materials insu- lated and by starting with the coil and the “tissue/phantom” at room temperature.</para>

      <title>SAFETY CONSIDERATION OF RECEIVE-ONLY RF SURFACE COILS</title>
      <para>Exceptionally large surface coil currents may flow if receive-only RF surface coils were  resonant while RF excitation pulses are played out on the transmit body RF coil (59-61).  These currents may result in extremely high local SAR levels near the surface coil. In ad- dition, the surface coil reaction currents would destroy <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">1</emphasis> homogeneity, by generating op- posing magnetic fields. To prevent such problems, a blocking network in the surface coil  presents a high impedance to limit surface coil currents during RF excitation (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>).  The blocking impedance required depends on the area of the RF coil, frequency, and how  large an opposing field is to be allowed. Typical blocking impedances are a few hundred  ohms. Note that in the case of phased array receive coils, special care must be exercised to  avoid the development of high local electric fields from differential voltages on adjacent  conductors.</para>

IEC 60601-1 sets a  surface temperature limit (<emphasis role="italics">T</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">limit</emphasis> = 41°C) for objects that may touch human subjects (34).  Skin temperature under normal, non-MRI or low SAR conditions is approximately 33.0°C.  However, during an MRI procedure involving a high SAR level, skin blood vessels dilate,  the cutaneous circulation increases, and skin temperatures may approach the level of the  core temperature. In tests with phantoms initially at ambient temperature, a 4.0°C rise should  be the limit for systems capable of high SAR. For low SAR systems, the surface coil tem- perature rise may be limited to 8.0°C above ambient temperature.</para>

      <para>Thermal effects arise from the temperature dependence of most biological functions.  Chemical reaction rates approximately double with each 10˚C rise in temperature (62). Pro- tein denaturation takes place at temperatures of approximately 45˚C (18). The fluidity of  cell membranes is also affected by temperature. Thermal effects may be caused by whole  body heating of the organism or by localized heating of tissues. During an MRI examination,  while only the body parts inside of the transmit RF coil are exposed to RF power deposition,  the entire body may be affected by thermal reactions.</para>

      <para>RF fields are too high in frequency to electrically stimulate excitable tissues (64). Thus,  as previously mentioned, the only well-established mechanism for RF energy-related bio- effects is heating (18). Guy, et al. (65) showed that the SAR threshold for cataractogenesis  is 100-W/kg. The highest safe core temperature for workers is considered to be 39.4°C (24,  66, 67). The threshold core temperature for teratogenic effects in pregnant women is 38.9°C  (60). During the day, core temperature fluctuates approximately 1°C or more (17, 68). Skin  temperature fluctuates over a range of 15°C (17). The skin pain threshold is 43°C (69). Fi- nally, the resting metabolic rate is 1.3-W/kg, while during vigorous exercise, in highly  trained athletes, may be as high as 18-W/kg (24).</para>

      <para>Adair and Bergulund (70, 71) utilized a mathematical thermal model of the body, based  on the Gagge model (72), to predict the effects of SAR, ambient temperature, impairment  of blood flow, relative humidity, clothing, and scan time on core temperature rise. Their  summarized results can be approximated with a simple program (71). The Adair program  was used to predict the effect of ambient temperature on core temperature rise (10) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">10</emphasis>). For the plot, it was assumed that clothing = 0.2 clo, relative humidity was 50%, blood  flow impairment was 40%, and the scan duration was 60 minutes. A 40% reduction in car- diac output is life threatening (73). From the plot, it is evident that an exposure to 4-W/kg  for an hour should result in only a 1°C core temperature rise when <emphasis role="italics">T</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">a</emphasis> = 19°C. However, if  <emphasis role="italics">T</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">a</emphasis> = 25°C, then 3-W/kg is needed. A one hour exposure to 1 W/kg even at <emphasis role="italics">T</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">a</emphasis> = 27°C should  result in no temperature rise. Of course, ambient temperature plays an important role in  core temperature rise.</para>

      <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>A variety of physical factors affect the manner in which the RF fields used for MRI ex- aminations impact patients. Both whole body and localized depositions of RF energy may  result in tissue heating. In consideration of this primary safety concern, regulatory agencies  have provided guidelines based on whole-body-averaged and/or peak SARs to ensure the  safe operation of MR systems. In this chapter, various techniques of calculating and esti- mating SARs associated with MRI procedures have been described. Additionally, there has  been a discussion of the possible mechanisms responsible for observed RF bioeffects and  a review of the thermal physics and mathematical models used to predict human thermal  responses to absorption of RF energy. This work served as the basis for characterizing the  RF fields used during MRI examinations and helps to estimate the thermophysiologic al- terations in patients.</para>
