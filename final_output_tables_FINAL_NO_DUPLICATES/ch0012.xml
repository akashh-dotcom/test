      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been used in clinical practice since  the 1980s. Over the years, nine GBCAs have been approved for intravenous or intra-articular  use in various countries throughout the world: Ablavar (gadofosveset), Dotarem (gadoterate  meglumine), Eovist/Primovist (gadoxetate disodium), Gadavist/Gadovist (gadobutrol),  Magnevist (gadopentetate dimeglumine), MultiHance (gadobenate dimeglumine), ProHance  (gadoteridol), Omniscan (gadodiamide), and OptiMARK (gadoversetamide).</para>
      <para>“Adverse reactions” are defined by all regulatory authorities as noxious and unintended  responses to a medicinal product (1). The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means  that a causal relationship between exposure to a medicinal product and an untoward medical  occurrence is at least a reasonable possibility. All medicinal products can produce an adverse  reaction in someone who has been exposed to them. GBCAs, though generally safe and  well tolerated, are no exception: adverse reactions can occur after their administration, par- ticularly in patients with underlying risk factors.</para>
      <para>“Acute adverse reactions” to GBCAs are defined as undesirable side effects that occur  within the first 60 minutes after administration of a GBCA (2). According to the approved  prescribing information of the GBCAs that are currently commercially available in the  United States (U.S.), the most frequent acute reactions to these imaging agents are headache,  nausea with or without vomiting, injection site reactions, dizziness, localized rash, and pru- ritus (incidence rate, 1 to 5%) (3-7). Importantly, reactions like coldness, warmth, or pain  at the injection site or headache probably depend on the physicochemical characteristics of  the GBCAs, while all other types of immediate reactions fall into the category of hypersen- sitivity reactions and are either allergic or pseudoallergic (allergy-like) in nature (8, 9).</para>
      <para>These latter two reactions are clinically indistinguishable due to their symptomatic similar- ities. However, they vastly differ mechanistically. Allergy-like reactions lack immunological  specificity and do not require previous exposure to the triggering antigen to elicit a response  (10). Conversely, allergic reactions are characterized by immunological specificity and  transferability. In cases of an allergic reaction, the patient’s immune system is able to rec- ognize and mount an immune response against an antigen, particularly due to subsequent  exposures to the same antigen (10). Allergy-like reactions are not associated with immuno- logical specificity but with direct release of histamine and other mediators from activated  mast cells and circulating basophils and eosinophils, activation of the contact and comple- ment systems, conversion of L-arginine into nitric oxide, and activation of the XII clotting  system leading to the production of bradykinin (11). Current clinical evidence shows that  most acute reactions to GBCAs are allergy-like in nature (8). However, cases of true allergic  reactions to GBCAs have been reported (9, 12-14).</para>

      <para>This chapter aims to provide information on the following: (1) how to identify patients  who may be at risk for developing serious acute reactions; (2) how to properly assess the  risks and benefits of using GBCAs in individual patients; (3) the preventative measures that  should be adopted; (4) when and how to promptly recognize the type of acute reaction; and  (5) the treatments that are recommended for patients experiencing serious adverse reactions.  These recommendations are based on guidance documents developed and published by  leading scientific societies (2, 15, 27).</para>

      <title>WHAT TO DO BEFORE THE EXAM</title>
      <para>To prevent or minimize the risk of complications following administration of GBCAs,  the following five steps should be adhered to before any contrast-enhanced magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) exam: (1) be aware of possible complications; (2) know your patient;  (3) assess risk/benefit of GBCA administration; (4) adopt preventative measures, if and  when necessary; and (5) be prepared to manage any adverse reaction.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">(1) Be Aware of Possible Complications </emphasis></para>
      <para>Before proceeding with a contrast-enhanced MRI exam, all personnel should be familiar  with all of the possible risk factors and be knowledgeable about the entire spectrum of ad- verse events that may occur after the administration of the GBCA to be used. This can be  achieved by carefully reading the prescribing information, being fluent with the relevant  literature and, if needed, requesting specific safety information from the manufacturer. Doc- umentation of continuing medical education of all involved healthcare professionals related  to the use of GBCAs should be maintained.</para>
      <para>Also, healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential for acute reactions to  drugs administered concomitantly for the sake of the MRI procedure, such as drugs used to  reduce anxiety, to sedate the patient, for analgesia or anesthesia, antihistamines, or phar- macologic stressors.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">(2) Know Your Patient </emphasis></para>
      <para>Risk factors associated with the development of immediate hypersensitivity reactions  to GBCAs are well known. However, the occurrence of acute adverse reactions is substan- tially unpredictable, and allergic or allergy-like acute reactions, including serious ones, are  frequently observed in the absence of risk factors.</para>
      <para>Patients at risk for developing acute reactions include those who have experienced prior  reactions to a GBCA (2, 15, 20, 27, 28). These patients are eight times more likely to expe- rience subsequent reactions, the severity of which may be greater than that of previous re- actions (29). Patients with underlying asthma or allergic diathesis, including hypersensitivity  to food, chemicals, or other medications, are also considered to be at increased risk. Al-</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">335</emphasis></para>
      <para>though there is no cross-reactivity, patients with known hypersensitivity to other types of  medical imaging agents (e.g., radiocontrast iodinated agents) should be considered at higher  risk for the development of hypersensitivity reactions to GBCAs (2, 15, 20, 28).</para>
      <para>Patients receiving treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers have been reported to be at  increased risk for experiencing hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated agents due to an in- crease in the release of mediators involved in anaphylaxis (30). Importantly, in the event  that a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, beta-blocking agents may decrease the car- diovascular compensatory changes to the anaphylactic shock, and epinephrine (adrenaline)  may be ineffective or promote paradoxical reflex vagotonic effects when used to resolve  the reaction (31-34).</para>
      <para>Therefore, before administering a GBCA, the healthcare professionals responsible for  the procedure should be aware of the patient’s pre-existing conditions, including the main  known or suspected diseases and any potential co-morbidities, identify any possible risk  factors, and ensure all medications the patient is taking have been identified. It is recom- mended to use a questionnaire to in order to ensure possible risk factors are identified and  to best assess the risk of GBCA use in individual patients. Finally, attention should be also  given to the emotional state of patients. Anxiety may cause panic attacks with symptoms  that may mimic hypersensitivity reactions. Also, under high stress situations, vasovagal re- actions may occur as well and it may be difficult to distinguish them from real hypersensi- tivity reactions. Severe acute reactions to GBCAs can be mitigated at least in part by having  a calm, relaxing atmosphere, and experienced personnel familiar with the GBCAs being  utilized and able to reduce anxiety (28).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">(3) Assess Risk-Benefit of GBCA Administration </emphasis></para>
      <para>Patient risk versus potential benefit of the GBCA-enhanced MRI examination should  be evaluated and possibly documented on an individual basis by the referring physician and  the radiologist for each patient. The radiologist should also consider the risk-benefit ratio  of imaging alternatives. If a GBCA-enhanced exam is based on a valid clinical indication,  patients should be properly informed about its risks and benefits and provided written in- formed consent.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">(4) Adopt Preventative Measures, If And When Necessary </emphasis></para>
      <para>There are no widely accepted policies for dealing with patients who have experienced  prior reactions to GBCAs and the need for subsequent exposure to the same or other  GBCAs. However, even in the absence of supportive evidence, it is suggested that in the  case of a patient who experiences an acute reaction to a GBCA and requires a future con- trast-enhanced MRI, every effort should be made to determine if a GBCA is absolutely nec- essary, and if so, identify the specific GBCA that elicited the initial reaction so that a  different agent may be selected for use (2, 15, 27).</para>
      <para>Premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines is recommended for patients with  a history of previous hypersensitivity reactions to GBCAs, allergies or known hypersensi- tivity to drugs or chemicals (2, 15). Two premedication regimens (<emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>) have been rec- ommended (15, 35, 36), of which the adults dosing regimens are summarized as follows:</para>

      <para>It is important to note that such regimens may reduce the frequency or severity of re- actions but are not always effective as breakthrough reactions, including life-threatening</para>
      <para>events, have been observed after GBCA administration in pre-medicated patients, and ra- diology teams must be prepared to treat breakthrough reactions when they occur (37-42).</para>
      <para>Oral corticosteroids should be used with caution in patients with uncontrolled hyper- tension, diabetes, active tuberculosis, systemic fungal infections, active peptic ulcer, or di- verticulitis. Antihistamines may cause drowsiness and should not be taken shortly before  operating a vehicle. Some patients have experienced allergies to the individual medications  used in premedication (15). Also, premedication may cause a delay in diagnosis imparted  by the multi-hour duration of premedication, increase hospital length of stay, increase time  to imaging exam, increase hospital-acquired infection risk, and increase costs compared to  non-premedicated controls (43). The indirect harms of premedication likely overshadow  the benefits of premedication in some vulnerable populations (15).</para>
      <para>Pretreatment may create a false sense of security, so that healthcare providers may neg- lect appropriate measures to monitor patients and to treat adverse reactions. It is important  to note that no premedication strategy is a substitute for preparedness to treat adverse reac- tions.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">(5) Be Prepared to Manage Any Adverse Reaction </emphasis></para>
      <para>Prerequisites to managing acute reactions include properly trained personnel and well- designed treatment plans. Personnel should be periodically and effectively trained to rapidly  recognize and assess acute adverse reactions and take all the necessary steps to initiate ap- propriate treatment, with properly documented review sessions and assessments. Periodic  training of onsite health care providers in cardiopulmonary resuscitation techniques, includ- ing basic life support or advanced cardiac life support, is recommended. Staff should be  also aware of how to activate the emergency response system to elevate the level of care if  needed in extreme cases. The contact phone number of the cardiopulmonary arrest emer- gency response team (i.e., the Code Blue team) should be clearly posted within or near any  room in which a GBCA is to be injected.</para>
      <para>All MRI facilities should have readily available, basic equipment and medications  needed to assess and treat acute reactions. As shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis>, this list includes but is not  limited to equipment to assess a patient, such as stethoscope, blood pressure and pulse mon- itor, pulse oximeter, as well as medications and equipment needed to treat a patient, such  as sterile saline for intravenous injection, epinephrine, atropine, diphenhydramine, beta-ag- onist inhalers, oxygen, intubation equipment, and a cardiac defibrillator (2, 15). MRI facil- ities should institute periodic monitoring programs to ensure functionality of equipment  and confirm all medications are within expiration date limits (2, 15). The equipment to as- sess and treat acute reactions must be readily available and within or nearby any room in  which a GBCA is to be injected. The number and distribution of carts designed to treat acute  adverse reactions should be tailored to the size of the imaging facility.</para>

      <title>WHAT TO DO DURING THE MRI EXAM</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">(1) Monitor Patients During the Procedure </emphasis></para>
      <para>The vast majority of patients undergoing a contrast-enhanced MR exam do not experi- ence any adverse event. However, even if rare, serious complications may occur. Therefore,  it is imperative that practitioners monitor all patients receiving a GBCA closely during the  procedure and remain in the immediate vicinity for at least 30 to 45 minutes following the  contrast injection. If there is an increased risk of an adverse reaction, venous access should  be left in place (8). Some patients are quick to report minor symptoms, while others may  wait until symptoms are more severe before alerting health care personnel. Thus, patients  should be instructed to call for help as soon as they experience any symptoms.</para>
      <para>Patients with concomitant impaired vision or hearing, neurologic disease, psychiatric  illness, such as depression, substance abuse, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hy- peractivity disorder, or cognitive disorders, may have diminished awareness of hypersensi- tivity triggers and symptoms. At any age, concurrent use of central nervous system-active  medications such as sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants, and first generation sedating H1- antihistamines can interfere with the recognition of symptoms and with the patient’s ability  to describe symptoms.</para>
      <para>Most severe reactions (94 to 100%) occur within 20 minutes of the GBCA injection;  therefore, it is imperative that equipment and medications be immediately available, but  positioned for use outside the MR system room (8). Patients requiring treatment should be  quickly moved from the scanner room to a safe area away from the influence of the powerful  static magnetic, using an MR Conditional transport stretcher or other suitable device so that  none of the resuscitative equipment becomes a projectile hazard (15). Assessment of reaction  severity is somewhat subjective and, thus, it is difficult to succinctly describe all possible  degrees of reaction severity. Sound clinical judgment should be used to determine when  and how aggressively an acute reaction should be treated (15).</para>
      <para>Mild reactions are usually self-limiting and do not require treatment (2, 15). Patients  who experience mild reactions should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after the first  symptoms are reported and longer, if necessary, to ensure there is no progression to a more  severe event (15).</para>
      <para>Moderate reactions can be more pronounced and persistent, requiring specific treatment,  and may progress if left untreated. Patients experiencing a moderate reaction should have  their vital signs closely monitored to make certain that progression to a more serious event  is avoided.</para>
      <para>Severe reactions are rare but of utmost concern since they may be life-threatening.  While they rarely occur, immediate recognition and treatment is necessary. In many cases,</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">339</emphasis></para>
      <para>life-threatening events begin with mild signs and symptoms, and then rapidly evolve to a  severe reaction. As a result, it is imperative that practitioners monitor all patients experi- encing minor or moderate adverse reactions until their complete resolution.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">(2) Prompt Recognition of the Type and Severity of Adverse Reactions </emphasis></para>
      <para>In the event of acute reactions, assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, and men- tation are necessary before proceeding to management steps. The American College of Ra- diology (ACR) Manual on Contrast Media recommends that the following assessments be  immediately made (15):</para>
      <para>(1) How does the patient look?   (2) Can the patient speak?   (3) How does the patient’s voice sound?  (4) How is the patient’s breathing?   (5) What is the patient’s pulse strength and rate?   (6) What is the patient’s blood pressure?</para>
      <para>The level of consciousness, appearance of the skin, quality of phonation, lung auscul- tation, blood pressure and heart rate assessment will allow the responding physician to  quickly determine not only the severity of a reaction but also allow for the proper diagnosis  of the reaction (15). Once the type and severity of a reaction have been identified, the ap- propriate treatment should be initiated. In cases of severe reactions, such as cardiopulmonary  arrest, it may be necessary to seek additional assistance to obtain access to specialized life- support equipment and the expertise of appropriately trained personnel. The ACR and the  European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) both publish guidelines for practitioners  to use as references. These guidelines, summarized in <emphasis role="bold">Table 4</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Table 5</emphasis>, include infor- mation concerning the latest approaches to treatment for various signs and symptoms of  acute reactions (2, 15). Patients should be monitored continuously to facilitate prompt de- tection of any clinical changes or progression to more severe symptoms.</para>

Also known as neurally-mediated syncope, vasovagal reactions  are characterized by abrupt peripheral vasodilation and hypotension, along with bradycardia.  Patients can also experience pallor, nausea, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, but no cu- taneous rash, bronchospasm, tachycardia, or angioedema are observed. The exact cause of  vagal reactions is unknown, but triggers such as anxiety and fear are known to elicit the re- sponse (44, 45).</para>
      <para>In anaphylactic or anaphylactic-like reactions, the most common areas affected include  the skin (flushing, itching, urticaria, angioedema in 80 to 90% of cases), respiratory tract  (throat itching and tightness, dysphonia, hoarseness, stridor, dry staccato cough,  wheezing/bronchospasm in 70% of cases), gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, nausea,  vomiting, diarrhea in 30 to 45% of cases), heart and vasculature (hypotension, tachycardia,  bradycardia, cardiac arrest in 10 to 45% of cases), and central nervous system (altered men- tal status, dizziness, confusion, loss of consciousness in 10 to 15% of cases) (46).</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italics">Distinguishing Anxiety or Panic Attacks From Hypersensitivity Reactions.</emphasis> An anxiety  or panic attack can cause diagnostic confusion because a sense of impending doom, breath- lessness, flushing, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal symptoms can occur in both  anxiety/panic attacks and in hypersensitivity events. However, urticaria, angioedema,  wheezing, and hypotension are unlikely to occur during an anxiety/panic attack (45, 46).</para>
      <para>Be aware of possible difficulties in timely detection of hypersensitivity reactions. In  patients with concomitant medical conditions, for example, asthma, chronic obstructive pul- monary disease, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, or pre-existing myocardial  infarction, signs and symptoms of these diseases can cause confusion in the differential di- agnosis of anaphylactic or anaphylactic-type reactions (46).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">(3) Timely and Appropriate Treatment of the Adverse Reaction </emphasis></para>
      <para>The vast majority of patients with moderate-to-severe reactions recover if they are  treated quickly and appropriately.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Treatment of Vasovagal Reactions. </emphasis>The pathophysiology of vasovagal syncope is char- acterized by an activation of the parasympathetic nervous system triggering a rapid decrease  in heartbeat (bradycardia), accompanied by an acute loss of sympathetic stimulation causing  a reduction of vascular tone and drop of blood pressure (hypotension) (47). Vasovagal re- actions are effectively treated by elevating the patient’s legs, increasing intravascular fluid  volume, and administering atropine to reverse bradycardia (2, 15).</para>
      <para>Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for severe hypersensitivity reactions. Anaphy- lactic and anaphylactic-like reactions are rapid onset, multisystem, and potentially lethal  events that develop very quickly as a result of mast cells and basophils systemically and  abruptly releasing mediators of inflammation. Different from vagal reactions, anaphylactic  and anaphylactic-like reactions are most effectively treated with rapid infusion of large vol- umes of fluids, along with epinephrine (2, 15, 48-50). If administered properly and promptly,  epinephrine can prevent or reverse the life-threatening symptoms of anaphylactic shock.  Patients are at risk for death in as little as five minutes following exposure to GBCAs. Ep- inephrine is life-saving because it is a mixed alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist  with rapid onset of action (48, 49). The alpha-adrenergic vasoconstricting effect reverses  vasodilation, thus alleviating hypotension and reducing erythema, urticaria, and angioedema  (49-50). Beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity acts to dilate bronchial airways, increase  the force of myocardial muscle contraction (inotropy) and heart rate (chronotropy), which  increases cardiac output, and attenuates the severity of histamine-induced symptoms via  beta-2 receptors on mast cells (48-52). Fatality studies provide the most compelling evidence  for prompt epinephrine injection (53-56).</para>
      <para>While epinephrine is recommended as first-line therapy, antihistamines and corticos- teroids can be considered as adjunctive therapies and may be tried after epinephrine is ad- ministered to help control cutaneous and cardiovascular manifestations such as itching,  flushing, urticaria, angioedema, and nasal and eye symptoms, as well as to prevent second- ary reactions. There is no evidence that either antihistamines or corticosteroids provide life- saving treatment (i.e., they do not prevent or relieve upper airway obstruction, hypotension,  or shock) (49). Besides, antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, have a significantly</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">345</emphasis></para>
      <para>longer onset of action and longer time to peak activity compared with epinephrine (57).  Similarly, corticosteroids have the potential to prevent recurrent or protracted episodes, but  should not be used in place of, or prior to, epinephrine, as they are not helpful for acute  symptoms (49). Of note, administering one or more second-line medications potentially de- lays prompt injection of epinephrine, the first-line treatment (58-60).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Issues Related to the Use of Epinephrine in the Management of Serious Hypersensitivity.</emphasis>  Despite the knowledge that epinephrine can save lives, it may be underused by physicians,  health care professionals, and even emergency medical services. Rates of epinephrine use  in the emergency department (ED) as first-line treatment of anaphylaxis are generally low,  even in patients who have been clearly diagnosed with anaphylaxis (60). In a small 2013  cross-sectional survey of emergency medical health professionals (N = 207) in EDs in the  United States, only 42% of healthcare professionals reported using epinephrine for most  anaphylactic episodes (61). In a retrospective study analyzing anaphylaxis-related Interna- tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes in a large health mainte- nance organization from 2008 to 2012 (N &gt; 150,000), epinephrine was only used in 16.2%  of total anaphylaxis cases (62). In a study of pediatric patients treated in the emergency de- partment for anaphylaxis, high proportions were inappropriately treated with antihistamines  (92%) or corticosteroids (78%), while only 54% of patients in this study received epineph- rine initially to treat the event (63).</para>
      <para>No use, use of inadequate doses, or delayed use of epinephrine is associated with poor  outcomes: fatality, encephalopathy because of hypoxia and/or ischemia, and protracted or  biphasic reactions (that is, reactions lasting several hours or a second phase occurring an  hour or more after the onset of the first phase, respectively) (60). A patient may still expe- rience serious complications or die in the instance of using epinephrine that has passed its  expiration date (48).</para>
      <para>If a patient does not respond to timely and appropriate treatment with epinephrine, po- sitioning on the back with the lower extremities elevated, supplemental oxygen, intravenous  fluid resuscitation, and rapid transfer to the care of a team specialized in emergency medi- cine, critical care medicine, or anesthesiology is recommended (46). Even if it is critical  for effectively resolving anaphylactic or anaphylactic-like reactions, the use of epinephrine  is not devoid of risk and, therefore, caution should be exercised when using it.</para>
      <para>Common side effects that occur at recommended doses of epinephrine via any route of  administration include agitation, anxiety, tremulousness, headache, dizziness, pallor, or pal- pitations (48). Rarely, and usually associated with overdosage or overly rapid rate of intra- venous infusion, epinephrine administration might contribute to or cause myocardial  ischemia, pulmonary edema, prolonged ventricular repolarization and arrhythmias, accel- erated hypertension, and intracranial hemorrhage in adults and children alike (48). Partic- ularly vulnerable populations are those individuals at the extremes of age and those with  hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart disease, or untreated hyperthy- roidism (i.e., due to an increased number of beta-adrenergic receptors in the vasculature of  these individuals, rendering the myocardium more sensitive to the beta-adrenergic effects  of epinephrine) (48).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">346</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Acute Reactions to Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents</emphasis></para>
      <para>Concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blockers decreases the effectiveness of exogenously  administered epinephrine. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and possibly an- giotensin II receptor blockers may interfere with intrinsic compensatory responses to hy- potension. Tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors may impede  epinephrine metabolism and lead to increased plasma and tissue concentrations. Cocaine  and amphetamines sensitize the myocardium to the effects of epinephrine, thus increasing  the risk of toxicity (48).</para>

      <title>WHAT TO DO AFTER THE MRI EXAM</title>
      <para>If no adverse reaction occurred during the MRI exam, it is advisable to observe patients  for 30 minutes after the GBCA administration and those at risk for hypersensitivity reactions  may be kept under monitoring for a longer period of time (2, 15). Patients experiencing  non–life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions may be observed for four to six hours after  successful treatment and then discharged. Patients who experience serious acute reactions  (with cardiovascular and/or severe respiratory symptoms) should be admitted or treated and  observed for a longer time period in the ED or an observation area.</para>

      <title>FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS</title>
      <para>GBCAs are, in general, very safe. Serious adverse reactions to GBCAs are fortunately  uncommon and fatal reactions are extremely rare. Proper patient evaluation and adequate  prophylactic measures can prevent some of these complications. Knowledge, training, and  preparation are crucial for appropriate and effective management of these events. Prompt  recognition and treatment are invaluable in attenuating an adverse reaction of a patient to  GBCAs, and may prevent a reaction from becoming severe or even life threatening.</para>
