      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Safety is paramount when considering that both demand and utilization rates for mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI) have increased dramatically in the past decade. As such,  effective safety training and education are essential, particularly because MRI has increas- ingly become the modality of choice for a number of medical indications and scanners with  higher static magnetic fields, faster gradient magnetic fields, and more intense radiofre- quency (RF) fields are frequently being used. Canadian MRI facilities strive to align with  relevant standards and with guidelines developed by leading organizations and experts to  ensure that policies and procedures function to protect patients, staff members, and others  working in and around the MRI environment.</para>

      <title>HEALTHCARE IN CANADA</title>
      <para>Canada has publicly funded healthcare where the federal government provides money  to the ten provinces and three territories as described under the Canada Health Act. Each  province and territory then manages and delivers healthcare to all citizens. The high cost of  providing healthcare means that MRI programs receive a great deal of attention from politi- cians, senior administrators, and the media. In particular, the time that patients must wait  for MRI scans is a politically sensitive issue. Consequently, the number of scanners installed  across Canada has steadily increased.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI in Canada </emphasis></para>
      <para>The Canadian Agency for Drugs &amp; Technologies in Health (CADTH) confirms a na- tional trend of increased examination volumes in <emphasis role="italics">The Canadian Medical Imaging Inventory, </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">2017</emphasis> that estimated that 1.86 million MRI scans were performed in 2017, up from 1 million  in 2007 (1). CADTH reports that between 2007 and 2017 the number of MR systems in  Canada increased from 222 to 366 (1). In Canada, the vast majority of MR systems are hos- pital-based; although some provinces offer MRI services in private clinics. The Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) finds that as of 2018 there are 10.2  MRI scanners per 1,000,000 inhabitants in Canada, compared to 39.1 MRI scanners per  million inhabitants in the United States and 55.2 MRI scanners per million people in Japan  (2). Since MRI access is less readily available in Canada compared to other countries, such  as the United States and Japan, management of MRI service is critical and receives a great  deal of attention.</para>
      <para>As MRI technology has progressed over the past 30 years, it has become apparent that  higher exposure levels than those contained within <emphasis role="italics">Safety Code – 26, Guidelines on Expo-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">sure to Electromagnetic Fields from Magnetic Resonance Clinical Systems</emphasis> (3) are now con- sidered to be safe, depending on a variety of factors. Increasingly, stronger systems are  being installed at facilities throughout the country. As of 2017, CADTH reports that 83.2%  of the units installed in Canada are 1.5 T units, although there has been a proliferation of 3  T units (13.7%) in MRI facilities across Canada (1). In total, 1.5 T and 3 T MR systems ac- count for 97% of the scanners in the nation. Therefore, the most common scanners transmit  and receive radiofrequency in the range of 64 to 128 megahertz (MHz). The range of fre- quency used in MR systems is in the particular range where the primary concern from RF  deposition is tissue heating and resultant tissue temperature increases.</para>

      <title>EXPOSURE LIMITS AND EQUIPMENT OPERATION IN CANADA</title>
      <para>In 1987, shortly after the arrival of the innovative new technology, Health Canada pub- lished Safety Code 26 that set limits for human exposure to static magnetic fields, time- varying magnetic fields, and radiofrequency (RF) fields (3). Safety Code 26 set the early  exposure limits, but many of the guidelines are out of date given the MR systems available  now. The major concerns and potential risks to the patient and operator relate to the bioef- fects and the combination of the three fields. Health Canada has published guidelines relat- ing to RF exposure, but the guidelines are not meant to apply to operation of medical  imaging equipment in Canada. Currently MR system manufacturers apply limits for MRI  equipment in alignment with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).</para>

      <title>HEALTH CANADA’S SAFETY CODE 26</title>
      <para>Safety Code 26, one of the first foundational safety MRI publications in Canada, arrived  at a time when both MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were just beginning  to gain clinical acceptance and application. As with any technology, even when beneficial  in medical applications, the potential health hazards and safety precautions are managed to  mitigate risks. There are several safety factors that must be considered with respect to the  clinical use of MRI in human subjects. The fields produced by MR systems (i.e., static mag-</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">926</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Practices, Guidelines, and Standards in Canada</emphasis></para>
      <para>netic, time-varying gradient magnetic, and RF fields) can potentially create detrimental bi- ological effects. Thus, questions have been raised regarding the safety of these electromag- netic fields generated by MR systems.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Static Magnetic Field, Gradient Magnetic Field, and RF Field Exposure Limits </emphasis></para>
      <para>The amount of RF energy deposited in the body by the RF pulse is termed the specific  absorption rate (SAR). Exposure to RF fields at certain SARs leads to local and whole- body temperature increases in the body (3). SAR is the dosimetric term, expressed in units  of watts per kilogram (W/kg), related to the rate of RF energy deposition per unit mass of  exposed body tissue (3, 4). SAR provides a quantifiable means to estimate the thermal ef- fects of the applied RF pulses used in MRI scanners. SAR is used by regulatory agencies,  including Health Canada, to establish safety guidelines relevant to RF exposure (3, 4). RF  pulses at certain SAR levels and extended exposure durations must be managed appropri- ately to reduce the amount of temperature rise in human tissues. SAR is not spatially uniform  within the human body and the spatial distribution depends on the design of the transmitter  coils, the frequency, the shape, the size and the type of tissue in the coil (3).</para>
      <para>Safety Code 26 briefly reviews the biological effects of the electromagnetic fields used  in MR devices and provides general guidance on acceptable exposure levels for the patient  and for the operator. Health Canada’s Safety Code 26 (3) recommended limits for patient  exposure can be found in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>. The levels cited in the safety code were never meant to  be considered as strict limits. Rather, if the limits were to be exceeded, an individual eval- uation was required in each scenario. The intent of the guidance document was to set an es- tablished level. Below the established level there are minimal potential hazards, and if the  level is exceeded there may not be a dangerous situation depending on the risk benefit analy- sis. Additionally, the limits outlined in the safety code have not been updated in nearly 32  years and the document serves as an early MRI exposure document.</para>

The number and duration of exposures are to be minimized  (3). There is outdated guidance on management of those who are pregnant, those with car- diac pacemakers, and those with other metallic implants and devices. Other safety issues  not directly related to human subject exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) that exist  in the MRI environment are not addressed in the safety code. These safety issues include  possible injury by projectiles (e.g., due to the forces from the static magnetic field acting  on ferromagnetic objects), injury due to the quench of a cryogenic magnet, acoustic noise  and hearing protection, and electromagnetic interference by MRI-related electromagnetic  fields with other medical devices such as patient monitoring systems, automatic injectors,  and ventilation systems (3).</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">927</emphasis></para>
      <para>is available online (5). Safety Code 6 is not applicable to deliberate exposure under the di- rection of qualified medical practitioners (5). The limits outlined in Safety Code 6 are in- tended to harmonize with other recommendations from leading international organizations,  such as those of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (IC- NIRP) (6). The limits are stated to be fairly consistent with those in the United States, Japan,  Europe, Australia, and New Zealand (7). The general public exposure limits cover a very  wide range of frequencies and err on the side of abundant caution to incorporate wide safety  margins that are far below the threshold for adverse health effects (6, 7). In the MRI equip- ment setting, the IEC standard 60601-2-33 (8) sets equipment operation limits for the patient  and operator that balance the risks and benefits of MRI technology.</para>
      <para>There is also a companion document, <emphasis role="italics">Safety Code 6 Technical Guide for Interpretation </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">and Compliance Assessment of Health Canada’s Radiofrequency Exposure Guidelines</emphasis> (9)  to aid in the interpretation of Safety Code 6. Although these documents apply to the fre- quency range used by MRI RF pulses, the safety code states, “Safety Code 6 does not apply  to the deliberate exposure for treatment of patients by, or under the direction of, medical  practitioners” (9). As an interpretation of this statement, the 2015 Revisions to Safety Code  6: Summary of Consultation Feedback (6) states, “Safety Code 6 does not cover deliberate  exposure of RF energy to medical patients or persons operating magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) or other RF-emitting medical equipment.” Instead, other international standards and  guidelines published by the provincial health ministry cover protection for RF exposure by  medical equipment and MR systems are regulated under the Food and Drugs Act (6).</para>

      <title>IEC 60601-2-33 STANDARDS</title>
      <para>In order to sell an MR system in Canada, the manufacturer must obtain a medical device  license from Health Canada. This is a complex process and Health Canada has published a  <emphasis role="italics">List of Recognized Standards for Medical Devices </emphasis>(10) that the manufacturer is encouraged  to conform with. Of particular interest to this chapter is that Health Canada has endorsed  the IEC 60601-2-33 standards for use in medical electrical equipment in the list. Although  the IEC standards are intended for manufacturers and regulators, many requirements affect  how the scanners are used and inform the development of MR system guidelines. For ex- ample, the IEC standards are used to define patient, worker, and visitor safe work practices  in the MRI environment and these are commonly followed in Canada.</para>
      <para>The IEC standards define levels of equipment operation for the patient and the MR  worker who are exposed to the MRI environment. These three levels apply to the fields en- countered in the MRI environment – the static magnetic field, the time varying magnetic  field, and the radiofrequency field. <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> is defined as equipment oper- ation where none of the fields have a value that can cause physiological stress to patients  (8). <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> is defined as equipment operation where one  or more fields reach a value that can cause physiological stress to patients and medical su- pervision becomes a requirement (8). To enter <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>, the  user must actively and deliberately choose to accept the setting. The mechanism to enter  the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> (whether a window pop up or toggle button) is  different for each system manufacturer. It is not unusual to enter this mode, however the  requirement for medical supervision while operating in the controlled modes is not optional.  <emphasis role="italics">Second Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> is defined as equipment operation where one or  more fields reach a value that can produce significant risk for patients. This mode is typically  only seen in research applications and explicit ethics approval is required (8). <emphasis role="italics">Second Level </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> must have security measures such as a password in effect to  prevent unauthorized operation. There are no specific upper limits in <emphasis role="italics">Second Level Con-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">trolled Operating Mode</emphasis> as each protocol is required to be individually approved by a review  board. The local approval by the review board shall include limits for static magnetic field,  SAR, and gradient output (8). For research applications, the informed consent of the patient  prior to the procedure is required.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">IEC Static Magnetic Field Limits  </emphasis></para>
      <para>IEC sets currently accepted limits for exposure to the static magnetic field for patients.  The static magnetic field limit for <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> is 3-T or less (8). The <emphasis role="italics">First </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> static magnetic field limit is greater than 3-T but less  than 8-T (8). The <emphasis role="italics">Second Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> limit for static magnetic field  is greater than 8-T (8). No long-lasting harmful effects can be attributed to short-term ex- posure to strong static magnetic fields because the physiologic effects are small and it is  difficult to estimate the level where strong magnetic fields become a hazard (11). The most  commonly reported sensory effects noticed above the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> by patients  and MR system operators include vertigo and nausea that are related to the rate of movement  in the static magnetic field. This is known as movement through the spatial gradient mag- netic field and has units of Tesla per second (T/s). The IEC limit for moving a patient into</para>

      <para>the bore is 3-T/s. Interestingly, this is also the value that Health Canada set in Safety Code  26 in 1987. Other effects of moving through the static field include a metallic taste in the  mouth and even magnetophosphenes when rapidly moving the eyes in high field systems  (8).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">IEC Time-Varying Gradient Magnetic Field Limits </emphasis></para>
      <para>Exposure to the time-varying gradient magnetic fields can cause peripheral nerve stim- ulation (PNS) and the onset of PNS is the threshold level (8). Uncomfortable PNS can be  tolerable to the informed patient, however intolerable PNS is the level where the scan pro- cedure must be terminated (8). When the gradient reaches a level that is capable of causing  PNS, the equipment must display a warning to the operator that the gradient output exceeds  the limits. Gradient exposure values in clinical systems are not enough to induce cardiac  stimulation, defined as an ectopic beat (8, 12). The MR system minimizes intolerable PNS.  <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> is not to exceed 80% of the PNS threshold level and <emphasis role="italics">First Level </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> is not to exceed 100% of the PNS threshold level (8). These  gradient limits are complicated and based on direct observational studies of human volun- teers, or as a default expressed as maximum values of an induced electric field, <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis> (V/m) or  as the time rate of change of the gradient magnetic field, <emphasis role="italics">dB/dt</emphasis> (8). IEC defines conditions  on how to conduct human studies to determine PNS output limits.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">IEC Acoustic Noise Level Limits and Hearing Protection  </emphasis></para>
      <para>The IEC 60601-2-33 standard states that manufacturers shall make a statement in the  instructions for use outlining, “for all equipment capable of producing more than an A- weighted root mean square (RMS) sound pressure level of 99 dB (A), hearing protection  shall be used for the safety of the patient and that this hearing protection shall be sufficient  to reduce the A-weighted RMS sound pressure level to below 99 dB (A)” (8). Patients are  typically given low-cost disposable earplugs.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">IEC Radiofrequency Limits </emphasis></para>
      <para>V<emphasis role="italics">olume Transmit RF Coil SAR Limits</emphasis>. Radiofrequency power deposition is dependent  on the type of transmit RF coil used for the MRI examination. The whole-body transmit  RF coil is built into the scanner and, when using this coil for RF transmission, the SAR  limits are defined by different means than when using a local transmit RF coil, such as a  head, knee, or wrist transmit RF coil. The patient mass that is input as a parameter in the  MR system console is used to calculate the whole body averaged SAR. The head SAR is  averaged over the mass of the head and averaged over a specified time. The partial body  SAR is averaged over the mass of the body exposed to the radiofrequency from the volume  transmit RF coil and averaged over a specified time. <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> shows the SAR limits for vol- ume transmit RF coils in Canada (8).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Local Transmit RF Coil SAR Limits</emphasis>. Local transmit RF coils are smaller than the built- in body coil and deposit RF power to smaller areas of tissue. Calculation of local RF power  deposition in the volume transmit RF coils is easier than the estimation of spatial peak SAR  for planar transmit surface coils (13). Local SAR is averaged over 10 grams of tissue in a  localized area of the body over a specified time. <emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis> shows the SAR limits for local</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italics">RF Power Deposition Temperature Limits</emphasis>. In Canada, MR systems are programmed to  operate according to the IEC standards for equipment operation, given scanner room tem- perature of less than 25°C. At higher temperatures, the values for whole-body SAR are re- duced by 0.25 W/kg per degree of room temperature over 25°C until the SAR is adjusted  to 2 W/kg or the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> (8). The limits in <emphasis role="bold">Table 4</emphasis> outline the temperature  limits for RF energy deposition and are viewed as conservative limits. IEC states that higher  temperatures may be permitted if there is no unacceptable risk for the patient. For this rea- son, operation in the <emphasis role="italics">Second Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> does not have an upper limit,  and, is based on the approval of a review board for research studies.</para>

Patient safety concerns are related to screening, implant  safety, and the use of contrast agents, sedatives, and anaesthetics. Regarding staff, the Cana- dian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS) explains the 14 jurisdictions in  Canada: one federal, ten provincial and three territorial (16). These jurisdictions each have  legislation and guidelines that outline safety standards for workers, supervisors, and em- ployers. In Canada, the resources commonly used by an MRI facility include the following:</para>

      <para>MRI safety practices, that empower staff and providers who are experts in the field,  form the foundational building blocks of a safety culture. The list above is very helpful  when formulating guidelines, SOPs, and policies for departmental operations of MRI facil- ities. When drafting safety documents, the standards must be in alignment with any appli- cable national or provincial legislation and regulations. The main resources that inform  guidelines and standards are the CAR standards (21-23) and the CAMRT BPGs (24). The  provincial Workplace Safety and Health Regulations, the Regulated Health Professions Act  (RHPA), the site administration, the MRI staff, and the regulatory colleges ensure that work  in the MRI environment is safe for operators, patients, and the public. Other recognized re- sources that help shape the policies and procedures in Canadian MRI to be more safety-ori- ented are the annually updated <emphasis role="italics">Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">and Devices</emphasis>, the MRIsafety.com website, the <emphasis role="italics">ACR Guidance Document on MR Safe Prac-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">tices: 2013</emphasis>, and the <emphasis role="italics">ACR Guidance Document on MR Safe Practices: 2019 update</emphasis> (17, 18,  19, 20).</para>

Canadian imaging techniques may  vary from site to site, but many similarities can be seen in clinical indications, applications,  and safety practices. The radiologist/clinician collaboration determines the appropriateness  of a given examination for a particular patient. CAR has worked extensively to develop  standards and referral guidelines for each diagnostic discipline. In Canada, Medical Radi- ation Technologists (MRTs) in collaboration with radiologists develop procedures, using  clinical experience and judgment, to provide diagnostic imaging that is in the patient’s best  interest (24). Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) recommends that safety policies  and procedures can be reviewed annually by the supervising diagnostic radiologist, the lead  MRI technologist, and the other team members for feedback, clarification, discussion, and  review. Collaborative development of safety guidelines with frontline staff contributes to a  culture of safety for staff, patients, and visitors to the MRI department. The recommenda- tions point to the importance of incident reporting in quality improvement initiatives in  order to build on professional development and optimize learning.</para>

      <title>CLINICAL STANDARDS FOR MRI</title>
      <para>The <emphasis role="italics">CAR Standard for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</emphasis>, published in 2011 is the most  current version detailing the guidelines recommended for clinical MRI service provision.  This document is freely available on the CAR website. These standards offer a very basic  overview of MRI safety considerations in MRI departments. The section on MRI safety  points correctly to commonly accepted reference material, but discusses practices at a rudi- mentary level. The clinical standards avoid being overly prescriptive and focus largely on  the recognized clinical applications of MRI for neurological, abdominal, pelvic, muscu- loskeletal, cardiovascular, thoracic, breast, and fetal imaging (21). Other items of interest  that are discussed briefly include MR system specifications, equipment, quality control, ac- ceptance testing, quality improvement, qualifications of personnel, contrast usage, sedation,  and general anesthesia recommendations. Unfortunately, discussion of labeling and implants  uses outdated terminology and glosses over the many safety considerations encountered in  modern MRI facilities.</para>

      <title>CONTROLLED ACCESS, LABELING, AND SAFETY PRACTICES</title>
      <para>MRI technologists are responsible for policy development, screening, patient advocacy,  preparation, safe work procedures, in addition to safe operation of the equipment. MRI tech- nologists are primarily responsible for controlling access and the safety of patients, visitors,  and staff. The CAR MRI standards provide advice on how to mitigate risks related to the  strong static magnetic field with respect to implants, ferromagnetic objects, and cryogenic  requirements. Canadians follow strict guidelines related to supervised and controlled access  in MRI departments. The CAMRT supports the principle of controlled access in preventing  accidents, reducing the risk of fatal injury, ensuring expensive medical devices and systems  are not damaged, mitigating downtime, and maintaining a safe and effective working envi- ronment (24).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">936</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Practices, Guidelines, and Standards in Canada</emphasis></para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Facility Design, Controlled Access, and Safety Zones  </emphasis></para>
      <para>CAMRT endorses the four zone approach as described by the American College of Ra- diology to MRI facility design with the aim of minimizing safety risks (24). A four zone  design approach controls access to the MRI environment and keeps other healthcare per- sonnel away from areas of danger (17, 24). To ensure controlled access and restrictions  within the MRI environment, many sites develop a map showing the zones and designate a  Magnetic Resonance Safety Officer (MRSO) or a lead technologist to enforce safety prin- ciples. Controlling access is an important safety mechanism to prevent accidents and reduce  risks due to projectile hazards, ensure that expensive medical equipment is not damaged,  mitigate downtime, and maintain a safe work environment for staff (24). For safety, it is  common to break an MR imaging department into four distinct zones. Zone I is defined as  any area that is freely accessible to the general public. Zone II is where patients and visitors  enter the MRI department, typically the reception and registration area where there is public  access. Zone II is where unscreened individuals complete the safety questionnaire and MRI  screening checklist. Zone III is a restricted access, controlled area (ideally with a physical  barrier in newer departments) with key or swipe card access for Level 2 Personnel. Zone  III and IV are locked down when not under direct supervision of Level 2 Personnel for the  safety of staff, patients, visitors and the facility (24). All persons entering Zone III must be  under direct supervision of Level 2 MR personnel (24). Zone IV is the MR scanner room  and any area where the fringe field exceeds 0.5 mT. Some sites choose to mark the fringe  field of the static magnetic field at the 0.5 mT (or 5 Gauss) line, as a safety mechanism and  exclusion zone for implants and other electronic devices. Design components in MRI de- partments can physically restrict access in Zone III and IV due to the risks of the MRI en- vironment. Multiple entrances to the MR scanner room are not generally advised.</para>
      <para>The IEC standards also define the reasoning behind the controlled environment in the  technical description of the MRI equipment in Section 201.7.9.3.101 (8). The <emphasis role="italics">controlled </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">environment</emphasis> is required when the 0.5 mT fringe field extends outside of the equipment  cover. The manufacturer shall give markings on the floor to control access by unauthorized  persons, labeled at all entries by warning signs indicating the presence of static magnetic  fields, and warn about the attractive and torqueing forces of the MR system (8). MR per- sonnel are aware of the potential hazards of static magnetic and RF fields and must relay  this information to other healthcare professionals and maintenance staff. MRI facilities meet  the conditions for a <emphasis role="italics">controlled environment</emphasis> due to RF emissions. The MR system room  shall not be freely accessible to the general public. IEC requires that there will be RF shield- ing and warning signs indicating that occupancy is “restricted to authorized personnel only”  at all viewing distances and angles where access to the controlled environment is possible  (8). The placement of signage is required prior to entry to the department and at the entrance  to the controlled environment to clearly identify the presence of RF emissions in the area  (8, 9).</para>
      <para>The CAMRT best practice guidelines define Level 2 MR Personnel as those who control  and authorize access to the MRI environment and maintain a presence at all times during  the performance of MRI exams (24). Entry into controlled access areas can only be author- ized by Level 2 MR Personnel (17, 24). Level 2 MR Personnel in Canada are CAMRT reg- istered MRI technologists (RTMRs) that have passed a national certification examination</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">937</emphasis></para>
      <para>in the discipline of MRI (24).  Other Level 2 MR Personnel include MRI physicists, scien- tists, radiologists, and physicians who have undergone extensive MRI safety training. Level  1 MR Personnel are defined as those who are minimally educated on MRI safety issues  with enough training to ensure their own safety. Access to the MR system room is restricted  to only screened patients, Level 2 MR Personnel, and other screened facility or Level 1 MR  Personnel that are educated on MRI safety procedures.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Signage and Labeling of MRI Devices </emphasis></para>
      <para>Recommendations from the CAMRT outline the need for “clear and explicit signage”  to reinforce the four zone safety concept (24). These signs are normally placed when a new  scanner is installed.  Examples of signage, as recommended by the CAMRT (24) are:</para>
      <para>Permanent demarcation of the 0.5-mT (5 Gauss) line  • Prominent “Do Not Enter” danger signs on the MR system room door  • “Magnet Always On” lighted signs running on back-up power  • “Magnet Always On” signage above or beside the MR system room door  • MRI departmental zone signs indicating restricted access in Zones III and IV  •</para>
      <para>All equipment used in Zones III or IV, such as IV poles, wheelchairs, and stretchers  should be labeled to indicate the conditions of use. MRI labeling guidelines are in accor- dance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F2503 standards that  are referenced by the ACR guidance document, the IEC, and the most current Reference  Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices  (8, 17, 19, 27). The CAR  and the CAMRT follow the standards used for labeling, although the definitions in the stan- dards and on the CAMRT website need to be updated to reference current information  sources and accepted terminology. The accepted international criterion breaks down all ob- jects into <emphasis role="italics">MR Safe</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="italics">MR Unsafe</emphasis> statuses. The <emphasis role="italics">MR Safe</emphasis> designation  refers to an object that poses not known hazards in all MRI environments and is non-metal- lic, non-conducting, and nonmagnetic. The icon is a green square or box with “MR” written  on or inside the box. <emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional</emphasis> is an object that may or may not be safe depending  on specific and well-defined conditions. The icon is a yellow triangle with “MR” in black  letters incorporated into the triangle. The specific conditions are variable and include limits  on static and maximum spatial gradient of the magnetic field, <emphasis role="italics">dB/dt </emphasis>(gradient output) limits,  RF field limits, and SAR limits. Finally, the <emphasis role="italics">MR Unsafe</emphasis> designation and status applies to  an item that is known to pose a hazard in all MRI environments. The icon is a red circle  with a diagonal line through the letters “MR.”</para>
      <para>One role of the lead technologist or MRSO is to create safety policies in conjunction  with the medical director. Other roles of the lead technologist include categorizing staff, la- beling items in Zones III and IV, and ensuring appropriate signage exists. These individuals  also educate facility staff, code team members, security officers, and support staff in MRI  environment safety. The lead technologist or MRSO is responsible for education of local  fire and police teams to ensure a safe informed response for emergency situations in the  MRI setting. Other education, such as refresher training and practice runs of mock emer- gency situations are useful to ensure that MRI department safety practices are understood  by all emergency responders or those who routinely enter the MRI environment.</para>

      <para>To ensure that MR Unsafe devices are not brought into the MR system room, strict  safety protocols can be developed to label all items in the department and prevent unautho- rized access to the MR system room. Recommended safety guidelines for preventing missile  effect accidents are widely accepted in Canada and can be found in the current Reference  Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices (19).

      <title>MRI SCREENING PROCEDURES AND IMPLANT SAFETY</title>
      <para>Canadian MRI technologists are certified with the CAMRT and responsible for the  safety of the patient, including conducting highly effective screening procedures, ensuring  appropriate preparation of the patient for the MRI procedure, maintaining departmental  safety, and operating the equipment. Many sites choose to have hard copy and online access  to current MRI safety resources, including the Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance  Safety, Implants, and Devices (19) and the MRI safety website, mrisafety.com (20). There  must be site policy outlining what documents are required to ensure accurate and effective  screening of the patient and/or any individuals required to go into Zone IV. The development  of effective screening procedures ensures that preventable injuries to patients, visitors, staff  members, and Level 2 MR Personnel do not occur.</para>
      <para>The screening procedures in Canada follow a multi-step process, without exception,  prior to the MRI examination. The initial step is pre-screening performed by the referring  physician, but frequently this step is missed and relevant information is often missing on  the requisition or referral. The second step occurs upon receipt of the paperwork where the  clerical staff, the technologists, and the radiologists pre-screen the requisition for any con- traindicated devices or conditions that may complicate imaging. Some sites opt to complete  a quick confirmation checklist (extra step) over the phone during the scheduling process  with the patient using an abbreviated series of questions to pick up major issues prior to pa- tient arrival. Additionally, an information sheet may be sent out in the mailed appointment  letter directing the patient to phone the department if they have any contraindicated devices  or pre-existing medical conditions prior to arrival.</para>
      <para>Once the patient is in the department, the MR staff will greet and provide the patient  with screening forms to complete prior to commencing the procedure. The third step in the  screening process is completion of the MRI screening forms. Patients and other persons en- tering the MRI scanner room must complete the screening forms. The forms in Canada can  be from international resources, such as the PDF forms on the MRI safety website and in  the Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices (19). There  are example forms available on the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Med- icine (ISMRM) website (28). There are examples of screening forms in other languages on  both ISMRM website and www.MRIsafety.com.  In Canada, the two official languages are  English and French. When language and fluency pose issues to screening, the help of a fam- ily member or translator can assist with the screening process. In the case of patients who  are hearing or visually impaired, the technologist can use other methods of communicating  with the patient prior to and during the examination, including the services of an ASL trans- lator.</para>
      <para>The fourth step in the screening process is a verbal screening review of the form with  the patient by Level 2 MR Personnel. The MRI technologist greets the patient and introduces  themselves by name and occupation, then provides a description of the test to be performed.  The use of the name, occupation, duty (commonly called a “NOD” in Canada) increases</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">940</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Practices, Guidelines, and Standards in Canada</emphasis></para>
      <para>patient satisfaction and builds trust into healthcare interactions. The screening process is  one of the most important patient safety components that technologists assume in their daily  routine to reduce the risk of harm and minimize potential hazards to the patient (24). Tech- nologists must explain the importance of obtaining relevant and accurate safety information  to ensure patients and their escorts understand the implications of withholding relevant in- formation. The technologist will attempt to answer relevant questions posed by the patient,  family, guardian, public trustee, or escort.</para>
      <para>The MRI technologist performs diagnostic services that deliver benefits and minimize  risks (24). The use of checklists enhances information exchange between two parties. Any  questions or concerns the patient or technologist has regarding contrast, sedation, claustro- phobia, implanted devices, or past surgery can be discussed prior to the examination. Tech- nologists with experience clue in when patients have not filled out the checklist adequately  or accurately prior to the examination. The MRI technologist and the patient (or a family  member, guardian, or public trustee who knows the pertinent medical history) signs off the  screening form to ensure both parties are in full understanding of the procedure. Typically,  there is a reminder discussing the safety risks associated with not accurately divulging in- formation. The patient completes the screening form prior to each MR imaging study to en- sure current information about the patient’s medical history. Effective screening includes  asking the patient about all prior surgeries, medical conditions, pregnancy, and claustro- phobia. Prior to contrast administration, the technologist screens for additional information  such as medications, medical conditions, drug allergies, and a history of liver or kidney  failure. If necessary, the patient and technologist complete and sign the contrast forms prior  to the initiation of venipuncture.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Screening of Visitors and Staff Entering the MRI Environment </emphasis></para>
      <para>Visitors to the MRI department may be nurses, healthcare aids, physicians, maintenance,  support and trades staff, fire department members, prison guards, paramedics, and other es- corts. All staff members or escorts required to enter the scanner room must fill out the  screening form and be verbally screened prior to being granted access to the MR system  room. For visitors who assist in the department regularly, completed forms may be kept in  a secure location for ease of reference.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Screening of High Risk Patients </emphasis></para>
      <para>In the case of patients who cannot fill out the screening form, other mechanisms can be  used to ensure safety. High-risk patients tend to be those where screening or communication  is a challenge and may be:</para>
      <para>Unconscious  • Hospitalized and non-ambulatory  • Unable to communicate  • Sedated or heavily medicated  • Exhibiting psychiatric disturbances (including dementia or confusion)  • Exhibiting violent behaviour  • Infants or neonates  •</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">941</emphasis></para>
      <para>These individuals may be screened with the assistance of a family member, guardian,  or public trustee who knows their entire medical history and condition. If the information  is not adequate, prior imaging studies that are recent can be reviewed. Alternately, radi- ographs can be obtained of the chest, abdomen, skull, pelvis, and other areas as per discus- sion with the radiologist. The patient can be inspected for scars related to surgical procedures  or bumps that may indicate implanted devices. In all occasions, implanted devices or foreign  object clearance must be obtained prior to the scan. If the information is not available, the  radiologist and referring clinician may do a risk vs. benefit assessment on whether or not  to proceed with the scan. In the case of emergency scans where verbal screening cannot be  performed and no reliable medical history can be provided, the patient may undergo radi- ographic imaging of the skull, orbits, chest, abdomen, and pelvis to exclude metallic foreign  objects or implanted devices (24).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Implanted Devices  </emphasis></para>
      <para>The Canadian <emphasis role="italics">Medical Devices Regulations</emphasis> requires that manufacturers shall provide  patients with 2 implant registration cards, specifically the manufacturer information, a notice  regarding the purpose of the card, and up-to-date address information for the purpose of in- formation exchange (29). The card is to be designed for recording the name of the device  including the control number, the name of the healthcare professional who implanted the  device, the date of implantation, the healthcare facility where the device was implanted,  and the patient’s name (29). This legislation is covered by the <emphasis role="italics">Food and Drugs Act</emphasis> (30).  Section 67 indicates that a staff member at the healthcare facility where the implantation  takes place will fill out the implant registration card and give one to the patient and the  manufacturer. Despite this being a legal requirement, often the patient misplaces this infor- mation or the physician may not provide the relevant implant information.</para>
      <para>In the screening process the technologist often identifies the presence of medical im- plants and/or devices, and is tasked with obtaining the device or implant information, in- cluding the model, reference, and/or serial number from the surgical or operative reports.  In certain situations, the manufacturer may need to be contacted for MR-specific information  regarding safety of the device in the MRI setting. The <emphasis role="italics">Reference Manual for Magnetic Res-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">onance Safety, Implants, and Devices</emphasis> and the MRI safety website are often consulted in  Canada to determine safety and exposure conditions prior to the scan (19, 20). Implants and  safe scanning practices are classified separately for passive and active implants. The relevant  information that the technologist must gather includes the type of implant, the location of  the surgery, the surgeon, the date of the surgery, the operative and perioperative documen- tation, and any product stickers or ID cards related to the implant.</para>
      <para>Common implants such as stents, aneurysm clips, heart valves, joint replacements,  screws, rods, and fixation devices are considered to be passive implants. Active implants  include electronically active devices such as cardiac pacemakers, implantable cardioverter  defibrillators (ICDs), infusion pumps, cochlear implants, and spinal cord or deep brain stim- ulation (DBS) systems. Sites ought to have local policies and procedures for scanning im- plants and devices. In the case of active implants, the MRI physicist may be consulted to  ensure the safety of scanning these devices. Additionally, the manufacturer information for  scan conditions must be available for consultation. In some cases, a representative from the</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">942</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Practices, Guidelines, and Standards in Canada</emphasis></para>
      <para>manufacturer may assist or require paperwork to be completed. In the case of scanning  pacemakers and defibrillators, commonly called Cardiac Implanted Electronic Devices  (CIEDs) the CAR has official guidance (31). Often, the presence of support staff from car- diology or neurology is required to ensure functionality of the device, and may be required  to test or reset the device post MRI examination. In all cases, adequate documentation and  follow through with post examination care is essential.</para>
      <para>Conditions to consider when scanning implants are magnetic field strength, spatial gra- dients, torqueing, heating and SAR or B1+RMS restrictions, artifacts, induced currents in  conductors, the physical properties and dimensions of the object or device, the location of  the object near vital structures, and the amount of counter forces on the object from normal  physiology, encapsulation, or scarring (19, 24). For further information on these types of  issues, Canadian MRI technologists consult the most recent edition of the <emphasis role="italics">Reference Manual </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices</emphasis>. In the case of electronically active  devices, the MR professionals will contact the manufacturer for the most recent and updated  labeling information prior to performing an MRI examination on the patient (19).</para>
      <para>In 2019, CADTH issued a rapid response report entitled <emphasis role="italics">Magnetic Resonance Imaging </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">for Patients with Implantable Cardiac Devices: A Review of Safety and Guidelines</emphasis>. The re- port explores reported adverse safety events occurring in literature when patients with con- ventional and <emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional</emphasis> CIEDs are scanned. The document includes loop recorders  in the discussion, however <emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional</emphasis> loop recorders have been scanned in Canada  for many years following specific conditions. The report does not appear to be written by a  person with a great deal of MR experience. The report assessed literature from outside of  Canada, mostly in the United States, regarding the use of MRI in patients with <emphasis role="italics">MR Condi-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">tional</emphasis> or non-<emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional</emphasis>, conventional or “standard” cardiac devices. The report ac- knowledged the lack of primary studies with high quality evidence for scanning patients  with conventional cardiac devices and the lack of information from Canada, where med- ically implanted devices might be different from those implanted in the United States (32).  The available evidence did suggest few adverse events in the 13 relevant publications that  were identified, but could not provide evidence-based guidelines because of the small sam- ple size and might fail to detect adverse outcomes (32).</para>
      <para>Canada has been slow to adopt scanning patients with CIEDs outside of large, special- ized centers. For this reason, CAR and the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society published a  consensus statement with recommendations on MR imaging of those with CIEDs. Of par- ticular note, the document uses the correct terminology of device and implant labeling and  discusses the challenges of identifying patients with MR Conditional systems (31). The  document discusses the risks, considerations, consent, abbreviated scan protocols, coils,  and monitoring requirements. The recommended field strength to scan CIED is 1.5 T, with  a SAR of less than or equal to 2 W/kg for each sequence, and a slew rate of less than 200  T/m/s (33). CAR advises against scanning patients with abandoned leads. The recommended  process is a collaborative approach between the cardiac clinic, cardiologists, MRI radiolo- gists, MRI technologists, MRI physicists, and nurses (31). The development of a working  SOP is essential. Larger tertiary care centers in Canada, with the aid of cardiologists and  radiologists working collaboratively, do scan patients with <emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional</emphasis> pacemakers and  defibrillators.

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Foreign Metallic Object Screening </emphasis></para>
      <para>Effective screening procedures pick up any potential internal foreign metallic objects  in the patient that may prove to be a contraindication to MR imaging. If there is concern re- garding the possibility of an orbital or other foreign metallic object such as a bullet, shrapnel,  BB, pellet, or other penetrating or retained metallic object in the patient, radiographs may  be obtained. The technologist will then ask the radiologist to interpret the radiographs. In  the particular case of a possible orbital foreign body where the patient has sought medical  attention, radiographs are recommended. The ACR advises that radiographs can be used in  screening the orbits with one or two radiographic views and that a previous MRI examina- tion without incident after the orbital trauma does not prove the safety to subsequently scan  the patient (18). Clinical history and timelines of the injury must be accurately recorded by  the technologist upon verbal clarification of the injury with the patient.</para>
      <para>In clinical practice, CT and radiographic imaging of the area in question that is recent  or performed after the injury or surgical procedure is required to screen for the presence of  contraindicated objects. The technologist keeps the patient informed of the situation and  any delays encountered prior to imaging. Information is presented in clear and simple lan- guage to ensure that the patient or caregivers understand the reasons for the delay (24). If  the technologist cannot answer the patient’s question, and the issue falls outside of their  scope of practice, they will involve the radiologist in the discussion. The radiologist becomes  involved with approval to proceed with the scan after a review of any additional imaging.</para>
      <para>On very rare occasions, the patient neglects to disclose a metallic foreign body or im- planted device. This may be due to cognitive issues or out of fear that the examination might  be cancelled. When the technologist becomes aware of an undisclosed foreign metallic ob- ject and visualizes an artifact on scouts or MR images, they must notify the radiologist im- mediately and slowly remove the patient from the MR system (24). The patient ideally  remains parallel to the scanner and as far out of the fringe field as possible in a supine po- sition (24). When out of the room, the technologist will explain to the patient why the ex- amination is being aborted. The patient may be questioned further and sent for imaging  upon the radiologist’s request. Attempts may be made to obtain medical records that indicate  what object is located in the patient.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Detection of Ferromagnetic Metallic Objects </emphasis></para>
      <para>Detection methods to identify any ferromagnetic objects prior to MR system room entry  must be employed at all times. The Level 2 MR Personnel will visually screen the patient  for any metallic objects, quarantine any foreign metallic objects, and lock up the patient’s  valuables. Patients who are deemed safe to enter the MRI environment are often required  to change into MR Safe clothing provided by the imaging department prior to entry into  the MR system room (18, 19). MRI technologists then direct the patient to the entrance to  Zone IV and perform a final screening and <emphasis role="italics">“full-stop and final check”</emphasis> at the doorway to  ensure no objects, such as dental work, hearing aids, or assistive devices get into the room  (18, 19). Some sites employ ferromagnetic detection systems in the doorway to identify</para>

      <para>any hazards that may have been missed for those patients who can walk through the entrance  to Zone IV unassisted. Other sites may use a handheld wand.</para>
      <para>At times, additional information is needed by the radiologist for interpretation prior to  authorization of the MRI examination. Mechanisms to ensure safety of those who are  deemed high risk patients, those with implanted devices, and those who may not be able to  fill out the screening questionnaire accurately are essential. MRI technologists understand  when it is necessary to request further imaging as required by the radiologist to “clear” the  patient. Radiologist assistance is often required for clearance prior to the MRI examination  and to review other previously acquired diagnostic information, such as radiographic or CT  studies. The supervising radiologist has the final approval on making an informed decision  to scan the patient, recommend an alternate modality, or determine if there are further con- siderations to be made regarding the safety of the MRI examination. The radiologist may  require additional information upon collaboration with the MRI technologist, who must as- sist in obtaining all pertinent information while advocating in the best interest of the pa- tient.</para>
      <para>Patients who are non-ambulatory and arrive in by stretcher, wheelchair, or with assistive  devices pose another challenge, especially on older MR systems without detachable tables.  The MRI department has a variety of MR Safe or MR Conditional equipment available for  non-ambulatory patients. Thorough preparation, in addition to collaboratively working with  intensive care unit staff and surgeons (in the case of intraoperative MR), prior to transporting  the patient into the scanner room is mandatory. Often, a final team <emphasis role="italics">“full-stop and final </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">check”</emphasis> prior to room entry to look for oxygen tanks, monitoring devices and equipment,  extraneous objects on or in the non-MRI staff member’s clothing, is an excellent mechanism  to pick up metallic objects that may have previously gone undetected. All individuals en- tering the MR system room must be re-educated and re-screened each time they assist in  the MRI environment.</para>

      <title>TIME-VARYING MAGNETIC FIELD ISSUES</title>
      <para>The major issues related to time varying (gradient) magnetic fields are related to induced  currents, peripheral nerve stimulation, and acoustic noise. There does not appear to be a  great deal of information on induced currents and PNS in the Canadian guidance documents.  For safety limits related to PNS, technologists may wish to consult the IEC standards. The  limits the IEC outlines for peripheral nerve stimulation set the exposure level below the  threshold of painful nerve stimulation on the MR system. Induced currents related to the  rapidly switching gradients are of particular importance to medical implants that are con- ductive and electrically active.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Acoustic Noise and Hearing Protection  </emphasis></para>
      <para>Acoustic noise is a serious safety concern and degrades verbal communication between  the technologist and the patient. The gradient magnetic fields, when activated, can generate  a wide variety of intermittent noises, such as clicks, knocks and taps, depending on the  pulse sequence used (24). Noise is a hazard inherent to MRI environments for both patients  and others who are required to remain in the MRI scanner room and each person has a dif-</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">945</emphasis></para>
      <para>ferent threshold for noise tolerance. Biological responses and effects such as annoyance,  anxiety, communication interference, and transient or permanent hearing loss in extreme  situations are related to noise exposure (19). The average noise levels generated in the MRI  scanner can vary greatly, but are typically in the range of 82 to 93 decibels (dB) on the A- weighted scale (20). Other worst-case scenarios report noise levels of up to 115 dBA for  EPI protocols on 1.5 T (19). Studies conducted at 3 T have shown levels in the range of  126 to 131 dB where the recommendation is to provide the patient with properly fitting  earplugs and headphones (19). Thin slice acquisitions, small field of view (FOV) scans,  three-dimensional scans, fast GRE pulse sequences, and EPI pulse sequences are well  known to generate the highest sound pressure levels. IEC standards state that every person  required to be in the scanner room during MR image acquisition is required to wear hearing  protection such as earplugs, plastic noise-reducing headphones, or ear muffs if the sound  pressures are expected to exceed 99 dB (A), but Canada has different guidelines for envi- ronments where workers are exposed to noise.</para>
      <para>Health Canada stipulates levels of sound permissible for workers. Occupational expo- sure limits (OELs) for noise in the <emphasis role="italics">Canada Occupational Safety and Health Regulations</emphasis>,  (e,SOR/86-304) take into account different noise levels and sound pressure levels using the  A-weighted sound pressure levels in dBA (14). CCOHS outlines that the noise exposure  assessment is to be conducted in accordance with CSA standard Z107.56-13 <emphasis role="italics">Measurement </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">of Noise Exposure</emphasis> (14, 33). The CSA Group (formerly known as the Canadian Standards  Association) is an independent, impartial organization that develops standards and codes  in Canada, similar to ANSI in the United States. The organization tests and certifies brands  to ensure they comply with U.S. standards such as those written by ANSI, ASME, ASSE,  ASTM, ASFE, UL, CSA, NSF, and more (34). The CSA seal is affixed to all objects in  Canada that are deemed CSA approved, such as hearing protection that conforms to the  CSA Standard Z94.2<emphasis role="italics">-14 Hearing Protection Devices – Performance, Selection, Care and </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Use </emphasis>(14, 34).</para>
      <para>The employer is required to appoint qualified personnel to carry out an investigation if  an employee’s hearing is endangered by noise levels and must provide hearing protection  for noise exposures for 8 hours of exposure to noise levels above 87 dBA (14, 35). Noise  level regulations are permissible to noise exposure levels for 8 hours of continuous noise  and/or impulse/impact noise levels that are defined in peak pressure levels (35). The noise  exposure levels for an 8-hour continuous exposure (Lex8) are lower than peak pressure lev- els. Additionally, there are exchange rates that mean that as the sound level increases, the  exposure time must be decreased. For instance, if the sound level is doubled, exposure du- ration is halved (35).</para>
      <para>The provinces and territories have lower noise exposure limits of 85 dBA. These reg- ulations are commonly outlined in the <emphasis role="italics">Workplace Safety and Health Act</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">Regulations </emphasis> (36). For instance, in Manitoba, there is the <emphasis role="italics">Workplace Safety and Health Act</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">Regula-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">tions</emphasis> (Man. Reg. 217/2006) and the employer is required to make regulations available to  staff. Clear and visible warning signs must be located at all entrances into the workplace  where noise levels are greater than 85 dBA (36). The warning sign shall include a pictogram,  according to CSA Standard CAN/CSA-Z321-96, <emphasis role="italics">Signs and Symbols for the Workplace </emphasis>(36).  Further, employers are required to make hearing protection available to employees that are</para>

      <para>MRI staff members must explain and educate the patient on expected noise levels and  the options for hearing protection prior to commencing the scan. Hearing protection is usu- ally provided in the form of disposable earplugs that are non-latex containing and that have  noise reduction rates (NRR) of up to 30 dB. Earplugs have an effective rating of 50% and  can abate noise by 10 – 30 dB when used properly (19, 37). MRI personnel will instruct or  assist the subject on the proper usage of earplugs to ensure conformance and adequate fit- ting. There are system headphones that can be used in addition to earplugs to play music  and improve the overall MRI experience. MRI departments can purchase earmuffs that are  MR Safe and reduce noise levels in the room with an effective rating of 70% (37). Hearing  protection alternatives known as “mini-muffs” work well for pediatric and neonatal patients.  Newer variations of common pulse sequences have also been developed by manufacturers  specifically to reduce noise levels for a wide range of applications, such as pediatric imag- ing.</para>

      <title>PATIENT MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING</title>
      <para>Preparation of the patient prior to the MRI is critical to a successful examination.  Through proper preparation, the quality and safety of the examination are improved. In- structions are often given the patient prior to the procedure regarding fasting, the reasons  behind preparations, and other important information related to the procedure (24). Simply  asking the patient if they need to use the washroom prior to imaging, can mean the difference  between a complete and incomplete MRI examination. Monitoring of the patient is an im- portant safety measure taken to reduce the potential for heating or adverse outcomes of the  test.  Discussions regarding the emergency call systems, contrast usage, or often the use of  sedation or other medications leads up to a successful scan without unwanted delays. Other  design elements that allow the MR staff to supervise patient care areas from the console  are useful, such as closed-circuit video surveillance systems. System manufacturers must  provide a means to monitor the patient in the MR system. Ideally this is a camera to monitor  the patient during a scan directed into the end of the bore.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">RF Power Deposition Limits  </emphasis></para>
      <para>Tissue heating is the primary established bioeffect of RF field exposure. Thermal in- juries related to MR system burns are one of the most common adverse events encountered  in the MRI department (24). The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)  publishes standards for the medical diagnostic device industry and has stated that when “an  insulated slab of tissue at thermal equilibrium with the environment is exposed to SAR of  1 W/kg, the temperature will increase at a rate of 1°C per hour” (38). NEMA considers RF  heating to be within safe levels if exposures to RF fields during scanning are insufficient to  produce a core temperature rise of 1°C and localized heating of 38°C in the head, 39°C in  the trunk, and 40°C in the extremities (38). NEMA and device manufacturers are required  to ensure that medical equipment operates within the levels recommended by the IEC  60601-2-33 standards.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">947</emphasis></para>
      <para>The SAR determination is done by either the calorimetric or the pulse energy methods  (38). Calorimetric methodology calculates the absorbed RF power directly (38). The pulse  energy method measures the net power delivered to the transmitter, minus the losses, to  measure the absorbed power (38). SAR is defined as either maximum whole-body SAR or  peak spatially-averaged SAR. Restrictions exist for both whole-body averaged SAR and  peak spatially-averaged SAR. Maximum whole-body averaged SAR is the term applicable  to RF exposure that is averaged over the entire body. SAR is limited to avoid RF field in- duced thermal responses and the resultant alterations of core body temperature in humans  (5).</para>
      <para>In an adult human body weighing 62 kg, there are 62,000 discrete one-gram tissue  parcels in an unending variety of configurations, each with complex compositions and dif- ferent heat dispersal characteristics. Peak spatially-averaged SAR is the term applicable to  RF exposure that is averaged over a small cubical volume (typically 1 to 10 grams) over a  specified time (5, 19, 38). Thermoregulation in these discrete volumes can most often effi- ciently dissipate heat and avoid body temperature changes greater than 1°C (5). SAR cal- culations are difficult to calculate during MRI and measure in the human body (19, 38).  The main factors to consider (19, 39) related to SAR and RF power deposition, include:</para>
      <para>MRI scanning parameters  • Resonant frequency of the MR system   • TR, number images/TR  • RF pulses (bandwidth, flip angle, waveform, duty cycle)  • Saturation pulses (water excitation, fat suppression, magnetization, spatial, IR)  • Pulse sequences   • Type of transmit RF coils (local RF coils minimize RF exposure)  • Patient anatomy and physiology  • Larger diameter structures absorb more power (38),  • Orientation of the body  • Shape of the anatomy  • Particular volume of tissue in the coil   • Physiological processes (blood flow, perspiration)  • Environmental conditions (blankets, clothing, air flow, ambient room temperature)  •</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Prevention of Thermal Injuries </emphasis></para>
      <para>Prevention is imperative to avoid excessive RF power deposition that may result in high  tissue temperature increases. MRI technologists understand how the RF coils work and the  differences between local and volume coil SAR deposition limits. Communication with pa- tients throughout the examinations ensures the patient is not having any unusual experiences.  For example, if the patient feels any heating, this must be addressed immediately by check- ing to make sure contributing factors are minimized. Preparation of the patient must include  an explanation by the technologist regarding the potential for heating, and the normal heat- ing to be expected with the MRI examination. This is especially critical if the patient has  tattoos or medical implants. Patients will ideally change into hospital gowns and clothing  to prevent burns that may be caused from metallic threads in the clothing (17, 19, 24). In  patients who are unable to communicate, further care must be taken to ensure that no po- tential for excessive heating exists, including keeping the scanner in the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating </emphasis></para>

Scanning in the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> re- quires constant medical supervision (and a communicative patient) if employed. Burns can  occur even when operating in the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>Each MRI facility establishes local policy to ensure radiofrequency power deposition  limits are within recommended limits. The IEC regulates the settings in the scanner, de- pending on input variables, such as weight, height, position of the patient, in addition to the  type of transmit RF coil used. The MR system vendor, field service engineer, and the MRI  physicist ensure that the equipment is operating within the limits specified by the IEC. Out- lining ideal conditions for imaging ensures that operators know how to mitigate burn risks  and manage alerts that may pop up on the system. Prevention of adverse events due to ex- cessive thermal heating can be achieved through a variety of mechanisms. The recom- mended practices to avoid burns can be grouped into categories and include (17, 19, 21,  24, 39):</para>
      <para>Environmental Conditions  • Maintain scanner room temperatures between 18 – 22°C   • Maintain scanner room humidity between 40 to 60%  • Increase air flow  • Screening and Patient Preparation  • Change patients into MR Safe clothing  • Remove unnecessary metallic objects from within the scanner bore and on the patient  • Remove foil medication patches  • Scan tattoos and permanent cosmetics with care  • Visually inspect for metallic objects on skin and under sheets   • Remove thermal heating blankets  • Patient Monitoring  • Monitor patients closely  • Educate patients on call bell use  • Warn patients to report heating or uncomfortable sensations  • Remove blankets  • Stop the scan if the patient is sweating profusely or reports warming  • Scan in <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> if the patient is febrile or has a condition that compro- • mises thermoregulation  Patient Positioning  • Avoid bore contact points  • Use insulation pads of at least 1 cm thickness between bore, transmitter, and contact points   • Avoid “cross points” and conductive loops  • Implant Precautions  • Use caution when scanning implants with resonant lengths   • Use caution when scanning skin staples and metallic sutures   • Scan only MR Conditional active implants according to manufacturer conditions  • Consult the MR medical director if there are scan concerns for implanted devices  • Scan active implants with extreme caution according to current manufacturer conditions  • Device/Coil Positioning  • Avoid cable loops   • Remove unnecessary coils from the bore  • Inspect coils for damage regularly  •</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">949</emphasis></para>
      <para>Route cables and wires down the center of the bore   • Avoid patient skin contact with coils, cables, leads, and monitoring devices  • Use only approved MR Conditional leads and electrodes  • Operator Controls  • Enter height and weight accurately   • Maintain contact with the patient at regular intervals  • Provide medical supervision if scanning in <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>  • Use care when accepting popups to enter <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>   • If the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> is entered, the operator ideally changes the  • system back to normal mode prior to commencing the next pulse sequence  Stop the scan if the patient reports heating or burning  • Decrease the refocusing flip angle, echo train length, flip angle, number of slices per repeti- • tion time  Use low SAR mode or increase the repetition time  • Use strategies to lower SAR and the RF duty cycle  • Consider the use of different coils, if appropriate, to limit SAR  • Adhere to medical device conditions for SAR or B1+RMS for implants  •</para>
      <para>CAMRT and CAR recommend that MRI departments can focus on reducing SAR in  alignment with the strategies outlined above (21, 24). MRI technologists who are uncertain  on how to meet the SAR or other heating guidelines will consult with an individual such as  a lead MRI technologist or MRI physicist. MRI-related burns must be reported to the MR  supervising technologist and MR radiologist (24). In the event of a burn, a cool compress  will be placed on the patient’s skin. A non-conformance or incident report must be completed  outlining the specifics of the situation, in addition to a technologist comment in the Radi- ology Information System (RIS) and final MR report (24). SAR information may be in- cluded in the image DICOM header for each pulse sequence.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Specific Absorbed Energy and Specific Energy Dose  </emphasis></para>
      <para>The estimated rate of temperature rise related to SAR matters, but there are other metrics  that capture the total accumulated amount of energy that is deposited in the patient (18).  Manufacturers have come up with calculations of RF dose known as Specific Absorbed En- ergy (SAE) or Specific Energy Dose (SED) on the newer MR systems to limit thermal in- creases (18). The SED is represented in J/kg and prevents excessive temperature increases  in patients where imaging is performed for long intervals, for example entire spine imaging  (18). SED = SAR multiplied by time.  Factors that affect the amount of power deposited in  the patient are related to selection of pulse sequence parameters and these factors are im- portant for the technologist to understand. If SED limits are expected to be encountered on  the MR system, the technologist should know how to reduce the thermal load of pulse se- quences on long examinations (18). Additionally, the SED warnings and lockouts do exist  on MR systems in Canada. On some systems, a SED warning will pop up at 6,000 J/kg,  and if the limit of 14,400 J/kg is reached, it is no longer possible to scan the patient (8).</para>

A metric now required to be display on MR systems by  manufacturers is called the B1+RMS. B1+RMS is not an estimated value but a known value  based on the pulse sequence and parameters and it is calculated the same from system to  system (40). IEC requires manufacturers to display the value on newer scanners (40). Device  manufacturers have started to label devices with a given B1+RMS value not to be exceeded,  and this information can be found where the SAR information is found on the newer MR  systems in Canada (40).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Claustrophobia </emphasis></para>
      <para>Claustrophobia is commonly encountered in the MRI environment and occurs for a va- riety of reasons. Claustrophobia is thought to occur in approximately 4% of the population  due to fear of suffocation and fear of restriction (24). Fear of the MR system can prevent  an essential step in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Those with claustrophobia can  successfully be coached and managed with a variety of techniques, but early identification  can help in preparing the patient for an exam (19). Strategies to manage claustrophobia are  well-defined (19, 21, 24) and include:</para>
      <para>Maintaining communication with the patient   • Reassurance and coaching  • Having a family member or friend remain in the MRI environment  • Reminding the patient that they have control over the situation and instructing the patient in  • call bell usage  Mirrors and prism glasses   • Virtual reality system distraction  • Modified positioning (feet first or prone scanning if possible)  • Placing a blindfold or washcloth over the eyes  • Bright lights  • Increasing air flow in the scanner’s bore   • Relaxation, meditation, hypnosis   • Music or scent therapy   • Sedative or anxiolytic administration   • Anaesthesia   •</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Emergency Call Systems </emphasis></para>
      <para>Emergency call systems are a necessity to communicate with the patient and used to  alert the operator to any change in patient condition when the patient is in the MR scanner.  The call bell function should be tested each day to ensure the system is fully functional.  The test results are kept in an equipment log. Each patient must be provided with an expla- nation of the emergency call bell system and instructed on how to use the device prior to  the scan in the event they need to alert the operator to stop the scan. Call bell usage ensures  the safety of the patient in the event they experience any unusual sensations, burning, dis- comfort, distress or claustrophobia in the scanner. Patients who understand that they are in  control of the test know they can stop the scan if the need arises. Staff must immediately  respond and acknowledge the activation of the emergency call system. In the event of an  emergency, staff will initiate the appropriate emergency response procedure.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Sedation and Anaesthesia Procedures </emphasis></para>
      <para>In mild to moderate cases of claustrophobia, the patient may obtain a prescription for  a mild, oral sedative from their physician. Technologists are trained to identify and manage  patients with a high degree of anxiety. The role of the technologist requires monitoring the  patient for a verbal response, operating the equipment, ensuring quality vital signs moni- toring, recognizing complications that may be encountered with sedative usage, and prepar- ing in the event of an emergency. In some cases, other healthcare providers may be present  to monitor the patient, and is often the case with neonatal and pediatric patients. The patient  must bring a driver after taking sedative medication and the MRI technologist should con- firm that the patient does not drive post procedure (24).</para>
      <para>For patients with claustrophobia that is severe, other measures such as IV sedative ad- ministration and conscious sedation may be indicated in the absence of any contraindicated  medical conditions. If the site is to offer sedation, there must be policy and procedures in  place to allow for trained staff, such as nurses, to monitor the patient and administer the IV  sedation (21). The technologist and nurse have a collaborative role to ensure the patient can  be aroused by verbal stimulation during the scan (24). Departments that administer sedation  will keep a Compendium for Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (CPS) on site for ease of ref- erence and must ensure the appropriate monitoring of the patient. Often site pharmacists  can assist radiologists by providing educational materials, developing guidelines and pro- cedures that aid in recognizing and treating complications such as desaturation, hypotension,  excessive sedation, and nausea or vomiting (24).</para>
      <para>The use of general anaesthesia for deep sedation can be used to successfully complete  the MRI examination for severely claustrophobic and pediatric patients (24). Anaesthesia  procedures are most often reserved for pediatric settings and in the case of interventional  or surgical MR-guided imaging. An anaesthesiologist or intensive care physician provides  care for patients who require anaesthesia (21). The patient requires vital signs monitoring  (in the case of deep sedation or anaesthesia) that is monitored by the person administering  the sedation or anaesthesia. The use of monitoring devices and ventilators that are MR Con- ditional are available to the intensive care staff. When the patient arrives, baseline vitals  are recorded by the nurse or physician, in addition to during the scan with MR Safe or MR  Conditional monitoring equipment, and during post procedural care in recovery (24). The  pharmacologic measures to conduct scans pose greater risk to the patient and require more  in depth medical information and adequate preparation prior to the scan.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Patient and Vital Signs Monitoring </emphasis></para>
      <para>In Canada, MRI technologists monitor their patients at all times for a change in condi- tion and to prevent adverse events (24). The patient is monitored during the entire MRI pro- cedure visually and verbally to ensure their physical and emotional state and to respond to  any signs of distress. If the status of the patient changes and they lose consciousness or ap- pear to be in a state of respiratory or cardiac distress, emergency procedures are initiated.  Site procedures for emergency response must be in place to address different types of med- ical emergencies. In the event of any emergency, the patient will be immediately removed  from the MRI environment and the technologist will respond and seek out appropriate as- sistance.</para>

      <title>PEDIATRIC MRI CONSIDERATIONS</title>
      <para>Pediatric patients undergoing MRI procedures pose different challenges than adults.  Neonates, infants, and children from intensive care units (ICU) may also require MRI pro- cedures frequently. With older children, simulation procedures may be helpful for families  to prepare for the scan. Policies and procedures can be developed in alignment with other  healthcare professions (such as nursing, intensive care staff, respiratory therapists, and  anaesthesia specialists) to support the needs of children. Special equipment and immobi- lization devices are often needed in order to deliver appropriate clinical care to pediatric  patients. Screening policies govern more people than simply the patient. Adequate prepa- ration involves caregivers and other healthcare providers, especially if they are required to  stay in Zone III and IV with the patient. Contrast administration is carefully considered as  pediatric patients may be exposed to more GBCAs during their lives than adults. Caregivers  may be more stressed and ask more questions, and even worry about the choices relating to  consent for procedures such as venipuncture, contrast media, and the scan.</para>
      <para>The limits in the IEC guidelines for pediatric patients are reduced for magnetic field  strength. Hearing protection requirements are different due to the small anatomy of infants  and children. Additionally, neonatal patients have different thermoregulatory requirements  than adults. Finally, sedation and anaesthesia procedures are required frequently when per- forming MRI on pediatric patients in order to obtain quality images.</para>

      <title>MRI IN PREGNANT PATIENTS</title>
      <para>Many studies provide evidence suggesting that MRI exposure during the first trimester  (as compared to no MRI exposure during pregnancy) is not associated with increased harm  to the fetus or in early childhood (19). Nonetheless, MRI facilities in Canada are cautious  and screen females of reproductive age (11 to 55 years) for pregnancy before permitting  them access to MRI environment (24). If pregnancy is established, consideration is given  to whether the requested MRI examination could safely wait to the end of the pregnancy,  in consultation with the radiologist and referring clinician. When other methods of imaging  are inadequate, the patient is advised that, “to date there have been no deleterious effects  related to the use of clinical MR imaging during pregnancy” (17, 19, 24). CAR guidelines  suggest that safety of MRI scanning during pregnancy has not been established. The decision  to scan must be made on a on a case-by-case basis, after a consideration of medical necessity  and alternate imaging methods have been explored (21). Therefore, no special consideration</para>

      <para>CAR guidelines do offer indications for fetal imaging in select circumstances (21). Re- gardless of trimester, MRI use for certain indications is the standard of care (19). The rec- ommended assessment prior to initiating imaging (19, 24) includes asking the following  questions:</para>
      <para>Can ultrasound be used?  • Will the MRI exam address the clinical question?  • Is early delivery a possibility?   • Is termination of the pregnancy a possibility?  •</para>
      <para>CAMRT suggests that informed consent be obtained by the radiologist prior to the ex- amination. The Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices  (19) indicates that MRI examinations are not to be denied in the following circumstances,  when a pregnant patient presents with:</para>
      <para>Active brain or spine signs and symptoms requiring diagnosis  • Cancer requiring staging or diagnosis  • Chest, abdominal, or pelvic signs and symptoms of active disease where sonography is non- • diagnostic  Patients with fetal anomalies  •</para>

MRI healthcare professionals are allowed to work around the MR system when        the RF and gradient fields of the equipment are not operating during all stages of the preg- nancy (24). The recommendations regarding a policy for pregnant workers include allowing  pregnant technologists and healthcare workers to perform MRI procedures, enter the room  to position patients, and otherwise attend to the patient during all trimesters of pregnancy  (19). The pregnant healthcare worker should not remain in the room during equipment op- eration when scans are underway (8, 19).</para>

      <title>MRI CONTRAST AGENT ADMINISTRATION AND SAFETY</title>
      <para>The decision to administer contrast is approved by the radiologist and indicated on the  protocol sheet or the requisition. Conspicuity of certain pathology is enhanced with the use  of contrast agents. CAR outlines specific indications for contrast agent usage and safety  (21). MRI technologists and nurses in Canada can be delegated the specialized function of  peripheral IV access. To become certified in venipuncture, the technologist will successfully  complete an educational program as deemed appropriate by the medical director and receive  advanced training on IV starts under the supervision of other professionals skilled in the  task. The education will consist of theory, an examination, observation, and demonstration</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">954</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Practices, Guidelines, and Standards in Canada</emphasis></para>
      <para>of the skill. Each technologist must be closely supervised and evaluated to ensure they are  competent to perform venipuncture and signed off on by the supervising radiologist and  trainer. The demonstration of skills will be documented in a training document, with the  skills and competence reassessed annually.</para>
      <para>The MR medical director will keep a register of all technologists who are authorized to  perform venipuncture in the department. All venipuncture procedures are charted on a con- sent form and in the radiology information system (RIS) by the technologist including date,  site or route of injection, name of technologist, the size of cannula, and the amount and type  of contrast administered. Additionally, any reactions to the contrast or complications arising  from the venipuncture procedures must be documented. For in patients, this information  will be noted in the patient’s chart. Technologists will only administer contrast that is ap- proved by Health Canada and as directed by the ordering radiologist, if the practice is in  compliance with the regulations governing their profession.</para>
      <para>Screening prior to the administration of contrast begins upon receipt of the requisition.  Information requested prior to a contrast enhanced examination is required to be completed  by the referring physician. Any history of prior allergies, contrast reactions, asthma, hyper- tension requiring medication, diabetes, or other related concerns are important factors to  consider prior to contrast administration. Questions related to contrast administration will  include whether the patient has a history of kidney disease, kidney transplant, single kidney,  kidney surgery, dialysis, or a history of kidney cancer. The patient needs to be informed of  the risks and involved in the decision to administer contrast (24). Patients have the right to  decline a contrast agent injection at any point in time.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">GBCA Administration in Pregnancy </emphasis></para>
      <para>The decision to administer contrast to a pregnant patient depends on a variety of vari- ables and a more complete discussion can be found in the current Reference Manual for  Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices (19). The choice to administer a GBCA  to a pregnant patient is left to the referring clinician and the supervising radiologist. This  decision is only considered if there is a significant benefit to the patient that outweighs the  risk of free gadolinium to the fetus (19). CAR does not offer any public guidance on this  issue, but often aligns with recommendations and ACR guidance for such issues. CAMRT  advises that the use of a GBCA should be avoided in pregnant patients because there is in- sufficient evidence to prove that gadolinium poses no risk to the fetus (24). If it is necessary  to use a GBCA, the radiologist must provide informed consent for the procedures.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Adverse Contrast Reactions </emphasis></para>
      <para>Technologists are trained to recognize any adverse reactions related to contrast admin- istration. Injections are administered in alignment with local site policy that requires over- sight by a licensed physician. In 2017, CAR published a Canadian update on management  of adverse contrast reactions. In the update, there is a discussion of acute reactions that may  be considered mild, moderate and severe (41). Reactions are defined as either anaphylactoid  or non-anaphylactoid. The predisposing risk factors to consider include a prior reaction to  a GBCA, certain medical conditions, infants and seniors, women, and those on certain  nephrotoxic medications (41). The risks of an adverse reaction to GBCAs are overall lower</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">955</emphasis></para>
      <para>as compared to iodinated contrast agents, at 0.4 per 1000 doses, but the chances of a severe  reaction in those few cases is often double (41). The update offers a recommended treatment  protocol for adverse reactions for Canadian clinicians based on symptoms. The treatment  protocols include urticaria, facial/laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, hypotension with brady- cardia, hypotension with tachycardia, hypertension, seizures, and pulmonary edema (41).  There is also a recommended prophylactic pre-treatment protocol (41). While GBCAs are  thought to carry a lower risk for adverse reaction than iodinated contrast agents and they  are not considered to be nephrotoxic, the potential for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)  exists. NSF poses a risk for those on dialysis, those with low eGFR, and those with acute  kidney injury (AKI).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents in Kidney Disease </emphasis></para>
      <para>In 2017, a panel of radiologists and nephrologists developed clinical practice guidelines  (CPGs) on management of patients with AKI, severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), and  those on dialysis. The rationale was to assess the evidence regarding the usage of macro- cyclic and newer linear GBCAs. Screening for renal function on outpatients was recom- mended by CAR in specific settings in the initial CPG in alignment with the European  Society of Urogenital Radiology. The guideline was not aligned with the ACR Contrast  Manual, Version 10.3, but the intent was to reissue guidance in 2 years after a literature re- view.</para>
      <para>In 2019, the CAR updated the CPG on the use of GBCAs in kidney disease. A literature  review was conducted to see if there were any unconfounded cases of NSF related to Group  II and Group III GBCAs. Only a single case was reported in a patient with Stage 2 CKD  after the patient received gadobenate dimeglumine and no other cases were found between  2017 and 2019 (23). The recommendations remained mostly the same from the 2017 CPG,  with the change that, “screening for renal disease in the outpatient setting is no longer jus- tifiable, cost-effective or recommended” when using Group II and Group III agent, gadox- etic acid (23).</para>
      <para>The document provides guidance on how to manage patients requiring contrast. These  guidelines apply to use of GBCAs in adult and pediatric patients in the following circum- stances:</para>
      <para>Mild renal impairment (eGFR between 60 – 90 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>)  • Moderate renal impairment (eGFR between 30 – 60 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>)  • Severe CKD (eGFR between &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>)  • Dialysis   • Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)  •</para>

      <para>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings regarding  brain accumulation of GBCAs beginning in July 2015 (42). The safety announcements were  issued due to new findings that found retained gadolinium deposits in the brains of patients  who had repeat contrast-enhanced MRI (22, 42, 43, 44). The findings were described pri- marily in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus, and to a lesser extent in the cerebellar</para>

      <para>white matter, the frontal lobes, pons, and thalamus (22).  Gadolinium retention has been  found on routine unenhanced T1-weighted imaging and upon autopsy in those with normal  renal function with both linear and macrocyclic agents (22). Deep brain deposition was  found to have a positive correlation with increasing number of doses of gadolinium-based  contrast agents (GBCAs) (22, 45). Gadolinium has also been found in the skin, bone, liver,  and other organs (45). In September 2017, the FDA issued warnings that there was a greater  risk with linear as compared to macrocyclic agents (43).</para>
      <para>Health Canada, the Canadian FDA equivalent, followed suit and issued a safety alert in  2017 after an initial investigation in 2016 (46). Health Canada issued <emphasis role="italics">New Safety Informa-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">tion on Injectable Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents Used in MRI Scans</emphasis>, an information  update in 2017, advising Canadians of the findings. Another alert was issued in May 2018.  Both alerts explain that no adverse effects, and more importantly no health consequences,  have been identified with gadolinium accumulation in the brain (46, 47). The safety review  also considers that pregnant women and children are more at risk of gadolinium build-up  and to use macrocyclic agents in those cases, however the majority of facilities in Canada  already use macrocyclic agents (47). Health Canada, as of 2017, now requires manufacturers  to update product labels to include the information (46, 47). Drug manufacturers of GBCAs  updated product monographs to outline the finding of gadolinium accumulation in the brain  within the last 2 years.</para>
      <para>In 2018, the CAR issued a position statement entitled, <emphasis role="italics">Gadolinium Deposition in the </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Brain: A Systematic Review of Existing Guidelines and Policy Statement Issued by the Cana-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">dian Association of Radiologists</emphasis> (22). The objectives of the CAR working group were to  review evidence, position statements, and existing guidelines from other organizations and  to formulate an evidence-based position statement from CAR (22). The CAR position state- ment states that GBCA administration should be considered carefully with respect to po- tential risks and benefits, standard dosing should be used, repeat administrations should be  avoided unless deemed necessary, and use of GBCAs should be limited to only when re- quired (22). CAR arranges GBCAs as follows: macrocyclic agents, linear ionic agents, and  linear non-ionic agents (in order of decreasing stability) and they conclude that there is in- sufficient evidence to recommend one class of GBCA over another at this point in time  (22). The issue is currently being watched closely.</para>

      <para>Nationally, the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists (CAMRT)  develops the competency profiles that guide educational programs on appropriate course  content and prepares the student Medical Radiation Technologist (MRT). The CAMRT is  the national professional association and certification body for medical radiation technolo- gists and set the competency profiles for the eight MRI technology programs in the country.  Canadian technologists are commonly referred to as MRTs. MRI technologists who suc- cessfully complete the CAMRT national MRI certification examination become Registered  Technologists, Magnetic Resonance or RTMRs. Upon completion of the didactic and clin- ical training, entry-level technologists are expected to be competent in a wide variety of  MRI procedures at a general duty level. The competency profiles are developed by working  groups of CAMRT-certified MRI technologists and educational professionals who set the  learning outcomes and nationally-accepted standards of competency, defined as a practice  tasks that can be performed with entry-level proficiency (48). The CAMRT encourages pro- fessional development activities, develops best practice guidelines (BPGs), descriptions of  practice, a code of ethics, job scopes, and standards of practice for members.</para>
      <para>In Canada, the CAMRT enlists voluntary professionals in each of the imaging disci- plines to set the curriculum to ensure high quality, rigorously prepared candidates. Candi- dates who have successfully completed a course of study at one of the recognized and  accredited Canadian educational facilities become eligible to write the national certification  exams. The CAMRT MRI competency profile is broken into modules on professional prac- tice, patient management, health and safety, equipment operation, and procedure manage- ment. The profiles are updated regularly (5 year intervals) to reflect current practice. The  MRI technology educational programs are offered in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba,  Nova Scotia, and Ontario.

      <title>QUALIFIED MEDICAL PERSONNEL</title>
      <para>In order to have a high-quality MRI facility, a team of appropriately trained medical  personnel is essential. This team will consist of radiologists, a physicist, nurses, and MRI  technologists. As CAR outlines in their standards, a Diagnostic Radiologist with subspe- cialty training in MRI is required to supervise and interpret MRI exams in addition to sup- porting clinical MRI service provision. Canada requires that physicians interpreting MR  images are board-certified radiologists with the Royal College of Radiology. Foreign-trained  specialists are acceptable as long as they have a fellowship that is approved by the provincial  college and they have an appointment in a Canadian University as a Radiologist (21).  Each  province has a regulatory professional college that supports the continued professional prac- tice, development, and education of each Diagnostic Radiologist. The local College of  Physicians and Surgeons in each province usually has a licensing committee that oversees  the regulation and scope of interpretation for radiologists in the province.</para>
      <para>The newest <emphasis role="italics">ACR Guidance Document on MR Safe Practices: Updates and Critical In-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">formation 2019</emphasis> states that the physician responsible for MRI safety, known as the MR med- ical director, “is required to ensure continued appropriate evaluation and screening of  patients, implants or devices, and equipment (e.g., patient support equipment and surgical,  radiation, and anesthesia devices) that are brought into the MRI environment” (18). Many  of these functions can be delegated, under appropriate oversight in a clinical setting, to an  experienced MRI technologist. In a research setting, there may be other non-technologist  Level 2 Personnel designated individuals who have undergone advanced training and edu- cation in MRI safety principles, such as imaging physicists, physicians, and research sci- entists.</para>
      <para>MRI technologists are MRTs who have been certified by the CAMRT in the discipline  of magnetic resonance (RTMR). Additionally, in at least 6 of the 10 Canadian provinces  the technologist must be registered with the provincial regulatory body. Technologists must  maintain current certification in CPR (according to the employer) and the CAMRT BPGs  recommend that technologists receive annual retraining (24). At most Canadian facilities,  MRI technologists will be certified in CPR if they are delegated the responsibility of  venipuncture. Technologists are responsible for equipment operation, patient care, and safety  of the equipment, staff, visitors, and patients in the MRI department. Technologists prepare  and screen patients, in addition to supporting them through the exam, to produce images  that are diagnostic. Assessment of the image for quality and artifacts is the responsibility of  the technologist. MRI technologists are the frontline staff responsible for delivering educa-</para>

      <para>In Canada, qualified medical physicists have certification from the Canadian College  of Physicists in Medicine (CCPM) and are also members of the Canadian Organization of  Medical Physicists (COMP). Alternatively, certification by the American Board of Radiol- ogy (ABR) is often recognized. Ideally, the medical physicist will have certification in the  subfield of magnetic resonance imaging, but this is not usually required. The physicist is  skilled in MRI physics, acceptance testing, system performance, troubleshooting, and qual- ity control activities. In Canada, it is very common for the physicist to be affiliated with a  university, have academic responsibilities, and be involved in research. The MRI physicist  collaborates with administrators, technologists, radiologists, and field service engineers  (FSEs) from the vendor. The role the MR physicist plays in medical imaging departments  is important to ensure the safety of the equipment and in the safety of patients with complex  implants. The physicist develops scan protocols and parameters in collaboration with the  MRI technologist to optimize sequences and ensure safe scan methods. Additionally, the  medical physicist oversees the quality assurance program along with the diagnostic medical  director and the lead MRI technologist. The physicist provides feedback and assistance re- garding preventative maintenance and any issues relating to faulty coils or phantoms in the  department in collaboration with the FSE.</para>
      <para>The FSE is usually employed by the vendor and manufacturer of the MR system (21).  The role of the FSE is installation, calibration, and preventative maintenance at regular in- tervals. FSEs have usually completed electronic engineering technologist training programs.  The lead technologist maintains communication with the FSE for troubleshooting and rou- tine maintenance. The MRI technologists keep a record of troubleshooting, errors, faults,  artifacts and other system deficiencies in a logbook and equipment manual. The information  is part of the annual quality report submitted to the physicist.</para>

The Canadian ter- ritories are Northwest, Nunavut and Yukon. There is currently only one scanner located in  the entire Arctic in Whitehorse, Yukon. Western Canada is formed by four provinces: British  Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Eastern Canada is formed by six  provinces: Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New- foundland/ Labrador. MRI accreditation in Canada is conducted by either Accreditation  Canada or provincially through the College of Physicians and Surgeons. The arctic territo- ries and eastern Canada are usually accredited along with the healthcare organization they  belong to by Accreditation Canada; however, the DI standards used by Accreditation Canada  were not available at the time of publication. Most of the western provinces are accredited  provincially by The College of Physicians and Surgeons through a facility medical director.  Medical directors must be qualified to make decisions and establish standards that benefit  patient care. Medical directors in MRI programs are usually specialized in magnetic reso- nance and involved in the development and review of policy and procedures.</para>
      <para>In British Columbia (BC), Alberta, and Manitoba there are specialty diagnostic accred- itation programs that function as part of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in each  province.

The provincial MRI standards provide an  excellent resource that enable sites to prepare policy, guidelines, and standard operating  procedures (SOPs) that serve to improve MRI service quality and enhance departmental  safety. Annual signoff of documents is a requirement, although the mechanism, in electronic  or hard copy, is currently different depending on the site and individual facility director.  The trend in some provinces, such as Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, and  PEI, seems that diagnostic and health services are starting to amalgamate and become  provincially managed and centralized.</para>

      <title>ACCEPTANCE TESTING FOR MR SYSTEMS</title>
      <para>For accreditation purposes, most facilities require an acceptance testing report prior to  offering clinical MRI services. In Canada, MRI acceptance testing of new MR systems is  conducted by a qualified medical physicist. In rare cases the installation report from the  equipment manufacturer is adequate provided it is reviewed by a qualified medical physicist.  One copy of the acceptance report is usually kept onsite in the department in an equipment  manual and one is shared with management. The CAR recommends following the ACR  guidelines (21). However, this is not a requirement and many sites perform their own tests.  The BC DAP program requires magnetic field homogeneity, RF shield integrity, ambient  RF noise, uniformity of the body coil, gradient performance, and table positioning accuracy  (52).</para>
      <para>It is common to use tests built-in to the scanner as a negative result is easily verified by  the vendor. The actual tests performed will vary somewhat depending on the make and  model of scanner. Ideally the shim will be verified and the slice position and thickness meas- ured. All coils should be checked to confirm signal level and signal-to-noise ratio are within  specifications. It is preferred that each coil element be independently verified. Given the  large number of coils ordered with a scanner, this can be a lengthy process. All images  should be free of unexpected artifacts. Coils that are faulty in construction, damaged, or  fail to meet image quality baselines must be replaced and not used for patient imaging.  Measurements of system stability and geometric distortion are often helpful. When the sys- tem is used for spectroscopy, a special phantom is often used to verify accuracy of the cor- responding sequences. Medical physicists often conduct an analysis of various pulse  sequences to ensure there are no artefacts or ghosts. All sequences are tested and reviewed  by the MRI technologists and radiologists after the system is handed over. The physicist  and technologist work together to perform a full inspection of the site, the MR system, the  peripheral equipment, monitoring devices, and the RF coils. This includes verifying pulse  oximeters, respiratory bellows, and ECG functionality.</para>
      <para>For a new facility, the MRI team should be involved during the design phase of the  project. If possible, the team should visit during construction to confirm the locations of  medical gasses, light switches, and other important design elements. After construction is  completed, the inspection of the site is ideally conducted collaboratively with the MRI  physicist, the MR medical director, and the MRI technologist to review the patient and staff  flow through the area. Further, a review of the departmental safety features and the final  acceptance report are completed. All areas in the department are inspected for construction  irregularities or flaws. The MRI team can ensure that signage, access restrictions, and la- beling of devices are adequate prior to accreditation. CAR specifically recommends a review  of the locations and functionality of the lighting and safety switches, MRI conditional fire  extinguishers, the emergency power off (EPO) and quench switches, the patient monitoring  devices, and the emergency call systems (21).</para>

      <para>Demarcation of the 5 Gauss line in the MRI environment is highly recommended. The  MANQAP and BC DAP accreditation standards outline this as a requirement (52, 53). The  vendor is required to provide maps of the fringe field as per the IEC requirements to ensure  the safe usage of peripheral equipment in the room and for exclusion zone purposes. The  physicist can also measure the fringe field using a Gauss meter. It is also useful to mark the  100 Gauss line as this is about the maximum field that peripheral equipment can tolerate.  Other elements to consider are a review of the quench line documentation, the quench pipe  outlet, and regular quality control program requirements.</para>

    <sect1 id="ch0035s22">
      <title>QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM</title>
      <para>The quality control (QC) program at the MRI facility is overseen by a medical director  and medical physicist. QC programs monitor equipment performance and are an important  requirement for accreditation. Trends in these measurements can indicate equipment failure  or other issues such as interference from external sources. Considering that very few sites  have a dedicated medical physicist, it is important that the measurements be straightforward  to perform. Ideally the signal and signal-to-noise values for the head or knee RF coil are  measured and the results recorded. It is fine to use software on the scanner to do this as  long as numerical results are provided (i.e., a simple pass or fail result is unacceptable).  The measurements are typically repeated at regular intervals, e.g., once per month, to fit  into the departmental workflow. In addition, it is important that all coils be separately tested  once per year. The MR system manufacturer provides a variety of phantoms for regular  testing of all coils. It is a good idea for the physicist to annually review the QC measure- ments and test results and provide recommendations in writing. It may be a requirement of  accreditation to remediate any non-conformances or deficiencies. Some sites in Canada  elect to follow the recommendation of CAR and use the ACR guidelines and an ACR phan- tom. However, this is not necessarily a good fit from many Canadian sites given the re- sources available.</para>
      <para>The MRI technologists in the department have knowledge and experience in running  the routine quality assurance activities. The technologists are also familiar with recognizing  a variety of image artifacts and notifying the lead technologist if artifacts become apparent.  Often the lead MRI technologist is delegated the responsibility to ensure conformance to  the quality control program according to a schedule developed by the MRI physicist. The  lead technologist is responsible to maintain the written logs, procedures, and record results  in order to report on the QC program to the MRI physicist. Many sites choose to keep a QC  and equipment manual to maintain a log of system errors, artifacts, and system downtime  relating to equipment failure. If remediation is required, documentation and service records  related to preventative maintenance or parts replacement are maintained by the lead tech- nologist. Another part of the regular system maintenance will include inspection of the RF  coils for signs of wear and tear or damage. Regular preventative maintenance schedules  and analysis of QC results serve to detect major systems issues before they result in coil  failure, equipment malfunction, or system downtime. In Canada, equipment downtime can  result in the diversion of patients requiring emergent imaging to alternate imaging centers.</para>
      <para>The MR system manufacturer provides a variety of phantoms for regular testing of all  system coils and these phantoms can be used, although some sites choose to follow other</para>

      <para>guidelines. Some sites in Canada may follow the ACR guidelines with the use of an ACR  phantom, in conjunction with an MRI physicist knowledgeable in the application of the  program. The physicist will annually review the quality control measurements and test re- sults and provide recommendations in writing with a timeline to remediate any non-con- formances or deficiencies.</para>

      <title>QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM FOR MRI</title>
      <para>Given the financial limitations in the Canadian healthcare system, a great deal of focus  is on improving access to MRI, triaging patients, and developing appropriateness criteria  for imaging. Unfortunately, lengthy queues exist in Canada, due to the relative lack of MR  systems available. The Choosing Wisely campaign has been endorsed by the CAR as an  improvement initiative to reduce the amount of unnecessary imaging. Unnecessary and re- peat imaging that does not alter treatment plans, introduces the potential for harm. In  Canada, with limited resources and increased scrutiny of how healthcare dollars are spent  appropriateness is a big deal and the CAR has developed referral guidelines.</para>
      <para>Other processes, including peer review and imaging audits are important for quality  improvement initiatives. Most facilities conduct regular image audits for technologists to  identify safety and image quality issues. Radiologist peer review processes are conducted  on the provincial level through the College of Physicians and Surgeons that licenses, regu- lates, and gives privileges to radiologists (and on occasion cardiologists) to interpret MRI  examinations.</para>
      <para>The quality improvement program allows the radiologist to supervise and sign off on  policy and procedures relating to contrast administration, patient management, emergency  procedures, sedation, and monitor safety concerns in the department that put patients or  staff at risk. Adverse events and critical incidents or occurrences must be reported in align- ment with local site policies and procedures and reviewed with the medical director.</para>

      <title>MEDICAL DEVICES IN CANADA</title>
      <para>All medical devices in Canada are subject to the <emphasis role="italics">Food and Drugs Act</emphasis> and the associated  regulations (54). The MR system specifications and performance must meet all provincial  and federal guidelines, including Health Canada guidelines. Health Canada ensures that  medical devices used for diagnosis are regulated according to the standards set forth by the  Medical Devices Bureau of the Therapeutic Products Directorate (TPD). According to the  Health Canada website, the TPD applies both the <emphasis role="italics">Food and Drug Regulations</emphasis> (C.R.C., c.  870) and the <emphasis role="italics">Medical Devices Regulations</emphasis> (SOR/98-282) under the authority of the <emphasis role="italics">Food </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">and Drugs Act</emphasis> to regulate pharmaceutical drugs and medical equipment to ensure those de- vices and products are safe, effective, and high quality (25, 26, 54). The terms and conditions  of medical device licensure minimize any potential harm and achieve two end goals; man- ufacturer compliance and a high level of public health and safety. Health Canada’s regula- tions for licensing medical devices are some of the most stringent regulations in the world  but improvements are being made through Health Canada’s <emphasis role="italics">Action Plan on Medical Devices</emphasis>  (55).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">964</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Practices, Guidelines, and Standards in Canada</emphasis></para>
      <para>To ensure that a medical device is safe and effective the manufacturer is required to  balance the risks associated with the usage medical device with the benefits offered to the  patient. The manufacturer must identify the inherent risks in the device and eliminate those  risks if possible. If it is not possible to eliminate the risks in the device, the manufacturer  must reduce the risks and provide protection appropriate to the risks (such as alarms). In- structions for use and other important information must be provided with the device to out- line and mitigate any risks that remain. The obligation of the manufacturer is to minimize  any hazards from potential failures of the device during the useful life of the device. Man- ufacturers must ensure that there exists a high level of protection in the devices they wish  to obtain licensing approval for and in turn sell to healthcare institutions in Canada.</para>
      <para>A medical device must function and perform as intended for the purposes and uses that  the device has been sold and manufactured. Manufacturers are required to ensure that the  device will maintain performance during the projected life of the device so that the device  does not become a risk to the health and safety of a patient, user, or other person. The design  and manufacture of the device must minimize all risks and hazards to the patient and user  related to (25):</para>
      <para>Flammability or explosion  • Contamination  • Radiation  • Electrical, mechanical or thermal hazards  • Fluid leaks  •</para>
      <para>Further, the device must perform and pass measurements within certain tolerance limits.  Software must perform as intended by the manufacturer. Mandatory quality control accord- ing to CSA and ISO standards, testing, and quality assurance in manufacturing ensures com- pliance with the medical devices regulations. Additionally, there exists labeling requirements  for all medical devices dependent on the class of the device.</para>
      <para>In Canada, medical devices are categorized into four classes based on the level of risk  associated with their use. Class I devices present the lowest potential risk (e.g., oral ther- mometers, hospital beds, wheelchairs, leg prostheses) and Class IV devices present the  greatest potential risk (e.g., cardiac pacemakers, defibrillators, breast implants, bone grafts).  Class II devices include infusion sets, syringes, tracheostomy tubes, urethral catheters. An  MR system is classified as a Class II medical device by these regulations (25). Class III de- vices are infusion pumps, anesthesia gas machines, and IUDs. Class II, III, and IV devices  receive increasingly rigorous reviews, and must be licensed before being sold in Canada.  By comparison, Class I devices do not require medical device licences, but they are moni- tored through establishment licences.</para>
      <para>Establishment licences ensure that TPD knows of the manufacturers, importers, and  distributors of the devices that are being sold in Canada. Health Canada issues Medical De- vice Establishment Licences (MDEL) and Medical Device Licences (MDL). Medical device  licences can be suspended and devices can be recalled if they are found to no longer be safe  and effective and pose a safety risk to Canadians. In order to determine if a particular MR  system is approved for use in Canada, a searchable database called Medical Devices Active  Licence Listing (MDALL) is available that lists Class II, III, and IV medical devices cur-</para>

      <para>The <emphasis role="italics">Medical Devices Regulations</emphasis> were last amended June 2019. Sections 26 to 32 in  the regulations are applied to MR systems and these are summarized from the Government  of Canada’s website, as follows (25):</para>

In the case that the device has been changed, an amended medical  device license must be obtained prior to sale. If the device in question is advertised in print,  the device must have a warning indicating that it may not have been licensed in accordance  with Canadian Law.</para>

      <title>REPORTING ON ADVERSE EVENTS AND INCIDENTS</title>
      <para>Health Canada publishes new regulations and amendments to laws in the Canada  Gazette. A major amendment to the <emphasis role="italics">Food and Drugs Act</emphasis>, called <emphasis role="italics">Protecting Canadians from </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Unsafe Drugs Act</emphasis> (Vanessa’s Law) was passed and updates the law that applies to medical  devices and drugs in 2014 (57). This amendment is the biggest change within the past 50  years and the changes will come into force as the <emphasis role="italics">Medical Device Regulations</emphasis> and the <emphasis role="italics">Food </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">and Drug Regulations</emphasis> are updated (57). There are now harsh financial penalties for the mar- keting of unsafe products, better mechanisms to recall products, and the law will compel  drug companies to test and revise labels to reflect health risk information (57).</para>
      <para>Health Canada’s <emphasis role="italics">Action Plan on Medical Devices</emphasis> was developed as a strategic move to  improve the oversight of medical devices (55). The main goal is to increase patient protec- tion. The action plan has three goals that include:</para>
      <para>Improving how devices get on the market (increase protection and research)  • Strengthening monitoring and follow up (mandatory hospital reporting)  • Providing more information on medical devices to Canadians  •</para>
      <para>The action plan and new regulations encourage healthcare practitioners and those in  the healthcare system to improve the reporting of serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs)  and medical device incidents (MDIs) to Health Canada (55, 57, 58). The plan aims to  strengthen the knowledge base on product safety to improve patient safety, outcomes, and  public health. Mandatory reporting by hospitals <emphasis role="italics">within 30 calendar days</emphasis> to adverse events  will now apply (58). The change is primarily due to under reporting and poor reporting on  ADRs and MDIs (55). Health Canada will also launch a searchable database that contains  medical device incident reports (55). It is unclear if the action plan applies to all classes of  medical devices (55), however the <emphasis role="italics">Mandatory Reporting of Serious Adverse Drug Reactions </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">and Medical Device Incidents by Hospitals</emphasis> guidance document gives a definition of what  medical devices and pharmaceuticals are covered (58). The guidance document indicates  that the term “medical device covers a wide range of health and/or medical instruments  used in the treatment, mitigation, diagnosis or prevention of a disease” and that mandatory  reporting includes all classes of medical devices (58).</para>

The new mandatory reporting  requirements will apply to all hospitals beginning December 16, 2019 (59). Healthcare  workers can report directly online at Canada.ca/medeffect beginning in the fall of 2019  (59).

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>There are numerous governing bodies that issue guidelines and standards regarding  MRI safety in Canada. The challenge is assimilating all of the resources together to come  up with best safety practices, guidelines, and standards that are current and relevant. The  lack of one Canadian governing document covering the safety, bioeffects, and management  of MRI operations could create gaps in clinical service standards. Canadian MRI depart- ments that clearly develop and stipulate which policies and procedures they operate under  offer clarity in service provision. A local departmental policy manual with specific guidance  for staff safeguards patient and staff safety. Preventative practices are in alignment with  other international standards and put in place to mitigate the risk of adverse events and out- comes in the MRI environment. MRI healthcare professionals work collaboratively to en- sure that all safety guidelines, quality management programs, policies, and standard  operating procedures (SOPs) function to enhance safety, minimize adverse events, and op- timize patient outcomes.</para>
