      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important diagnostic modality that utilizes a  powerful static magnetic field that may pose serious hazards to patients and other individ- uals. The potentially violent attraction of ferromagnetic objects into the bore of a magnetic  resonance (MR) system is referred to as the missile (or projectile) effect. Magnetic field in- teractions acting on a highly ferromagnetic object brought too close to the magnet of the  scanner can become so substantial as to be unstoppable by human effort. Items such as steel  gas cylinders (e.g., an oxygen tank) and fire extinguishers can enter the MR system at 30-  to 40-mph, the same speed they would reach if dropped from a 40-foot building to the  ground. The kinetic energy gained by a steel cylinder that becomes a missile as it rapidly  moves towards the scanner is dissipated on impact. A 15-lb cylinder acting as a projectile  can seriously injure an individual and/or severely damage the MR system.</para>
      <para>Ferromagnetic detection systems (FMDS) are available for use in the MRI environment.  These devices have several uses (note that not all FMDS provide each of the following):</para>
      <para>To mitigate the risk of missile-relateds occurring by warning if ferromagnetic ob- • jects are approaching the MR system room (Zone IV).  To reduce image artifacts and minor missile-related incidents by discovering fer- • romagnetic objects on patients inadvertently missed by routine patient screening.   To detect ferromagnetic implants, such as cardiac pacemakers, that were missed  • by routine patient screening.   To monitor safety metrics remotely and centrally across a number of MR systems   • to manage safety processes and procedures.</para>
      <para>A ferromagnetic detection (FMD) device may be defined as:</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">A device that passively detects the presence of a ferromagnetic object by means of the object’s </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">naturally surrounding magnetic field, and issues an alert to indicate that the object has been </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">detected.</emphasis></para>
      <para>Various versions of FMDS currently exist. These devices are specially designed to only  detect ferromagnetic items. Other materials, such as aluminum and copper, are nonferro- magnetic and, therefore, are not detected by an FMD device. There are many ferromagnetic  metals but, by far, the most common is martensitic, which is magnetic, steel. An FMD device  will detect a steel gas cylinder and indicate a positive alarm, but it will not detect or alarm  on an aluminum one. Thus, the FMD device will only alarm on potentially dangerous objects  relative to issues related to magnetic field interactions. Utilizing an FMD device in the MRI  environment is recommended or required by various influential organizations concerned  with MRI safety, including the American College of Radiology (ACR) and The Joint Com- mission (1-5).</para>
      <para>This chapter discusses the missile effect, its causes, and consequences. The unique de- tection technology utilized by FMDS is then presented. Included in this chapter is a practical  guide to working with an FMD device in the MRI environment. The potential application  of an FMD device for screening patients to identify ferromagnetic implants and foreign  bodies using an FMD device is also discussed, followed by a perspective on the future of  these devices.</para>

      <title>THE MISSILE EFFECT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">The Fringe Field Associated with an MR System </emphasis></para>
      <para>A properly functioning MR system has a powerful and highly uniform static magnetic  field (6). The vast majority of scanners use superconducting electromagnets because these  provide substantially higher static magnetic fields and considerably lower power consump- tion than electromagnets. Superconducting electromagnets have the interesting property  such that the massive electrical currents in their coils will flow perpetually without the need  for a power supply as long as they are kept cold enough to remain superconducting. A su- perconducting magnet does need high power to establish the field while the magnet is being  “ramped up”. The energy that is used during this time is stored in the magnetic field. This  stored energy will only be released when the magnet is “ramped-down” or quenched.</para>
      <para>From a safety consideration, it is important to understand that a magnetic field is an  “energy store”. An analogy might be a gas cylinder insofar as it requires energy to compress  a gas into the cylinder. Once there (and with the valve closed), no power or energy is re- quired to maintain it. The stored energy is only released when the gas is let out. With the  gas cylinder, the energy is stored safely within the walls of the cylinder. However, with a  magnet used by an MR system, the energy is stored in the magnetic field on the <emphasis role="italics">outside</emphasis>,  through which staff members, patients, and other individuals walk through and work in  every day. It is a common misconception that the energy in an MR system’s magnet is stored  in the electrical current in the windings, safely within the scanner. However, that is not the  case. Inside the bore of the magnet and in the area surrounding the magnet there is an energy</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">401</emphasis></para>
      <para>field that cannot be felt, seen, heard, tasted, or smelled. The only sense of the presence and  power of this energy field is when a ferromagnetic object is taken into the area and the  forces are felt that are exerted on the object.</para>
      <para>During the planning of an MRI facility, a plot showing the magnetic contours surround- ing the MR system is typically provided by the manufacturer, an example of which is shown  in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>. Normally, MR system rooms are designed such that, where there are walls ad- joining areas occupied by individuals, the fringe field is less than 5-Gauss (7). This is con- sidered to be the generally permissible magnetic field level that ensures safety for  individuals with electronically-activated devices, such as cardiac pacemakers. Frequently,  the 5-Gauss line is contained well within the MRI environment, usually at or within a con- trolled area.</para>
      <para>The fringe field associated with the magnet of the MR system falls away in all direc- tions, getting weaker as the distance increases. The rate of change of the magnetic field  with distance is called the spatial gradient magnetic field. If the magnetic field is <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>, then  the gradient is <emphasis role="italics">∂</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">B/</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">∂</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">x</emphasis> where <emphasis role="italics">x</emphasis> is the distance in the x-direction. An illustration of the fringe  field and gradient profiles are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2 (a)</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2 (b).</emphasis></para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">How Magnetic Fields Interact with Metallic Objects </emphasis></para>
      <para>There are four primary mechanical effects that a magnetic field could impart on a metal- lic object: (1) linear force or translational attraction, (2) torque or rotational force, (3) mag- netization effects, and (4) motion damping. These mechanical effects are described below.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Linear Force </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>Linear force is the mechanism that causes the missile or projectile effect. It occurs be- cause an object, having been magnetized by the magnetization effect, or by its previous  magnetization state (or both) becomes attracted to the magnet of the scanner. The spatial  gradient of the magnetic field is responsible for linear force. The position at which the mag- netic field is highly uniform, such as in the middle of the bore of the MR system, the linear  force is close to zero. This is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Torque  </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>Torque is when a ferromagnetic object, in the presence of a magnetic field, experiences  a torque to rotate or align it with respect to the direction of the magnetic field. Once in the  preferred direction, there is no further rotation. However, torque will oppose any attempt  to orient the object in another direction. This is the principle that magnetic compasses use  to indicate the direction of the Earth’s magnetic poles. An elongated ferromagnetic object  (e.g., a steel oxygen cylinder, pen, etc.) becomes magnetized along its long axis in prefer- ence to another direction. Unless the object is spherical, it will usually experience torque.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Magnetization Effects </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>Magnetization effects only occurs in ferromagnetic objects. The magnetization of a fer- romagnetic object increases with the applied magnetic field. This means that the closer a  ferromagnetic object approaches to the magnet of the MR system, the more magnetized it  becomes.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Motion Damping </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>Motion damping is the only main effect that all metallic objects experience whether or  not they are ferromagnetic. It is a mechanism that is a function of the electrical conductivity  of the metallic object and its shape. If a metallic object moves through a magnetic field gra- dient so that the field it experiences changes with time, then eddy currents are generated  within the metal, obeying Faraday’s Law of Induction, also known as the dynamo effect.  The eddy currents circulate, according to Lenz’s Law in a manner that generates their own  magnetic field that opposes the movement (i.e., the objects resist motion)(8). The reason  this is discussed here is because a ferromagnetic missile accelerating toward the bore of the  magnet is slowed down by this effect. Without this effect, missile incidents would be even  more damaging.</para>
      <para>When an individual approaches the magnetic field of the MR system with a ferromag- netic object, the object will typically first encounter torque as the first effect to be noticed.  The linear force acting on the object is often felt closer to the scanner. The motion damping  effect is not that noticeable but can be experienced if an aluminum sheet is taken into close  to the origin of the magnetic field and moved around. A favorite trick MRI physicists like  to display is to take a half-inch thick aluminum object, such as a pizza pan, stand it edgewise  on the patient table near the opening of bore of the MR system, and then tip it over. The ob- ject falls in a surprisingly slow manner.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">The Missile Effect </emphasis></para>
      <para>Although the missile effect is predominantly caused by the linear force acting on a fer- romagnetic object, each of the four interactions described above plays a part. Let’s begin  by considering the linear force in more detail. As a ferromagnetic object approaches the  magnet, the force it experiences dramatically increases. Thus, every time the distance to  the magnet is reduced by 10%, the force doubles. Therefore, small changes in distance  equate to large changes in the force acting on the ferromagnetic object. Decreasing the dis- tance to the magnet by half increases the force by approximately 130 times.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">404</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Using Ferromagnetic Detection Systems in the MRI Environment</emphasis></para>
      <para>This highly non-linear distance dependence on the force causes problems for individuals  carrying ferromagnetic objects close to the MR system. When the forces begin to increase,  muscle control typically cannot cope with the non-linearity. Thus, there is a point at which  the ferromagnetic object can no longer be restrained. The force is so highly non-linear that  it is rare for individuals to experience or encounter similar forces under other circumstances  because we are naturally more accustomed to sensations involving constant or linear forces.  It is often an unconscious assumption by people who deliberately take ferromagnetic objects  into the MR system room that the force will increase more smoothly than it actually does,  as the ferromagnetic object gets close to the scanner. This incorrect assumption has led to  many missile-related accidents. In various videos posted on the Internet of individuals de- liberately demonstrating the missile effect, one can see the sudden attraction of a ferromag- netic object into the bore of the MR system. Additional information on this topic directed  towards the interests of the MRI physicist is presented in the comprehensive publication  by Bleaney and Bleaney (9).</para>

      <title>TERMINOLOGY USED FOR IMPLANTS AND DEVICES</title>
      <para>Descriptions of the current terminology and classifications used for implants and de- vices, including patient support equipment, have been presented by Shellock, et al. (10).  One important aspect of these classifications is the item’s susceptibility to becoming a mis- sile-related hazard. For example, MR Safe items are those defined as, amongst other things,  “nonmetallic, nonmagnetic, and nonconducting” objects (10). MR Unsafe items are “known  to pose hazards in all MR environments” (10). Objects made from martensitic stainless steel  or iron may be MR Unsafe. MR Conditional items have, “been demonstrated to pose no  known hazards in a specified MR environment with specified conditions of use. Field con- ditions that define the MR environment include static magnetic field strength....” (10). As  far as missile-related hazards are concerned, this classification refers to items that are either  very weakly magnetic or composite items that have small amounts of ferromagnetic mate- rials. For implants, the counterforces present for certain MR Conditional items must be  taken into consideration because these can prevent risks related to movement or displace- ment relative to the use of MRI.</para>
      <para>An important area to consider is composite equipment that is classified as MR Condi- tional, where the majority of the materials that are used are nonferromagnetic but there may  be ferromagnetic components, as well. Most MR Conditional gurneys, wheelchairs, and re- movable MR system patient tables are in this category. The ferromagnetic materials found  in composite equipment always experiences forces of attraction in association with scanner,  so an interesting question is, when does an object become too magnetic and in danger of  becoming a missile? On one level the answer is simple. It is when the attractive force of  the magnet overcomes the restraining or counterforce holding the object back. For a piece  of patient support equipment, such as a wheelchair, there are two primary forces that can  prevent it from becoming a missile:  the weight which acts in a downward direction and the  friction due to contact with the ground, which acts along the floor in the opposite direction  of the force, as illustrated in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>. This force of attraction is generally toward the nearest  edge of the bore of the MR system. In <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>, the magnetic force is shown resolved into</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">405</emphasis></para>
      <para>its horizontal and vertical components. The forces of gravity and friction are in opposition  to these components.</para>
      <para>First, consider the friction. This has the property that frictional force increases to exactly  match any horizontal force on the object up to a point called Fmax, beyond which it will  begin to slide toward the MR system. A full analysis is complicated because Fmax is pro- portional to the object’s weight and it also depends on the properties of the two surfaces in  contact. For a given object, there will be an area surrounding the MR system’s magnet, out- side of which the object will remain stationary on the floor, and inside of which it will be- come a missile, due to horizontal forces. Objects with wheels have intrinsically low Fmax  because that is the point of having wheels in the first place. That is, to allow devices such  as wheelchairs and gurneys to move horizontally with very low friction. This means special  care must be taken with wheeled items when present in the MR system room so that these  devices are not moved closer than allowed based on the approved MR Conditional labeling.  For example, certain patient support devices are labeled MR Conditional and the conditions  specify use at 500-Gauss or less. Moving the device closer than 500-Gauss may pose a mis- sile-related hazard.</para>
      <para>The vertical forces are different in nature. An object of a given weight will remain on  the floor until the vertical component of the magnetic force exceeds it. Then, it may become  a missile, as it rises off the floor and moves towards the scanner. This cannot be disentangled  from the horizontal forces because Fmax depends on the force pressing the object to the  floor, which is the difference between its weight and the opposing vertical magnetic force</para>

      <para>component. Because of this, objects positioned on the floor will tend to first travel along  the floor, move near the MR system, and then leap up off the floor into the scanner.</para>
      <para>Again, it should be noted that the magnetic force is related to the spatial gradient of the  magnetic field and not to the strength of the static magnetic field. While it is generally true  that a ferromagnetic object in the presence of a 3-Tesla MR system will tend to be more  strongly attracted than in association with a 1.5-Tesla scanner, with the emergence of new  “open”, vertical field MR systems it is conceivable that a lower strength magnet can have  larger spatial gradients than a higher field strength one. The take home message is that it is  always prudent to be cautious when introducing an MR Conditional item into the MR sys- tem room for the first time, even if the condition relative to the static magnetic field is met.  What is important is the allowable fringe field (e.g., 500-Gauss or less) for which the device  is labeled and where that value exists in the specific room where the device is intended for  use.</para>
      <para>For handheld item, the restraining force is related to the muscular activity of the indi- vidual holding the object. Like the frictional force, muscular strength can also restrain a  ferromagnetic object up to a point. Beyond this, the object may be snatched away from the  person’s grasp and become a missile. Normally, torque acting on the object is experienced  prior to this point.</para>

      <title>THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF MISSILE-RELATED   ACCIDENTS</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Why Missile-Related Accidents Occur </emphasis></para>
      <para>Human risk factors are fundamentally inherent in the delivery of healthcare associated  with medical devices and their applications during medical procedures. Simply stated, we  are human and we are imperfect, so accidents will happen. Missile-related accidents occur  for many reasons but there tends to be five main causes.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">(1) Faulty safety protocols.</emphasis> Some MRI facilities have inadequate or outdated safety  protocols that have dangerous gaps. Common examples include allowing untrained staff  members or maintenance people into the MR system room, inadequate training regimes,  lack of a policy regarding the use of certain types of equipment in the MRI environment,  and failure to check and follow equipment labeling (11). The solution for this is to have an  MRI Safety Officer or other individual responsible for developing and implementing proper  safety policies and procedures.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">(2) Ignorance of safety protocols by staff members.</emphasis> This occurs when staff members  have not been properly educated and trained to follow the MRI facility’s safety protocols  and, thus, they are ignorant or unaware of them. Common accidents where this is the cause  involve cleaning and maintenance staff as well as non-MRI medical professionals and other  individuals. The prevention of this problem involves a concerted effort to educate and train  all of those involved in the MRI environment.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">(3) Unintentional disregard for safety protocols.</emphasis> Staff members may unintentionally  disregard safety protocols due to lapses in concentration, or making wrong decisions under</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">407</emphasis></para>
      <para>high pressure settings, or in emergency situations (12). This can, and often does, occur with  highly experienced staff members. Long-term experience and a good previous record will  not ensure safety due to this cause. There is no practical mitigation against this, although  regular practice of safety policies especially those related to emergency situations may help.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">(4) Deliberate disregard of safety protocols.</emphasis> This is the “I know better than the MRI  Safety Officer” or “it will never happen to me” attitude. Some staff members guilty of such  attitudes may decide that some aspects of their safety protocols are unnecessary or incorrect  and, thus, they have decided to ignore them. Fundamentally, this is about the personality of  the staff member. Strong character traits of arrogance, pride, or an attraction to risk may  lead to this problem. Prevention of this issue is difficult, but training and safety inspections  help. Disciplinary action should be considered for staff members caught disregarding safety  protocols.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">(5) Incorrect or absent information on MR Safe or MR Conditional equipment.</emphasis> The cur- rent MRI labeling was instituted in 2005 (10). Equipment labeling prior to 2005 may not  have updated labeling applied. Even now, some equipment labeled MR Safe is not. Thus,  the regular review of equipment and application of proper labeling are important procedures  for MRI facilities. Additionally, MR Conditional equipment does not always have the con- ditions for use marked on the devices (13). Furthermore, an MRI facility may have recently  upgraded from a 1.5-T to a 3-T MR system, resulting in different conditions that may pose  risks. Prevention of this issue involves regular equipment inspections and review, particu- larly with regard to MRI labeling.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Frequency of Occurrence </emphasis></para>
      <para>It is well known that the majority of missile-related incidents are not reported. This is  because, in many instances, missile-related incidents that do not hurt individuals don’t tend  to be reported. Also, at least in the U.S., only a small minority of medical incidents of all  kinds that result in patient harm are reported (14). For accidents involving the missile effect,  estimates vary between 5% and 20% for the proportion of potentially harmful incidents that  are actually reported. Despite the unknown scale of the problem, the missile effect is often  quoted as one of the most serious hazards in the U.S. healthcare system (5).</para>
      <para>Fatalities in the MR setting are extremely rare, but it is estimated that major injuries  occur approximately once a year across 20,000 MR systems. For minor injuries, there are  no reliable statistics, but these are believed to be far more common. Expensive accidents  resulting in damage to the scanner and downtime are thought to be relatively common.  However, again, there are no reliable statistics in the public domain pertaining to this matter.  Small accidents involving scissors, pens, paper clips, and other similar items that can be  removed from MR systems without the need to quench the MR system are very common.  Most MRI facilities have several stories of such incidents but there are no known statistics  that document how often these problems occur.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Consequences of Missile-Related Accidents </emphasis></para>
      <para>An internet-based search for MRI accidents will reveal many photographs and reports  of some of the more serious cases. Floor buffers, gas cylinders, and office chairs are amongst</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">408</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Using Ferromagnetic Detection Systems in the MRI Environment</emphasis></para>
      <para>the most common missiles, although monitoring equipment, ventilators, tools and even  handguns may be seen. There are also many links to news reports describing accidents in- volving victims and near misses.</para>
      <para>If a patient or staff member is injured or killed, then there is a high risk of expensive  litigation, and a significant loss of reputation for the hospital or the MRI facility. Larger  ferromagnetic objects cannot be manually removed from the MR system unless the magnet  is quenched, reducing the level of the static magnetic field.</para>
      <para>Therefore, it is usual for the manufacturer of the scanner to provide technical support  to ramp the magnet down, remove the item, and repair any damage. After that, the magnetic  field of the MR system needs to be ramped-up and shimmed. This process can take several  days, resulting in a significant loss of imaging time. Estimates for the average cost of a mis- sile-related accident not involving human injury vary between $20,000 to more than  $200,000. If an injury is involved, the monetary costs can be excessive, not including any  commercial damage due to loss of reputation.</para>

      <title>FERROMAGNETIC DETECTION SYSTEMS</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Introduction To Ferromagnetic Detection Systems </emphasis></para>
      <para>Ferromagnetic Detection Systems (FMDS) designed for the MRI environment appeared  in 2002, shortly after the tragic death of Michael Colombini in 2001. Columbini was struck  by a steel oxygen that was brought into the MR system room while he was in the scanner  undergoing a brain MRI (15). Prior to this, conventional archway metal detectors and some  forms of magnetometers were tried at MR system room doorways, but these were not found  to be useful. Conventional metal detectors “alarm” on all metals, ferromagnetic and non- ferromagnetic and, therefore, may detect many objects that can be legitimately taken into  the MR system room which do not pose a missile-related hazard.</para>
      <para>The first example of a modern-day FMD device was installed in the Royal Hospital  Haslar in the United Kingdom in November 2002. Since then, several companies special- izing in FMDS have supplied these devices commercially (16-18).</para>
      <para>As the name suggests, ferromagnetic detection systems selectively detect ferromagnetic  objects, ignoring nonferromagnetic objects. Because only ferromagnetic objects pose a mis- sile-related hazard, an FMD device selectively detects threats and operates by monitoring  the ambient magnetic field using magnetic sensors. The ambient field is a combination of  the fringe field of the magnet and the Earth’s magnetic field plus the contribution from ar- chitectural steel and any other stationary steel objects in the immediate vicinity. A ferro- magnetic object distorts the ambient field in its vicinity. If it is brought close to an FMD  device, the distortion is detected as a changing magnetic field and an alert is triggered. This  is illustrated in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>, where the ambient field is illustrated as parallel horizontal lines.  A person who is not carrying any ferromagnetic material will not modify this field in any  way and can walk past the FMD device undetected, as seen in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4 (a)</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>son is far from the FMD device, the ambient field is unchanged, so the FMD device has not  detected the object, as of yet. In <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4 (c)</emphasis>, the person carrying the ferromagnetic object  is now close enough to the FMD device such that the perturbation in the field surrounding  the object has caused a change of the ambient field at the FMD device. This change triggers  an alarm.</para>
      <para>Importantly, an FMD device ignores static magnetic fields (i.e., magnetic fields that do  not change with time). In practice, this means that the FMD device is only sensitive to  changing magnetic fields or moving ferromagnetic objects. The device is insensitive to a  stationary ferromagnetic object, so if an object is placed near to an FMD device it will be  detected as it is put in place but thereafter ignored, until it is moved again. The reason for  this is that the ambient magnetic fields are very large compared with the magnetic pertur- bations caused by a ferromagnetic object, and it is difficult to measure tiny changes on a  large background field. The large static background is therefore removed by the FMD device  by filtering it out, irrespective of whichever components make up that static magnetic field  including the magnet of the MR system, the Earth’s magnetic field, or a metal cabinet next  to the FMDS.</para>
      <para>For a handheld FMD device, the object may be stationary but the FMD device is moved,  so it is the relative motion that is important when using this type of device. By comparison,  a stationary FMD device detects moving ferromagnetic objects only.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Magnetic Sensors </emphasis></para>
      <para>There are several types of magnetic sensors, however, only three types have been used  in devices used for FMDS. Each has relative merits and drawbacks. The detailed workings  of the sensors have been described previously (19). Therefore, only a brief summary of fea- tures relevant to FMDS is provided below.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Fluxgates </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>These are the most sensitive magnetic sensors used in FMDS. Fluxgates can resolve  better than 20 x 10<superscript>-12</superscript>-Tesla in a 1-Hz bandwidth at 1-Hz. Their main drawback is their high  price and several are needed in an FMD device. The high sensitivity and high price means  that fluxgates are only used in top-end FMDS.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Amorphous Magneto-Resistive (AMR) </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>These are solid-state devices with a resolution of 350 x 10<superscript>-12</superscript>-Tesla in a 1-Hz bandwidth  at 1-Hz and cost one-tenth of the price of fluxgates. Their main limitation is the limited sen- sitivity, so more of them are required to provide full coverage in an FMD device.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Induction Coils </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>These sensors are coils of wire wound on ferrite cores. They are intrinsically similar to  an AMR sensor in both sensitivity and cost. Induction coil FMDS are used by one company  in their hand-held FMD device (17, 18) where they use a magnet within them to boost the  ambient field and hence the magnetization of the ferromagnetic objects they seek to detect</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">411</emphasis></para>
      <para>(17, 18, 20). This adds to the effective sensitivity close to the FMD device’s sensors, but  the device should be kept away from electronic implants and the eyes.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Ferromagnetic Detection Systems </emphasis></para>
      <para>A stationary FMD device needs to be highly sensitive in its immediate vicinity but  highly immune to large moving ferromagnetic objects further away, such as cars on roads  and elevator counterweights. These FMDS consist of magnetic sensors along with the nec- essary amplifiers and filters to condition the signals. There are methods employed to provide  the rejection of unwanted distant moving ferromagnetic objects. Following the signal con- ditioning is the detection stage. Detection can be done in several ways but the simplest is  to rectify the signals so that they are always positive and compare them with a threshold  level. If the threshold is exceeded by the magnetic signal, an audible and visual alarm will  result. Adjusting the threshold modifies the sensitivity of the system. That is, a higher thresh- old means that the magnetic signal must be larger to exceed it and vice versa.</para>
      <para>There are two uses of FMDS: entryway and patient screening:</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Entryway FMDS.</emphasis> The purpose of these is to protect the MR system room and any people  within it. Entryway FMDS are systems that are normally mounted at or near to the entrances  of the scanner rooms. Their main use is to provide a warning to individuals approaching  the scanner room if they are bringing ferromagnetic objects with them, prior to their actual  entry. Normally these FMDS are configured to detect objects that can cause serious acci- dents such as phones, scissors and, in particular, larger ferromagnetic objects.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Patient Screening. </emphasis>These FMDS mounted in or near the patient preparation areas (e.g.  the dressing rooms) with the purpose of warning if the patient who is about to be scanned  is carrying a ferromagnetic object. This type of an FMD device may be a wall-mounted or  a handheld device. They are set to be of higher sensitivity than the entryway systems because  they need to detect relatively small objects such as bobby pins that may cause imaging ar- tifacts. This type an FMD device comes in two forms: wall-mounted as a single upright  unit, in front of which a patient rotates, or as a handheld device.</para>
      <para>For an entryway FMD device, if ferromagnetic objects are moving close to it that are  not intended to go into the MR system room, most manufacturers have techniques for sup- pressing the alarm unless the object is actually passing into the scanner room itself. This  reduces the unwanted or nuisance alarms (21). Because doors leading into the MR system  room tend to be relatively wide, in order to get good coverage across the width, the FMD  device will have sensors on both sides of the door. This may be in the form of two wall- mounted units as illustrated in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 5 (a)</emphasis>, a frame surrounding the door as shown in <emphasis role="bold">Fig-</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">ure 5 (b)</emphasis>, or two freestanding units that are upright poles with bases, although these are  less common.</para>
      <para>It is important to note that the sensors are housed in the upright sections of the FMD  device, and the closer these are together the more sensitive the system will be in its least  sensitive position, that is, at the midpoint of the uprights. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis> shows illustratively how  the field perturbation from a ferromagnetic object decays with distance as <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis> ∝ 1 / <emphasis role="italics">r</emphasis><superscript>3</superscript>.

      <para>were at the midpoint, position B, with a lower field <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>. This can more usefully be looked  at from the viewpoint of what the signal is measured by the FMD device as a function of  the ferromagnetic object’s position across the door to the MR system.</para>
      <para>Note that the FMDS response is non-uniform and has a minimum for objects at the  midpoint, point B (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). If the FMD device uprights were further apart, the minimum  would be lower. At some separation, the minimum will be reduced below the sensitivity  threshold of the FMD device. In this case, there will be a gap through which a ferromagnetic  object could pass undetected.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Sensitivity and Extraneous Alarms </emphasis></para>
      <para>Sensitivity (or true positive alert rate) in the context of FMDS is the ability for detecting  ferromagnetic objects. The higher the sensitivity of the sensors within an FMD device, the  smaller the ferromagnetic object it will detect. For a patient screening FMD device, this is  extremely important because a more sensitive device can find ferromagnetic objects that a  less sensitive one will miss. Not all FMDS are the same. Sensitivity can vary considerably  between different manufacturers. The FMD device market is unregulated and most manu- facturers claim, without accountability, to have the most sensitive products. When selecting  an FMD device it is especially prudent to ask the vendor to provide the evidence supporting</para>

      <para>The level of extraneous, unwanted alarms is also an important factor. FMDS have im- proved considerably in this regard since their initial introduction. For example, the door to  the MR system room is a large moving ferromagnetic object. Some FMDS now have a  mechanism for not alarming on the influence of the moving door. There are several other  frequently encountered effects in and around the scanner’s door that some FMDS now ig- nore or compensate for. Again, not all FMDS are the same for nuisance alarm rates.

      <para><emphasis role="bold">User Interfaces </emphasis></para>
      <para>To warn an individual approaching an MR system doorway with a ferromagnetic object,  entryway FMDS typically incorporate both lights and sound. For entryway systems, the  magnetic sensors can detect objects before they get to the threshold. The distance at which  they can do this depends on the magnetic susceptibility and size of the object and the sen- sitivity setting of the detector. Visible lights, normally green for no detection and red or yel- low for a detection, are used to indicate approaching ferromagnetic objects. It is incumbent  upon the person entering to stop and check themselves prior to entering if a red or amber  warning light is observed. FMDS also normally have a light beam or other sensor across  the threshold to sense whether a person or object is entering the scanner room rather than  passing by. If the beam is broken by an individual and there is a detected ferromagnetic ob- ject, then an audible alert will be issued (21). The audible alert is the final warning before  the MR system room is entered.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Installation Considerations </emphasis></para>
      <para>The effectiveness of an FMD device depends not only upon the quality of the system  itself, but where it is sited and what its environment is. We first consider the entryway  FMDS. It is important that an FMD device is sited such that anyone entering the MR system  room must pass through it. There may be many different architectural layouts for scanner  rooms, however, there are five main entrance types. These are, as follows:</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Off an atrium.</emphasis> In this case, the door is in the wall of a room that may have an open con- trol room (or several) or a waiting area. In some facilities, these are highly compact with  control room desks and patient transfer equipment in a confined space. Others have large  uncluttered areas.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">With an anti-chamber. </emphasis>Here, stub walls are built out from both sides of the MR system  doorway, usually to a distance of 1.5- to 2-meters. These may be built for a variety of rea- sons, but most commonly for allowing extra control desk and working areas, or dedicated  space for outward opening MR system room doors to swing into. Sometimes these are built  specially to accommodate an FMD device.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">End of a corridor. </emphasis>Due to being at the end, the last section of the corridor is dedicated  to the MR scanner. In this respect, it is similar to the anti-chamber setting. The system con- trol room will often have a door to the side of the corridor shortly before the MR system  door, itself.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Side of a corridor.</emphasis> This is a common layout but the least safe. This layout is poor prac- tice from a safety consideration unless the corridor can be a controlled area.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Mobile MRI trailer.</emphasis> This a highly compact setting and a smaller than standard MR sys- tem door is usually installed. The control room is in close proximity to the door.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">415</emphasis></para>
      <para>For each of these entrance types, the door may be swing-in or swing-out (although  swing-out is rare for a side of a corridor entrance). Usually the FMD device will be installed  on the immediate surrounding area of the door itself because there is normally available  wall space. It is preferable to use an FMD device that has a door-ignore capability to mount  at the door. Otherwise, the system should be offset a distance of 1.5- to 2-meters in front of  the door so the person entering has been screened by the FMD device before the door is  opened. This can only be practically achieved with anti-chamber or end of corridor layouts.</para>
      <para>For swing-out doors that open near an FMD device mounted on the outside of the door,  as issue is presented because the FMD device needs to distinguish between the door opening  and a person carrying a ferromagnetic object. In both cases, a moving ferromagnetic object  is passing through the FMD device, the door is safe and the person is unsafe. Different man- ufacturers of FMDS have developed different solutions to address this situation. One man- ufacturer developed a solution that allows the FMD device to be mounted on the outside of  a swing-out door and operate normally (22). Another manufacturer elected to install the  FMD device on the inside of the MR system room, so that the door swings outwards away  from the device, not through it (17). Notably, some MRI users regard this as providing a  warning too late, or as being non-compliant with ACR recommendations (2), while others  accept it.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">WHAT FMDS WILL AND WILL NOT DETECT:  </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS </emphasis></para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Magnetic Qualities of Potentially Dangerous Objects  </emphasis></para>
      <para>The physics involved with magnetics is not intuitive. There are two common miscon- ceptions that individuals have when they consider using an FMD device in the MRI setting.  It is often expected that identical objects will have identical magnetic qualities but, in fact,  they can magnetically vary by several orders of magnitude. Another misconception is that  larger ferromagnetic objects will be magnetically stronger (and pose a greater risk) than  smaller ones. This premise can be true but so can the converse. Probably the most common  question asked of the FMD device manufacturers is, <emphasis role="italics">what is the smallest object that can be </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">detected?</emphasis> It is one of the most difficult questions to answer because a ferromagnetic object’s  size is not strongly related to its magnetic properties. Furthermore, because of the strong  dependence on distance, very small ferromagnetic objects may be detected close to an FMD  device sensor, whereas at longer distances to the FMD device, the same or larger objects  may not be detected.</para>
      <para>As previously mentioned, the magnetic properties of a ferromagnetic object depend pri- marily on the material’s magnetic susceptibility and the shape of the object (23). For objects  with different sizes but made of the identical material, there is potential for the larger objects  to be more heavily magnetized than the smaller ones. Also, for objects of identical size but  made from different materials, there is potential for the objects with higher magnetic per- meability to be more heavily magnetic than those with lower magnetic permeability. For  example, a “weakly magnetic” pair of scissors made from steel can be magnetized more  than a stainless steel pair of the same size and shape.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">416</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Using Ferromagnetic Detection Systems in the MRI Environment</emphasis></para>
      <para>Very small objects have only a limited potential to achieve high magnetic moments.  Most magnets associated with MR systems will have relatively minor missile-related oc- currences by paper clips, pens, or other small objects. The limited magnetic qualities along  with the very light weight of certain objects such as those means that they cannot accumulate  enough kinetic energy to do damage or cause much inconvenience (unless the object impacts  a particularly delicate area, such as the human eye). There is clearly a grey-scale between  this and a missile-related accident with larger objects that will be inevitably serious. Using  an FMD device at the MR system door should, at the mid-point of the door, at least detect  the latter.</para>
      <para>The relative signal strength related to the magnetic qualities of different objects that  may be commonly found in the MRI setting has been measured (M.N. Keene, unpublished  data) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>). These measurements were made in the fringe field, just out- side of an MR system room at 1-Gauss and at the mid-point, 75-cm from the uprights of  the FMDS. The average of several movements past the FMD device for each object are  shown. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis> shows data for objects commonly found in control rooms and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>  shows data for personal items. The vertical scale is consistent between <emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">8</emphasis>. Depending upon the type of sensor used (or brand of the FMD device), the maximum  sensitivity that is available is between 0.06 and 0.3 on this scale. Notably, the signals are  much higher if the objects are near to the FMD device’s uprights.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Working With Entryway FMDS  </emphasis></para>
      <para>The ideal FMD device (which does not yet exist) would have the following qualities:  (1) no adaptations to workflow would be needed to accommodate the FMD device, (2) the  FMD device would never alarm unless there was a ferromagnetic object entering the MR  system room and (3) the FMD device would only alarm on loose objects that could become  a hazard and not on tethered or restrained ferromagnetic objects (e.g., bra underwires or  docking tables associated with scanners).</para>
      <para>It is not ideal for MRI technologists or radiographers to have to modify their behavior  to accommodate an FMD device. The main concern is opening and entering the door (which  is highly magnetic) to the MR system room. At least one system allows the door to be  opened and swinging as the MRI technologist enters and is still able to screen them effi- ciently (16). Others do not and so the door must be open and stationary before anyone can  enter. The door is not an issue where an FMD device that is mounted a few feet in front of  the door, although this configuration only works with certain facility layouts.</para>

      <para>moving ferromagnetic objects in Zone III but different systems do this to different degrees.  Also, the more compact the Zone III space is, the more likely this will occur.</para>
      <para>An FMD device cannot yet distinguish between loose ferromagnetic objects that could  become missiles and “fixed” ferromagnetic objects that cannot. For example, the bolts in  an MR Conditional gurney or the ferromagnetic components in MR Conditional monitoring  equipment become problematic for screening. In these instances, the FMD device detects  only the presence of ferromagnetic objects and not whether they are free to move. Therefore,  extraneous alarms are inevitable in some circumstances. This will be discussed in more de- tail in the following section.</para>
      <para>Overall, the use of an FMD device is believed to significantly enhance the safety level  of MRI facilities, although non-ideal aspects of the current systems can impact the day-to- day activity and workflow of the MRI staff members, especially the MRI technologists.  The individuals who are believed to cause most missile-related accidents are non-MRI work- ers who enter the room. While MRI technologists may not be able to supervise and control  access to the scanner room constantly, an FMD device can and, thus, provides a warning to  a person entering when the door is unsupervised. If non-technologists cause “alarms”, they  should be trained to seek the advice of an MRI technologist before entering the MR system  room.</para>
      <para>When an FMD device alarms, its purpose is to prompt the MRI technologist to inves- tigate. For example, an MRI technologist pushes an MR Conditional stretcher into the room  and the alarm sounds, as always, because the stretcher typially has ferromagnetic compo- nents. The correct response of the MRI technologist is to stop and to perform a final check  of the patient and the stretcher. Is the stretcher acceptable to use with this particular MR  system? Is there a ferromagnetic oxygen cylinder or IV pole present that is MR Unsafe? Is  there a ferromagnetic object under the sheets such as a sand bag with metallic shot? The in- correct response is to ignore the alarm because an MR Conditional stretcher will always  trigger an alarm. Many accidents have occurred because of ferromagnetic items being placed  on top of stretchers or underneath sheets, next to the patient. In this case, the alarm from  the FMD device acts as a reminder to do a final check. It must be emphasized that FMDS  are an adjunct to all other safe practices established for the MRI environment and should  not replace any part of it. An FMD device adds an extra layer of safety.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Extraneous Alarms and False Alarms: Causes and Prevention </emphasis></para>
      <para>There is an important distinction between false alarms and extraneous (nuisance)  alarms. A <emphasis role="italics">false alarm</emphasis> occurs when there is no ferromagnetic material passing through the  FMD device but the alarm is activated. This may be due to some external factor causing a  magnetic disturbance at the same time as a magnetically “clean” person passes through or  by the FMD device.

Notably, with extraneous alarms, the FMD device is functioning  normally and doing its job.</para>
      <para>If the frequency of extraneous alarms is excessive, alarm fatigue sets in and staff mem- bers soon begin to ignore the FMD device. When this occurs, the FMD device is reduced  in effectiveness during the working hours of the MRI facility, although it still remains ef- fective for non-MRI staff members. However, most of the causes of extraneous alarms are  preventable and within the power of the MRI technologists to remediate them. Certain so- lutions exist to prevent extraneous alarms including, the following:</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Staff member clothing and accessories.</emphasis> This can be one of the biggest causes of extra- neous alarms. One of the most common items is the ferromagnetic underwires in bras. Con- sidering the activities of female MRI technologists, nurses and other personnel, these wires  may come into close proximity with the MR system’s magnet and, thus, become highly  magnetized, for example some underwires can increase in magnetization by 20 times as a  result of exposure to an MRI magnet. Other objects such as watches, bracelets, and shoes  with tangs or metallic supports can also trigger the FMDS. Alternatives for all such clothing  and accessories are readily available. Watches and ferromagnetic jewelry can easily be re- moved.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional equipment.</emphasis> For patient transfer equipment, there are products that are  available that are entirely nonferromagnetic and, thus, will not cause extraneous alarms.  The use of nonferromagnetic transfer equipment means an FMD device will alarm only on  any ferromagnetic materials carried on them. For docking tables associated with scanners,  patient monitors, and other equipment there is currently no solution. It is recommended that  the extraneous alarm should be used for the purpose of taking the time to check the equip- ment for objects placed upon them before proceeding into the MR system room.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Patient clothing and accessories.</emphasis> It is always best practice to place patients in pocketless  gowns or scrubs in preparation for MRI examinations. Accordingly, any FMD device alarm  will be real and not extraneous. Underwire bras, shoes with metal supports, and ferromag- netic jewelry issues are the same as for staff members.</para>
      <para>There is a relationship between the effectiveness of an FMD device and its sensitivity  level that becomes limited by the extraneous alert rate (24). Referring to <emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>, the ‘ef- fectiveness’ of an FMD device is its ability to warn users that there are ferromagnetic objects  entering the MR system room. When plotted against the sensitivity setting of an FMD de- vice, the effectiveness increases with the sensitivity setting, up to a point (Point A in <emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">9</emphasis>). Further increasing the sensitivity results in lowered effectiveness due to alarm fatigue  (Point B) caused by watches, shoes, pens, badges, underwires bras, and other items that the  staff members may have as they enter the scanner room or pass the FMD device, or due to  MR Conditional equipment with ferromagnetic components. Where such things are limited,  the extraneous alarm rate may be lowered and a higher sensitivity level can be set, thus, in- creasing the FMD device’s effectiveness (Point C). Some facilities operate a “zero mag- netic” working policy (see next section) and with this, the highest effectiveness is achieved</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">420</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Using Ferromagnetic Detection Systems in the MRI Environment</emphasis></para>
      <para>(Point D). Therefore, the sensitivity of an FMD device should be set appropriately for the  environment to the maximize the effectiveness point.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Zero Magnetic Working In the MRI Environment </emphasis></para>
      <para>While it is unacceptable for patients to enter the MR system room with unnecessary  ferromagnetic objects, it is often deemed acceptable (albeit poor practice) for staff members  to do, with the exception of those objects are retained in place by counterforces (e.g.,  watches, underwire bras, belt buckles, etc.).  Zero magnetic working in the MRI environ- ment is a method of working whereby staff members adopt the same mantra as patients and  have no unnecessary ferromagnetic objects. The purpose is to minimize extraneous alarms  on entryway an FMD device so that they can be set to a higher sensitivity level with a low  extraneous alert rate (Point D, <emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>) to provide higher levels of safety. In addition, zero  magnetic transfer equipment is used so that an alert will register a ferromagnetic object on  a non-ambulatory patient being transferred into MR system room.</para>
      <para>Obviously, zero magnetic working is challenging to adopt. It requires staff members to  use tested products to wear, or to take a small magnet into stores to test clothing items. For  example, it will be noted that not all underwires in bras are magnetic. While martensitic  stainless steel wires are ferromagnetic, austenitic stainless steel or other nonferromagnetic</para>

      <para>materials or nonmetallic materials used for this same application are acceptable for zero  magnetic working. Unfortunately, all materials are rarely if ever reported on product labeling  for clothing items. Therefore, the only practical approach is to test them with a magnet.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Guidance on the Adoption of FMDS </emphasis></para>
      <para>The effectiveness of an entryway an FMD device for improving safety depends pre- dominantly on the attitude of the MRI facility’s managers and MRI technologists. The in- troduction of an FMD device significantly increases the potential for safety improvements,  but this may not be realized due to various factors. To illustrate this, two examples are pro- vided.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">MRI Facility A</emphasis> purchased several entryway FMDS to protect their scanner rooms. They  adopted a zero magnetic working policy. The patient transfer equipment was replaced with  entirely nonferromagnetic equivalents. A culture of “zero tolerance” to unnecessary ferro- magnetic materials entering the MR system rooms was introduced. Staff members were re- quired to be entirely nonferromagnetic, adopting the same standard of “magnetic  cleanliness” as their patients, and even wore pocketless scrubs to prevent accidental entry  of objects. Each patient was gowned and checked with a screening FMD device prior to  entry into the MR system room. The doors to the scanner rooms were always kept closed  when not in use. The low extraneous alarm rate that resulted from these measures allowed  each FMD device to be set at a relatively high sensitivity level, such that it could detect  smaller ferromagnetic objects. The staff members had regular MRI safety training and were  able to contribute to the evolving safety protocols for the facility.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">MRI Facility B</emphasis> also purchased several entryway FMDS to protect their MR system  rooms. Unfortunately, the ferromagnetic detection systems were purchased by an inexperi- enced manager without consultation the MRI technologists. The staff members were un- willing to change the way they clothed, and the managers were unwilling to enforce a  clothing policy. They kept their regular MR Conditional transfer equipment. Staff members  resisted making any workflow concessions with regard to the doors to the MR system  rooms. Patients were not gowned and their family members were allowed into the scanner  rooms. A patient screening FMD device was not utilized. Despite being set to a low sensi- tivity to reduce extraneous alarms, each FMD device alarmed on virtually every entrance  and exit occurrence. When this became intolerable each FMD device was turned off.</para>
      <para>The examples of <emphasis role="italics">MRI Facility A</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">MRI Facility B</emphasis> may be regarded as being at oppo- site ends of a safety spectrum where one facility maximized its safety standard and repre- sented best practice, while the other facility was unchanged from its initial poor practice.  For any MRI facility, improving safety with regard to missile-related accidents using an  FMD device is a journey. Some facilities choose to make that journey in one leap with a  radical culture change to become like <emphasis role="italics">MRI Facility A</emphasis> in a very short time. Typically, the fa- cility will usually have good reason to do this with the most common reason being an oc- currence of a missile-related accident or near miss that shocked the facility. Events like  these tend to unite the MRI technologists and the facility management to take all effective  measures to prevent a problem from occurring again.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">422</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Using Ferromagnetic Detection Systems in the MRI Environment</emphasis></para>
      <para>For most facilities, the implementation of an FMD device involves gradual changes.   The FMD device may be set to the modest sensitivity initially (e.g., Point A in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>. As  the MRI technologists improve their protocols, procedures, and their surrounding environ- mental factors, the sensitivity of the FMD device may be increased accordingly, as time  goes by. Well-organized facilities do this as a defined structured plan. It is possible with  some entryway FMDS to chart the number of entries into MR system room and the number  for which an alert was issued (see <emphasis role="italics">The Entryway FMD Device as a Safety Management Tool</emphasis>  below). Thus, improvements due to new procedures, workflow or environment can be meas- ured. It is much more motivating for MRI technologists to see that changes can result in  measurable improvements to safety.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Workflow Aspects of Using an Entryway FMD Device </emphasis></para>
      <para>The FMD device should be sited where workflow is least affected. For an MRI facility  that is high on the safety scale where extraneous alarms are low, there is very little impact  on workflow. In the case of where there are a substantial number of extraneous alarms and  each one is investigated, the impact increases. In many facilities, the workflow is a key pri- ority that will not be compromised. There are two common responses to this situation. One  is to ignore the FMD devvice, which reduces safety levels. The other is to move up the  safety scale to reduce the extraneous alarms. Both responses retain the workflow, but one  increases safety while the other reduces it. For example, implementing a nonferromagnetic  clothing policy tends to make the greatest impact on maintaining workflow in a positive  safety direction followed by changing to nonferromagnetic patient transfer equipment.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">The Entryway FMD Device as a Safety Management Tool </emphasis></para>
      <para>Recent innovations in entryway FMDS have taken them beyond a warning device at  the MR system door. Some entryway systems (16, 17) now have optional cameras that can  make a short video recording or take a series of photographs when an alarm is triggered.  This may help a facility understand the causes of alarms or to perform a root cause analysis  on missile-related events.</para>
      <para>The most advanced FMDS can additionally collect data from the scanner doorways and  provide access and interpretation of it to be presented on an app or a web browser (16). The  data that such an FMD device can measure include the number of times the MR system  room (i.e., Zone IV) has been entered, the number of times a ferromagnetic object has en- tered, the general level of magnetic activity in the area prior to the MR system room (i.e.,  Zone III), the status of the door (i.e., opened or closed), and the FMD device’s self-test re- sults. These data accumulate with time so trends can be observed. The data from each en- tryway FMD device within the facility can be inspected from an office computer, or on a  smart phone or tablet remotely, and at any time by authorized users.</para>
      <para>These data can be distilled into information that is useful to a facility manager, the MR  safety officer, or the lead MRI technologist. For example, knowing the proportion of entries  that cause extraneous alerts may be used to track the progress of process improvements im- plemented to reduce the entry of ferromagnetic objects. Additionally, the trend over time  provides evidence of safety improving or worsening. Because the data from all MR systems  owned by a facility are monitored, comparisons can be made between different shifts and</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">423</emphasis></para>
      <para>between different scanners. This reveals where attention needs to be given for safety im- provements. It is obvious that the fewer unnecessary ferromagnetic objects that enter the  MR system room, the lower the probability of missile-related accidents. Thus, to measure  and analyze this information will help to manage the improvement processes. Example data  that illustrate the above is shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>. This facility implemented a procedural  change during a one-month period that resulted in a lower number of incidents related to  ferromagnetic objects.</para>

Here, it was observed that the ingress of unnecessary ferromagnetic material into the MR  system room (Zone IV) required improvement. A process improvement was introduced at  the end of February 2017 and the situation measurably improved. (Figure courtesy of Me- trasens Ltd.)</para>

      <para>Data on the status of the MR system door can also drive safety management decisions.  For example, the data may show that MRI A has the door left open on average 10 minutes  per hour but is used by individuals passing through only for 2 minutes. By comparison, for  MRI B, the door is only opened for people passing in and is closed at all other times. This  may suggest for MRI A, that the door is left open unnecessarily, which is a safety weakness  whereas MRI B has a good safety practice in this regard.</para>
      <para>High levels of magnetic activity outside the MR system door may indicate the presence  of ferromagnetic objects that could accidently and easily be carried into the room because  they are in the immediate vicinity. It is not uncommon to find ferromagnetic trash bins,  chairs, stools, linen carts, oxygen cylinder carts, and crash carts placed immediately outside  the door to the scanner. Having the data to indicate which MR system room has a high level  of magnetic activity immediately outside the door may motivate an inspection and lead to  improvements.</para>
      <para>The collection of these data from across a facility, regardless of whether they are in dif- ferent buildings or even different cities, allows these aspects of safety to be actively man- aged, centrally. Improvements can be targeted, and the effect of any changes measured.  Safety changes that are evidence-based are often more acceptable than seemingly esoteric  changes.</para>

      <title>FERROMAGNETIC DETECTION SYSTEMS FOR USE TO   SCREEN PATIENTS</title>
      <para>Using an FMD device for patient screening is becoming more common (25-29). The  main purpose of this practice is to check patients for ferromagnetic objects just prior to the  MRI examination. The utilization of an FMD device will help to prevent potential missile- related incidents from devices a patient may bring into the MR system room and to reduce  scanning artifacts due to small and well-hidden ferromagnetic objects such as bobby pins.</para>
      <para>A detailed study by the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority (30) reveals the range of  objects and frequency of reported events for ferromagnetic items that passed conventional  screening undetected. This study included events where objects were carried in by staff  members. Ferromagnetic screening can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary fer- romagnetic objects being carried into the MR system room by patients, as well as staff mem- bers if they screen themselves as a safety check.</para>
      <para>There are two types of patient screening FMDS available, wall-mounted as shown in  <emphasis role="bold">Figures 11 (a)</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">11 (b)</emphasis> and a handheld device, <emphasis role="bold">Figure 11 (c)</emphasis>. For a wall-mounted FMD  device, the patient approaches the unit and slowly rotates in front of it. This process brings  all parts of the surface of the patient within a few inches of the FMD device, which has a  twofold purpose: (1) the small distance between a ferromagnetic object and the magnetic  sensors permits smaller (i.e., lower magnetic susceptibility) objects to be detected and (2)  it provides the necessary motion of the ferromagnetic object relative to the FMD device.  By comparison, handheld FMD device is used to methodically scan the surface of the pa- tient.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">425</emphasis></para>
      <para>Performing patient screening using an FMD device does not tend to have extraneous  alarms because only the patient is screened and should essentially be free of ferromagnetic  objects. Staff members and equipment are not screened this way unless there is a policy for  this procedure.  However, patient screening using an FMD device is subject to false alarms  if there is a moving ferromagnetic object nearby during this screening process. Normally,  the MRI technologist can easily identify this situation by observation, and repeat the screen- ing, as needed.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">The Patient Screening Process Using an FMD device </emphasis></para>
      <para>Screening the patient using an FMD device is an additional step in the screening process  and is the last step before the MRI examination. It is important to note that it is not a re- placement for any aspect of the screening procedure but rather it is an supplemental proce- dure that adds a final objective check prior to performing MRI (29). This type of screening  normally takes less than a few minutes to complete provided that there is no positive alarm.  It takes somewhat longer to use a handheld FMD device because it has to be manually  scanned over the entire surface area of the patient’s body. Ideally, there will be a line item  at the bottom of the screening questionnaire that records the result FMD device screening  and any observations or actions as a result.</para>

      <para>If a patient passes the FMD device screening without a detection occurring (i.e., no  positive alarm), this should be documented on the screening form and the patient may then  proceed with the MRI examination. If an alarm occurs, then the patient must be investigated  for the presence of a ferromagnetic object and it should be removed, if possible. Once this  has been completed, the patient should be re-screened using the FMD device. If a ferro- magnetic object cannot be found, the FMD device screening should be repeated in case the  original result was a false positive alarm. With genuine alarms that cannot be resolved, the  MRI technologist must then suspect the possibility that the ferromagnetic object is internal,  being either an implant or a foreign body (25-29). The patient’s history should then be thor- oughly checked before proceeding to MRI.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Detection Performance </emphasis></para>
      <para>The earlier discussion concerning the size of ferromagnetic objects that can be detected  using entryway FMDS applies to patient screening utilizing an FMD device, as well. How- ever, due to the shorter distance when using a patient screening FMD device, magnetically  weaker objects can be more reliably detected. In general, bobby pins, hair barrettes, and  other similar items can be reliable detected with the best performing patient screening FMD  device. Obviously, this feature is good for artifact reduction and will save time re-scanning  individuals in the MRI setting. However, very small ferromagnetic objects are not likely to  be detected, such as a small metallic ferromagnetic foreign body in the eye.</para>
      <para>Because potentially dangerous objects that are discovered by FMD device screening  and removed prior to MRI are not reportable, the efficacy of patient screening using this  technique in clinical environments is difficult to accurately measure. Some investigations  have been performed and report the performance of using a patient screening FMD device  (25, 31, 32), but several are unpublished. A summary of information regarding clinical alert  rates is provided in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>. It is interesting to note that although the patients in each of  these published and unpublished studies were gowned, there were a surprising number of  positive alarms. These alarms were mainly associated with removable dental implants, eye- glasses, underwire bras, and other objects.</para>

      <para>The use of a wall-mounted FMD device provides head-to-toe, whole-body screening  that is easy to accomplish and fast to perform for cooperative ambulatory patients. For non- ambulatory patients, the only means of screening with a wall-mounted FMD device is to  use a nonferromagnetic gurney or wheelchair and perform a “drive-by” in two directions  parallel to the wall, pushed by an MRI technologist that has no ferromagnetic objects. How- ever, this process will not provide the close distance required to detect the smallest objects,  but is nonetheless useful for the detection of larger personal items.</para>
      <para>The use of a handheld FMD device (17, 18) is somewhat similar to using a handheld  metal detector (e.g., the type used at airports), insofar as it must be swept or scanned over  the surface of the individual’s body at close range, usually within 5-cm of the surface. The  sensing area is relatively small (approximately 5-cm x 9-cm) so that care must be taken to  ensure that screening occurs with no gaps while maintaining a relatively short, stand-off  distance. Due to this being a manual process, the quality and reliability of the screening de-</para>

      <para>pends on the person performing the scan using the handheld FMD device. Staff members  may be reluctant to screen an intimate patient area, such as the groin, which may result in  safety issues as reported by James et al. (26). Notably, the only available handheld FMD  device at this time has a strong permanent magnet within it to boost the magnetization of  ferromagnetic objects (17, 18). Because of this, this type of handheld FMD device should  never be used close the eyes, near cardiac pacemakers, or other similar implanted devices  to prevent the magnetic field from posing possible problems. A handheld FMD device can  be used for a non-ambulatory patient on an MR Conditional stretcher or wheelchair, as well  as nonferromagnetic ones. Using a stretcher, the patient needs to turn over from one side to  the other to get full coverage for proper screening. Using a wheelchair, it is more difficult  to get full coverage unless the patient can stand in front of the FMD device for a short period  of time.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Screening for Ferromagnetic Implants, Devices, and Foreign Bodies </emphasis></para>
      <para>The question surrounding the detection of ferromagnetic implants, devices, and foreign  bodies is a current research topic with growing interest (25-29, 31). The use of a patient  screening FMD device is not intended to be used for the specific purpose of detecting im- planted objects according to the manufacturers of these systems. However, because human  flesh is effectively transparent to ferromagnetic detection, the distinction between <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis>  and <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> ferromagnetic objects is merely one of range, and it can therefore be expected  that ferromagnetic implants can be detected. Investigations on implant and foreign body  detection have been conducted (25-29, 30, 32). Recently, a more comprehensive study con- fined to cardiac pacemakers demonstrated that good detection of such devices is possible  with all pacemakers detected in the study group (33 different pacemaker models)(32).

      <para>makers constitute by far the largest proportion, (58% compared to second place 14%), of  objects causing adverse screening events in the most systematic study currently available,  to date (30). Implanted objects can range from completely nonferromagnetic (e.g., aban- doned cardiac pacing leads) to highly ferromagnetic items. The implants that may or may  not be reliably detected are, therefore, dependent upon the sensitivity of the FMD device.  It is important to note that FMDS are not approved medical devices by the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration and, thus, cannot be sold as “implant detectors”. Because of this, there  are no standards of performance for the detection of implanted devices.  Therefore, it is im- portant to see published evidence in the peer-reviewed literature for performance of different  FMDS if patient screening is to be considered for this additional use.</para>
      <para>It is important to note that conventional handheld metal detectors are still commonly  found in patient screening areas. These handheld devices transmit a fluctuating magnetic  field, which, if strong enough, could exceed the safe conditions for certain active implanted  devices. However, the manufacturer rarely states the specifications for their device and how  it changes with distance. As such, it is difficult to be certain that these are acceptable metal  detectors for use on patients intended to detect active implants. Experimental studies have  not determined a combination of implantable device and metal detector that may cause an  adverse event (33), likewise for the handheld FMD device (17, 18) that contains a strong  magnet (17, 18).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Siting Considerations for FMDS </emphasis></para>
      <para>Wall-mounted and handheld patient screening devices have two requirements on their  installation or use location. First, this type an FMD device needs to be installed in a con- venient position from the point of view of efficient workflow. This will typically be in the  patient changing or preparation area, or sometimes in the immediate area prior to the MR  system room (Zone III), although this is less ideal due to the activities in this area. The sec- ond requirement is that it is located sufficiently far enough awayfrom interfering magnetic  sources so that it can be set to maximum sensitivity. Interfering sources may include public  corridors, roads, and elevators.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">INTERVENTIONAL, INTRAOPERATIVE, HYBRID-MR SYSTEMS,  </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">AND 7-T MRI ENVIRONMENTS </emphasis></para>
      <para>There are increasing numbers of hospitals using suites where the MRI is not a stand- alone diagnostic imaging tool. These include interventional, intraoperative, hybrid-MR sys- tems (e.g, PET/MR, radiation therapy MR, etc.), and ultra-high-field systems, each of which  present new challenges for patient safety with respect to missile-related events. These suites  are intrinsically more at risk from ferromagnetic projectiles than regular clinical MR scan- ners for two important reasons: (1) there is a more varied mixture of staff members involved  with the procedures, so a consistently high standard of safety knowledge and training is  very difficult to achieve, and (2) there is a substantially larger number of types of equipment  that is needed in the respective scanner.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Interventional</emphasis>. The use of an entryway FMD device at an interventional MR system  room entrance is likely to be counter-productive unless it is implemented as part of a broader</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">429</emphasis></para>
      <para>safety strategy. The main issue is alarm fatigue because the mixture of different staff mem- bers, types equipment that is required for use in this setting, and other factors. Currently,  there are two approaches for the use of an entryway FMD device in the inteventional MRI  environment. The first is to implement a zero magnetic dress code for all staff members  working in this area regardless of role or position. Notably, an FMD device patient screener  repurposed as a staff screener outside of the suite will enable self-checking. All equipment  entering should be inspected for safety and transferred in only by the MRI technologist  preferably in advance of the procedure and other staff members arriving. This way, the  equipment may be checked by an experienced individual and the FMD device can be ig- nored or temporarily silenced (a feature that some FMDS have) during this ingress.. With  the exception of the patient being transferred to the room on the docking MR system table  or MR Conditional gurney, there should be no further extraneous alerts.</para>
      <para>The second approach is to use an entryway FMD device in an area some distance in  front of the suite’s door such that it can be bypassed. Thus, the FMD device can then be  used at the discretion of the MRI technologist to check individuals and equipment for which  there is some uncertainty. Objects or staff members that the MRI technologist has confidence  are safe for the MR system room but that are like to cause an alert, may bypass the FMD  device.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Intraoperative</emphasis>. For entrances inbetween interoperative suites (including the IMRIS Hy- brid Operating Suites), the issues and solutions are similar to the interventional suite. How- ever, if there is a door to the scanner room from the control room for the MRI technologist  to use and is not in the workflow for patients and the other staff members, then a regular  entryway FMD device may be used. Many intraoperative suites have inner sliding doors  between the operating room and the MR system, such as that used with the IMRIS Hybrid  Operating Suite. It is inadvisable to use an entryway FMD device in this setting because  there will always be nuisance alerts related to movement of the table. However, the instal- lation of a ‘<emphasis role="italics">patient screener</emphasis>’ FMD device near these doors in the OR side is advisable for  the use of OR staff to check themselves prior to entering the MR system room. It is the role  of the technologist to assess the safety of the docking table with the patient on the table.  This may be by visual inspection and also questioning the surgeon about whether any in- struments are internal to or attached to the patient.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Linac/MR</emphasis>. Linac (linear accelerator)/MR radiotherapy suites feature very heavy radia- tion shielded doors that are very slow opening due to the lead and concrete construction in  a steel frame. This presents a challenge to install entryway FMDS at the door as regular  door-ignoring technology in FMDS struggle to cope with slow moving automated sliding  doors. An entryway FMD device may be installed at the doorway, but it is best to wait for  it to fully open before entering.  Alternatively, they may feature a <emphasis role="italics">maze corridor </emphasis>leading to  a regular MRI door to prevent any line-of-sight for radiation leakage into the hospital. It is  advisable to install an entryway an FMD device in this corridor prior to the scanner’s entry  door.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">7-T MRI Environment.</emphasis> The introduction of research and clinical 7-T MR systems pres- ents new challenges for safety. The magnetic fringe fields are generally higher than for 1.5-  and 3-T and, thus, the forces acting on ferromagnetic objects will be higher. Much of the</para>

This important task been accomplished  by Culo, et al. (34) for many commonly used patient support devices including wheelchairs,  IV poles, instrument tables, step stools, and others devices. Entryway and/or patient screen- ing FMDS may be used for 7-T MRI settings similar to how they are used with lower field  strength scanners. In 2019, Hoff, et al. (35) presented general safety considerations for the  7-T MRI environment.</para>

      <title>REQUIREMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FMDS</title>
      <para>In the United States (U.S.), the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends  the use of FMDS in their guidance document on MR safe practices (2). This document is  largely regarded as a model for the standard management of patients referred for MRI ex- aminations. The Facilities Guidelines Institute (FGI) requires FMDS for new and retrofitted  builds (36). The FGI guidelines have been adopted by The Joint Commission in their En- vironment of Care Standard EC.02.06.05 and by over 40 states in the U.S. (37).</para>
      <para>In the United Kingdom. the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  (MHRA) recommends the use of FMDS (38), and Italy is likely to emerge as the first coun- try to have a national requirement (39). There are other international bodies that make sim- ilar recommendations based on the ACR’s recommendations (2). Therefore, it is advisable  for all MRI facility planners and managers to familiarize themselves with the recommen- dations or requirements from their national regulators with respect to FMDS.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>The safety of patients, staff, equipment, and reputation of an MRI facility should be  recognized as a holistic issue, not just about the use of an FMD device, but the entire culture.  This culture should be characterized by the adoption of best practice in safety procedures,  staff training and education, use of safety-related technology along with a striving for con- tinuous improvements at all levels. Unfortunately, there is a notion that adopting high safety  standards often work against the high throughput or efficiency of the MRI facility. This is  a dangerous and incorrect perspective.</para>
      <para>The availability of an FMD device as a safety technology has substantially increased  the potential safety levels that a facility may attain. If these devices are adopted with the  view that they are one key element of an overall safety improvement program, they will be  most effective.  If they are adopted as an excuse to do nothing more on training or safety  procedures, they will have a limited positive benefit.</para>
      <para>Earlier in this chapter, the ideal FMD device was defined. As the technology continues  to develop, systems will move toward this ideal. The main non-ideal issue present with an  FMD device relates to extraneous alarms, which are partly a result of the introduction of  the FMD device into a setting where unnecessary ferromagnetic objects may be routinely  carried into the MR system room and partly due to problematic siting (e.g., in proximity to  equipment that transmits “magnetic noise”). Hopefully, technology used for FMDS will  evolve to eventually overcome these matters.</para>

      <para>FMDS are not currently subjected to regulatory standards so there is no minimum per- formance standard defined for these devices. When selecting an FMD device, an MRI fa- cility currently has to rely on the manufacturer’s claims, whether or not a satisfactory  experience occurred during the demonstration of the product, or recommendations from  MRI safety experts. Fortunately, articles in the peer-reviewed literature have also helped to  support the use of FMDS to prevent incidents and accidents.</para>
      <para>At some point, the use of an FMD device may become an essential screening tool for  MRI facilities. To date, the statistical impact that these devices have on safety has yet to be  investigated and, therefore, it is difficult to know how many accidents or injuries have been  avoided. As the recognition of the need to improve MRI safety proliferates and as the use  of FMD device technology correspondingly widens, the global MRI community will hope- fully become substantially safer.</para>
      <para>Entryway FMDS may now have an additional use in the management of safety due to  the data they collect at the doorway. This has elevated them from being just a point-of-use  device to, additionally, an IoT (Internet of Things) device whereby safety managers may  view and act upon data from all of their scanners in order to direct changes and target im- provements, as well as to measure improvements. Additionally, these particular devices pro- vide a recorded audit trail. Patient screening FMDS are increasingly being used as a final  objective check for a patient before performing MRI. Their ability to discover certain im- portant-to-detect implants and foreign bodies has been realized (26-32).</para>
