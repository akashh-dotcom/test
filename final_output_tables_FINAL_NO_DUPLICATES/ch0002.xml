      <title>INTRODUCTION: MAIN SOURCES OF RISK IN MRI</title>
      <para>The Standard Model of physics requires 61 fundamental particles to describe the world  we live in: 24 for matter and for antimatter, and 13 for interactions between them. Thankfully  this chapter is mostly about just one, the electron. Some of the fundamental particles truly  have superhero powers: Neutrinos can fly through the Earth as if it were not even there;  about 65 billion solar neutrinos do so every second for every square centimeter of Earth’s  surface facing the Sun. The Higgs boson can give mass and inertia to objects. Quarks and  anti-quarks can mix and match into hundreds of wildly different composite particles, some  as mundane as neutrons and protons and others as exotic as pentaquarks or Upsilon mesons.  Fortunately, this chapter is only about electrons.</para>
      <para>A magnetic resonance MR system or scanner in operation can be thought of as a dance  of electrons. A torrent of them goes around and around in the coils of the main magnet,  while jets of them streak back and forth in the wires that form the gradient and radiofre- quency (RF) coils. Each electron generates a field around itself, to inform the Universe  about how everything with electrical charge should get attracted or repelled by it. When an  electron moves, it sends a new field, an updated version of the old one. These updates travel  outward at the speed of light, broadcasting an electromagnetic wave. As electrons dance,  they coax nuclear spins into a dance of their own and the MRI signal is created. This chapter  is about this dance of electrons and how individuals may be injured when it goes wrong.</para>
      <para>As the term “magnetic” in the name announces, an MR system is very much about mag- netism, and fields generated by electrons flowing in three main types of coils are involved  in creating images. First there is the so-called ‘main magnet’, which produces the large  static magnetic field. This is most often a superconducting electromagnet but it could also  be a permanent magnet. Added to this are coils to generate the radiofrequency electromag- netic field, referred to as “RF coils”. Lastly, the “gradient coils” are responsible for creating  linearly-varying magnetic fields, for spatial encoding purposes. While these coils and the  manner in which the fields they generate interact with matter can lead to useful images,  they can also cause serious threats to human subjects (1-11).</para>
      <para>The main risks associated with MRI have been extensively reported and studied. For  example, everyday objects may turn into projectiles, RF energy deposition can cause burns,  time-varying gradient magnetic fields can induce nerve stimulation and loud noises can  lead to auditory loss. These various risks are associated with the three types of coils dis- cussed above: main magnet, RF coils, and gradient coils, and will be discussed in turn,  below. A number of reviews and exposés on related topics can be recommended as supple- mental reading (12-23). For those who wish to go even deeper into the physics, excellent  basic textbooks exist on electromagnetism (24, 25) and the magnetic properties of materials  (26). Good intuition on the interactions between electromagnetic fields and materials can  be obtained through numerical simulation of Maxwell’s equations (27), the fundamental  equations that govern these interactions. For this we recommend an excellent textbook by  Elsherbeni and Demir (28) that comes complete with well-documented Matlab code.</para>
      <para>The present chapter is focused toward providing intuition about the physical mecha- nisms that give rise to MRI-related risks. In the process, several equations will be presented,  including the Lorentz force equation and two of Maxwell’s equations that provide the math- ematical basis for the physical interactions considered. All others, along with their applica- tion in several detailed sample calculations, are meant to assist the reader gain intuition  about these interactions, in particular, with respect to size and degree. How strong is the  magnetic force? How much will the RF field heat the tissues? How much current will be  induced in a conductor? In this chapter, we intend to provide an understanding of the degree  to which a particular interaction might represent a hazard, and in this sense, we hope that  this information will be useful to the reader.</para>

      <title>RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAIN MAGNET</title>
      <para>The main magnet of a commercial MRI system is the most distinguishing feature of  the device, and also the greatest source of risk. The field it generates, approximately 1.5 to  3.0 Tesla (T) for the most widely used high field strength scanners, is much stronger than  magnetic fields casually encountered in everyday life. For example, it is roughly 30,000 to  60,000 times stronger than the earth’s magnetic field at the surface and is roughly 300 to  600 times greater than the field of a common refridgerator magnet. While the universe can  certainly create much stronger magnets (e.g., the field generated by some neutron stars may  reach 100 billion Tesla), magnets used for MRI are among the strongest that exist on Earth.  Because MRI involves field strengths much higher than the typical everyday experience,  regular objects may behave in a non-intuitive manner near scanners. How objects behave  in such conditions greatly depends on what they are made of, and for this reason we will</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">35</emphasis></para>
      <para>begin by looking at the magnetic properties of materials. For objects most affected by mag- netic fields, we will consider the translational and rotational forces acting on them. We will  also look at the effect of the scanner’s static magnetic field on biological processes and the  effects of motion in such an environment.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Susceptibility and the Magnetic Properties of Materials </emphasis></para>
      <para>When a given material is placed in an external magnetic field, it becomes magnetized.  Permanent magnets are always magnetized regardless of whether an external field is present  or not, but permanent magnets are rare in nature and more mundane everyday objects require  the coaxing of an external field to become so. The ‘volume magnetic susceptibility’, com- monly represented by the symbol <emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">v</emphasis>, or more simply <emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis>, expresses how easily a given ma- terial becomes magnetized. While some material such as crystals may require <emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis> to take the  form of a tensor, more typically <emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis> is just a number and it relates the degree of the induced  magnetism to the strength of an externally applied field. <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> below gives the suscepti- bility of some common materials. More generally, values of <emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis> for elements of the periodic  table have been tabulated and are readily available from online sources such as www.peri- odictable.com.</para>

The first  category, large and positive, represents ferromagnetic materials and is the only category  causing safety concerns in the presence of <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis>, the MR system’s large static magnetic field.  At room temperature only a few elements such as iron, nickel and cobalt exhibit ferromag- netic properties. Of these, iron is most widespread, and for this reason iron-containing ob- jects are typically the culprits for projectile incidents at MRI sites. While all materials are  to some extent magnetized when subjected to a large magnetic field, ferromagnetic materials  are distinguished in that the magnetic dipoles of every molecule in the material can possibly  come into alignment, resulting in a very large magnetization. In such case the object is said  to be ‘saturated’ as further increasing the external field could no longer increase the object’s  magnetization.</para>
      <para>Most everyday objects that do not contain iron would fit in the latter category, having  small and negative magnetic susceptibility. Such materials are called diamagnetic and in- clude common materials such as water, wood, many types of plastics, and essentially all  biological tissues. The negative sign associated with their magnetic susceptibility means</para>

      <para>that such materials are (ever so slightly) repelled by a magnet. A slightly-frivolous yet most  dramatic demonstration of this fact was achieved by levitating frogs (29). (Example I pres- ents a calculation for the conditions to levitate a frog along with a rough estimate for what  it would take to get a human subject off the ground!)</para>
      <para>The third type of material, with small and positive magnetic susceptibility, is referred  to as paramagnetic. Although not particularly common in everyday life, paramagnetic ma- terials such as gadolinium and manganese play an important role in the design of chemical  contrast agents in MRI. Furthermore, the paramagnetism of deoxyhemoglobin is central to  the endogenous blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast exploited in functional  MRI. Chemical contrast agents and their safety is a topic deserving of consideration on its  own, beyond the scope of the present chapter.</para>
      <para>In the following subsections, we will look at the translational and torsional forces ex- erted on ferromagnetic objects due to an external magnetic field. Paramagnetic and dia- magnetic materials will not be considered any further, as forces in these materials are  generally too small to be of any practical relevance to safety. Because iron is such a prevalent  metal, it might be easy at times to develop the impression that all metallic objects must be  ferromagnetic. However, in reality, metals such as copper and many types of stainless steel  are essentially non-magnetic. Assuming they are pure enough, objects made of these non- magnetic metals do not cause any projectile risk in an MRI environment. That said, and  given the prevalence of iron in everyday objects, suspicion toward all metals and testing  with a hand-held magnet remains a healthy reflex.</para>
      <para>The computation of forces and torques can be very complicated because they depend  on the strength of the magnetic field and of its spatial gradient, as well as the exact compo- sition and geometry of the object submitted to it. While a more thorough discussion of this  topic can be found elsewhere (18), the text below aims at providing intuition about the  forces at play.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Translational Forces Due to Interaction with a Static Magnetic Field </emphasis></para>
      <para>Ferromagnetic objects are attracted to magnets, so logically, the closer one such object  gets to an MR scanner the stronger the attraction should grow, should it not? Actually, no,  in fact a ferromagnetic object at the center of the bore would feel no attraction at all, and  maximum force would instead be felt somewhere outside the scanner. This is one example  of non-intuitive behavior, further explained below.</para>
      <para>The magnetic field generated by the main magnet is referred to as <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis></emphasis>. It is a vector field  meaning that <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> has a magnitude and an orientation at every point in space. The spatial gra- dient of the main field is simply the change in the field’s magnitude, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis>, with respect to po- sition or distance. In general, the spatial gradients of a given quantity are obtained by  applying the ‘grad’ operator, denoted as ‘𝛁’. Accordingly, 𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> represents the spatial gradient  of the main field of the MRI; at every point in space the magnitude of 𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> represents how  steeply <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> is changing around this point, and the orientation of 𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> points in the direction  of steepest change. The units for 𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> are Tesla per meter (T/m), or alternately, Gauss per  centimeter (G/cm). While the Tesla is the official unit for magnetic fields according to the  International System of Units (SI) the Gauss still remains frequently used. One Tesla is</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">37</emphasis></para>
      <para>equal to 10,000 G, one meter is of course equal to 100 cm, and as such 1 T/m is equal to  100 G/cm.</para>
      <para>In addition to the spatial gradient of the main field (above), another key quantity in de- termining the force exerted on an object is the magnetization of this object: a strongly mag- netized object will interact strongly with <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis></emphasis> while a non-magnetized object will not. The  magnetization of an object, <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">M</emphasis></emphasis>, its magnetic dipole, <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis></emphasis>, and its internal flux density, <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis></emphasis>, are  closely-related concepts. The internal flux density may be simply equal to <emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis></emphasis>, although  complicating factors such as saturation and object shape will be considered below. The mag- netization differs from <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis></emphasis> through a constant of nature, the permeability of free space, so  that <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis></emphasis>=<emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis><emphasis role="italics"> </emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">M</emphasis></emphasis>. The magnetic dipole, <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis></emphasis>, represents the whole object while <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">M</emphasis></emphasis> is expressed  per unit of volume, so that <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis></emphasis>=<emphasis role="italics">V</emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">M</emphasis></emphasis> where <emphasis role="italics">V</emphasis> is the volume of the object. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> shows a  schematic representation of an idealized magnetic dipole and its associated magnetic field  lines; the magnetic dipole can be thought of as a current loop enclosing some small region,  thus explaining its units of measure, amperes times meters-squared (Am<superscript>2</superscript>). While the dipole  itself has no actual spatial extent, it does create a magnetic field in the space around it equiv- alent to that generated by such a current loop.</para>
      <para>An expression for the translational magnetic force, <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">trans</emphasis></emphasis>, which can transform everyday  objects into projectiles, can be obtained by calculating the Lorentz force due to <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> acting  on the current loop that is assumed to generate the magnetic dipole (30). More specifically,  <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">trans</emphasis></emphasis> depends on the magnetic dipole and spatial variations in the field (26, 30, 31):</para>

      <para>The dot product of two vectors as used in Equation (1) is a scalar with a magnitude  equal to the product of the lengths (magnitudes) of the two vectors times the cosine of the  angle between them. If we assume that <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis></emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis></emphasis> point in the same direction, then the angle  between them is zero, the cosine of that angle is 1, and the middle term in Equation (1) be- comes the simpler term on the right, <emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis> 𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis>, where <emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis>  represents the magnitude of <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis></emphasis>.  Note that <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">trans</emphasis></emphasis> is also a vector that points in the same direction as 𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis>. For the remainder  of this chapter, however, we will be dealing only with the magnitude of the force,   <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">trans</emphasis>= <emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis> |𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> |.</para>
      <para>In terms of MRI safety, values for <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">trans</emphasis> are not necessarily very telling by themselves.  For example, while the strength of one person’s arm might be more than enough to throw  a hammer in dangerous fashion, the same arm is unlikely to get a large file cabinet to budge  in any real way. As a rule of thumb, whenever magnetic forces are significantly less than  the gravitational pull on the object then the magnetic forces should pose no major safety  concern (32, 33), as weight and friction should prevent the object from turning into a pro- jectile. Therefore, in Equation (2) below, the magnitude of <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">trans</emphasis> from Equation (1) is placed  in relation to the gravitational force, <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">g</emphasis>, on the same object:</para>
      <para>In Equation (2), the relationships <emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis>=<emphasis role="italics">VB</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis>/<emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis>=<emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">g</emphasis>=<emphasis role="italics">mg</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">ρ</emphasis>=<emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis>/<emphasis role="italics">V</emphasis> were also  employed, where <emphasis role="italics">g</emphasis> is the gravitational acceleration constant, <emphasis role="italics">ρ</emphasis> is the material density and  |𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis>| at any given point is the length of the vector 𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> at that point. The numerical value  of the constant C, in ferromagnetic metals, is about 10 m/T<superscript>2</superscript>, a number that will be used in  examples later in the text. Note that <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">trans </emphasis>/ <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">g</emphasis> depends on <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> |𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis>|, often referred to as the  spatial gradient product (SGP). Equation (2) is independent of how much material there is;  while a larger object would lead to a stronger magnetic force it would also be heavier, leav- ing <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">trans </emphasis>/ <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">g</emphasis> unchanged. This “relative magnetic force”, <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">trans </emphasis>/ <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">g</emphasis>, will prove useful in es- timating the degree to which a magnetic field can pull on or attract objects.</para>

      <para>Equation (2) is not always applicable, as saturation and the shape of the object also play  a role, as further detailed below. While the term <emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis><emphasis role="italics"> B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> in Equation (2) represents the strength  of the magnetic flux as created within the object, such flux could not grow to arbitrarily  large levels even if the magnitude of the applied field, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> were to grow arbitrarily large. In- stead, it would plateau once a maximum value is reached. This maximum is the saturation  flux density, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">s</emphasis>.

For example, in nickel, <emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis> is around 600 and <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">s</emphasis> is 0.64 T, thus, Equation (2) is  only appropriate wherever <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> remains below 1.1 mT. Wherever the material is saturated,  Equation (2) should therefore be modified as follows:</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">s</emphasis> in ferromagnetic objects may range from about 0.25 to 2.5 T, with nickel at about  0.64 T and iron at up to around 2.5 T.</para>
      <para>Based on Equation (3), one can estimate how strongly a scanner may attract ferromag- netic objects in its vicinity. The maximum spatial gradient (MSG) on some modern MR  systems can exceed 10 T/m and accordingly, from Equation (3), with <emphasis role="italics">C</emphasis> ≈ 10 m/T<superscript>2</superscript>, magnetic  forces on objects made of nickel or iron can readily reach 60 or 250 times their weight, re- spectively. Even for a modest one-pound iron object, one can appreciate how magnetic  forces can readily become superhuman in nature, and that no amount of ‘holding on tight’  to an object might come close to matching them. Such a force is enough, for example, to  accelerate an iron object to a speed of 200 km/hr in less than 25 milliseconds.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Demagnetization Factors</emphasis></para>
      <para>Magnetization in ferromagnetic objects very much depends on their shape, a fact that  Equation (2) does not take into account. As the microscopic domains of ferromagnetic ma- terials become aligned with the applied field, their strong magnetic dipole fields overlap so  as to partly cancel each other, effectively reducing the magnitude of <emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis>. Alternatively, one  may think of the induced magnetic field of the material as having a component that opposes  the applied field, referred to as the demagnetizing field (26). The demagnetizing field un- dermines the work of the externally applied field as it tries to magnetize the material, ef- fectively reducing the susceptibility.</para>
      <para>Figure 1 may help to visualize the idea of the demagnetizing field. The field lines of a  single dipole oriented in the <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis>-direction are shown schematically in the figure (see white  lines with arrows). Locations where the <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis>-component of the dipole field is positive are high- lighted in the drawing on the right. Magnetic material in the highlighted region will be en- couraged to align in the same direction as the dipole, i.e., to become magnetized. In contrast,  wherever the <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis>-component of the dipole field is negative, as highlighted in the drawing on  the left, magnetic materials tend to align opposite the dipole, i.e., to become de-magnetized.  A flat object with almost no extent in the <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis>-direction would have a large demagnetizing  field, while a slender object aligned along <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis> might be associated with a negligible demag- netizing field. In general, for arbitrarily-shaped ferromagnetic objects, determining the de- tails of this demagnetizing field can be very complex and requires the use of numerical  methods.</para>

The force index is equal to <emphasis role="italics">C B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">s</emphasis> in Equation (4) so that one can determine the magnetic  force at any location in the magnetic field (relative to its weight) simply by multiplying the  force index by the magnitude of the spatial gradient at that location (assuming the object is  already saturated as was assumed when constructing the maps in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>). <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> gives  the force index as measured for several common objects along with a hypothetical strongly  ferromagnetic piece of iron.</para>

      <para>this more intuitive, we put the force in relation with the translational force, <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">trans</emphasis>, on the  same object (18). More specifically, the ratio between the maximal values of both of these  forces is given below. Of course, the maximal values of these forces do not occur at the  same location in/around the scanner as   occurs near the isocenter while   occurs  near the entry to the bore. Even so, the ratio between the two forces can help one understand  the importance of torqueing as a safety issue, particularly for small implants. We find that,</para>
      <para>where <emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis> is the length of the object. As an example, taking typical values for a 3T  shielded MRI system with a maximum spatial gradient of 10 T/m, and assuming <emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis>= 1 cm,  we find from Equation (6) that the force one needs to apply to the ends of the object to pre- vent torqueing in the magnetic field can reach 30 times the maximum translational force.  Thus, especially in the case of an elongated object implanted into the body, potential damage  from torqueing can readily become a greater source of concern than translational forces.</para>
      <para>It may seem at first somewhat counterintuitive that for an object of greater length (larger  L in Equation (6) the relative importance of   is reduced compared to  . As an  object becomes longer/bigger the torque on it would increase, but so would the translational  force and both effects cancel out in the ratio in Equation (6). The remaining 1/ <emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis> dependency  in Equation (6) is a consequence of our definition of <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">torque</emphasis> as the force needed at the ends  of the object to prevent rotation: a smaller force is required at the ends of a longer object to  oppose rotation, for the same reason as loosening a bolt with a long-handled wrench can be  much easier than with a short-handled one.</para>

      <para>For currently available clinical MR systems, magnetic translational forces and torques  on diamagnetic and paramagnetic tissues have been estimated and shown to be much too  small to be of any safety concern. For example, the tendency of iron-containing red blood  cells to separate from plasma due to the differential translational force (Δ<emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">trans</emphasis>) based on  the susceptibility difference of the tissues (Δ<emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis>) can be calculated. If one assumes a relatively  high but realistic SGP of 25 T<superscript>2</superscript>/m and in Equation (2) replaces <emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis> with Δ<emphasis role="italics">Χ</emphasis> and ρ with Δρ,  the difference in density between red blood cells and plasma, then Δ<emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">trans</emphasis> is found to be  less than 9% of the difference in gravitational pull (Δ<emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">g</emphasis>) on the tissues (18). Although, for  the SPG of 1400 T<superscript>2</superscript>/m that was sufficient to levitate frogs (which admittedly is not a very  realistic SPG for a practical human-sized MRI), the Δ<emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">trans</emphasis> would be more than 400% of  Δ<emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">g</emphasis>. Accordingly, assuming a suitable magnet were available to a human who was willing  to share in the frog’s exhilarating experience of magnetic levitation, there might also be a  partial separation of their red blood cells from plasma in the process, with unknown health  effects.</para>

Whether these vestibular symptoms may be caused by magnetic forces, for example,  those resulting from anisotropic susceptibility or from the magnetohydrodynamic effect, or  whether they may be related to induced currents associated with motion in the magnetic  field, still remains unclear (20).</para>
      <para>Another potential force effect comes from current-carrying tissue structures being phys- ically pulled one way or another by the Lorentz force. As charged particles move in a mag- netic field, a force emerges that is perpendicular to both the direction of motion and the  field:</para>

Note  that <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">v</emphasis></emphasis> × <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis></emphasis> is equivalent to an electric field, <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis></emphasis>, acting on the particle. The magnitude of  the Lorentz force on current-carrying metallic conductors can be significant as will be dis- cussed in the section on gradients. However, currents in biological tissues such as nerves  are generally found to be too small to be of any practical concern even at field strengths as  high as 20 Tesla (35).</para>
      <para>The Lorentz force acts on all charged particles in motion, and these particles may some- times take the form of ions (i.e., charged molecules) in a flowing liquid. Such interactions  fall under the general category of magnetohydrodynamics and the effects in the body have  been studied extensively (36-38). Blood flowing in a direction orthogonal to a magnetic  field experiences a reverse pressure impeding the flow but this is expected to result in an  insignificant increase in blood pressure even in a high field MRI (36, 37). Of greater prac- tical concern is that positive and negative ions in blood are pushed in opposite directions  by the Lorentz force, causing a charge separation and an electric field that corrupts electro- cardiograms and complicates the task of performing cardiac-gated MRI (39-41).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Effects of Movement in a Strong Static Magnetic Field </emphasis></para>
      <para>It is well known that movement in a magnetic field can induce a voltage (due to Fara- day’s law of induction to be discussed in more detail later) in electrically conductive mate- rials including biological tissues, especially when the motion is through regions of space  where the magnetic field changes steeply. For example, near the entry to the bore of a 3T  MRI where |𝛁<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis>| tends to be greatest, it can be shown that current densities over 0.1 A/m<superscript>2</superscript>  may be produced in conductive tissues due to the voltage induced by normal movement  (42, 43). This is more than twice the 0.04 A/m<superscript>2</superscript> (low frequency) limit for exposure of work- ers recommended by the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection  (ICNIRP) (44). While there is controversy regarding whether the ICNIRP limit might be  too conservative, currents induced in tissue deserve serious attention as a potential MRI  safety concern especially when new high-field MR systems are introduced. Furthermore,  because the magnitude of the induced current is proportional to conductivity, significant  current densities may also be generated in metals used in implants. For example, currents  induced in metallic heart valves have been studied over such concerns (45).</para>

The maximum strength of <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1 is only a few mi- croteslas (<emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis>T), an order of magnitude lower than the earth’s magnetic field at the surface  and many orders of magnitude smaller than <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis>.

      <para>here. Dividing the SAR in Equation (9) by the heat capacity of tissue, which is around   4200 J/kg/°C, one obtains the rate at which tissue is expected to heat if it had no independent  way of cooling itself. For example, a SAR of 4.2 Watts/kg will heat tissues at a rate of   10<superscript>-3</superscript> °C per second. A volume of tissue subjected to this energy deposition will be heated  1°C (the FDA exposure limit) in 1000 seconds, or about 17 minutes, again assuming there  is no cooling during this period.</para>
      <para>In order to meet regulatory requirements, it is necessary to measure or calculate the  SAR for MRI pulse sequences. A rough estimate of the SAR at the surface of the body may  be obtained using a simple loop model (13). Based on the Maxwell-Faraday equation (i.e.,  Equation (8)), in a surface ring of tissue of radius, <emphasis role="italics">R</emphasis>, exposed to a uniform RF field, an  electric field would be generated in the loop with peak magnitude as follows:</para>
      <para>where <emphasis role="italics">f</emphasis> is the Larmor frequency (in Hz) and <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">P</emphasis> is the peak amplitude of the magnetic  field component of the electromagnetic field produced by the RF coil. Equation (10) predicts  the behavior of the <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> field as seen in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>, in the sense that the length of the arrows in  <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis> increases linearly with <emphasis role="italics">R</emphasis>, the distance from the center of the phantom. More specif- ically, in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italics">R</emphasis> would be the size of a circle, centered with the simulated phantom,  where a time-varying <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis> field generates an <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> field. Combining Equations (9) and (10),</para>
      <para>Equation (11) is the usual expression for SAR, as widely published and employed. Al- though simplistic in some ways detailed below, the equation is useful in the sense that it  shows some important trends such as SAR increasing with the square of both <emphasis role="italics">f</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">P</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>Overall, the assumption that Equation (10) gives the true value of E<emphasis role="italics">P</emphasis> (and thus Equation  (11) gives the true SAR) is reasonably accurate for low frequency excitations (e.g., below  10 MHz). Simulations reveal, however, that even at a frequency of 42.58 MHz, the Larmor  frequency at 1 T, the estimate of the magnitude of the electric field based on Equation (10)  is not accurate. Why is this?</para>
      <para>Looking back at <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis> we are reminded that the oscillating <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold">1</emphasis> field generated by  the RF coil induces an electric field <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold">1</emphasis> and, in a conducting medium, a circulating conduc- tion current density equal to σ<emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold">1</emphasis>. This induced current in turn generates a new magnetic  field as seen from another of Maxwell’s equations, Ampere’s law, which further connects  <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis> as follows:</para>

Equation (12) expresses the fact that a magnetic field is generated around a closed loop  equal to the sum of the total current passing through the surface enclosed by the loop. Am- pere’s law applies to all currents and, as shown schematically by the drawing on the right  side of <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>, this also includes those eddy currents generated through Faraday induction  that were discussed above. Thus, there is a new induced <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">i</emphasis></emphasis> field that combines with the  original source RF field and, because of this, the magnitude of the generated electric field  no longer has a simple dependence on the transmitted field, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">P</emphasis>.

While solutions involving these simple models may be useful  in elucidating the basic behavior of electromagnetic waves in conductive tissue, they are  limited when it comes to obtaining direct answers as to what SAR can be expected for a  human MRI exam. For this, numerical methods, which are not constrained to solving for  simple geometries in homogeneous media, are typically employed (46). A good general dis- cussion of the use of numerical field calculations for MRI safety applications can be found  in (47-49) and with respect to the RF field specifically in (50).</para>
      <para>Obtaining accurate SAR estimates <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> is especially complicated by the fact that the  human body has a complex geometry and is not uniform in terms of its electrical properties  (51). Conductivities, for example, can vary by as much as an order of magnitude between  tissue types. Attempts have been made to develop human body models that, when used with  numerical simulation techniques, may give accurate estimates of SAR (52-61). A more  direct and potentially more accurate approach to estimate SAR is to use actual MR images,  for example, obtaining <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1 maps that may then be used to estimate the <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> field and derive the  SAR distribution (62-65), although it has been shown that significant changes in SAR and  heating distributions are not necessarily reflected in <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1 changes (51). Thermo-acoustic im- aging has also been investigated as a method for direct SAR mapping (66).</para>
      <para>It is important to note that, for the purposes of safety monitoring, SAR is merely used  as a surrogate measure for the potential to cause tissue damage. The real problem is heating.  Numerical models that use SAR, not as the endpoint, but as input to estimate resultant tem- perature changes in the body via, for example, the Pennes bioheat transfer equation, have  been employed to this end (67-72). An even more direct means of determining the likelihood  of tissue damage is to obtain <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> temperature maps through MR-based temperature map- ping using the fact that the water resonant frequency is temperature dependent (73-78).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">RF Interaction with Metallic Objects Forming Loops </emphasis></para>
      <para>As long as the MR system is functioning properly and limits regarding SAR are re- spected, no dangerous heating (or cooking of turkeys) should occur during routine MRI as  a result of RF irradiation. It is still possible, however, to cause serious tissue damage when  conductive metallic objects are present in patients. Currents generated by the RF field in  these objects do not significantly affect global SAR, but they can focus energy deposition  in small volumes and create localized tissue damage.</para>
      <para>Let us consider a copper loop placed perpendicular to the RF field orientation and ex- amine Equation (11), which was used when estimating the SAR of a ring of tissue. The con- ductivity of copper is about 8 orders of magnitude higher than that of biological tissues,  and its density is close to 10 times that of tissue. Accordingly, from Equation (11), the SAR  of the metal would be around 10 million times greater than in tissue and one would expect  enormous heating. The fact is, however, that there is actually very little heating of the metal- lic object (79). How can this discrepancy be explained?</para>
      <para>As detailed in the previous section, Equation (11) is only an approximation, and it can- not be applied to situations where currents are large (whether due to high <emphasis role="italics">f,</emphasis> or the presence  of highly conductive metal). The heating predicted by Equation (11) does not happen be- cause Equation (12), again, comes into play. The current in the loop will itself generate a</para>

If the current induced in the loop grows  large enough to generate a field that exactly cancels <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1, then no more current can be induced.  <emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>, which shows the total <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> fields under different simulated situations, illus- trates this fact. The <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> field is shown on the bottom left of <emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>, for a section of conduc- tive tissue-like material irradiated by a uniform 128 MHz <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1 field oriented perpendicular  to the section. The <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> field for the most part shows a radial dependence on intensity, as pre- dicted by Equation (10). Note that the total <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis> field is no longer uniform due to the contri- bution from the field generated by the circulating currents.</para>
      <para>In the middle column of <emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>, the total <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> fields are shown for the case where  a simulated conductive metallic ring was placed inside the tissue. Both the <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis> field  inside the ring almost completely vanished as a result. Not only is there minimal SAR within  the metallic ring itself (and thus no risk of dangerous heating) but the ring essentially acts  as a shield to limit SAR for tissues within it.</para>
      <para>Before wrongly concluding that loops of metal pose no risk in MRI, let’s consider the  case where a small break is present in the loop, as illustrated on the right side of <emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>.  Note that the <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis></emphasis> field remains mostly unchanged by the presence of a break in the loop, but</para>

(80), who demonstrated significant heating in a metallic radio- surgery head frame at the tips of screws that clamp the frame to the head. Loops of cables  that come in contact with the body also have the potential to cause burns and should be  avoided.</para>
      <para>Although a less likely scenario, there is also the potential that a loop-containing im- planted device might act as a circuit in resonance (79, 81, 82), in which case large amounts  of energy may be transferred, possibly resulting in destruction of the device and damage to  surrounding tissues. An un-blanked receive coil would be an example (83).</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">The Antenna Effect </emphasis></para>
      <para>The mechanism for RF heating discussed to this point has only involved the generation  of current via induction in conductive loops. Straight wires (not bent into loops) can also  pose a significant hazard and serious injury has resulted when they come in contact with  the RF field and are subjected to the so-called antenna effect.</para>
      <para>From antenna theory, it is known that currents can be induced in a conductive wire  when excited by an incident <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> field oriented parallel to the direction of the wire. This theory  has been invoked when explaining the observation that significant heating may be produced  at the tips of wires exposed to the RF field in MRI. This is a resonant phenomenon in the  sense that the length of the wire must be such as to support the formation of standing waves.  Typically, wire lengths of a half wavelength are most likely to result in the maximum heat- ing. The speed of light in void is 3 x 10<superscript>8</superscript> m/s, meaning that a wave with <emphasis role="italics">f</emphasis> = 127.7 million  oscillations per second would cover 2.35 meters per oscillation, which gives about 1.17 me- ters for a half wavelength. However, RF waves in MRI do not travel in void and one must  take into account the relative permittivity of tissue, εr=80. The half wavelength in tissue is  reduced compared to its value in the void by   down to about 13 cm here. The conduc- tivity of tissues also comes into play and brings the half wavelength value even further  down, for example, close to 12 cm if one assumes a conductivity of 0.5 S/m. Thus, in a 3T  scanner ( <emphasis role="italics">f</emphasis> =127.7 MHz), an implanted metallic wire in the range of 12 cm in length should  be especially worrisome although, given variability in the electrical properties of different  tissues and uncertainty in estimation of wavelengths, one should not assume there will be  no heating based on the length of the wire alone. Other factors, such as how the wire is ter- minated, were also shown to have importance in this regard (84, 85).</para>
      <para>The plot in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis> demonstrates the significant effect of wire length on heating in  the RF field. The results of simulations with conductive wires embedded in tissue-like ma- terial show that SAR at the ends of the wires is maximized at a length of 12 cm, the half  wavelength at <emphasis role="italics">f</emphasis> =127.7 MHz. The SAR image in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis> illustrates a highly localized en- ergy deposition in the conductive medium near the ends of the 12 cm wires, where electric  field variations are largest.</para>
      <para>Localized SAR amplification has been predicted by simulation (86) and extrapolated  from experiment (87) to 10,000-fold or more. Thus, even with relatively low RF input  power, temperatures can rise rapidly. Indeed, significant temperature increases from 20 to  60°C have been recorded in experiments with a variety of devices that include implanted  wires; deep brain stimulation systems (88, 89), vagus nerve stimulation systems (90), cardiac  pacemakers (84, 91, 92), guidewires (93, 94), EEG electrodes (95), implanted planar elec- trodes (96), and implanted stereo-electrodes (97). Temperatures exceeding 60°C were  recorded in copper wires of resonant length at 1.5T (79). An incident ascribed to action of  the antenna effect in an ECG lead resulted in a fire in 1.5T system and patient burns (98).  At high field strengths such as 7T, resonant lengths are much shorter and heating due to the  antenna effect can occur in devices such as aneurysm clips that are otherwise too short to  be a big concern at lower field strengths (99, 100).</para>
      <para>In addition to wire length and terminal conditions, the position and orientation of the  wire also have importance (101). This is demonstrated by simulation results shown in</para>

      <para>A common intuitive explanation for the antenna effect is that an incident <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis></emphasis> field of ap- propriate wavelength and oriented along the length of the wire forces current back and forth  coherently along the conductive metallic wire. The wire may then re-radiate energy as, for  example, a dipole antenna. More in-depth analysis proceeds by direct application of  Maxwell’s equations, yielding Hallen’s or Pocklington’s integral equations whose solution,  given the incident field, allows for the calculation of the current distribution on the wire  and (more importantly for a SAR estimation) the radiated field pattern (94, 102-104). Other  approaches such as treating wires as transmission lines using a lumped-element model have  been employed to estimate the current distribution along the wire (106-108). Experimental  approaches to measure the transfer function for heating given the incident electric field have  also been developed (109-111). Furthermore, MRI has been used to estimate the induced  currents by measuring their effect on the <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1 field (112-116) or to directly estimate SAR via  MRI-based temperature mapping (117-118) or by thermo-acoustic ultrasound (119). Direct  measurement of induced currents with special sensors has also been employed (120-122).</para>

      <title>RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GRADIENT FIELDS</title>
      <para>Electrons in the wires of the gradient coils are coaxed into moving in ways that mo- mentarily add to the much larger static <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> field. Gradient coils in MR systems are used to  encode spatial information by adding a relatively small component to the <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> field that varies  linearly with position, thus introducing a small spatially-dependent variation in the Larmor  frequency. In today’s systems, spatial gradients of around 40 mT/m (or 4 G/cm) are com- mon, and higher-performance systems may reach 80 mT/m. Assuming an imaging field-of- view (FOV) of 50 cm, a 40 mT/m gradient set produces a maximum magnetic field strength  of ±10 mT (±100 G) at the edges of the FOV. The magnitude of the fields produced by the  gradient coils is about three orders of magnitude stronger than magnitude of the fields pro- duced by RF coils, but between two and three orders of magnitude less than the static mag- netic field. With slew rates of 200 T/m/s, the orientation of these fields can be reversed in  less than one millisecond. Compared to the main magnet and the RF field, the gradient  fields are intermediate both in terms of their strength and of the frequency of their temporal  variations.</para>

      <para>While forces due to the magnetic field were the key source of risk for the static magnetic  field, and the generation of currents via magnetic induction was the key source of risk of  the RF field, both forces <emphasis role="italics">and</emphasis> magnetic induction come into play when considering the safety  of the gradient fields. How these issues are manifested, however, is quite different in the  case of the gradients.</para>
      <para>The problem of magnetic forces with reference to gradient coils is not one of keeping  ferromagnetic objects away from the fields. Indeed, applying Equation (3) for a saturated  iron object (<emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">s</emphasis> = 2.5 T), <emphasis role="italics">C</emphasis> ≈ 10 m/T<superscript>2</superscript> and assuming a maximum imaging gradient field of  40 mT/m gives a force ratio of 1, about two orders of magnitude lower than force ratios as- sociated with the main magnet (Section 1). For the gradients, the problem instead is the po- tential for ear-damaging acoustic noise caused by physical movement of the current-carrying  conductors of the gradient coils as they interact with the static magnetic field via the Lorentz  force.</para>
      <para>The problem of the induction of eddy currents is not the associated direct heating of  tissue as it is with the RF field (although heating of metallic objects via gradient induced  currents can be theoretically important). When Equation (11) is applied to calculate the  SAR at the periphery of a body 20 cm in radius, where the maximum gradient fields strength  would be ±4 mT (assuming 40 mT/m gradients), we obtain an SAR due to gradient switch- ing (at 1 kHz) of only 0.003 W/kg, compared to the 6.5 W/kg calculated for the RF field  strength of 2 <emphasis role="italics">μ</emphasis>T. Instead of direct tissue heating, for gradients, the major concern is nerve,  muscle and other sensitive tissue stimulation that may result from the electric fields asso- ciated with the induced currents. These issues are discussed in more detail below.</para>
      <para>It was noted in an earlier section that charges moving through a magnetic field experi- ence a force, the Lorentz force, proportional to velocity and the strength of the field (Equa- tion (7)). The Lorentz force acting on current-carrying conductors can be very large even  for moderate currents. Hundreds of amperes may flow through gradient coils, resulting in  enormous forces on the coil elements. This is comparable to the force ratio we found for</para>

      <para>ferromagnetic objects when in the region of the maximum spatial gradient of the MRI field.  Therefore, it is easy to see how it is that the rapid switching of such large currents and the  accompanying rapid reversal of the direction of the large Lorentz forces may result in loud  sounds (123, 124), the levels of which can easily exceed 130db in modern MR systems  (125, 126). Temporary hearing loss was reported in early studies even with relatively low- field systems (127) and guidelines have been established in the intervening years to protect  exposed persons from permanent hearing damage (126). Today, hearing protection is con- sidered mandatory during any MRI procedure in order to reduce acoustic noise to safe lev- els.</para>
      <para>Nerve and cardiac tissue stimulation, due to rapidly switching gradients, represent yet  another source of concern (128-130). The mechanism by which stimulation occurs has been  studied extensively (17, 21, 128). As discussed in previous sections, according to Faraday’s  law, time-varying magnetic fields induce an EMF around a closed circuit proportional to  the time rate of change of the total magnetic flux through the surface enclosed by the circuit.  Given the rate of change in the gradient field, <emphasis role="italics">dB</emphasis>/<emphasis role="italics">dt</emphasis>, with the maximum occurring at the  periphery of an FOV of radius, <emphasis role="italics">R</emphasis>, the maximum induced field, <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis> is given by <emphasis role="italics">R</emphasis>/<emphasis role="italics">2 dB</emphasis>/<emphasis role="italics">dt</emphasis> (i.e.,  this result is obtained from Equation (10) if one substitutes <emphasis role="italics">dB</emphasis>/<emphasis role="italics">dt</emphasis> for 2π <emphasis role="italics">f B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">p</emphasis> assuming a si- nusoidal variation of the gradient field with <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">p</emphasis> being the peak magnitude). In order to  achieve nerve stimulation, there is a threshold electric field strength, <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">s</emphasis>, which is equal to  <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">r</emphasis>(1+τc/τd), where τd is the duration of the stimulation, <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">r</emphasis> (called the rheobase) is the min- imum <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">s</emphasis> necessary to cause stimulation, and τc (called the chronaxie) is a reference stimu- lation time.</para>
      <para>Values for both the rheobase and the chronaxie are obtained through fits performed on  experimental data (129). From simple assumptions about the geometry of the subject, a  curve of <emphasis role="italics">dB</emphasis>/<emphasis role="italics">dt</emphasis> versus stimulus duration (gradient ramp time) can be obtained to determine  whether specific ramp durations are likely to cause nerve stimulation. Furthermore, by com- bining complex body models with electro-magnetic simulations and neuro-dynamic models,  accurate prediction of thresholds for stimulation of specific nerves has been shown (131).  Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is well within the capability of modern MR systems  and has been reported since the first echo-planar capable scanners became available (130).  While uncomfortable and possibly painful, PNS does not represent a serious threat. Cardiac  stimulation, however, could have serious consequences and must therefore be considered.  Fortunately, even with the current maximum dB/dt of 100 T/m, and maximum gradient am- plitude of 80 mT/m on the newest commercial MR systems, ramp times to reach peak are  well below threshold values to cause cardiac stimulation (17). However, cardiac stimulation  remains theoretically possible on some research systems outfitted with 300 mT/m gradients  (132), and, thus, special care must be exercised in such a setting.</para>
      <para>In addition to the effects of switching gradient fields discussed above, interaction with  implanted devices containing metals must also be carefully considered (133). In cardiac  pacemakers, gradient field switching could possibly induce currents that might create com- petitive pacing, with the potential of causing life-threatening arrhythmias (134-136). Unin- tended electrical stimulation of tissue due to induction of currents on the leads of other  active implants such as neurological stimulators could be another concern (137,138). In- duced currents from gradient switching may also cause heating of devices containing metal-</para>

      <para>lic components (139, 140) although the significance of this heating has not been generally  appreciated (141, 142). Gradient-induced currents may also generate a significant magnetic  moment and cause vibration of devices as gradients are switched (143, 144). Although less  of a safety concern than interactions with the <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">o</emphasis> or RF fields, the switching of gradient  fields should nevertheless be considered when evaluating devices for potential damaging  interactions.</para>

      <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>In this chapter, it was explained how electromagnetic fields associated with MRI interact  with human tissues and artificial objects. We also provided realistic numerical examples  regarding some of the main sources of risks in and around MR systems. With regard to all  potential interactions with biological systems, the present text, of course, only scratched  the surface. We have mostly limited ourselves to those interactions that are known to rep- resent potentially serious safety hazards in the context of today’s MRI setting.</para>
      <para>In focusing exclusively on the major hazards associated with MRI we have taken the  chance of creating the impression that there is little that can be done about any of it. Fortu- nately, one constant rule about technological development is that, once a problem is iden- tified, it may be only a matter of time before either a solution or a work-around can be  found, and so it is also with MRI. The problem of heating due to the RF field, especially in  regard to the interaction with implanted devices, is a good case in point. For example, a va- riety of techniques have been developed to defeat the antenna effect, by engineering wires  and cables to be safer (145-151), or making changes to the RF transmission system (152- 157). More general solutions to the SAR problem have involved pulse sequence and RF  pulse modifications (158), the use of dual and parallel RF transmitters (159-168), and the  strategic use of high-permittivity materials (169-171). Engineering solutions have also been  developed to address other safety-related issues such as reducing or buffeting the acoustic  noise produced by the gradient magnetic fields (172, 173). There is not much that can be  done to mitigate the danger inherent in the main magnetic field but there has been progress  in developing detection systems to help keep ferromagnetic objects out of the MR system  room (174-176). With appropriate evaluation based on a solid understanding of the physical  principles underlying interactions of materials with the MRI-related electromagnetic fields,  it is possible to scan patients with implanted devices where it was once considered an ab- solute contraindication by following specific conditions (177, 178).</para>
      <para>The central components of the MR system are the subsystems that generate the elec- tromagnetic fields essential to the production of MR images. Enormous energies go into  producing these fields, hence the potential dangers to life within them. MRI is known as a  safe imaging modality because it does not require the use of ionizing radiation and, with  proper care and management, the exquisite MR images we have come to expect can indeed  be obtained safely. Understanding the physics underlying the risks in MRI is a key compo- nent for proper care and management, and it is with this goal in mind that we offer this  work.</para>
