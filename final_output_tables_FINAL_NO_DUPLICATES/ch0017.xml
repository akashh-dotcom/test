      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Conventional physiological monitoring equipment and patient support devices were  not originally designed to be utilized in the harsh magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) en- vironment where static, time-varying gradient, and radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic  fields can adversely impact (e.g., as a result of missile effects), affect, or alter the operation  or use of these devices (1). Fortunately, various monitors and other patient support devices  have been specially modified or specifically developed to be utilized safely in the MRI set- ting (1-32). Thus, commercially available MR Conditional monitors and other devices (note,  certain devices are MR Safe if made from nonconducting, non-metallic materials) are readily  available and can be used routinely for patients in the MRI environment (1-32).</para>
      <para>MRI healthcare professionals must carefully consider the ethical and medicolegal ram- ifications of providing proper patient care that includes identifying patients who require  monitoring in the MRI setting and following a protocol that ensures their safety by using  appropriate equipment, devices, and accessories (1, 33-43). The early detection and imme- diate treatment of complications that may occur in high-risk, critically ill, or anesthetized  patients undergoing MRI can prevent relatively minor problems from becoming life-threat- ening situations.</para>
      <para>This chapter provides information, recommendations, and guidelines for patient mon- itoring in the MRI environment. In addition, techniques, equipment, and devices that may  be used to monitor and support patients undergoing MRI examinations are described herein.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MONITORING PATIENTS DURING MRI: RECOMMENDATIONS AND </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">GUIDELINES </emphasis></para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">General Policies and Procedures </emphasis></para>
      <para>In general, monitoring during an MRI examination is indicated whenever a patient re- quires observations of vital physiological parameters due to an underlying health problem  or whenever a patient is unable to respond or alert the MRI technologist or another health- care professional regarding pain, respiratory or cardiac distress, or other difficulty that might  arise during the examination (1-3). In addition, patients should be monitored if there is a  greater potential for a change in their physiological status or condition during MRI (1-3).  Besides physiological monitoring, various support devices and accessories may be needed  for use in high-risk patients to ensure safety (1-32).</para>
      <para>With the advent of advanced MRI applications such as MRI-guided interventional or  intraoperative procedures, there is an increased need to monitor patients, especially since  these individuals are typically anesthetized during the procedures. Additionally, patients (or  volunteer subjects) undergoing MRI examinations using experimental MR systems, exper- imental MRI accessories (e.g., transmit radiofrequency coils), or experimental pulse se- quences should be monitored continuously to ensure their safety due to possible problems  that may be encountered.</para>
      <para>Because of the widespread use of MRI contrast agents and the potential for adverse ef- fects or idiosyncratic reactions to occur, it is prudent to have appropriate monitoring equip- ment and accessories readily available for the management and support of patients who  may experience deleterious side effects (1-3). This is emphasized because adverse events,  while extremely rare, may be serious or fatal.</para>
      <para>In 1992, the Safety Committee of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Imaging pub- lished guidelines and recommendations concerning the monitoring of patients during MRI  examinations (2). The information indicated that all patients undergoing MRI should, at the  very least, be visually and/or verbally (e.g., intercom system) monitored, and that patients  who are sedated, anesthetized, or are unable to communicate should be physiologically  monitored and supported by the appropriate means (2).</para>
      <para>Severe injuries and fatalities have occurred in association with MRI technology that  could have been prevented with the proper use of monitoring equipment and devices (1, 3).  Notably, recommendations issued by The Joint Commission state that MRI facilities should  proactively plan for the management of critically ill patients who require physiological  monitoring and continuous use of life-sustaining drugs while in the MRI suite (33).</para>
      <para>Over the years, the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Anesthetic  Care for Magnetic Resonance Imaging has regularly issued practice advisories that include  advice on performing physiological monitoring in patients undergoing MRI examinations.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">436</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Physiological Monitoring of Patients During MRI </emphasis></para>
      <para>The latest advisory, published in 2015, has the following indicated purposes: (1) to promote  patient and staff safety in the MRI environment, (2) to prevent the occurrence of MRI-as- sociated accidents, (3) to promote optimal patient management and reduce adverse patient  outcomes associated with MRI, (4) to identify potential equipment-related hazards in the  MRI environment, (5) to identify limitations of physiological monitoring capabilities in the  MRI setting, and (6) to identify potential health hazards associated with the MRI environ- ment (34). With specific reference to monitoring patients during MRI, the Practice Advisory  suggests the use of appropriate equipment (e.g., MR Conditional monitors and other de- vices) and compliance with standards from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (34).</para>
      <para>The American College of Radiology’s (ACR) Manual on MR Safety has information  and recommendations for physiological monitoring of patients during MRI (35). The ACR’s  document states that monitoring techniques should be carefully selected primarily because  of the risk of thermal injury associated with monitoring equipment in the MRI setting. While  not all RF-induced thermal injuries can be detected as they are developing, sedated, anes- thetized, or unconscious patients are especially vulnerable to such injuries because they are  unable to provide the MR system operator with adequate warning of actively developing  thermal injuries. The ACR’s Manual on MR Safety also has advice regarding suitable mon- itoring devices that can be safely utilized to record various physiological parameters in the  MRI environment.</para>
      <para>Other organizations similarly recommend the need to monitor certain patients using  proper equipment and techniques in the MRI setting (36-38). <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> summarizes the types  of patients who may require physiological monitoring and support during MRI examinations  (1).</para>

      <para>The proper selection of the specific physiological parameter(s) that should be monitored  during MRI is crucial for patient safety. Various factors must be considered including the  patient’s medical history, present condition, the use of medication and possible associated  side effects, as well as the aspects of the MRI procedure to be performed (1-3, 34-39). For  example, if the patient is to receive a sedative, it is generally necessary to monitor respiratory</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">437</emphasis></para>
      <para>• Sedated or anesthetized patients.  • Critically ill or high-risk patients.  • Patients that may have a reaction to an MRI contrast agent.  • Neonatal and pediatric patients.  • Patients that have compromised physiological functions.  • Patients that are physically or mentally unstable.  • Patients that are unable to communicate.  • Patients undergoing MRI-guided interventional or intraoperative procedures.  • Patients undergoing MRI examinations using experimental MR systems.  • Patients undergoing MRI examinations using experimental techniques.</para>
      <para>rate, apnea, and/or oxygen saturation (34-38). If the patient requires general anesthesia dur- ing MRI, monitoring multiple physiological parameters is required (1, 3, 34-39).</para>
      <para>Policies and procedures for the management of the patient in the MRI environment with  respect to monitoring should be comparable to those used in the operating room or critical  care setting, especially with respect to monitoring and support requirements. Specific rec- ommendations for physiological monitoring of patients during MRI examinations should  be developed in consideration of “standard of care” issues as well as in consultation with  anesthesiologists, critical care specialists, and other similar healthcare professionals (1, 3,  11, 28, 29, 34-40).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Personnel Involved in Patient Monitoring </emphasis></para>
      <para>Only healthcare professionals with appropriate training and experience should be per- mitted to be responsible for monitoring patients during MRI (1, 3, 28, 29, 34-40). This in- cludes several facets of training and experience. The healthcare professional must be well  acquainted with the operation of the monitoring equipment and accessories used in the MRI  setting and should be able to recognize equipment malfunctions, device problems, and  recording artifacts. Furthermore, the healthcare professionals responsible for monitoring  the patient should be well versed in screening patients for conditions that may complicate  the procedure. For example, patients with asthma, congestive heart failure, obesity, obstruc- tive sleep apnea, and other underlying health conditions are at increased risk for having  problems during sedation or anesthesia (29, 34-40). Also, the healthcare professionals must  be able to identify and manage adverse events (e.g., respiratory or cardiac arrest) using ap- propriate equipment and procedures that are applicable for the MRI environment (1, 3, 11,  28, 29, 34-40).</para>
      <para>If a sedated patient suddenly exhibits a rapid decline in oxygen saturation during MRI,  a  healthcare professional must be able to recognize this problem, assess the patient for po- tential causes, and rapidly determine if intervention is necessary. At the very minimum, the  individual should be capable of recognizing and responding quickly to contact an emergency  team in the event that an adverse event is experienced by the patient. Additionally, there  must be policies and procedures implemented to continue physiological monitoring and  support of the patient, as needed, by trained personnel after the MRI examination is per- formed. This is especially necessary for a patient recovering from the effects of a sedative  or general anesthesia.</para>
      <para>The monitoring of physiological parameters and management of the patient during MRI  may be the responsibility of one or more individuals depending on the level of training for  the healthcare worker and in consideration of the condition, medical history, and procedure  that is to be performed on the patient. These individuals include anesthesiologists, nurse  anesthetists, imaging nurses, and registered nurses (34-40).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Emergency Plan </emphasis></para>
      <para>The development, implementation, and regular practice of an emergency plan that ad- dresses and defines the activities, use of equipment, and other pertinent issues pertaining to  a medical emergency are important for patient safety in the MRI environment (1, 3, 29, 35-</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">438</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Physiological Monitoring of Patients During MRI </emphasis></para>
      <para>38). For example, a plan needs to be developed to immediately remove the patient from the  MR system room in order to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of cardiac  or respiratory arrest. Obviously, taking vital equipment such as a cardiac defibrillator, intu- bation instruments, “crash cart,” or other similar devices near the MR scanner could pose  a substantial hazard to patients and healthcare professionals since these items tend to be un- safe for use in the MRI setting. Appropriately-trained healthcare professionals that are in  charge of the emergency or code blue team, maintaining the patient’s airway, administering  drugs, recording events, and conducting other emergency-related duties must be identified,  trained, and continuously practiced in the performance of these critical activities in the MRI  environment. Accordingly, a “mock code” that includes all essential personnel should be  scheduled and practiced on a regular basis.</para>
      <para>Attempting to manage an emergency in the MR system room is widely considered an  unsafe practice and, thus, must be avoided in the interest of safety (1, 3, 28, 29, 34-40).  This is primarily because unacceptable equipment may be brought into the area by first re- sponders unaware of the dangers associated with the MRI environment. Therefore, for emer- gencies, it is important that there is a policy to immediately remove the patient from the  MR scanner room and to transfer the patient to a suitable, designated location where the  management of the patient may be safely conducted with appropriate equipment and devices  that are readily available (1, 3, 28, 29, 34-40).</para>
      <para>For outpatient MRI facilities or mobile MR systems, it is usually necessary to have an  advanced agreement with outside emergency personnel, such as the local paramedics, and  an acute care hospital willing to take care of their patients in the event of emergencies. Typ- ically, MRI facilities not affiliated with or in close proximity to a hospital must contact  paramedics to handle medical emergencies and to transport patients to the hospital for ad- ditional care. Therefore, personnel responsible for summoning the paramedics, notifying  the hospital, and performing other essential activities must be designated beforehand to  avoid problems and confusion during an actual emergency event.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">TECHNIQUES AND EQUIPMENT FOR PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORING </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">PATIENT AND SUPPORT </emphasis></para>
      <para>Physiological monitoring and support of patients is not a trivial task in the MRI envi- ronment. A variety of potential problems and hazards exist. Furthermore, the types of equip- ment used for patient monitoring and support must be considered carefully and implemented  properly to ensure the safety of both patients and MRI healthcare professionals.</para>
      <para>During the early days of MRI, MR Conditional monitoring equipment did not exist.  Therefore, it was a common practice to modify or otherwise adapt conventional physiolog- ical monitoring equipment in order for it to be utilized on patients undergoing MRI (2-21,  28). Over the years, monitoring equipment was specially designed to be acceptable for use  in the MRI setting (i.e., properly tested and labeled MR Conditional) and there are now  many commercially available devices that may be used to monitor patients during MRI  which include stand-alone individual monitors (e.g., used to record heart rate, blood pres- sure, oxygen saturation, temperature, etc.) as well as more sophisticated, multi-parameter</para>

      <para>Several potential problems and hazards are associated with the performance of patient  monitoring and support in the MRI setting. Conventional or even MR Conditional physio- logical monitors and other accessories that contain ferromagnetic components (e.g., trans- formers, power supplies, batteries, etc.) may be strongly attracted by the powerful static  magnetic field of the MR system, posing a serious missile or projectile hazard to patients  and MRI healthcare professionals. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> shows various examples of projectile-related  accidents, all of which could have been easily prevented if policies and procedures were in  place along with proper safety training of all staff members working in the MRI setting.  Notably, several serious injuries and at least one fatality have occurred as a result of bringing  MR Unsafe gas cylinders (e.g., oxygen tanks) into the MR system room (1, 3, 41-44). In  addition to being a tragedy for the involved individuals that could have been avoided, MR  scanners can sustain substantial damage as a result of being struck by large ferromagnetic  objects. Further expense is incurred if it is necessary to quench a superconducting magnet  associated with an MR system in order to remove a large ferromagnetic object (43).</para>
      <para>If possible, MR Conditional devices that have specific gauss-level ratings as part of the  specified conditions of use (e.g., a device that is labeled to state that it must not be used in  a gauss level above 200-gauss) such as monitoring equipment, gas anesthesia machines,  and ventilators because of the presence of ferromagnetic materials or operational compo- nents that may be damaged by exposure to higher magnetic fields should be permanently  fixed to the floor or otherwise “tethered” to prevent them from becoming projectiles. Fur- thermore, these devices must have prominent warning labels to inform MRI healthcare pro- fessionals and others that they should not move this equipment too close to the MR scanner.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>The care and management of high-risk, critically ill, and sedated or anesthetized patients  undergoing MRI examinations presents special challenges. These challenges are related to  requirements for MR Safe and MR Conditional equipment and devices as well as the need  for MRI facilities to implement MRI-specific policies and procedures that ensure patient  safety. Safely performing MRI examinations in patients that require physiological moni- toring is straightforward as long as there is clear and consistent communication among all  staff members, proper labeling of all devices and equipment, and an understanding of the  unique aspects of the MRI environment.</para>
