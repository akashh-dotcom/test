      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>In all aspects of life, children are provided with a different set of rules and regulations  than adults to help keep them safe, and this is no different in the medical field, particularly  in radiology. In fact, a major initiative in radiology is to reduce exposure to ionizing radia- tion in the pediatric population. In 2008, the <emphasis role="italics">Image Gently</emphasis> campaign was created by the  Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging to help the medical community change  their practice by increasing awareness of the opportunities to promote radiation protection  in the diagnostic imaging of children. While there is presently no similar group leading the  effort with regard to the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the pediatric popula- tion, it is this author’s hope that we will continue to share best practices within the MRI  community which will help ensure safety in pediatric patients relative to the utilization of  MRI technology.</para>
      <para>The objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of information pertaining to best  practices as well as to present policies and procedures related to MRI safety for pediatric  patients. Notably, in the MRI environment, children can present many challenges in imaging  and safety (1-4). Trying to establish safety policies and guidelines in the use of equipment  (e.g., radiofrequency coils, monitoring systems, anesthesia equipment, etc.) and the devel- opment of MRI techniques can be extremely challenging. To help guide us through these  issues, it is essential for the facility to establish an MRI Safety Committee and safety en- hancement program.</para>

      <title>THE MRI SAFETY COMMITTEE</title>
      <para>It can be challenging to impose the concept of MRI safety upon those not directly in- volved with it on a daily or otherwise routine basis. Without an MRI Safety Committee, the</para>

      <para>involvement from ancillary teams (e.g., nursing, anesthesia, transportation, etc.) can be dif- ficult to establish. As such, a collaborative approach allows for the development of rules  and regulations that impact the workflow of all individuals involved in the care of patients  who undergo MRI exams. By seeking the advice or input from the other healthcare profes- sionals, the implementation of new policies and procedures becomes a synergistic effort.  Developing an MRI Safety Committee composed of vital representatives from ancillary de- partments such as the anesthesia department, the intensive care unit (ICU), respiratory care,  and nursing staff members is beneficial because it provides a path by which the members  of the committee become the liaison between radiology/MRI and the individual disciplines  and departments.</para>

    <sect1 id="ch0029s04">
      <title>FUNCTION OF THE MRI SAFETY COMMITTEE</title>
      <para>Before developing an MRI Safety Committee, careful thought should be given as to  how the committee will function, as well as to the development of the roles and responsi- bilities of the various committee members (5-8). There are several avenues the group can  take when forming an MRI Safety Committee. The committee can be one of three basic  types: (1) Advisory, (2) Policy Making, or (3) a combination of the two.</para>
      <para>(1) The Advisory Committee investigates MRI safety issues within the department and hos- pital, offering guidelines, as needed. This committee does not make policies, but rather,  offers opinions to those individuals responsible for developing rules that impact the MRI  facility.</para>
      <para>(2) The Policy Making Committee is entrusted with the power to make or change policies  and procedures based on their safety findings or in response to a need to address an acci- dent or incident. Similar to the Advisory Committee, the Policy Making Committee may  have to investigate or research topics and issues, but this committee is also granted the  further discretion to formulate new policies and procedures.</para>
      <para>(3) The Combination Committee takes into account recommendations from both the Advi- sory Committee and the Policy Making Committee. This committee should be given spe- cific guidelines on its authority. In some instances, its authority may be advisory, while  other issues may require the latitude to develop and implement new policies and proce- dures</para>
      <para>The goal of the MRI Safety Committee should be to promote awareness and under- standing of MRI safety issues by collaborating and actively soliciting information that will  provide a safer and more secure MRI setting. Membership in the MRI Safety Committee  may include the following:</para>
      <para>(1) Radiology Leadership including the Radiologist-in-Chief or designate, Radiology Patient  Safety Officer/MRI Safety Committee Medical Director, Radiology Administrative Di- rector, Radiology Manager and the MR Safety Officer (MRSO)</para>
      <para>(2) Anesthesia, including personnel from Cardiac Anesthesia and General Anesthesia and/or  those providers overseeing sedation such as the Medical Director of Sedation Services (as  appropriate)</para>
      <para>(3) Environmental Health and Safety, Director of Environmental Health and Safety</para>
      <para>(4) MRI Technologists, MRI Team Leader, Quality and Safety, and Cardiac MRI Technolo- gists (if applicable)</para>

      <title>MRI SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM</title>
      <para>MRI safety should be continuously enhanced because every year, new biomedical  equipment and medical implants are deployed that can create possible unsafe situations in  the MRI setting and for patients. Additionally, every year new personnel join medical cen- ters, many of which may need to visit the MRI facility. These new employees require spe- cialized training and need to be kept informed regarding new developments that impact  MRI safety. An enhancement program may include the following:</para>
      <para>• An education and communication plan to address topics such as The Joint Commission  requirements for MRI or new information from the American College of Radiology.   • Environmental enhancement needs or other similar needs such as incorporating a ferro- magnetic detection system to supplement screening for patients and other individuals.  • Budgeting for new safety equipment, devices, and software.</para>
      <para>Essentially, an MRI enhancement program may adopt a similar philosophy as the In- stitute for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Education and Research (IMRSER.org) which is,  as follows (9):</para>
      <para>• To promote awareness and understanding of MRI safety  • To disseminate information regarding current and emerging MRI safety issues  • To develop and provide materials and resources to facilitate MRI safety-related education  training  • To respond to critical MRI safety issues with a sense of urgency</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="ch0029s06">
      <title>MRI EDUCATION</title>
      <para>Education of the team members increases their knowledge about critical aspects of the  MRI environment, the special challenges with MRI safety, and the how’s and why’s of new  policies and procedures. There should be the opportunity for initial learning, annual refresher  courses, Just In Time (JIT) education and other related educational endeavors. At a mini- mum, educational courses should include the following content:</para>
      <para>• Basic MRI principles  • MRI safety concerns  • Screening processes and the importance of completing the screening forms  • Images showing examples of accidents   • The history of why MRI safety matters   • Policies and procedures of the MRI facility</para>
      <para>This education can be provided or reinforced by any one or combination of the follow- ing means:</para>

      <para>(1) “Field trips” to nursing units that discuss basic MRI information and safety concerns, the  purpose and importance of family members filling out the MRI screening forms for pedi- atric patients, and images of accidents that highlight the importance of MRI safety.</para>
      <para>(2) Online courses and presentations that encompass a basic understanding of MRI-related  issues, as well as an advanced level of MRI safety education (e.g., see www.appliedradi- ology.org/mrisafety).</para>
      <para>(3) One-on-one education with an MRI technologist that includes all personnel who need ac- cess to the MRI environment in order to discuss the policies and procedures for MRI  safety.</para>
      <para>(4) Annual education that is provided to all MRI staff members and ancillary teams who fre- quent the MRI setting including: security officers and first responders, members of the  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and  anesthesia personnel who are involved in the management of patients in the MRI setting  on a regular basis.</para>
      <para>(5) Just in Time (JIT) education is typically used to teach and re-teach known medical tech- niques and is a great resource for staff members that may have a limited rotation to the  MRI facility (10). This particular type of education should be kept simple and relatively  brief, while touching on key items. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> presents an example of a flyer that can be  used as a tool for JIT. Note that it covers the key points directed towards the hospital’s  nursing staff that they must review before entry to the MRI area. JIT may also be used as  screen savers on computers at the nursing stations to remind staff members of key items  related to MRI safety.</para>
      <para>MRI safety is usually misunderstood by individuals that do not work in the MRI setting.  Using techniques such as formalized educational programs provide an opportunity to remind  all hospital personnel of the dangers inherent in the MRI area, making sure that ancillary  staff members obtain the necessary knowledge to keep pediatric patients safe. Importantly,  the pursuit of MRI safety should be an integral part of an overall institutional safety pro- gram.</para>

    <sect1 id="ch0029s07">
      <title>SIMULATION AND ITS ROLE IN MRI SAFETY</title>
      <para>Hospitals and medical centers now offer variations of simulation-based training  whereby medical and other personnel have the opportunity to develop skill sets on man- nequins and to use other tools in specific settings before actually performing the skills in- volving patients, such as venipuncture and responses to various types of emergencies.  Similarly, an MRI simulation center can be a useful tool to improve the culture of safety  relative to the MRI environment. Additionally, an MRI simulation center can help facilitate  the review of policies and procedures by simulating real life situations. The objectives of  these simulations should be to ensure that the policies and procedures are clear and that all  involved can effectively perform the critical tasks, as needed.</para>

      <title>POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND JOB AIDS</title>
      <para>A “policy” is a non-negotiable requirement of a regulatory agency or a self-imposed  governing rule to ensure safety, quality, compliance, or cost-effectiveness (14-17). In gen- eral, policies should be written clearly and concisely. Language in the policy statement  should mirror the language of the regulation itself. Policies should be fewer in number in  the “Focus and Simplify” format. A key point is that, if procedures and job aids are well- written, a policy may only need to be accessed infrequently because the associated docu- ments would help one to adhere to the policy (14-17).</para>
      <para>• Purpose - Defines a governing rule or a non-negotiable requirement  • Volume - Few in number  • Source - Regulatory agency or self-imposed to ensure safety, quality, compliance or cost  effectiveness  • Structure - Written clearly and concisely in a few sentences  • References - Included in the document  • Use - Accessed only when needed and for informational purposes</para>

      <para>A “procedure” outlines a step-by-step process to carry out a work process, much like a  recipe. It outlines the steps an employee needs to follow, in order, from start to finish. A  procedure may be related to a policy, or it may be a stand-alone procedure. Accordingly,  there should be many more procedures than policies (15-17).</para>
      <para>• Purpose - Provides step-by-step actions to carry out a work process or to achieve an out- come, usually based on a policy  • Volume - Many  • Source - May be related to a policy or may stand-alone   • Structure - Includes steps in a process (i.e., similar to a recipe). Two-column or three-col- umn format. Minimum level of detail for the experienced person and supplementary.  • References - Not usually included in the document  • Use - Can be a reference document or a continuous use document</para>
      <para>It is important to note that when writing policies and procedures, make sure that they  are evidence-based and not simply based on the way things have always been done.</para>
      <para>A “job aid” is any informational tool or supplement used to carry out a policy or pro- cedure. It is important to note that a single policy or procedure may have multiple job aids  associated with it. Information contained in job aids is guidance-oriented, rather than ac- tion-oriented. Examples of job aids include, but are not limited to, the following: checklists,  flowcharts, pictures or diagrams, and lists. In the proper format, there should be many more  job aids and procedures than policies (16,17).</para>

      <title>EXAMPLES OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</title>
      <para>Let’s now consider the special issues that the management of pediatric patients sbring  to the formulation of the policies and procedures for MRI safety.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Screening Policies </emphasis></para>
      <para>Most pediatric patients are usually unable to speak for themselves and, thus, rely on  parents and guardians to provide and convey information for them and to ensure their safety.  If you are a parent, you know that when you take your child to the hospital for an examina- tion or procedure, you are focused on the child getting diagnosed or treated and may not al- ways remember the answers to all the questions being asked. Parental anxiety plays a major  role in how screening questions for MRI are answered and, therefore, having multiple tools  and/or interviewing sessions provide parents with the opportunity to remember something  they may have forgotten.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italics">MRI Screening Process for In-Patients.</emphasis> Pediatric in-patients rely heavily on ancillary  personnel to support them during MRI exams. Monitoring the ancillary staff, allowing a  family member into the MR system room, performing the scan, answering telephones, and  other tasks can be overwhelming for the MRI technologist due to the variety and vast num- ber of support staff members that may be involved and the duties that are required. As such,  to help monitor the large number of staff members in the MRI environment, there is a great  dependence on screening policies and procedures.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">The MRI Screening Form</emphasis>. MRI facilities should have screening forms readily available  for every individual that needs to enter the MR system room (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 2</emphasis> to <emphasis role="bold">4</emphasis>). When screen- ing pediatric patients, a family member or responsible guardian should fill out the screening  form. In the event that there is not a parent or guardian available before the MRI exam, then  a knowledgeable nurse or physician can fill out the form. Notably, the MRI screening form  should include the parent or guardian’s cell phone number in the event that it is necessary  to ask questions so that these individuals can be reached directly and not delay their child’s  MRI exam. Once the screening form has been completed, the MRI technologist must review  the content for the following information:</para>
      <para>• Any implant or device that may be of concern   • Follow up on any question on the form answered “yes” or “unknown”  • A list of prior diagnostic imaging procedures</para>
      <para>The MRI technologist then signs the screening form, which verifies that the form was  reviewed and that the information was verified. In addition, if the pediatric patient has an</para>

      <para>implant or device, this information should be documented with respect to the name, model,  and any warnings that may exist. Ideally, information for an implant or device should be  entered in the departmental or Hospital Information System. The patient should then be ap- proved to be scheduled for the MRI examination.  Upon arrival to the MRI department, the  patient should be screened again by an MRI technologist - once in the department and then  again at the final “Time Out and Visual Check” procedure, described below. This is a four- step process that includes:</para>
      <para>(1) Proper identification of the patient and the MRI examination  a. Verify that the correct patient information is present, utilizing two patient identifiers  as suggested in The Joint Commission’s goals (i.e., name, date of birth, medical  record number, etc.).  b. Verify that the correct examination will be performed and that the correct body part  will undergo the MRI exam.  (2) Review of the MRI screening form  a. Review the screening form to ensure that all questions and concerns have been ad- dressed.  (3) Visual inspection of ancillary staff  a. Ensure that staff members remove jackets and other clothing articles that may con- ceal ferromagnetic or other potentially problematic objects (e.g., cell phones, beep- ers, etc.).  b. All pockets are to be squeezed, not simply patted down, to identify unwanted ob- jects.   (4) Visual check of equipment and patient   a. For the patient, lift blankets, sheets, and gowns to look for ferromagnetic items or  other unsafe objects.  b. Confirm that the wheelchair or stretcher is MR Safe or MR Conditional and labeled,  accordingly.  c. Confirm that oxygen tanks, IV poles, and all similar patient support devices are ac- ceptable for use in the MR system room.  <emphasis role="italics">MRI Screening Process for Out-Patients.</emphasis> The MRI screening process is different for  the out-patient population. At the time of scheduling, the parent (or patient, as appropriate)  should be questioned in regards to potential MRI safety issues.  If there is a concern, the  MRI safety group member (i.e., a designated MRI technologist whose responsibility it is to  investigate implants, devices, or safety issues before the patient arrives to the MRI facility)  should be contacted via phone or email. All details of the investigation should be docu- mented as part of the scheduled visit.</para>
      <para>A preliminary MRI screening procedure is ideally performed before the patient arrives  for the appointment, but if this does not occur during this time, then it can be conducted on  the day the patient arrives and before the next screening step is performed. In order to fa- cilitate this process, the MRI technologist may evaluate the following:</para>
      <para>• Review the most recent X-rays and report for implants or devices.  • Review medical documentation in the institution’s Information System for the presence  of implants or devices.</para>
      <para>On the day the appointment is scheduled, the patient should be prescreened and, upon  arrival, a more in-depth documented screening process should be conducted to ensure that</para>

      <title>PROTECTION FROM ACOUSTIC NOISE</title>
      <para>Acoustic noise can pose a threat to a child’s psychological and physical health. There- fore, the use of proper hearing protection in pediatric patients is an important part of ensuring  safety. Modern-day MR systems can generate acoustic noise from 78- to 130-decibels or  higher depending on the pulse sequence and other factors. While certain scanners may have  reduced the maximal acoustic noise levels to 90-decibels, it is still recommended that all  patients utilize hearing protection. In addition, healthcare workers who remain in the MR  system room during the MRI exam should likewise wear hearing protection.</para>
      <para>Hearing protection is utilized to minimize the risk of hearing impairment in association  with MRI. Special noise attenuation devices may be used (e.g., MiniMuffs (Natus Medical,  Seattle, WA) for neonates and young infants (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>). These devices may be used in con- junction with soft ear putty (silicone-based and/or beeswax). Additional protection such as  using positioning sponges (i.e., the ones provided with the MR system’s head RF coil) will  help prevent acoustic noise-related problems for pediatric patients. The combination of Min- iMuffs and ear putty is advantageous over other types of earplugs because they provide the  best type of noise reduction and help to avoid the difficulty of inserting earplugs into rela- tively small ear canals. This strategy also prevents the possibility of small children swal- lowing or choking on tiny earplugs.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI SAFETY ISSUES RELATED TO THERMOREGULATION IN PEDIATRIC </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">PATIENTS </emphasis></para>
      <para>Thermoregulation is the ability to maintain body temperature independent of the outside  environment. Infants rely on their mothers to regulate their temperatures <emphasis role="italics">in utero</emphasis>. Once  born, the infant has a somewhat limited ability to regulate body temperature in response to  exposure to cold environments primarily due to the inability to shiver. While an infant can  sweat, only the glands in the head, neck, hands and feet are active (i.e., approximately 25  to 30% of their total body size) (18-25). To keep warm, a baby may try to curl up into the  fetal position, move, or cry. However, a baby’s main source of heat production is the special  type body fat, known as brown adipose tissue (BAT).  BAT starts developing at 26 to 30  weeks of gestation and makes up about 2 to 7% of the baby’s total body weight at birth.  BAT is similar to the fat tissue found in hibernating animals.</para>
      <para>BAT plays an important role in providing body heat for the infant. Unfortunately, a dis- advantage of using BAT to stay warm is that the metabolism associated with utilizing this  type of fat to produce heat requires extra oxygen and glucose. This can result in the newborn  becoming physically stressed, as the infant attempts to maintain a proper body temperature.  If allowed to become too cold (the baby’s temperature should be never be lower than 36°C),  the infant may be reluctant to feed in an effort to conserve energy, thus, compounding the  problem (21-25).</para>
      <para>Importantly, procedures should be in place to ensure that a newborn’s temperature is  maintained at an acceptable level throughout the MRI examination. Once a patient from  the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is ready to travel to the MRI facility, a checklist  composed of three sections should be used for: (1) Pre-Study, (2) Arrival at the MRI facility,  and (3) Post-Scan Instructions.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Pre-Study </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>This checklist is followed in the NICU and before arrival to the MRI facility:</para>
      <para>• A decision is made regarding how to keep the patient still and comfortable during the  MRI exam. The choices are sedation or feeding combined with an immobilization tech- nique.  • A pre-study body temperature should be recorded to determine if it is safe to take the in- fant out of the NICU environment.  • If the infant’s temperature is less than 36.5°C axially, the MRI exam must be approved by  the attending physician.</para>
      <para>If the baby is approved to travel to the MRI facility, certain items must come with the  patient, including those items required for traveling (e.g., items needed to care for the patient  outside of the NICU) as well as the items specific to the MRI environment. The following  must be considered:</para>
      <para>• Confirmation that the MRI screening form has been appropriately completed and sent to  the MRI facility.   • The infant should be placed in clothing with no snaps (hospital issued clothing only).  • Confirmation that there is a need for extra intravenous tubing for patients on IV infusion  pumps.</para>

      <para>• If patient has a metal-based tracheostomy tube in place, it must be changed to a silicone  or other MR Conditional tube before going to the MRI facility.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Arrival at MRI </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>• Hand-off care from the NICU staff to the MRI nursing staff  • Body temperature recorded again. If less than 36.5°C axially, the NICU attending physi- cian should be informed to discuss sedation versus immobilization technique or cancela- tion of the MRI examination.  • MRI nursing staff should check for the following:  -  The hard copy of MRI screening form is available,  -  Clothing has no metallic parts (e.g., snaps, zipper, etc.),  -  Necessity for “cozy bunting” or other immobilization device,  -  Hearing protection is in place,  -  Change over or remove unsafe items such as electrodes, monitoring devices, etc.,  and  -  Placement of an acceptable (i.e., MR Conditional) temperature probe.  Note: If the temperature recorded using an MR Conditional temperature probe does not  correlate with the axially acquired temperature, document both readings and leave the tem- perature probe in place for trending purposes. Furthermore, if the body temperature appears  to begin a downward trend, add extra blankets and/or hot packs. If the temperature drops  by 1°C during the MRI examination, the procedure should be discontinued and rescheduled.  The infant must be returned to a warmed environment (Isolette and/or warming bed such  as a Transwarmer) as soon as possible.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">Post-Scan Instructions </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>• Documentation of post-scan body temperature  -  If less than 36.5°C axially, it is necessary to determine the need to transport the in- fant in a Transwarmer or Isolette.  -  If the infant is on oxygen delivered by a source in the MR system room, the infant  should be taken off of oxygen and then transferred to oxygen delivered via an oxy- gen tank.  -  The infant should travel with a checklist of the above information and this checklist  should be maintained at the MRI facility.   While it is important to maintain the infant’s temperature during MRI, it is equally im- portant to review the relevant MRI procedure when utilizing an MR Conditional incubator  for that purpose of ensuring that there will be no issues (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). Fortunately, several  types of MR Conditional incubators from various manufacturers are available for use in the  MRI setting. These incubators offer thermal regulation with air warming, which allows the  infant’s skin temperature to be monitored at all times during transport to and from the MRI  facility and throughout the MRI examination (26-28).</para>
