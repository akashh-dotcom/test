      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been utilized in the clinical setting for more  than 35 years. During this time, the technology has continued to evolve to improve image  quality, acquisition time, and patient comfort. These changes resulted in MR systems with  more powerful static magnetic fields, faster and stronger time-varying gradient magnetic  fields, and improved radiofrequency (RF) transmission coils. The short-term exposures to  the electromagnetic fields used for MRI at the levels recommended in the governing MRI  standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 60601-2-33 and by the  United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration have resulted in relatively few problems  for the hundreds of millions of MRI examinations performed to date (1-7). MRI-related in- juries and the few fatalities that have occurred in patients without and with implants have  been mostly due to not following recommended user guidelines related to the safety aspects  of the MR scanners and medical implants.</para>

      <para>Accordingly, the preservation of a safe MRI environment requires the utmost vigilance  with respect to the management of patients with implants and devices because the variety  and complexity of these items constantly changes (3, 6-9). This is particularly important  when managing patients with active implantable medical devices (AIMDs) because of the  elaborate nature of these implants (3, 6, 9). In consideration of the above, this chapter dis- cusses MRI safety issues for neuromodulation systems, which are widely used and clinically  important AIMDs.</para>

      <title>MRI SAFETY ISSUES FOR NEUROMODULATION SYSTEMS</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Static Magnetic Field-Related Issues  </emphasis></para>
      <para>Static magnetic field-related issues are known to present hazards to patients with certain  implants or devices primarily due to movement or dislodgment of objects made from fer- romagnetic materials (3-9, 12, 13). Thus, neuromodulation systems with ferromagnetic ma- terials, which are usually related to the power supply in the implantable pulse generator  (IPG), will be attracted to (i.e., force) and aligned (i.e., torque) with the strong static mag- netic field of the MR system (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>). This movement could result in patient injury (e.g.,  torn sutures, internal bleeding, etc.) or require surgical revision to reposition the device (i.e.,  to restore therapy or for patient comfort). Exposure to the scanner’s powerful static magnetic  field may also alter the neuromodulation system’s settings, requiring reprogramming, or  permanently damage the device, necessitating replacement surgery (8, 9).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">711</emphasis></para>
      <para>Numerous studies have assessed magnetic field interactions for implants and devices  by measuring translational attraction and torque associated with the static magnetic fields  of MR systems (3, 6). These investigations demonstrated that, for certain items, MRI exams  may be performed safely if the items are nonferromagnetic or “weakly” ferromagnetic (i.e.,  the object minimally interacts with the magnetic field in relation to its <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> application),  such that the associated magnetic field interactions are insufficient to move or dislodge the  items, <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>. Furthermore, the “intended use” of the implant must be taken into consider- ation, because this can greatly impact whether or not a particular item is acceptable for a  patient undergoing MRI from a magnetic field interaction consideration. Sufficient <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>- related forces (e.g., fibrous encapsulation of an IPG) can exist to retain even a ferromagnetic  device once it is implanted in the patient (3, 6).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Time-Varying Gradient Magnetic Field-Related Issues  </emphasis></para>
      <para>MRI may be unsafe for patients with certain implants or devices due to induced energy  and/or eddy currents related to the time-varying gradient magnetic fields. According to Fara- day’s Law of Induction, any circuit located within the rapidly changing magnetic fields is  subject to induced currents (9, 13, 14). With typical neuromodulation systems that utilize a  lead and electrode, the circuit can be formed between the implanted electrode and the IPG,  on a metallic structure (i.e., the IPG), or on individual components (e.g., coiled structures  like antennas or energy transfer coils) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>). A variety of interactions can occur if cur- rent flows. For AIMDs, like neuromodulation systems, there is the risk of unintentional  stimulation at the switching rate of the MR system’s gradient coils. Unintentional stimula- tion can be relatively benign as is the case with most neurostimulation scenarios, since neu- rostimulation pulse frequencies are much higher than the gradient switching frequencies  associated with clinical MRI exams.</para>
      <para>It should be noted that the gradient-induced voltages acting on the antennae and recharge  coils of AIMDs, such as neuromodulation systems, can be extremely high, due to the number  of coils within the associated components. If the circuitry is not robust enough to shield  against high voltages, the device may sustain damage to its communication or recharge sys-</para>

      <para>An additional concern from the time-varying gradient fields is the heating of the metallic  surfaces of AIMDs caused by eddy currents. Large metallic surfaces with poor conductivity  such as those associated with IPGs and implantable infusion pumps, may heat excessively  resulting in possible burns.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Radiofrequency Field-Related Issues </emphasis></para>
      <para>The use of AIMDs, physiological monitors, external accessories and similar objects  made from conductive materials has caused excessive heating, resulting in serious burn in- juries to patients undergoing MRI (3, 6, 7). The heating of implants and devices tends to be  problematic primarily for objects made from conductive materials that have an elongated  shape such as electrodes, leads, guidewire, and certain types of catheters (e.g., thermodilu- tion catheters with thermistors, intracranial pressure monitoring catheters, etc.)(3, 6, 7, 14,  15).</para>
      <para>Relatively long conductive structures can act as antennas during MRI, collecting RF  energy and dissipating it along the path of least resistance. For leads associated with neu- romodulation systems, this typically occurs at the electrodes of the leads, which are com- monly found at the distal end and in contact with the organ receiving stimulation (e.g., brain,  occipital nerve, vagus nerve, sacral nerve, etc.)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>). Since the electrodes used with  neuromodulation systems are relatively small, the dissipated energy is concentrated very  close to their surface. Excessive heating can be generated in neuromodulation systems under  certain MRI conditions and there have been reports of serious patient injuries (16-18). A  variety of factors contribute to the potential heating of a neuromodulation system. The im- portant variables that impact MRI-related heating of an implanted medical device are pre- sented in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> (3-7, 9, 14-28). Importantly, each of these variables must be taken into  consideration to create safe MRI operating conditions for patients with neuromodulation</para>

      <para>systems. It is particularly important to appreciate the complex interactions between the vari- ables related to RF heating. For example, each RF frequency used for MRI (i.e., 64-MHz  associated with 1.5-Tesla, 128-MHz associated with 3-Tesla, etc.) needs to be evaluated  and considered individually for a given neuromodulation system because the resulting tem- perature rises may actually be lower at higher frequencies compared with lower frequencies  (3, 6, 9, 14, 15-28)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>Over the years, different RF field-induced heating mitigation strategies have been em- ployed and presented in the MR Conditional labeling for neuromodulation products.  For  example, for certain neuromodulation systems that did not incorporate design changes in  consideration of the electromagnetic fields used for MRI, the strategy was to exclude the  RF exposure entirely by utilizing a transmit RF head or extremity coil if the neuromodula- tion system was implanted outside of that particular transmit coil. In those instances, the  transmitted RF energy did not subject any part of the implant to heating, resulting in a safe  MRI exam (3, 6, 8, 9). Other neuromodulation systems used a reduced whole-body averaged  SAR or B1+RMS limit to minimize exposure to RF energy, while still other neuromodulation  products have been specially designed to safely manage the RF energy so that the MR sys- tem can be operated under normal RF power levels (i.e., the Normal Operating Mode or  First Level Controlled Operating Mode)(3, 6, 8, 9).</para>
      <para>With respect to the whole-body averaged SAR value reported by the MR system, it  should be realized that this metric is especially problematic with regard to MRI-related im- plant heating, as reported by Baker, et al. (29, 30) and Nitz, et al. (31). The scanner reported  SAR values can be considered to be “not to exceed” values, such that each MR system man- ufacturer may have a different safety margin (i.e., comparing one manufacturer to another)  to ensure that the displayed SAR values are not exceeded. Because there is no direct way  to measure SAR prior to or during an MRI exam, scanner manufacturers rely on numerical</para>

      <para>models to conservatively estimate the SAR for a particular scan sequence and each manu- facturer uses certain assumptions for their SAR models. Importantly, the estimates of SAR  did not consider situations when metallic implants were present in patients. Therefore, it is  important to understand that implant heating may differ significantly when using different  MR systems of the same static magnetic field strength and frequency for a given pulse se- quence.</para>
      <para>Significant variations in heating for a deep brain stimulation lead in association with  different 1.5-Tesla scanners (notably from the same manufacturer) was first reported by  Baker, et al. (29) and further examined in a later investigation (30). The specific concern is  when MRI safety labeling for an implant is based on data generated using a particular MR  system that has a high SAR safety margin, which ultimately equates to a lower transmitted  RF power. In the clinical setting, the device’s safety conditions may be followed using a  different scanner that has a lower SAR safety margin, resulting in a higher transmitted RF  power level. The end result could be a substantially higher temperature rise for the implant,  potentially resulting in a patient injury.</para>

The MR system reported, whole- body averaged SAR used at 1.5-Tesla was 1.4-W/kg and at 3-Tesla it was 3-W/kg. Note  the substantial differences in the temperature profiles during MRI-related heating of the  lead (i.e., 1.5-T/64-MHz showing substantially higher temperatures), which illustrates  that different resonant effects impact temperature rises for elongated implants. For an im- plant of a given length, different RF wavelengths will yield different heating effects (i.e.,  64-MHz versus 128-MHz).</para>

      <para>In consideration of the myriad of issues of using SAR to ensure safety for patients with  implants, the Food and Drug Administration along with other entities recommended that a  different metric for RF energy should be utilized to characterize MRI-related heating specif- ically for AIMDs. This metric, the B1+RMS, is the root-mean-square value of the MRI-ef- fective component of the RF magnetic field (B1 field). That is, it is the time-averaged RF  magnetic field component relevant for creating an MR image.</para>
      <para>The MR scanner measures the B<superscript>+</superscript>1 field (i.e., the positively rotating RF magnetic field)  needed for an imaging sequence and uses the time-averaged B<superscript>+</superscript>1 field, or B1+RMS, that is  associated with a particular imaging sequence. Thus, the B1+RMS value is calibrated by the  MR system’s software during the “prep” or “pre-scan” phase of an MRI exam. An important  characteristic of B1+RMS is that it is not an estimated value but it is a known quantity based  on the pulse sequence and the associated parameters. Notably, B1+RMS is not patient-depen- dent nor is it calculated differently based on a given MR system manufacturer.</para>
      <para>Understanding the importance of B1+RMS as a metric for RF energy that is presented in  MR Conditional labeling of AIMDs necessitates an appreciation of basic MRI physics.  When a patient enters the MR scanner, protons in the body align in the direction of the static  magnetic field (B0), similar to a compass aligning with the Earth’s magnetic field. An MR  imaging sequence is composed of a series of RF pulses that produce a magnetic field that  interacts with these magnetically-aligned protons and rotates them through a specific angle  commonly referred to as the “flip angle”. The RF magnetic field (B1 field) of which only  one part, known as the positively rotating or “+” component, is useful for “flipping” the  magnetically-aligned protons, allowing MR images to be created. The maximum 10-second,  time-averaged B<superscript>+</superscript>1 field strength of the RF pulses in the imaging sequence is the root-mean- square or “RMS” B<superscript>+</superscript>1 value of the imaging sequence.</para>
      <para>In 2013, the (International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) mandated that all MR  systems manufactured going forward must display the B1+RMS. Therefore, it is unlikely to  see B1+RMS information presented on older scanners or those with software that has not  been updated. B1+RMS is measured and reported by the MR system in units of micro-Tesla  (μT).</para>
      <para>Considering that B1+RMS is a more precise RF exposure metric than SAR, AIMD man- ufacturers typically present values for B1+RMS that must not be exceeded when scanning  patients in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis> (IFU) for their implants. When following B1+RMS as a  condition of use, the SAR value is irrelevant, unless, of course, a particular operating mode  of the MR system is specified. Using B1+RMS tends to provide better performance for the  MRI exam because it has fewer limitations versus using SAR values for patients with  AIMDs.</para>
      <para>Because B1+RMS is being used by manufacturers in their MR Conditional labeling for  AIMDs, it is vital to understand how to adjust protocols to achieve an acceptable B1+RMS  value to ensure patient safety. The parameters that an MR system operator uses to modify  B1+RMS will vary with the particular MR system. By way of example, parameters and op- tions that can be adjusted to reduce B1+RMS include, the following: (1) increase the RF pulse  duration, (2) utilize a “Low SAR” mode of other similar option, (3) increase the repetition  time (TR), (4) reduce the number of slices for a given TR, (5) reduce the echo train length</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">717</emphasis></para>
      <para>(ETL) in a fast spin echo (FSE) pulse sequence, (6) reduce the refocusing angle (i.e., for  FSE sequences), (7) reduce the flip angle (i.e., for gradient echo, GRE, pulse sequences)  and (8) use a GRE sequence instead of a spin echo or fast spin echo pulse sequence (3, 6).</para>
      <para>In addition to being a more precise metric for controlling RF power deposition, another  advantage to using B1+RMS as opposed to SAR is that, once the adjustment is made to a de- sired B1+RMS value for a given sequence, that information can be saved in scanner’s protocol  library for future use. The B1+RMS will then remain at that value for the next patient unless  the imaging parameters are changed.</para>
      <para>As previously stated, patients with neuromodulation systems are exposed to the risks  associated with the RF energy collected in undesirable antennas in the leads, resulting in  excessive heating. Because RF energy can also travel in the opposite direction towards the  IPG, device components or memory can be damaged and, thus, may require replacement  surgery in the event that the electronics are compromised (3, 6, 8, 9, 14). The RF energy  entering into the IPG can impact the internal electronics causing rectification (i.e., rectifi- cation is the process of turning an alternating current waveform into a direct current wave- form, thus, creating a new signal that has only a single polarity) and the resultant signal can  be delivered to the patient through the lead contacts creating unintended stimulation.</para>

      <para>As previously indicated, neuromodulation systems have been employed for a variety  of neurological disorders as well as for many other conditions (8, 9, 11, 12). A typical neu- romodulation system used for stimulation consists of an IPG (i.e., similar to a cardiac pace- maker) and one or more leads that conduct the electrical pulses to the therapeutic target via  one or more electrodes (3, 6, 8, 9)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>). The IPG contains electronics and a single-use  or rechargeable battery. The size of the IPG and the therapeutic target dictate the potential  implant locations and lead routings through the patient’s body.</para>

      <para>There is a newer type of neuromodulation system that is predominantly used for spinal  cord stimulation (SCS) or peripheral nerve stimulation (32-34). This device utilizes an im- planted lead and has an external battery and stimulator. The external component communi- cates with the implanted lead using wireless technology (3, 6, 8, 9)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). This platform  was developed for neuromodulation for various reasons. Traditional neuromodulation sys- tems require surgical implantation of multiple components: the IPG, lead extensions, and  lead with stimulating electrodes. The IPG used with a conventional neuromodulation system  is somewhat bulky and, thus, may cause tissue damage or other problems (32-34). Because  of possible complications and hardware-related issues, the standard neuromodulation system  platform is suggested to pose a higher risk for certain adverse events (32-34).</para>
      <para>By comparison, wirelessly-powered leads used for SCS or peripheral nerve stimulation  represent a practical option for patients with respect to their clinical utilization. Importantly,  a clear advantage of using a wirelessly-powered lead system is the elimination of compo- nents that are required by traditional systems, namely the pulse generators, lead extensions,  and longer leads (32-34). Thus, the proposed benefits of a wirelessly-powered lead system  include decreased implantation procedural time, lower risk of infection (i.e., because fewer  components are implanted), reduced overall costs compared with conventional neuromod-</para>

      <para>Current neuromodulation therapies approved by the FDA and other notified bodies in- clude deep brain stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, dystonia, and  obsessive-compulsive disorder and other conditions; SCS for chronic pain; peripheral nerve  stimulation for chronic pain sacral nerve stimulation for urinary and fecal incontinence;  gastric stimulation for gastroparesis; vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and responsive neu- rostimulation (RNS) for epilepsy; VNS for depression; auditory nerve stimulation for hear- ing impaired patients; administration of Baclofen or other medications for chronic pain via  implantable infusion pumps; as well as many others (8, 9, 11, 12, 33, 34).</para>
      <para>During the early days of MRI technology, because of the inherent risks associated with  neuromodulation systems relative to the MRI environment, the presence of these AIMDs  and others was considered a strict contraindication for patients. However, over the years,  various studies were performed that supported the safety of scanning patients with neuro- modulation systems under highly specific MRI conditions (9, 11, 12, 20, 22, 24, 29, 30, 33- 61). Because of concerted efforts of device manufacturers and biomedical investigators, a  large number of neuromodulation systems now have MR Conditional labeling, allowing  patients to benefit from the diagnostic capabilities of MRI (8, 9, 11, 12, 62, 63).  As such,  if specific guidelines are followed, MRI examinations may be conducted safely in patients  with certain neuromodulation systems.</para>
      <para>Various representative examples of neuromodulation systems that have criteria defined  to permit safe MRI examinations are presented in the following sections of this chapter,  with the acknowledgment that many other devices exist with approved MR Conditional la- beling. It should be noted that certain neuromodulation systems are labeled MR Unsafe in  the United States but MR Conditional outside the United States. Therefore, it is always im- portant to obtain country-specific labeling information for a given neuromodulation system.  In addition, because the labeling for implants may change based on new information, health- care professionals are advised to contact the manufacturer of the neuromodulation system  to obtain the latest information to ensure patient safety relative to the use of MRI.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Deep Brain Stimulation Systems </emphasis></para>
      <para>Deep brain stimulation is one of the most rapidly growing areas in neuromodulation.  Since 1997, there have been well over 160,000 patients implanted with DBS systems world- wide. As previously mentioned, DBS is currently approved for the treatment of essential  tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition, clin- ical trials are underway assessing the role of DBS to treat epilepsy, chronic pain, cluster  headaches, major depression, post-traumatic stress syndrome, morbid obesity, and other  conditions (11, 35-40).</para>
      <para>A typical DBS device includes an IPG, which is usually implanted in a subclavicular  position but may also be placed in an abdominal site. The IPG is connected to one or two  lead extensions, and one or two leads that run through the torso, chest, and neck region to  the brain (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>). This neuromodulation device delivers high frequency electrical stim-</para>

      <para>The necessity of using MRI is essential to the use of DBS therapy in patients. MRI is  important for the diagnosis of hemorrhage, stroke, and intracranial lesions, as well as for  assessing the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, MRI-guided pro- cedures are used to optimally position the DBS electrodes, resulting in a substantial decrease  in the time required for implantation (58, 59). MRI is used post-operatively to determine  the location of the DBS leads and electrodes, which is critical information for the evaluation  of patients with sub-optimal results or side effects, as well as for targeting during revision,  or other cranial surgeries. Furthermore, functional MRI (fMRI) has been demonstrated to  be beneficial for understanding the mechanisms of DBS (47, 60).</para>
      <para>The inherent desire to use MRI in DBS patients prompted several groups to systemat- ically study MRI-related issues for these AIMDs (8, 9, 29, 30, 41-57, 61). Approximately  20 years ago, the earliest research contributed to the first AIMD to receive MR Conditional  labeling, the DBS system from Medtronic. Despite the limitations for MRI that included  scanning at 1.5 Tesla, only, using a transmit/receive RF head coil, and a maximum head  SAR of 0.1 W/kg, patients were allowed to undergo MRI for the first time. Importantly,  these studies along with those conducted by device manufacturers resulted in MR Condi- tional labeling for several DBS systems, including those that are “full-body eligible”, en- abling a wide range of MRI exams to be performed in patients (8, 9). Because manufacturers  of DBS systems have strict safety criteria for MRI examinations, healthcare professionals  must only scan patients according to the specific information indicated in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions </emphasis></para>

      <para>In this case report, Henderson, et al. (17) described a patient with Parkinson’s disease  that sustained a serious permanent neurological injury secondary to an RF lesion caused by  excessive heating of the electrode of a DBS system associated with MRI of the lumbar  spine. Because the patient was an avid hunter, the IPG for the DBS system was placed in  his abdomen rather than in the typical subclavicular region to avoid interference with the  butt of his rifle. Seven months after placement of the IPG, the patient underwent an MRI of  the lumbar spine for the evaluation of back and left leg pain. Multiple scan sequences were  performed at 1.0-Tesla/42-MHz with a transmit body RF coil and a receive-only spine coil.  Following the MRI examination, the patient experienced hemiparesis.</para>
      <para>The patient was subsequently evaluated by his neurologist, who noted that he exhibited  “obtunded aphasia with right hemiplegia, bilateral extensor plantar responses, and skew de- viation, right eye below left.” A computed tomography scan performed immediately fol- lowing the MRI revealed hemorrhage surrounding the left DBS electrode. An MRI of the  brain conducted using a 1.5-Tesla MR system two days after the lumbar scan found “suba- cute hemorrhage with methemoglobin in the left thalamus, posterior limb of the left internal  capsule, and left cerebral peduncle.” The hemorrhage was adjacent to the DBS electrode,  with surrounding edema seen on T2-weighted pulse sequences (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>).</para>

      <para>The patient was evaluated seven months following the MRI exam and determined to  have severe dysarthria that made his speech nearly impossible to understand. He had per- sistent right hemiparesis with falling toward the right and clumsiness of his right hand. No- tably, this patient’s neurological deficits were identified immediately after his lumbar MRI  exam, implicating a direct relationship between the imaging procedure and associated brain  lesion. In addition, the hemorrhage and edema demonstrated on subsequent brain imaging  surrounded the DBS electrode circumferentially, as would be expected of a lesion generated  by RF heating (17). Of further note is that this patient suffered from a lesion on the left side  of the brain, corresponding with the left-sided lead and the IPG implanted in his abdomen.  No lesion was produced on the right side, where the IPG was implanted in the standard sub- clavicular position. This serious accident clearly emphasizes that, while MRI may be per- formed safely in patients with DBS systems with close adherence to specific safety  guidelines (i.e., in this case, the labeling required imaging at 1.5-Tesla using a transmit/re- ceive RF head coil and not exceeding a head SAR of 0.1-W/kg), any deviation from the  stated MRI requirements can result in serious consequences for the patient.</para>

      <para>Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is commonly used to treat chronic pain of neurologic  origin, as well as other conditions that are undergoing clinical investigations (8, 9, 12). Sev- eral types of IPGs and many different types of leads with different electrode arrays are used  to administer SCS. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis> shows an example of a SCS device. Equipment-related factors  associated with standard SCS devices substantially complicate MRI-related issues for these  devices (8, 9, 65-72). Importantly, the lead used for SCS varies in length depending on the  spinal location targeted for stimulation, presenting particular challenges for the evaluation  of MRI-related heating (i.e., because the length of an implant is a major determinant of  heating)(3, 9, 13-15, 74). There are several different manufacturers of SCS products, many  of which have MR Conditional labeling.</para>

      <para>Initially, SCS systems approved for patients undergoing MRI were limited to the use  of 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz scanners to image the head using a transmit/receive RF head coil,  only. In 2013, the first “full-body” MR Conditional SCS systems from Medtronic were ap- proved for scanning at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz. These AIMDs utilized “MRI SureScan” technol- ogy, which involved substantial modifications of the IPGs, leads, and electrodes and still  have conditions that must be complied with in order to perform risk-free MRI exams (8,  9). Other device manufacturers such as Boston Scientific, Abbott, Nevro, and others now  have MR Conditional SCS systems that are full-body eligible. Patients with these particular  SCS systems are now afforded the benefit of the diagnostic capabilities of MRI since other  body parts can be examined in addition to the head. <emphasis role="bold">Tables 6</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">7</emphasis> present MRI-related in- formation for two SCS devices from Abbott and Boston Scientific, respectively.</para>

      <para>As previously mentioned, standard SCS systems have an IPG that contains the stimu- lator along with a power source that connects with leads to deliver electrical pulses via elec- trodes into the spinal column (8, 9, 12). The other platform used for SCS has an implanted  lead (which may incorporate pulse generating electronic components) and an external bat- tery and stimulator that wirelessly communicates with the lead (33, 34). Using this type of  SCS system, the patient must wear the external components when therapy is needed for  pain management. Because of the inherent shorter lead lengths and fewer metallic compo- nents, it is less challenging to meet the MRI safety requirements for these SCS systems  compared to traditional SCS systems (33, 34). In all instances, the external components are  MR Unsafe and must be removed from the patient prior to entering the MR system room.  Various manufacturers make SCS devices with implanted leads and external components.  <emphasis role="bold">Table 8</emphasis> describes the MRI-related information for one such system, the Freedom-8A  (FR8A) Stimulator Receiver for Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) from Stimwave Technolo- gies.</para>

      <para>The use of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) to treat chronic pain conditions has be- come an increasingly important field in the area of neuromodulation (8, 9, 12). Pain in the  extremities may occur due to a variety of central and peripheral neuropathic and nociceptive  syndromes. Accordingly, peripheral nerve stimulation may be particularly effective when  the pain is localized to a part of a single extremity or when the source of the pain is related  to the malfunction of a known peripheral nerve. The ongoing advances in electrical neuro- modulation technology since 1999 led to the miniaturization of the implantable electronics</para>

      <para>A cochlear implant (CI) is neuromodulation system designed to help severely-to-pro- foundly deaf adults and children who get little or no benefit from external hearing aids (89- 106). Notably, even individuals with severe or profound “nerve deafness” may benefit from  these AIMDs. A cochlear implant has two main parts: an external part that hooks over the  ear or that is worn on the head, and a surgically implanted internal part (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15</emphasis>). The  two components are coupled together using powerful magnets, one or more of which are  implanted. With respect to the external part of the CI, this component contains a transmitter,  microphone, and speech or sound processor. The microphone detects acoustic sounds and  sends it to the speech processor. The processor then analyzes and digitizes the signal before  sending it to the transmitter. The transmitter “codes” the signals and sends them to the im- planted receiver via the magnetic coupling. With respect to the internal part, this component  includes one or more magnets, a receiver, which is located under the skin on the temporal  bone, and one or more electrode arrays (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 16</emphasis>). The receiver collects signals from the  transmitter and converts them to electrical pulses, which are then dispatched to the elec- trodes that have been inserted into the inner ear. The electrodes directly stimulate the audi- tory nerve throughout a portion of the cochlea, resulting in the brain interpreting the signals  as sound.</para>

      <para>The technology used for cochlear implants has made tremendous advancements since  the earliest version used in the 1960s, which was relatively large and had a single electrode  (106). Presently, sophisticated CI devices exist and are available from three major manu- facturers: Cochlear Limited, Advanced Bionics, and MED-EL. Similar to other AIMDs, CI  systems were not originally designed in consideration of the electromagnetic fields used  during MRI. Not surprisingly, the implanted magnets, which are integral parts of these de- vices, along with the presence of other ferromagnetic materials used in the internal compo- nents of cochlear implants, present particular challenges for MRI safety (89, 93, 98, 99,  101-105).</para>
      <para>MRI-related labeling for the first CI devices required removal of the magnets prior to  performing MRI exams, meaning that the patient had to undergo two separate surgical pro- cedures: one to remove the magnet and another to replace it after undergoing MRI (<emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">17</emphasis>). One of the major issues related to removal and replacement of the magnet is that the  patient with a CI needed to endure a period without sound to allow the surgical wound to  heal. Obviously, this was undesirable for most patients, resulting in many individuals re- fusing to have MRI exams, undergoing less favorable diagnostic imaging procedures, which  usually involved exposure to ionizing radiation.</para>

      <para>In order to avoid magnet removal and replacement surgery, an alternative approach was  utilized, whereby a “compression bandage and splint kit” was used to immobilize the  cochlear implant’s magnet and control its orientation with respect to the direction of the  static magnetic field (98, 101-104). This MRI safety strategy was suboptimal because pa- tients could experience unintended acoustic stimulation because of the implant’s interactions  with the electromagnetic fields that are applied during scanning (89). Notably, clinical im- aging of the patient’s head was still impacted by substantial signal loss and distortion caused  by the implant (this occurred even with the magnet removed due to the ferromagnetic ma- terials used in cochlear implants)(89, 94, 97-99). Furthermore, there was still a tendency</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Implantable Infusion Pumps </emphasis></para>
      <para>Implantable infusion pumps systems are used for intrathecal or intravascular adminis- tration of various medications, especially those used for pain management (8, 9, 107-114)  (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22</emphasis>). Targeted drug delivery with these AIMDs provides several advantages includ- ing the fact that significantly decreased dosages may be used in patients (which appears to  reduce drug-related adverse events) and, importantly, these devices permit patient mobility  (8, 107, 108).</para>
      <para>An infusion pump operates by having the drug enter the pump through the reservoir  fill port, where it passes through the reservoir valve and the pump’s reservoir. At normal  body temperatures, pressurized gas that is stored below the reservoir expands, exerting pres- sure on the reservoir. The pressure helps advance the drug into the pump’s tubing. The peri- staltic action of the pump moves the drug from the pump’s reservoir, through the pump’s  tubing, check valve, catheter access port, through the implanted catheter, to the infusion  site. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 23</emphasis> shows a schematic of the critical components of an implantable infusion  pump.</para>

      <para>Infusion pumps and associated catheters typically contain metallic parts and, thus, can  be impacted by MRI-related electromagnetic fields (3, 9, 100-114). For example, the elec- tromagnetic fields (static magnetic, time-varying gradient magnetic, and radio frequency  fields) may displace the infusion pump, generate excessive heating, alter the programmed  settings, damage the device, and create substantial artifacts. Several programmable pumps  have undergone comprehensive MRI testing and certain ones have FDA approved, MR  Conditional labeling. <emphasis role="bold">Tables 15</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">16</emphasis> present the MRI-related information for two of the  more popular implantable infusion pumps: the Prometra II Programmable Pump (Flowonix  Medical) and the SynchroMed II Implantable Drug Infusion Pump (Medtronic, Inc.).</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>With the continued advancements in MRI technology and the development of more so- phisticated AIMDs, there is an increased potential for hazardous situations to occur in the  MRI environment. Therefore, to prevent incidents and accidents, it is essential to be cog- nizant of the latest information pertaining to MRI safety and to adhere to current labeling  for AIMDs, particularly for neuromodulation systems. Unfortunately, there is still reluctance  by MRI facilities to scan patients with neuromodulation systems. Thus, further interaction  is needed by the device manufacturers to provide educational resources and technical sup- port, so that MRI healthcare professionals feel competent when performing MRI in patients  with AIMDs.</para>
