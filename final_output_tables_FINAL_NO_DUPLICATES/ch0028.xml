      <para>A well-designed safety program to protect medical personnel and patients is mandatory  for all centers performing clinical medical imaging. However, due to unique inherent risks,  specific requirements must be stipulated for the outpatient magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) facility (1, 2). <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> lists safety concerns relevant to all medical imaging proce- dures. All outpatient imaging departments must have a written safety program, properly  implemented and maintained by management, technologists, and radiologists.</para>

      <title>PERSONNEL: RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES</title>
      <para>Staffing of the outpatient MRI facility should be carefully considered and maintained.  Appropriate experience and training of the management team (e.g., the MR medical director,  imaging center manager, MR modality specialist, MR team leader, and MR safety officer)  is crucial to operating an efficient and safe imaging department. The key personnel in out- patient imaging safety include the management team, members of the MRI Safety Com- mittee, the MR medical director (MRMD), MR Safety Officer, and other involved  employees, because employees are one of the key elements that help ensure a safe outpatient  MRI center.</para>
      <para>The management team should establish an MRI Safety Committee. The Safety Com- mittee should then designate an MR Safety Officer if one has not already been established.</para>

      <title>MRI SAFETY PROGRAM</title>
      <para>Outpatient MRI facilities should be accredited by either the American College of Ra- diology (ACR), the Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Magnetic Resonance  Imaging Laboratories, RadSite or The Joint Commission. Services should be performed   under the direct supervision of a physician certified by the American Board of Radiology  or other equivalent national medical imaging certifying body and licensed to practice med- icine in the state where the center is located. Some state and local governments require ad- ditional certification. The MRI technologists should be active participants in the continuing  compliance and quality assurance standards of the facility’s accreditation certification. These  individuals are key members of the safety team discussed above.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Patient Safety </emphasis></para>
      <para>A key component of the MRI safety program is to protect patients. This requires a com- prehensive system that includes appropriate policies and procedures and begins with the  patient’s first interaction with the MRI facility. Scheduling of MRI studies requires an order  from a licensed medical professional. The order must be provided to the facility as one of  the following:</para>
      <para>A written document signed by the treating physician/practitioner that is hand-de- • livered, mailed, or faxed to the facility;</para>
      <para>A telephone call by the treating practitioner, with written documentation of the  • order by both the practitioner’s office and the center; or</para>

      <para>If the patient is determined to be pregnant and the referring physician is not aware at  the time of the imaging request, then the referring physician must be notified and approval  obtained before allowing the patient into the magnetic resonance (MR) system room. The  radiologist must also approve MRI examinations on pregnant patients. The risk versus ben- efits of MRI must be considered and explained to the patient by a trained healthcare pro- fessional before proceeding with the study and documented in the patient’s medical record.</para>
      <para>The MRI technologist should carefully review the examination order and confer with  the radiologist if the order is incomplete, unclear or needs amending. The MRI technologist  cannot change the requested order without approval by the radiologist or authorization from  the requesting physician. Any change in the original order requires documentation of an  amended order including:</para>

      <para>Specific information describing the changes made.  •</para>
      <para>Importantly, Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities (IDTFs) are required to obtain  all referring physician orders and modifications in writing.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Implants </emphasis></para>
      <para>Screening patients for the presence of implants and devices that may pose hazards in  the MRI environment must begin with the scheduling process. Notably, the Safety Com- mittee should provide scheduling personnel with guidelines so that implants and devices  inappropriate for MRI are detected and exams not scheduled. Patients should be asked at  the time of scheduling to bring their implant device card or information in writing from  their physician. The physician or surgical center can be contacted when the patient cannot  provide the necessary information. The presence, nature and MRI information for implants  and devices (i.e., the labeling for MRI which is usually found in the Instructions for Use,  IFU, for the item) should be re-verified by the MRI technologist when reviewing the pa- tient’s history just prior to the patient entering the MR system room.</para>
      <para>All employees should be familiar with current MRI labeling terminology, as follows:  MR Safe, MR Conditional, or MR Unsafe (3, 4). The MRI-specific restriction information  for each MR Conditional-designated implant should be carefully evaluated before the patient  is allowed into the scanner to ensure compliance (e.g., strength of the static magnetic field,  level of the spatial gradient magnetic field, type of transmit radiofrequency coil, specific  absorption rate limitation, etc.) (3-7). Scheduling personnel must have access to an MRI  technologist and/or a radiologist in case questions concerning safety of specific devices  cannot be resolved. A detailed list of this information can be found on the website,  www.MRIsafety.com, in an annually updated textbook (4), or from the implant manufac- turer. In addition to the above, policies and procedures must be in place to ensure that pa-</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">770</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Policies and Procedures for an Outpatient Facility</emphasis></para>
      <para>tients are properly identified and the correct patient information is entered into the MR sys- tem and medical record.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Access Zones </emphasis></para>
      <para>Because of the potential risk inherent in the MRI environment, the American College  of Radiology (ACR) recommends segmenting the area into four different zones (5, 7). In  new construction, these zones should be physically separated by barriers or other appropriate  means. In certain outpatient MRI centers, physical separation may not be practicable and,  in general, has been found to be unnecessary.</para>
      <para>Areas that are restricted, that is, the immediate areas outside the MR system room (Zone  III) and the scanner room (Zone IV) where the static magnetic field exceeds 5-Gauss should  be clearly marked and designated as being potentially hazardous. Danger signs should be  prominently displayed at the entry of hallways and rooms that are adjacent to the MR system  room and should also be prominently displayed on the door of the scanner room (5, 7).</para>
      <para>Where locking mechanisms are available, the MR system room should be physically  restricted from general access by key locks whenever MRI personnel are not in the imme- diate vicinity and cannot control access (e.g., lunch break and evening closing). Only MRI  personnel should be provided with the access keys to the scanner room. The ACR recom- mends that physical barriers be maintained across doorways when the MR system room  must remain open for cleaning or maintenance (5-7).</para>
      <para>Patients are screened for risk factors before being escorted into the Restricted Zones  III (hallways or rooms adjacent to the scanner room) and IV (the MR system room). This  topic is covered in great detail elsewhere in this textbook. Patients (or their family, guardian,  or designate) must complete a written screening form. Special diligence is required for in- communicative and critical patients. The facility can create its own screening form approved  by the Safety Committee or a form can be obtained from other sources, such as the ACR  (5, 7) or downloaded from www.MRIsafety.com. A completed and signed screening form  should be obtained each time a patient presents for an MRI examination. Screening of un- conscious or incommunicative patients who are unable to provide a history for surgery,  trauma, metal exposure, or prior MRI contrast reactions should be performed by the MRI  technologist in conjunction with the patient’s spouse, closest relative, guardian, or personal  physician. This individual should complete and sign the screening form designated for this  purpose.</para>
      <para>The MRI technologist performing the examination must review the completed screening  form and verbally review the answers with the patient or other individual before witnessing  (i.e., signing) the form. The screening form is placed in the patient’s medical record. Any  implants, devices, or metallic foreign bodies raising concerns relative to MRI safety should  be checked with published sources or by other means (1-6), before allowing entry into the  MR system room. Consultation with the supervising radiologist or MR Safety Officer is  recommended if any safety concerns cannot be resolved. The MRI technologist should per- form a final visual and verbal safety check prior to entering the MR system room with the  patient.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">771</emphasis></para>
      <para>Sedated, anesthetized, incommunicative or high-risk patients should undergo appropri- ate physiologic monitoring throughout the MRI examination. This may include checking  the patient’s vital signs, such as respiratory rate, heart rate, electrocardiogram, blood pres- sure, and oxygen saturation as clinically indicated and as deemed appropriate by the MRI  facility and supervising physician (5).</para>
      <para>A critical component of the outpatient MRI facility’s safety program is planning for at- tending to patients who may have medical emergencies in the MR system room. Appropri- ately trained personnel and supervisory physician shall be available at all times to provide  emergency medical treatment to patients with cardiac and respiratory arrest. Mock emer- gency or “code blue” drills are recommended to ensure that the emergency team can effi- ciently manage medical emergencies. In the setting of a serious emergency such as a  cardiopulmonary arrest, the patient should be rapidly and safely removed from the scanning  room and immediate basic or advanced life support or other appropriate treatment should  be initiated. Emergency medical equipment and medications should be readily available  and accessible to emergency personnel.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Pregnant Patients </emphasis></para>
      <para>Pregnant patients warrant special consideration. MRI may be performed at any stage  of pregnancy if the patient’s physician and radiologist determine that the risk versus benefit  warrants performing the exam. This topic is covered in detail in another chapter in this text- book.</para>
      <para>The indications and other information for scanning during pregnancy must be docu- mented in the patient’s medical record and should include that the MRI study cannot be ac- quired via other non-ionizing means such as ultrasound, the diagnostic information is  medically necessary to diagnose the mother or fetus during pregnancy, the referring physi- cian does not believe it is prudent to wait until a later stage of pregnancy or after pregnancy,  and the patient agrees to have the examination during pregnancy. Importantly, the prior re- quirement for written and verbal informed consent is no longer a requirement from the  American College of Radiology (7). <emphasis role="bold">Table 7</emphasis> outlines the indications for performing MRI  in pregnant patients.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Fetal MRI </emphasis></para>
      <para>Fetal MRI is indicated for use if diagnostic ultrasound is inadequate or the examination  provides important information about the fetus that would otherwise require exposure to  ionizing radiation (4, 5, 7-9). Fetal MRI is conducted only on the recommendation of a ra- diologist after consultation with the referring physician (4, 7-9). The radiologist should doc- ument in the radiology report the fact that: (1) the diagnostic study could not be acquired  via other non-ionizing diagnostic imaging means, (2) the information was needed to poten- tially affect the care of the fetus during the pregnancy, and (3) the referring physician did  not feel that it was prudent to wait until the fetus was born to obtain the information. Of  note is that recent investigation reported that MRI exposure to the fetus during the first  trimester of pregnancy was not associated with increased risks (9).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Specific MR System-Related Patient Risks </emphasis></para>
      <para>The time-varying magnetic fields applied during image acquisition induce currents in  conductors in the field’s influence and, when applied in the presence of a high static mag- netic field, create torque on the gradient coils, producing acoustic noise. Because of the in- tensity of the noise induced by gradient switching in high field strength MR systems,  patients should wear hearing protection when undergoing MRI (4, 7, 10-12). Typical hearing  protection devices include earplugs, headphones, or headphones with noise reduction tech- nology. Certain MR scanners provide active noise control (noise cancellation) systems that  attenuate acoustic noise and/or have an option of using quiet pulse sequences (11). Despite  these features being available, patients should still utilize passive noise control (earplugs  or headphones) during all MRI exams performed on high field strength scanners.</para>
      <para>The radiofrequency (RF) fields used during MRI can generate heat in conductors (4, 7,  12-16) resulting in temperature increases.  Therefore, all unnecessary electrically conductive  materials should be removed from the patient and the bore of the MR system before initi- ating scanning to prevent patients from experiencing excessive heating or burns (4, 7).  All  electrical connections, such as on surface RF coils, electrocardiogram leads, and other sim- ilar items should be checked by the MRI technologist prior to each use to ensure integrity,  and that the thermal and electrical insulation is intact. Damaged cables and exposed wires  should be immediately reported to the service engineer and the equipment taken out of serv- ice until it is repaired.</para>
      <para>For electrically conductive materials, such as wires, that are required to remain in the  bore of the MR system during MRI, the wires must be oriented so that no loops are formed  (4, 7). Adequate thermal insulation (i.e., using air, padding, etc.) should separate the patient’s  skin from all conducting materials, as well as the transmit RF coil (e.g., the body RF coil)  during MRI. Procedures to prevent excessive heating and burns in patients during MRI have  been previously presented and should be closely followed as part of preparing patients for  MRI examinations (4, 5, 7).</para>

      <para>Before undergoing an MRI examination, patients should be asked if they have ever had  a permanent coloring technique (i.e., tattoos or permanent cosmetics) applied to the body.  This includes cosmetic applications such as eyeliner, lip liner, lip coloring, as well as dec- orative designs. Screening is necessary because of associated imaging artifacts and, more  importantly, because a small number of patients have experienced transient skin irritation,  cutaneous swelling, or heating sensations at the site of the permanent coloring in association  with MRI (4). These issues do not represent a contraindication to MRI but precautionary  measures should be in place, such as application of a dry, cold compress (ice pack wrapped  in a towel) to the tattoo site during the exam. Patients should be advised to immediately  notify the MRI technologist regarding any unusual sensation felt at the site of the tattoo  during scanning (4, 5, 7).</para>
      <para>Patients with metallic body piercing jewelry must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis  and cleared in the same manner as other implanted devices that have no labeling informa- tion. Accordingly, the supervising physician must make a careful assessment of risk asso- ciated with the MRI versus the benefit of the diagnostic information.</para>
      <para>Some drug delivery or medication patches may contain metallic foil or other similar  conducting material. Subjecting the area of the medication patch to RF energy may result  in thermal injury to the patient (4). Since removal or repositioning can result in altering the  medication dose, consultation with the patient’s prescribing physician is recommended. If  the medication patch is removed, a nursing staff member should be given the responsibility  for ensuring that it is replaced or repositioned (4)</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Sedation </emphasis></para>
      <para>Certain outpatients may require sedation in order to complete a successful MRI exam- ination (17-19). The Safety Committee must have written policies and procedures detailing  how adult and pediatric patients should be medicated in the MRI setting. For pediatric pa- tients, these policies and procedures should be based on national standards, facility-specific  policies defined by the referring pediatrician and the pediatric radiologist, the age of the  patient, the mental capacity of the patient, the time duration of the MRI examination, and  the depth of sedation needed. Written guidelines for adult sedation are also needed. Facil- ity-specific policies developed in conjunction with anesthesiologists should determine the  type of sedation that is utilized. Sedation should always be administered in accordance with  national guidelines and state and local laws (4, 7, 17-19). Separate sedation consent forms  must be approved by the Safety Committee and explained to the patient by an appropriate  healthcare professional before the patient or designate signs the document.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Gadolinium-Based MRI Contrast Issues </emphasis></para>
      <para>The most common adverse event leading to emergency room visits from outpatient  MRI facilities is an adverse reaction to intravenous administered MRI contrast agents. No  patient should be given an intravenous contrast agent without the written prescription of a  licensed physician in accordance with state laws. Depending on state regulations, a physi- cian, registered nurse, or IV-qualified MRI technologist may start and attend to the periph- eral intravenous access line and administer the MRI contrast agent as a bolus or continuous  injection.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">774</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Policies and Procedures for an Outpatient Facility</emphasis></para>
      <para>Before administering an intravenous MRI contrast agent, preferably at the time of  scheduling the study, a history must be obtained from the patient or patient’s guardian con- cerning prior contrast injections and possible adverse reactions (20-23). A history of asthma  or allergic-type respiratory reaction not associated with MRI contrast agents is a risk factor  for adverse reactions, but does not require premedication in most circumstances. Monitoring  the cardiovascular and/or respiratory status (i.e., via the use of an MR Conditional pulse  oximeter) is prudent during and following administration of intravenous gadolinium-based  MRI contrast agents in high-risk patients. According to recommendations by the ACR, if  the patient has a history of an adverse reaction to a gadolinium-based contrast agent, then  the patient should be considered for premedication prior to receiving the contrast dosage  (20). The patient’s cardiovascular and respiratory status should also be carefully monitored  using appropriate techniques during MRI and for 30 minutes following contrast adminis- tration. While serious reactions are rare (21, 23), patients who have had a severe anaphy- lactoid reaction to prior gadolinium-based contrast media should be given careful  consideration before use in future MRI exams.</para>
      <para>According to recent recommendations in the ACR Manual on Contrast Media (20), out- patients do not need to be screened for renal function status before administration of a Group  II agent at standard or lower doses unless they have the known risk factors. In other in- stances, screening questions designed to determine the patient’s risk for nephrogenic sys- temic fibrosis (NSF) should be asked at the time of scheduling and when the MRI  technologist obtains the patient’s history prior to MRI (24-34). <emphasis role="bold">Table 8</emphasis> lists screening ques- tions that we recommend to ask patients relative to the issue of NSF. A positive answer to  any of these questions requires calculation of the patient’s glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  to determine risk for NSF before administering gadolinium-based contrast agents in the out- patient setting.</para>

      <para>Do you have a history of kidney disease, including:  Kidney surgery or a kidney transplant?  • Single kidney?  • Kidney tumor or renal cancer?  • Do you have hypertension that requires medication?  Are you diabetic?</para>
      <para>The referring physician and radiologist or attending physician must confer and  • decide that use of the gadolinium-based contrast agent is essential for diagnosis  and no other reasonable means is available;</para>
      <para>Written orders from the referring physician and the supervising radiologist must  • be obtained, which include the name of the patient, the name and brand of the  MRI contrast agent used, dose, route and rate of administration, the date and sig- nature of the radiologist;</para>
      <para>The lowest effective dose of a lower-risk Group II gadolinium-based contrast  • agent should be used unless there is a specific indication for another agent.</para>
      <para>Although the benefits of hemodialysis have not been definitively established if the pa- tient is on dialysis, the patient should undergo a hemodialysis session as soon as possible  after the administration of the gadolinium-based contrast agent, preferably within a few  hours of the study. The ACR no longer recommends that dialysis be repeated 24 hours later  (20). Of note is that peritoneal dialysis provides less NSF risk reduction compared to he- modialysis.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Visitor Screening </emphasis></para>
      <para>All visitors entering the Restricted Zones (III and IV) must be screened for MRI risk  factors and fill out a specific screening form designed for those not undergoing an MRI ex- amination (4) while still in the Patient Preparation Zone and undergo screening by the MRI  technologist. If deemed safe to enter the Restricted Zones by the MRI technologist, then  the visitor may be allowed access to these areas under direct supervision by an MRI safety- trained healthcare worker. Prior to entering the MR system room, it is recommended that  the visitor change into a gown or scrubs provided by the MRI facility.  However, if the vis- itor is allowed to remain in street clothes, pockets must be emptied of all metallic objects,  external hearing aids, jewelry and analog watches, and any other objects that are ferromag- netic or could be damaged in the presence of a high static magnetic field must be removed.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Emergency Personnel </emphasis></para>
      <para>Emergency responders (e.g., first responders), firefighters, police, and security person- nel must be fully screened as a visitor and cleared by an MRI technologist before being al- lowed access to the scanner room.  Furthermore, it is prudent for outpatient MRI facilities  to periodically inform their local police and firefighter organizations of the risks of the pow- erful static magnetic field of the MR system and the 24-hour presence of the magnetic field  for superconducting magnets before emergencies arise so that emergency personnel will be  cognizant of the risks when responding to emergencies. Security personnel must remove  all metallic objects from their possession including guns and ammunition, electronically- activated restraint devices, radios, cell phones, badges, name tags, jewelry, coins, wallets,  keys, pocket knives, and similar items before entering the MR system room. If the patient  is a detainee and requires a restraining device, a plastic restraint device must be used (7).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Employee Safety </emphasis></para>
      <para>The outpatient MRI facility is a dynamic and often stressful environment. Therefore, it  is important to establish policies and procedures for professional behavior and etiquette to</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">776</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI Safety Policies and Procedures for an Outpatient Facility</emphasis></para>
      <para>avoid unnecessary patient stress on top of an anxiety-provoking examination. Center per- sonnel who interact with patients should properly identify themselves and explain their  roles.</para>
      <para>All employees of an outpatient MRI facility must be screened for MRI risk factors and  any employee who is deemed to be unsafe for the MRI setting (e.g., as a result of having  an unsafe implant) must be kept from the Patient Preparation and the MR system room.  Employees with access to the scanner room must complete and pass an MRI safety training  course, which should be repeated on an annual basis (5, 7).</para>
      <para>If an equipment malfunction occurs, then the chief or lead MRI technologist, facility  manager, or radiologist should be informed in a timely manner. Only certified and qualified  MRI technologists and MRI safety-trained radiologists should be permitted to operate an  MR system and have unrestricted access to the scanner room. These individuals must be  extensively trained and educated in the broader aspects of MRI safety, including issues re- lated to the potential for attraction of ferromagnetic implants and devices, burns, peripheral  nerve stimulation, acoustic noise, and other potential risk factors (4-7).</para>
      <para>In order to minimize errors, it is recommended that the MRI technologist indicated in  the patient’s medical record should be responsible for screening the patient and performing  the MRI examination. Only safety-trained MRI technologists should be authorized to con- duct MRI screening. Non-MRI personnel should be accompanied by and/or under the im- mediate supervision of an MRI technologist while they are in the immediate area prior to  the MR system room and the scanner room, itself.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Pregnant Personnel </emphasis></para>
      <para>Pregnant healthcare workers can work in and around the MRI environment throughout  all stages of their pregnancy (4, 5, 7). This includes, but is not limited to, positioning pa- tients, scanning, archiving, injecting MRI contrast agents, entering the scanner room in an  emergency, and performing similar tasks.  However, if pregnant workers are uncomfortable  with the concept of exposure to the static magnetic field of the MR system, they should not  be required to work in the MR system room. Pregnant healthcare workers should not remain  within the bore of the scanner during the operation of the scanner (4, 5, 7)</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Equipment </emphasis></para>
      <para>Proper installation and maintenance is necessary for the safe operation of an MR system.  All equipment used in the scanner room must be deemed safe for use in the MRI environ- ment. Oxygen tanks must be nonferromagnetic throughout the imaging facility. Fire extin- guishers must be MR Conditional versions and must be placed in a conspicuous place in or  near the scanner.  Monitoring equipment such as pulse oximeters and anesthesia equipment  must be MR Conditional in order to be used in the MR system room. All other equipment  such as IV poles, step stools, stretchers, and other patient support items must also be MR  Safe or MR Conditional.</para>
      <para>There are risk factors unique to the powerful magnet associated with an MR scanner.  For example, if an individual is “trapped” against the MR system by a large ferromagnetic  object, then the static magnetic field will likely need to be shut down immediately. If the</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">777</emphasis></para>
      <para>magnet is resistive, then the power can be shut off. If the magnet is superconducting, then  the field must be reduced using the “quench button”, which should be located in a conspic- uous place. Special training and education are important for all staff members working in  the outpatient MRI facility with regard to specific procedures to follow involving a quench  (4, 7).</para>
      <para>Preventive maintenance is mandatory to ensure high performance of the scanner in  order to minimize down time and to maximize image quality and should be performed ac- cording to the manufacturer’s recommendations and properly documented.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>Optimal MRI safety in outpatient imaging centers requires a well-organized plan that  includes the facility’s management, employees, an MRI Safety Committee and committed  MR Medical Director, and MR Safety Officer. A written safety plan that includes policies  and procedures that address the risks uniquely associated with the MRI environment must  be developed and explained to all employees, along with the assignment of specific respon- sibilities for execution of the plan.  Since few lay people understand the risks associated  with high static magnetic fields and other potential hazards associated with MRI, screening  must begin at scheduling and continue prior to scanning. Strict adherence to patient safety  management must be practiced before and during the MRI exam. Visitors, emergency per- sonnel, and others must be screened and prohibited from entering the MR system room with  unsafe devices to ensure both their safety as well as that of patients and staff members. For- tunately, extensive experience with MRI technology in outpatient facilities worldwide dur- ing more than thirty years has demonstrated that outpatient MRI is extremely safe if proper  policies and procedures are in place and the precautions discussed herein are rigorously en- forced.</para>
