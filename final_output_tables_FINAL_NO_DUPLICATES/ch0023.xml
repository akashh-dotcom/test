      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>The level of knowledge of a natural phenomenon has often been related to the ability  to describe it through more or less complex mathematical relationships. Notably, physicists  and engineers have always used mathematical tools and modeling to represent the real  world. On the contrary, some biological disciplines, especially in the past, showed more  skepticism to their use. It is argued that the biological reality is extremely complex and,  therefore, not suitable to be represented by an oversimplified model. This objection implies  that the description of a system through mathematical and physical models may produce a  distortion of the phenomena under investigation. As such, it is difficult to refute this objec- tion because, as a matter of fact, the construction of any mathematical model needs to for- mulate simplifying hypotheses. However, this is a characteristic of all cognitive phenomena,</para>
      <para>which are always based on some form of schematization. What is interesting to see is  whether the mathematical or physical model is indeed more distorting than other methods.  The mere presentation of experimental results does not produce conceptual distortions, but  cannot be considered free from defects on a practical level, because even the measurement,  in itself, implies an alteration of the system. Moreover, and this is a point of great impor- tance, it does not allow the interpretation of the phenomenon, since its function is purely  descriptive. On the other hand, when it is possible to describe a complex phenomenon using  the basic laws of physics, it is possible to provide an interpretative key to the results that  are obtained (i.e., an interpretative model). On the basis of the model, it is then also possible  to formulate predictions on the behavior of the same phenomenon over time, or even under  conditions that differ from those observed when experimental data were collected (i.e., a  predictive model).</para>
      <para>It is useful to emphasize that the biomedical world has always been very familiar with  the concept of model, although it is generally associated with <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> studies or animal  models. Indeed, experimental medical practice leads from clinical to laboratory experience  to return to clinical experience, developing through abstraction and simplification steps, in  order to understand the single aspects that contribute to complex natural phenomena. This  approach is very similar to that of physical-mathematical modeling: the profound complex- ity that characterizes living organisms and the countless relationships existing between their  different components, make it impossible to describe the system in its entirety and require  the identification of specific sub-phenomena, with the introduction of drastically simplified  models with respect to reality. However, keeping in mind these simplifications, the models  can provide results and interpretations on the physical aspects of biological reality that could  hardly be achieved by the observation of experimental evidence alone.</para>
      <para>The definition of a model commonly accepted by methodologists of science is: given  any system, <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis>, where system means a set of elements connected to each other, it is said that  a new system, <emphasis role="italics">M</emphasis>, represents a model of <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis> when it is possible to establish a correspondence  between the elements and relationships of <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis> and the elements and relationships of <emphasis role="italics">M</emphasis>. Such  definition implies that, to a certain extent, the study of the system S can be traced back to  the study of the system <emphasis role="italics">M</emphasis>. When the elements of <emphasis role="italics">M</emphasis> are mathematical entities and the rela- tionships between them are mathematical functions, <emphasis role="italics">M</emphasis> is called a mathematical model.</para>
      <para>The definition of a physical model is more debated. In some cases, a physical model is  defined as a mathematical model in which the relationships that bind the different elements  of the model are borrowed from the language of physics. According to another interpreta- tion, the physical model represents a simplification of the starting model that allows a sim- pler characterization and evaluation, but always in terms of experimental measurements  and not through mathematical functions.</para>
      <para>When it is possible to characterize the structure and properties of a system and write  the relationships between the different variables, it is also possible to proceed to the con- struction of the mathematical model with interpretative function. However, it is evident that  when choosing the structure of the model corresponding to the system under consideration,  it is necessary to accept some simplification. Thus, the model is generally deduced through  a process of abstraction and a series of simplifying hypotheses, which lead the real system</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">612</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</emphasis></para>
      <para>to be associated to an ideal or “abstract” system that is an image of the former but which it  is not the exact replica.</para>
      <para>The adoption of simplifying hypotheses poses the problem of the validation of the  model, which is generally based on the comparison between the results obtained from the  model, through logical deductions or numerical simulations, and the results obtained from  the experimental analysis on the real system. Even when the comparison is successful, it is  necessary to ask whether the model is valid only for the particular experiment carried out  or has more general validity. In the first case, the model would lose all forecasting capacity.  However, even in this case, the model would still have the merit of providing an interpre- tation of the experimental evidence, which goes far beyond the simple descriptive function.</para>
      <para>When all the hypotheses underlying the model are demonstrated to be valid, the deduc- tive nature of the modeling process reasonably allows the ability to recognize the interpre- tative (and predictive) capabilities of the model, for a various set of physiological conditions,  not necessarily limited to those under which the validation was carried out. The possibility  of modifying the structure of the physical/mathematical model that describes a particular  biological phenomenon, undoubtedly represents a useful tool towards a form of predictive,  preventive, and personal care, which is now becoming the paradigm of modern medicine.</para>
      <para>The general concepts expressed so far fit well with the study of the interactions of elec- tromagnetic fields with biological tissues. In particular, the modelistic approach has repre- sented and continues to be an indispensable means of analysis for the evaluation, both in  qualitative but also in quantitative terms, of human exposure to non-ionizing electromag- netic fields. The knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the propagation and the interac- tions of electromagnetic fields with the external world has always proceeded in parallel  with the ability to describe them through mathematical laws. Beginning with the identifi- cation of simple relationships, valid only for particular cases and under strong simplifying  hypotheses, with the progress of science, increasingly complex models of general validity  have been formulated. In some cases, they have also permitted the capability to hypothesize  the existence of particular phenomena before being able to have an experimental evidence  of the same phenomena. Maxwell’s equations constitute the fundamental mathematical  model for the description of the electromagnetic phenomenon and give a complete descrip- tion of the relationships between electromagnetic fields, charges, and current distributions.</para>

      <para>The resolution of these equations can be obtained, generally speaking, both through  purely analytical methods and through numerical methods. In the first case, however, only  relatively simple problems have so far been successfully addressed, such as the absorption  of a plane wave by an infinite tissue surface, possibly consisting of several layers, or by  spheres, and the absorbed electric field has been obtained in a closed form. Despite the  major simplifications needed by the analytical approach, the latter has definitely helped in  understanding the theoretical basis of the power absorption by a biological body, and in  identifying the parameters that play a major role in this process.</para>
      <para>In the case of numerical analysis, on the other hand, the electromagnetic equations are  solved by algorithms that use numerical approximation. The rapid development of compu- tational capacities during the last decades has made it possible to greatly reduce the impact  of such approximation and to carry out studies on models that are very close to the actual  system under investigation.</para>
      <para>The numerical computation of the induced electromagnetic field inside the human body  is the starting point for the study of the possible effects of electromagnetic fields on biolog- ical systems and the mechanisms underlying them. The parameter typically used to charac- terize the interactions between electromagnetic fields and tissues is the power absorbed per  unit of mass or the specific absorption rate (SAR) measured in watts/kilograms (W/kg).</para>

      <para>The SAR is the typical parameter adopted by international regulations that address the  protection from electromagnetic fields, as a basic parameter for the risk assessment.  Such  a choice derives from the consideration that the whole-body averaged SAR and local SAR  are suitable quantities to compare the effects of electromagnetic exposure under different  conditions. The SAR value resulting for a given exposure condition can also be related to  the local induced temperature increase, thanks to the bioheat equation (1), which describes  the heat exchange mechanisms within biological tissues:</para>

      <para>SAR = absorbed energy rate (W/kg)</para>
      <para>In parallel with the development of modeling/numerical techniques, the effects of the  interactions between electromagnetic fields and biological tissues have also been investi- gated through experimental studies. In many cases, experimental measurements have rep- resented the starting point for the definition of the numerical model, as well as the source  of data necessary for the validation of the model itself.</para>
      <para>However, by analyzing these experimental studies and the limitations necessarily related  to them, the great importance of numerical models and simulations is even better high- lighted. Generally speaking, experimental studies evaluate the electromagnetic field inter- actions with biological tissues by exposing a physical model of the human body, typically  referred as a “phantom”, to the electromagnetic field. The strong simplification needed by  the physical model compared to the case of actual biological tissues makes it difficult to  immediately extend the results obtained to what can be expected in the real case in human  subjects without any further analysis. In addition, the measurement of the electromagnetic  quantities (e.g., electric field, induced currents, etc.) without perturbing the system is often  a difficult challenge that must be adequately addressed. Therefore, an indirect measurement  is often preferred, considering, for example, quantities, such as the temperature, that are</para>

      <para>In consideration of the above, the modern computational capabilities and computing  powers that have grown continuously in recent years have made the modelistic approach  an excellent means to describe the interactions between electromagnetic fields and biolog- ical tissues, not only limited to the research field. Presently, numerical simulations are used  as a predictive and design support tool in different contexts, from the industrial prototyping  of new devices to the regulatory compliance evaluation in terms of electromagnetic com- patibility issues.</para>

      <para>The evaluation of the possible effects induced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)- related electromagnetic fields on a patient bearing a metallic implant is an excellent example  to demonstrate the important role that computational modeling plays today. MR systems  generate time-varying gradient magnetic fields and pulsed radiofrequency (RF) fields in  the presence of a powerful static magnetic field to create an image of the body. Together,  the three electromagnetic fields (static, time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and RF fields)  create a hostile environment for any metallic device implanted in the patient, in particular  for active implanted medical devices (i.e., medical devices relying on functioning by a  source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the  human body or gravity) such as a cardiac pacemaker, an implanted cardioverter defibrillator,  a neurostimulation system or a cochlear implant.</para>
      <para>The scientific community has been engaged in finding a practical solution to extend  the unparalleled benefits of MRI to patients implanted with metallic devices since the early  1990s (2-8). Numerical analysis has been widely adopted for the design and optimization  of MR systems: for the optimization of static magnetic field homogeneity and for shimming  (9-14); for the design of gradient coils and their optimization (15-19); for the design of  transmit RF coils and optimizing RF field homogeneity (20-26); and for the design of re- ceiver coils and the assessment of the signal-to-noise ratio for MR images (27-33). Numer- ical tools were also adopted to model the human body’s exposure to the three  aforementioned components of the electromagnetic fields generated by the MR scanner.  Electromagnetic modeling has been used to evaluate the biological effects related to the  power static magnetic fields of MR systems (34-36), the peripheral nerve stimulation caused  by the time-varying gradient magnetic fields (37-39), and safety aspects of RF power dep- osition and resultant tissue heating during MR signal excitation (40-50).</para>
      <para>However, the modeling of the interactions with the human body in presence of a metallic  implant, definitely suffered from the oversimplifications made necessary by the computa- tional resources available at that time, and tools based on numerical simulations played, in  this field, a secondary role compared to experimental measurements and <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> studies.</para>
      <para>Indeed, Maxwell equations have to be solved to simulate the interactions of the elec- tromagnetic field with the implanted medical device. For a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner, the Lar-</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">616</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</emphasis></para>
      <para>mor frequency is 64 MHz, which corresponds to a wavelength in human tissues of approx- imately 40 cm. Therefore, the wavelength is about the size of the studied object, and full- wave simulations need to be run, meaning that no approximation on Maxwell equations  can be made. This is true for MR systems that works at 3 T (Larmor frequency =128 MHz,  wavelength in human tissues of about 20 cm) as well. Thus, in order to reduce the compu- tational costs of the model, the human body was often represented as a homogeneous do- main with a simple geometry (e.g., rectangular or ellipsoidal) (51-54), or only a part of the  body, such as the head, could be modeled taking into account the different tissues properties  (55-57). In addition, the model of the implant could not account for the actual structure and  geometry of a real device (i.e., the insulation sheet and the arrangement of the inner wires  of the lead were not considered) (58-62).</para>
      <para>In vivo and <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> experimental studies demonstrated the complexity of the interactions  between the MR system, the human body, and the medical implant, and described multiple  variables that may play an important role in such interactions, including the patient’s size,  anatomy, body composition, the patient’s position in the MR system, the pulse sequence,  (which included RF power level), lead routing, and lead design (63-66). The consequence  of the great number of variables involved led to a substantial variability in the results pre- sented in the peer-reviewed literature and indicated how the characterization of an implanted  device in a patient undergoing MRI was an extremely complex problem.</para>
      <para>While the experimental approach could demonstrate in a relatively easy way the hazards  related to the exposure of a patient implanted with a device to the MRI-related electromag- netic fields, it was far more difficult to prove a solution to these hazards because of the  complex and unpredictable nature of the MRI-implant interactions. The use of phantoms,  which do not account for the anatomical details and differences in terms of dielectric prop- erties of different tissues, does not allow the results to be immediately extended to what oc- curs in a human subject. In addition, the simple measurement of a parameter does not allow  any interpretation of the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon and does little to identify  any strategies to reduce the risks associated with the parameter of interest. Thus, it became  evident early on that there was a need for a different approach that was able to provide an  interpretative and predictive key to the phenomenon: the modeling and numerical analysis.</para>
      <para>As the computational resources increased over the years, the reliance on numerical cal- culations increased as well. Such an increase was supported by the possibility of performing  systematic analyses of the several variables affecting the interactions between the MRI elec- tromagnetic fields and the implanted device, with decreased costs and increased repro- ducibility compared to performing experimental measurements. Computer-aided modeling  demonstrated a practical and efficient method for exploring millions of variable combina- tions in a holistic manner. Additionally, computer modeling allowed the analysis of param- eter extremes, outside the bounds of normal clinical practice, which permitted further  assessment of safety margins and the sensitivity of influencing variables. The results of  model simulations enabled predictions to be made about what would happen in the “real”  system that was being studied in response to changing conditions, and to obtain information  virtually impossible to obtain by experiments, like the electric fields inside a human body.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">617</emphasis></para>
      <para>For all of these reasons, present-day numerical simulation has become an indispensable  means of safety testing for metallic devices associated with MRI, not only for research pro- poses, but also for medical device manufacturers to affordably obtain MRI-related safety  labeling for their products. As an example, the first cardiac pacemaker implant that obtain  the FDA clearance as MR Conditional in 2009 used modeling data to support regulatory  submissions for approval. In particular, the modeling data was, in fact, the primary vehicle  to demonstrate safety for this active cardiac device (67).</para>
      <para>Considering the complexity of the electromagnetic problem, most of the modelistic  methods implement the numerical solution of the Maxwell’s equations. The vast majority  of numerical field calculations performed for MRI of the human subject, without or with a  metallic implant, are related to the RF fields. Whereas perturbations associated with the  static magnetic and time-varying gradient magnetic fields due to the presence of the human  body in the MR system are only a few parts per million (on the order of 0.000001 times the  applied field), perturbations in the RF field can easily be tens of a percentage (on the order  of 0.1 times the applied field in free space). In addition, RF field-induced heating in tissue  (concomitant with the maintenance of the RF field in a lossy medium) must be understood  and monitored to avoid excess heating or a burn injury in a patient (68). This is also the  major concern when assessing the MRI issues for a metallic implant that is present in a pa- tient undergoing an MRI examination.</para>
      <para>Several numerical methods exist, each of them solving the Maxwell’s equations fol- lowing a specific algorithm. However, every numerical method has the implicit limitation  of not solving solutions in a linear continuum. Every physical system has to be discretized  in finite domain, so that the numerical solution is computed based on partial differential  equations. The geometry of the physical systems involved in the problem is partitioned into  elements of space or cells, in which the differential equations can be computed. The entire  net of elements discretized into the numerical system is typically named by the term,  “mesh”. Several meshes can be implemented based on the specific grid of elements defined.  In general, a mesh can be classified based on the following factors:</para>
      <para>•  Domain dimension: One-, two-, or three-dimensional;</para>
      <para>•  Element type: Triangular, tetrahedral, quadrilateral, hexahedral, or a mix of more than  one type;</para>
      <para>•  Element aspect ratio: Isotropic or anisotropic;</para>
      <para>•  Mesh density: Uniform or graded mesh; and</para>
      <para>•  Topology: Structured or unstructured mesh.</para>
      <para>A structured mesh presents a regular topology with a well-known pattern. Conversely,  an unstructured mesh has an irregular topology where the connectivity of the grid is part of  the data structure. Once the mesh is defined, then the relation to the physical system within  each element of the numerical space has to be found. What needs to be defined then is the  algorithm that is able to solve the physical problem in the discretized space for the specific  characteristics chosen. Several numerical methods exist to solve a physical system, however</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">618</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</emphasis></para>
      <para>each one is defined with respect to its numerical implementation. Thus, every method cannot  be independently defined by the algorithm.</para>
      <para>The methods used to solve Maxwell’s equations in a physical system are based on dif- ferential or integral equation solvers, such that they discretize the differential or integral  form of Maxwell’s equations. Both methods can be solved in the time or frequency domain.  In the time domain, the frequency range of interest is specified, and a gaussian signal with  the frequency information is defined. Then, the signal is transformed into the time domain  by using an inverse Fourier transformation, resulting in a time signal with a gaussian enve- lope. The system is then excited with this time pattern.</para>
      <para>Conversely, in the frequency domain, the behavior of a physical system is usually rel- evant in a specified frequency range. Thus, no information can be concluded for a single  frequency. Hence, several simulations in the frequency band of interest have to be per- formed, the number of which are defined by the software algorithms to achieve a predefined  accuracy of results by interpolation of points.</para>
      <para>The most favorable methods for this type of problem, in terms of memory requirements  and simulation time are the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) (69) or the Finite In- tegration Technique (FIT) solved in the time domain. These time domain solvers require  reasonable memory and simulation time compared to the frequency domain solvers (FEM,  Finite Element Method; MM, Method of Moments) (70). Moreover, these algorithms tend  to be easily implemented on Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) allowing a tremendous ac- celeration of the simulations with a hardware cost way below the cost for a cluster of central  processing units (CPUs).</para>
      <para>One drawback of these time domain solvers is the hexahedral mesh, which is much less  flexible than the tetrahedral mesh of a finite element solver. However, the possibility of  using a conformal mesh permits the ability to follow the strong curvature of a geometry  without having to dramatically refine the mesh. This is even more important because the  smaller the mesh step, the smaller the time-step of the time domain solver.</para>
      <para>The FDTD method is a related space-grid, time domain technique that involves the res- olution of Maxwell’s equations on their differential form. Since its introduction by Yee in  1966 (69), the FDTD method has been widely used for a broad range of electromagnetic  applications including geophysical, bioelectromagnetic, and biophotonics (71) and this tech- nique experienced an exponential growth starting from its first proposal. One of the major  reasons for such growth is the increase of computational performances for a given cost of  technological resources.</para>
      <para>Because the FDTD algorithm is based on the solution of Maxwell’s equations on their  differential form, it is required to define the boundaries condition of the problem. In partic- ular for wave-propagation problems in unbounded media, artificial boundary conditions  have to be used to eliminate the reflections from the edge of the finite computational domain  (72). A major turning point of the method for the study of wave propagation problems was  the introduction of the perfectly matched layers (PML) by Berenger in 1992 (73). One of  the characteristics of the FDTD method is that as the resolution of the sampled object is re- fined, the time required by the simulation to reach the Courant Friedrich Levy condition</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">619</emphasis></para>
      <para>grows. This is a direct consequence of the intrinsic definition of the time-step as directly  proportional to the square root of space resolution (71). Thus, the smaller the resolution,  the smaller the time-step, and the higher the number of time-step intervals required to per- form a time-defined simulation. Presently, computers are able to simulate increasing simu- lation space with higher resolution steps within a reasonable amount of time for each  simulation. As described by Taflove, et al. (71), there are several reasons for the popularity  of this method, including its robustness and systematicity. On the other hand, one of the  major disadvantages of the technique is due to the inability of modeling smooth curved and  tilted profiles. Without the implementation of a specific algorithm, a curved or tilted profile  implemented in FDTD will be affected by “staircasing”. Although the simplest and most  frequently used approach is the staircasing approximation, it has been reported that there is  a solution inaccuracy related with the staircasing effect (74, 75). Moreover, an error of up  to 2% error can be committed in the evaluation of the resonance frequency of a resonant  object with respect to the tilted angle of the object with Cartesian axes of the grid (74).</para>
      <para>In addition to the staircasing approximation, in the past years several methods have  been proposed to generate a conformal mesh for tilted and curved profiles. Among all, four  categories can be highlighted: the contour path (CPFDTD) algorithm (76), the non-orthog- onal FDTD (77), the hybrid methods using FDTD-FEM (78) or FDTD-MoM (79), and the  sub-gridding method (80). Even though these methods have been extensively discussed and  compared (81), the original FDTD Cartesian grid for the simulation of a radiofrequency  (RF) coil for MRI has been, to date, the most commonly used methodology adopted in the  peer-reviewed literature.</para>
      <para>Other methods including the Method of Moments (MoM) and the Finite Element  Method (FEM) are very good for creating accurate representations of good conductors of  arbitrary geometry, but rely on methods such as matrix inversion that work best for sparsely- populated spaces. Finite element representations of the human body are used occasionally  in MRI (82-84), but due to the computational requirements, the representations tend to have  far more homogeneous representations of far fewer tissue types than FDTD methods can  accommodate on a given system.</para>
      <para>The FEM method is a near-neighbor, volume method for solving Maxwell’s differential  equations in the frequency domain. The physical space is divided into a non-structural grid,  composed of meshes of small volumes or cells of tetrahedral elements, and this fact makes  this method very suitable in modeling inhomogeneities and complex geometries. Once the  volume has been subdivided, the unknown field within each element is approximated using  linear extrapolation, starting from a sparse system equations matrix. The solution is given  by the inversion of this matrix. The FEM can couple the electromagnetic solution with other  physics, such as those associated with mechanical and thermal problems. However, it could  be inefficient in the treatment of highly conductive radiators due to the requirement to have  some mesh between the radiator and the absorber, and the mesh could be very complex, re- sulting in a meshing time that is longer than the solution time.</para>

The strong points of this method are that: (1) it is unnecessary to  discretize the “air space” around the antenna, leaving only the antenna and the region of in- terest to be considered; (2) only the surface is meshed; and (3) there is an efficient treatment  of highly conducting surfaces. However, the MoM does not handle electromagnetically pen- etrable materials, especially if the material is inhomogeneous, and requires the surfaces to  be closed, which is often impractical.</para>
      <para>To represent both the transmit RF coils and human body accurately in the same simu- lation, some groups have devised hybrid methods combining more than one method and  sharing results between them (85). After an electromagnetic simulation, the specific absorp- tion rate (SAR) distribution that is obtained is then scaled for each real RF pulse of the se- quence and can be given as an input to the transient heat equation solver.</para>
      <para>For the magneto-static problem, to assess the interaction of the field with complex  geometries, the most frequently used method is the FEM. For gradient magnetic fields for  which the frequency is a few kHz, approximations can be made on the Maxwell equations  and the most common method used is the FEM (86).</para>
      <para>Today, the crucial role that the numerical simulations play in the evaluation of the elec- tromagnetic field generation, propagation, and interaction with the human body, not only  limited to research purposes but also for industrial design and manufacturing, is revealed  by the several tools that are commercially available. The main commercial simulation soft- ware available on the market providing a time domain solver are CST Microwave Studio™  (CST GmbH, Germany), Sim4Life™ (Zurich MedTech AG, Switzerland), Xfdtd™ (REM- COM Inc., USA), and FEKO™ (Altair Development SA, South Africa). ANSYS™  (ANSYS Inc., USA) and COMSOL Multiphysics™ (COMSOL Inc., Sweden) are finite- element solvers that are mainly used in the frequency domain.</para>
      <para>Parallel to the growth of the electromagnetic solver capability and computational effi- ciency, numerical human phantoms additionally evolved tremendously since the first need  for these in the 1960s (87), from an approximate geometric model to the very detailed  anatomical models existing today. The first numerical phantoms adopted in electromagnetic  simulation were “stylized phantoms”. These phantoms were the first generation of compu- tational phantoms and were also called the mathematical phantoms (88, 89). They were im- plemented and used mainly between the 1960s and 2000s.</para>
      <para>Stylized phantoms were introduced to assess the dose exposure in body organs and tis- sues that were described by mathematical expressions representing planes or cylindrical,  conical, elliptical or spherical surfaces. All of the models developed over the years were  representative of the “average or standard individual” as defined by International Commis- sion on Radiological Protection (ICRP) data on the reference man (89). The most utilized  stylized phantom model was the “MIRD” model. This phantom was named after the initials  of the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) Committee of the Society of Nuclear Med- icine based in the United States (U.S.). The MIRD phantom was first introduced by Fisher  and Snyder in 1967 and later refined (90, 91). The refined model shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> was  representative of an adult human model. In the following years, several other models that  were part of the MIRD-type phantoms were released, representing infants and children of</para>

      <para>various ages, separate male and female adult models named Adam and Eva, and three phan- toms representing the adult female in three stages of pregnancy (92-95).</para>
      <para>The second generation of computational phantoms was the voxel phantoms. The voxel  models were first presented as a “tomographic-type” and were introduced in 1984 by Gibbs,  et al. (96) and in 1986 by Williams, et al. (97). These numerical models were generated  from medical imaging data collected through MRI or computed tomographic (CT) scans.  The voxel models were able to provide three-dimensional representations of the human  body by volume elements of the same size (i.e., voxel) but representing the anatomical  structures of the human body (e.g., white matter, muscle, bone, etc.).</para>
      <para>Since their introduction in 1980s, the voxel models are still in use, and a large number  of them are free to download or are commercially available. In the context of the MRI ex- posure assessment, one of the first studies on this important topic was performed by Dim- bylow in 1996 (98). The exposure was computed on the NORMAN (i.e., NORmalized  MAN) human voxel model with a weight of 73 kilograms (kg) and height of 1.76 meters  (m). The model was implemented based on MRI data from a series of continuous, partial  body scans of a single subject. Because the concept of the ICRP reference man was still  strong, the final dimensions of the model were scaled so that the mass and height would  agree with the new values for the reference man. Over the years, additional models were  developed, including the Visible Human Man (VHM) and Visible Human Woman (VHW),  which were completed in November 1994 and 1995, respectively. The VHM and VHW  were the result of the visible human project led by the U.S. National Library of Medicine  that started in 1956 and formed the basis for a large number of MRI safety assessments.</para>
      <para>With the growth of computational power and imaging resolution, several other models  were introduced. In particular, volumetric models were adjusted by using surface description  methods, which allowed smoother surfaces that could be meshed at one’s convenience, with</para>

Among all  of the models available today, one of the more popular ones that are used for the assessment  of electromagnetic exposures are the phantoms of the Virtual Family (100), which were ex- panded to the Virtual Population (101). The populations include models of males and fe- males ranging from an infant to an older adult. Models of pregnant woman and obese human  are also present.</para>
      <para>Recently, a further improvement for computational phantoms is represented by the  boundary representation (BREP) phantoms. The BREP phantoms are computational human  models that contain exterior and interior anatomical features of a human body using the  boundary representation method. With respect to the voxel models, the BREP phantoms are  deformable phantom whose geometry can be conveniently transformed to fit particular  physical organ shapes, volumes, or body postures. The operations that are possible to per- form on BERP phantoms include extrusion, chamfering, blending, drafting, shelling, and  tweaking (89). These features allow BREP models to include very complex anatomical fea- tures, as well as surface deformations. More details about the human phantoms adopted  today in MRI numerical simulations, as part of complete model of interactions between the  MR scanner and the patient, are provided in the next section.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">THE COMPLETE MODEL OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MR SYSTEMS </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">AND PATIENTS WITH IMPLANTED LEADS</emphasis></para>
      <para>Patients with active implants that incorporate one or more leads (e.g., cardiac pacemak- ers, neurostimulation systems, cochlear implants, etc.) are often referred for MRI examina- tions. Importantly, to ensure the safe use of MRI technology in these individuals,  comprehensive <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> testing is necessary to evaluate the various MRI issues that exist,  especially MRI-related heating of the leads. As part of this assessment, modeling is often  performed because of the above-mentioned reasons. Modeling of the interactions between  the MR system and the patient implanted with metallic leads faces three major challenges:</para>
      <para>First, there is inter-MRI examination-related variability. The initial studies that focused  on the MRI safety of biomedical implants immediately highlighted that there are several  factors that greatly impact the results and that justify the large variations of the findings re- ported in the peer-reviewed literature. For example, the type of MR scanner that is used  and imaging conditions (e.g., the static magnetic field strength and frequency of the trans- mitted RF fields, the pulse sequence parameters, the duration of the scan, the body part un- dergoing imaging, etc.) vary between MRI procedures. Furthermore, other factors influence  the level of lead heating that occurs during MRI such as the patient’s position in the transmit  RF coil, the position of the implant and the lead configuration inside the patient, and the  patient’s characteristics (e.g., size, morphology, and posture). In addition, variations exist  in the length and design of the lead as well as in the type of implanted device that is present  in the patient (i.e., cardiac pacemaker versus spinal cord stimulation system). Thus, the  large number of different combinations of the factors mentioned above makes individual  simulations of each combination a particularly challenging problem.</para>
      <para>Second, there is body tissue heterogeneity. The different tissue types present in the  human body are both geometrically complex and differ strongly in dielectric properties.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">623</emphasis></para>
      <para>Just to get an idea, Liu, et al. (102) used conductivity values ranging from 0.02 S/m (yellow  bone marrow) to 2.3 S/m (cerebrospinal fluid) and values for the relative permittivity rang- ing from 7 (fat and mammary tissue) to 128 (intestine/bowel content) in their simulations  of an MR scanner operating at 64 MHz (1.5 T scanner).</para>
      <para>Third, this is a multi-scale problem. Importantly, several length scales are present in  the problem. At 64 MHz, the wavelength λ0 of the RF field in free space is roughly five  meters. Thus, the human body has a size of approximately λ0/3. Inside the body, the wave- length is reduced to λ = λ0/√εr, where εr is the relative permittivity of the body tissue. De- spite this reduction of the wavelength, in many cases the components of the implanted  device (e.g., the insulation sheath of a cardiac pacemaker lead) have dimensions on a length  scale of approximately λ/1000. Volume discretizing methods are able to resolve these length  scales concurrently but are limited by overwhelming simulation times and memory require- ments.</para>

Running a simulation with such constraints  is computationally expensive because it leads to a large number of discretization cells (up  to 200 million cells) and a complex distribution of material of different electrical proper- ties.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">The Model of the MR System </emphasis></para>
      <para>The risks of MRI-related electromagnetic fields on implanted devices arise from three  basic aspects of scanning (103-105). Magnetic resonance utilizes extremely powerful static  magnetic forces (usually 30,000 to 60,000 times the Earth’s magnetic field). This powerful  magnetic field has the theoretical potential to move or dislodge an implanted metallic device.  MRI also involves the use of time-varying gradient magnetic to image the scanned field of  interest. These rapidly varying magnetic fields have the potential to induce electrical cur- rents. Finally, MRI uses “pulsing” RF energy during the scanning process. If the implanted  metallic device acts like an “antenna”, this RF energy has the potential to cause substantial  localized heating or to induce electrical currents.</para>
      <para>Today, the materials typically used in implanted biomedical devices have physical prop- erties that make mechanical effects (i.e., force and torque) negligible in association with  static magnetic fields. As an example, reports confirm that, indeed, the forces for cardiac  pacemaker pulse generators exposed to 1.5 T and 3T MR scanners tends to be lower than  the gravitational force exerted by the Earth (106, 107). More dangerous are the effects re- lated to the time-varying gradient magnetic fields and the RF fields, in particular when the  implanted device is an active implanted medical device (105).</para>
      <para>Devices such as cardiac pacemakers or ICDs have the ability to sense several physio- logical parameters of the patient and to modulate their activity, accordingly. The gradient  magnetic fields and/or RF fields may affect the proper sensing activity, causing an inap- propriate functionality of the device. In MR Conditional devices, this hazard has been mit- igated by introducing a specific mode of operation, called the “MRI Safe Mode”, “MRI  Protection Mode” or other suitable term, that temporarily switches off the sensing ability  of the active cardiac device, preventing any form of interference.</para>
      <para>The heating generated at the tissue/device interface due to the electrical currents induced  during the scanning process represents the most significant and potentially dangerous effect  of the complex interactions between the implant and the MR system, in particular for those  devices that used long metallic leads. Since the magnitude of the RF field is several times  higher than the gradient magnetic fields, the induced heating is mainly due to the RF field.  For this reason, the vast majority of numerical field calculations performed for MRI of the  human subject implanted with metallic devices are related to the RF fields.</para>
      <para>RF coils can be distinguished into surface coils, array coils, or volume coils. Volume  coils (e.g., the transmit body RF coil) completely encompass the anatomy of interest and  are mostly operated as transmit RF coils coupled with receive-only coils but are also capable  of operating as transmit/receive RF coils. Volume coils are typically cylindrical and rely  upon a sinusoidal distribution of currents arranged circumferentially around the tube and</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">625</emphasis></para>
      <para>running along the length of the coil to create a transverse magnetic field. Such RF coils, as  the birdcage and the transverse electromagnetic (TEM) resonator, were designed to generate  a very homogeneous RF excitation field B1 across the entire covered volume.</para>
      <para>A surface RF coil consists of a partial loop of wire having dimensions that match the  area of interest and its inductance in resonance with the capacitance at the Larmor frequency.  The inhomogeneous field profile of surface RF coils restricts their use primarily to the re- ceive-only mode, except in the case where adiabatic pulses or trains of pulses are used to  reshape the flip angle profile. However, they are, as their name suggests, good for detecting  signals at a much higher SNR close to the surface of the patient. RF array coils are used to  reduce imaging time by their ability to spatially localize signals.</para>
      <para>Volume coils, and in particular birdcage coils, are the most common type of RF coils  adopted as RF sources in the numerical field calculations performed for MRI of the human  subject. The issue is to tune it properly to get the wanted homogeneous mode of the resonant  structure. The birdcage body coils are implemented using two circular rings named end- rings connected by a certain number <emphasis role="italics">N</emphasis> of straight longitudinal connectors named rungs or  legs. The RF field produced by the birdcage coil is the result of the currents flowing in the  rungs. The currents flowing in the RF coil system is the result of the resonance of each net- work component of the coil structure.</para>
      <para>In 1997 work, Leifer (108), accurately described the theory behind the birdcage res- onator, through a simple LC (also called a resonant circuit) circuit. Leifer solved the birdcage  coil using Kirchoff’s mesh equations on the coil network. Leifer described the network as  a generalized “band-pass” birdcage containing capacitors in both the end-rings and rungs.  From the same structure “low pass” and “high pass” coils can be derived as special cases  of the general band-pass coil. The three coil typologies are characterized by different reso- nant “modes”. In fact, because of its geometry, the birdcage resonator shows a periodic or  cycling nature. The periodic waves produced are named “modes” of resonance and their  number is dependent on the number of coil rungs, such that the modes of resonance are  those that show an integral number of wavelengths around the coil structure, each with a  different field pattern and frequency of operation. Theory demonstrates that the number of  resonant modes in a birdcage coil is strictly related to the number of rungs <emphasis role="italics">N</emphasis>, and equal to  <emphasis role="italics">N</emphasis>/2 -1. In addition to those, Leifer (108) showed that a mode of resonant can exist in which  the currents flow in the same direction in each end ring. Because of co-rotating currents in  the end rings, this mode was named Helmholtz or the co-rotational (CR) mode, and it cannot  be constructed from any combination of currents in the LC network. This mode, however,  doesn’t produce any propagating wave around the RF coil, hence it doesn’t generate a mag- netic field in the sample region. With the addition of this last Helmholtz mode, a total of  <emphasis role="italics">N</emphasis>/2 + 2 resonant mode exist in a birdcage coil of <emphasis role="italics">N</emphasis> rungs. Between the <emphasis role="italics">N</emphasis>/2 +2:</para>
      <para>• The mode of resonance with periodicity or order equal to 0 has equal and opposite ring  currents and zero rung currents. It is called the anti-rotational (AR) ring mode.</para>
      <para>• The 0 mode is followed by the CR mode that is not identified by a periodicity or order  number.</para>
      <para>• The mode of resonance with periodicity or order equal to 1 is the only one able to gener- ate a homogeneous magnetic field. Thus, this is the typical mode used for imaging.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">626</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</emphasis></para>
      <para>• All the other modes generate a magnetic field with a null at the center of the birdcage  coil.</para>
      <para>Low pass and high pass models present the same number of resonance modes, but they  differ by showing a low or a high resonance spectrum, respectively. In particular for a low  pass birdcage type, the AR and CR modes degenerate at zero frequency, with higher-order  modes increasing in frequency. Conversely, in high pass birdcage type, the AR and CR  modes form a doublet in high frequency, with higher-order modes decreasing in frequency.</para>
      <para>Over the years, the RF birdcage coils have been proffered as the main implementation  of RF coil for approximating the B1 propagation in the patient. However, the presence of a  patient can affect the B1 homogeneity. As a result, there may be areas within the body of  the patient in which the transmit RF field is substantially weaker than in other regions. Ad- ditionally, the loss of homogeneity increases with the static magnetic field strength and with  the RF coil’s dimensions. For this reason, other technologies have been implemented to  overcome the loss of field homogeneity. The more relevant ones are the Transverse Elec- tromagnetic (TEM) resonator coils, and the parallel multi-transmit RF coils. The TEM res- onator was first introduced by Vaughan in 1999 (109). The structure of the TEM resonator  differs from the one of a birdcage coil in two ways. First, longitudinal connectors of the  birdcage coil are replaced in the TEM coil with microstrips that are affixed to the inner sur- face of a non-conducting cylinder. Second, in the birdcage coil the rungs current use the  end-rings as a return path, whereas in the TEM resonator the microstrips are all connected  to the outer thin metallic shield. Thus, inductance and self-resonance of the TEM coil are  independent of RF coil’s diameter, because the TEM coil return path follows the shield  rather than the end rings. The main characteristic of the TEM resonator is that at high fre- quencies, it becomes a cavity resonator or longitudinal transmission line in which oscillating  standing waves develop.</para>
      <para>The increase of the SNR has always been the main target of improvement for RF bird- cage body coils. To this aim, the use of multi elements excitation was adopted as a measure  to improve the RF homogeneity in the excited volume. The simple birdcage coil was seen  as a multi-element transmit coil array that could allow for an independent adjustment of  amplitude and phase of the signal feeding each element of the coil. Starting from 2000s,  this concept was evolved and made to take advantage of this method to reduce the RF in- homogeneities in the patients, particularly at high static magnetic fields (110). This new RF  modality is also known as parallel multi-transmit or RF shimming. The degree of freedom  given for each element of the coil to be fed with a specific waveform, permitted the ability  to more carefully control and increase the homogeneity of the B1 field generated by the RF  excitation. Thus, the main concept of the multi-transmit coil is that the power is distributed  to the feeding sources of the transmit RF coil (typically a TEM resonator) using two or  more independent channels. A second advantage of these transmit RF coils is that they can  be also used in a parallel receiving mode with a consequent reduction of the acquisition  time.</para>
      <para>The structure of the birdcage coils allows for multiple feeding conditions within the  coil rings. Depending on the source number, and feeding phase and amplitude, different po- larization of the produced magnetic field can occur. Historically in the 1980s, the birdcage  coils were fed using a single port coil, such to achieve a linearly polarized field. However,</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">627</emphasis></para>
      <para>with such polarization, “quadrupole” artifacts were present in the resulting MR image (111).  These artifacts manifested as “holes” or voids of decreased image intensity that could not  be attributed to any anatomical feature of the patient scanned.</para>
      <para>By running simulations with cylinders of different size and material, it was evident that  the “holes” were caused by the asymmetric nature of induced eddy currents that derive from  the finite conductivity of the medium. To overcome this artifact problem, it was suggested  to implement the circularly polarized birdcage coil with two feeding ports. The two ports  were fed with the same amplitude and differential phase of 90° in order to generate a purely  rotating wave. With this new polarization, a 1.4 and 1.6 higher SNR was observed with re- spect to left/linear and right/linear polarization, respectively.</para>
      <para>The linear polarization is then considered less efficient for MRI because half of the  transmitted power is not used for the imaging process. The circularly polarized field is ob- tained by adding to the original linearly polarized field, a second field generated by sinu- soidal current phase shifted by 90°. This is typically obtained by a quadrature transmission  of signals in the RF birdcage coil.</para>
      <para>This can be achieved by two or more feeding sources around the coil ring. When such  a circularly polarized field is generated, the two counter-rotating components of the two  generated fields (i.e., B1 -) cancel each other, whereas the subfields effective at inducing  MRI (i.e., B1 +) add together. Hence all of the power is used for imaging and an overall  higher efficiency is achieved. Presently, the RF coil implemented in a clinical MR system  uses the highly efficient, quadrature excitation. Conversely, linearly polarized transmit RF  coils are restricted for use in small animal imaging.</para>
      <para>Beside the time-varying magnetic field (B1) used for the excitation of the magnetization  vector, when a conductive media, such as the human body, is present inside or in close prox- imity to the RF energy, an altering voltage or electromotive force is induced inside the con- ductive media by the variation of the magnetic flux. The electromotive force generates eddy  currents inside the media that, in turns, generate a secondary magnetic field and a corre- sponding additional voltage. Overall, the induced internal fields are strongly dependent on  both the incident field, and the size, shape, and dielectric properties of the exposed medium.  The voltage induced by B1 is much larger than the secondary one. However, within the  human body it can be considerably high enough to perturb the primary field. This is due to  the complexity of the body’s anatomy and to the inhomogeneity of the dielectric properties  of the tissues.</para>
      <para>Additionally, an electric field can be generated within the body by the distribution of  electrical potential specific to a given resonant structure. In MRI, such an electric field is  typically named “conservative” or “capacitive”. One possible situation in which the capac- itive effect should be taken into account is when the medium is in close vicinity to the RF  resonator. All these elements must be considered in the development of the model of the  transmit RF coil used for MRI. For an ideal computation, the entire RF coil (with the actual  power supply and the tuning capacitors able to produce the circularly polarized magnetic  field), should be reproduced using a grid resolution fine enough to adequately account for  the detail of the implanted device under investigation. As previously mentioned, the chal- lenge is to combine a simulation of large dimensions (i.e., the length of the MRI’s transmit</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">628</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</emphasis></para>
      <para>RF coil &gt; 1 m) and small structures (i.e., the thin wire &lt;&lt; 1 mm). In order to decrease the  computational effort required by the model, in many of the numerical studies, the birdcage  coil is simplified with respect to its actual structure. In some investigations (112, 113), the  birdcage coil is modeled removing all the lumped elements: the capacitors are replaced by  current generators, with sinusoidal time behavior (i.e., at the frequency of 64 or 128 MHz)  and a phase delay equal to the azimuthal angle in order to obtain circular polarization. In  this case, the resonance mode is no longer achieved by tuning the capacitors, but by forcing  the right current distribution inside the birdcage coil. This model is able to faithfully repro- duce the electromagnetic field distribution of an unloaded birdcage coil, but, when adopted  to simulate the interaction with an implanted device in the body, it becomes much less ac- curate, in particular when the implant is placed immediately underneath the skin (e.g., an  implanted infusion pump), close to the transmit RF coil.</para>
      <para>As already highlighted in the previous section, FDTD and related methods remain dom- inant in numerical field calculations that consider realistic human body models. However,  it is not the ideal method in all situations, such as when dealing with fields near highly con- ductive surfaces in any arbitrary orientation, as with most RF coils. Generally, FDTD and  related methods rely on a Cartesian grid (with regular or irregular grid spacing), so surfaces  at oblique angles are represented in a ‘staircase’ fashion. Although there are some algorithms  to help reduce the shortcomings of FDTD-type methods in these situations, other approaches  include development of human body models for finite element methods (114) and hybrid  approaches using one numerical method in regions containing the RF coils, and another in  the region containing the human body are often adopted (115).</para>
      <para>Modeling has also been applied to investigate the interactions between implants and  the time-varying gradient magnetic fields. The gradient coils of an MR system generate  time varying magnetic fields with a frequency in the kHz range. These varying magnetic  fields generate induced electric fields on implanted metallic devices during the MRI process  that results in the appearance of eddy currents which can generate induced voltages on the  electronics of active implanted medical devices. In the frequency range of gradient fields,  capacitive and electromagnetic propagation can be neglected, thus, it is possible to treat  bioelectric currents and voltages in living tissues as stationary. This is known as the quasi- static approximation. Under quasi-static assumptions, the stimulus amplitude and the re- sulting voltage, electric field and current density are all in a linear relationship. Therefore,  it is sufficient to employ a steady-state solver, which greatly simplifies the computational  costs of the analysis required.</para>
      <para>As for the static magnetic field, modeling and simulations were mainly adopted to ad- dress the problem of the disturbance of the static field owing to the presence of a metallic  implant in the patient, resulting in imaging artifacts which may impact the diagnostic use  of MRI, sometimes making it difficult or even impossible to interpret the images. To con- sider the implementation of correction techniques or magnetic susceptibility artifacts atten- uation, it is essential to be able to calculate very accurately the disturbance of the local  magnetic field generated by the implanted metallic object placed in MRI conditions. For  this purpose, analytical models may be useful tools to perform design and optimization  studies on metallic objects with simple geometries (116). For more complex geometries,  however, an accurate computation of the local magnetic field is needed, using numerical</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">The Model of the Human Body </emphasis></para>
      <para>The success of computational modeling is due to the possibility of performing system- atic analyses of the several variables affecting the interactions between the patient with a  metallic implant and the MR system, with reduced costs and increased reproducibility com- pared to experimental measurements. If there are fundamental flaws or inaccuracies in the  model that mask or modify the physics under examination, even if the simulation itself runs  flawlessly, results might be erroneous and predictions based on that simulation will not ac- curately embody the intended aspects of the physical world. It is with this motivation in  mind that developers of phantoms characterizing the human body and its corresponding  physiological processes have continuously advanced the state-of-the-art and pursued ever  more accurate representations of human anatomy at a variety of geometric scales.</para>
      <para>Many MRI simulations that evaluated the safety of implanted devices, in particular the  early studies conducted when the computational resources were still limited to account for  the detailed representation of the human tissues, adopted numerical models of the body that  were derived from the physical phantoms used in experimental studies. Physical phantoms  are typically made of solid materials, which are approximately equivalent to human tissues  in terms of electromagnetic properties. They can be based on simplified designs or they can  be anthropomorphic phantoms.</para>
      <para>Simplified phantoms have the advantage of being easily standardized. In the peer-re- viewed literature, it is possible to find simplified phantoms made of different geometries  such as: “oblong saline bath to simulate an endovascular intervention” (118), cylindrical  phantom (119, 120), or spherical phantom (121). Because of their simplicity, simplified  physical phantoms were also standardized. In the context of MRI exposures, the standard- ized phantom to assess MRI-related heating for a metallic implant is the American Society  for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International phantom. In the first version of the standard,  the phantom had a shape based on simplified human head and trunk regions (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3a</emphasis>).  In the 2011 edition of the standard (122), the phantom was revised to include only the trunk,  suggesting a rectangular box shape (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3b</emphasis>). The ASTM phantom of the standard is a  container filled with a gelled-saline phantom material with electrical and thermal properties  in the same range of the ones of the human body at the frequencies of interest (i.e., 64 to  128 MHz corresponding to 1.5 and 3 Tesla, respectively).</para>
      <para>An additional phantom proposed for controlled exposure conditions is the ellipsoidal  phantom, described in the Annex M-3 of the Technical Specification (TS), International Or- ganization for Standardization (ISO), ISO/TS 10974:2018 (123) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3c</emphasis>). In addition  to simplified phantoms, anthropomorphic phantoms have been also implemented for a more  realistic representation of the human body heterogeneity. These phantoms typically consist  of several tissue-equivalent materials that are molded into shapes of organs or bones to rep- resent single part or all of the human body. Among all, the bottle manikin absorption  (BOMAB) phantom represents the ICRP reference man and it consists of 10 high-density  polyethylene containers (124). Each of these phantoms are representative of body sections,</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">630</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</emphasis></para>
      <para>such as the head phantom and human torso (125). However, even the most complex physical  phantom cannot adequately represent the extremely complex morphological properties of  the actual human body. On the other hand, numerical modeling allows for a much more re- alistic representation.</para>
      <para>Currently, several voxel and surface human body models are available for downloading  free of charge for non-commercial use. Among these, the most often used solution adopted  not only for electromagnetic exposure evaluations but also in many other medical applica- tions where the detailed human anatomy has to be reproduced, is the Virtual Family (VF)  (100).</para>
      <para>The VF is a set of four highly detailed, anatomically correct, whole-body models of an  adult male, an adult female, and two children. The four models are based on high-resolution  (MRI data of healthy volunteers. Organs and tissues of the models are represented by three- dimensional, highly detailed computer-aided design (CAD) objects without self-intersec- tions and gaps. The CAD objects allow the models to be meshed at arbitrary resolutions  without loss of small features. As of the end of 2014, the VF was used in more than 120  medical device submissions to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was cited  more than 180 times in the peer-reviewed literature. The following two VF model versions  are available free of charge:</para>
      <para>• VF 1.0: The VF 1.0 models include segmentation of approximately 80 high-resolution or- gans and tissues. The Virtual Family Tool can be used to discretize and export the CAD  objects in a generic voxel-based format. All four VF 1.0 models and the Virtual Family  Tool are provided free of charge (except for shipping and handling fees) to the scientific  community for academic purposes, only.</para>
      <para>• VF 2.0: The VF 2.0 models consist of simplified CAD files optimized for finite-element  modeling in any third-party platform. These models are based on a new, high-end genera- tion of VF models that have been re-segmented at finer resolution to afford a higher de- gree of precision and anatomical refinement, as well as improved structural continuity of  approximately 300 organs and tissues. For the purpose of simplification, these structures  are combined into 22 high-resolution tissues. The VF 2.0 models are available free of  charge (except for shipping and handling fees) to everyone.</para>

The models are distributed  as surface meshes in STL (i.e., Standard Tessellation Language or STereoLithography) for- mat. Each tissue is stored as a separate surface mesh, which is guaranteed to be closed, but  may contain non-manifold edges or vertices.</para>
      <para>In addition to the initial human body models, the VF has been then extended to increase  the population coverage: the MR images of additional child volunteers (five and eight year  old girls, and five and 14 year old boys) were segmented to create the Virtual Classroom.  Increased coverage of anatomical variability was provided with obese (37 years old, 1.82  m, 120 kg) and elderly (84 years old, 1.73 m, 65 kg) male models, an eight week old baby  model, and three pregnant women models at gestational stages of three, seven and nine  months. Today, this widely used set of anatomical models is also known as the Virtual Pop- ulation (ViP) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>).</para>

      <para>However, while they have been employed in selected cases to the assessment of medical  devices and therapies (e.g., the safety of implants during MRI), the first generation of the  Virtual Population suffers from limitations related to limited local detail and accuracy, un- suitable tissue surface quality, missing fine structures and insufficient fine structure conti- nuity, as well as inconsistent segmentation across the different models. Furthermore, current  devices often combine complex interactions from multiple domains of physics and physi- ology sometimes in a coupled manner, which require models adapted to different solvers  (e.g., a finite-element method, FEM), which typically requires high-quality unstructured  meshes. In order to overcome these, a second generation of VF models (ViP3) was devel- oped, reaching a level of detail and accuracy with more than 300 tissues and organs per  model and a resolution of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm<superscript>3</superscript> throughout the entire body. For these new- generation models, posing functionalities are available to parameterize the posture of the  models. In addition, to further extend the population coverage, morphing functionality is  also provided that allows, for example, the fat or muscle content to be increased or decreased  to change the body-mass index (BMI) of the models while preserving realistic internal organ  placement and tissue distributions.</para>
      <para>The Virtual Population 3.0 models are integrated within the multiphysics simulation  platform, Sim4Life, which includes only a time domain electromagnetic solver, or the SEM- CAD time domain electromagnetic solver. The Virtual Population 3.0 models cannot be ex- ported to any third-party software. The Virtual Family v1.x models are also compatible with  Sim4Life or SEMCAD time domain electromagnetic solvers, or can be exported to other  solvers only in voxel format, which is not suitable for import into solvers based on unstruc- tured meshes.</para>
      <para>Recent literature includes reports of the development of surface-based models obtained  from the conversion of voxel-based data, and then used for electromagnetic simulation with  solvers that need unstructured meshes (e.g., FEM), which could be more efficient in mod- eling in the frequency domain than other elements of the complete model, that is, the trans- mit RF coil and the implant. However, converting to high-quality, surface-based objects  and correctly matching contact regions is not trivial and presents a significant challenge.  Thus, only a few surface-based, full-body human models are available today, providing lev- els of detail of different human tissues that are not always adequate to be used as a realistic  human model in MRI simulations for the assessment of the safety of implanted leads. How- ever, these models have the advantage that can be obtained from the voxel models derived  from the Visual Human Project Visible Man and Visible Woman data sets, which have  formed the basis for a large number of MRI safety assessments (126). For inter-laboratory  studies, in general, it is beneficial to use voxel- and surface-based models derived from the  same dataset.</para>
      <para>The anatomic accuracy of the human body model is not the only key element that guar- antees the success of a numerical analysis. Depending on the physics to be applied in the  simulation, the parameters of interest (e.g., electric and magnetic conductivity, permittivity  and permeability for electromagnetic simulations, or thermal conductivity, heat generation</para>

Such parameters can be derived from the studies available in  literature that specifically investigated the properties of human tissues in the different fre- quency ranges (127) or from the databases available on-line (128) that, based on a compre- hensive review of the aforementioned scientific papers, provide the modeling community  with average and range-of-variation values of electromagnetic and thermal properties, as  well as density and perfusion of biological tissues, as a function of the frequency of inter- est.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">The Model of the Implant </emphasis></para>
      <para>The model of the lead represents the most critical aspect for MRI simulations that eval- uates the safety of this implant. As such, it needs, at a minimum, a sub-millimeter discretiza- tion inside the comparatively large volume of the transmit body RF coil of the MR system  and must account for a vast selection of realistic implant positions in numerous human body  models in order to perform a statistical basis for a prediction of the expected worst-case  condition. In addition, the inner structure of the lead is often difficult to be known in suffi- cient detail because each device manufacturer may adopt proprietary solutions that are rarely  accessible by the general public. For these reasons, many MRI simulations directed toward  comparing different exposure conditions (e.g., in terms of implant positioning inside the  human body, the level of RF energy applied during MRI, the position of the body inside  the transmit RF coil, etc.) or different implant basic characteristics (e.g., lead length, thick- ness of the insulation sheet, etc.), adopted as the implant model a simple insulated metallic  wire with exposed conductive tips. It is obvious that such a simplified model does not pro- duce realistic results and, thus, is not suitable to predict what can be expected during a “real”  MRI examination involving a patient with actual implanted leads.</para>
      <para>Typical leads used in implanted devices (e.g., cardiac pacemakers, implanted car- dioverter defibrillators, neurostimulation systems, etc.) use coiled wire configurations. The  coiling of the wire is essentially utilized to increase the flexibility and implanted lifetime  of the lead. Coiled wires used in such devices may be single filar (single strand of wire) or  have multi-filar windings (i.e., there may be more than one conductive strand coiled together  to form the wire form). Such complex structures, arranged over realistic pathways compat- ible with the anatomy of the human body cannot be easily represented in the FDTD envi- ronment. Other techniques, such as the MoM, are more favorable, but then suffer from the  already mentioned limitations, when the model of the implant has to be integrated inside  an accurate model of the human body.</para>
      <para>Studies that reproduced and investigated lead structures more complex than the simple  insulated wire, mainly focused on developing and comparing the performance of implanted  lead designs or strategies that could eliminate or ameliorate the hazards related to MRI (129,  130). Whereas these studies achieved a substantial significance with respect to the design  of the MR Conditional implants, they were not suitable for adoption as an accurate implant  model in the complete model of interactions between the MR scanner and the patient. The  difficulties to numerically solve human and lead models simultaneously due to the complex  structure of implanted lead systems prompted the researchers to find an alternative approach,</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">634</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</emphasis></para>
      <para>based on the concept that it may be advantageous to model the lead and the human sepa- rately and then combine the results to determine the heating.</para>
      <para>In 2007 Park, et al. (131), introduced the concept the transfer function (TF) of a lead,  that is a mathematical function that relates the incident electric field to the scattered electric  field in the vicinity of the electrode. From knowledge of the TF, the heating at the lead’s  electrode and the resonant behavior of leads in phantom and human models can be pre- dicted.</para>
      <para>The TF concept comes directly from the formulation of the electromagnetic problem  by the Method of Moments (MoM): the scattered field at the lead tip is considered to be the  linear superposition of the effect of the tangential incident field all along the lead.  Different  methodologies have been proposed to measure the TF of an implanted lead.</para>
      <para>Park, et al. (131) calculated the transfer function for simple wire geometries that sim- ulated implanted leads using the MoM technique. First, the scattered electric field at a test  point near the lead tip arising from a uniform incident electric field of 1 V/m was computed.  Then, the radial component of scattered electric field at the same test point, <emphasis role="italics">P</emphasis>, was calculated  for a step function of the tangential E-field that has unit value (1 V/m) over a specific seg- ment of the lead and is zero over the remainder of the lead. The TF is finally obtained from  these two contribute to the scattered electric field, considering the power dissipation around  the lead tip as the linear superposition of the contribute obtained by the moving the step  function of the tangential E-field all along the lead length.</para>
      <para>By definition, the FT depends on the electrical properties of the surrounding tissue, the  RF frequency, and on the structure and characteristics of the lead under test. Therefore, it  is assumed to be independent from the particular lead path adopted. Thus, the electric field  at the tip of the lead, placed in any possible configuration inside the human body model,  can be easily estimated from the E-field distribution computed inside the body without the  implant.</para>
      <para>Even if such an approach allows the ability to “decouple” the model of the implanted  lead and of the human body, the estimation of the TF obtained from numerical calculations  is still rather demanding, since the actual detailed model of the lead has to be known and  reproduced. The TF can be calculated also via experimental measurements, by exciting a  small portion of the lead with an electric field that needs to be constant over the small section  measured and then drastically reduced to zero in the nearby sections. The TF is then obtained  by recording the E-field at the tip, while moving the excitation signal all along the lead.  However, the generation of such an excitation signal is not immediate and requires specific  and rather expensive systems (131, 132).</para>
      <para>Due to the aforementioned limitations, alternative methods have been proposed in the  peer-reviewed literature (133, 134). An interesting alternative approach is based on the rec- iprocity principle conjugated with the Huygens’ principle (i.e., this principal shows how a  wave field on a surface determines the wave field outside the surface) and demonstrates  that, if one excites the electrode where the heating has to be evaluated, the current distribu- tion along the lead is actually the transfer function. Thus, the current distribution can be  obtained numerically, by exciting the lead with a known current source at the tip, or exper-</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">635</emphasis></para>
      <para>imentally, by injecting an RF signal (64 MHz or 128 MHz corresponding to 1.5 Tesla or 3  Tesla, respectively) into the lead and measuring the current along the lead itself. In the latter  case, in order to obtain from the resulting current distribution a transfer function for the  heating evaluation, a calibration factor has to be determined experimentally, by performing  heating measurements under a known incident electric field.</para>
      <para>Currently, the TF is widely adopted, not only for research purposes, but also by device  manufactures, in the design phase to test the safety of their products, and to produce evi- dence of the safety for the regulatory body in charge of issuing the marketing authorization.  The TF is also described as one of the four-tiered approaches described in the Technical  Standard (TS) from the International Organization for Standards, ISO/TS 10974:2018 (123),  which will be discussed in detail in one of the following sections.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Model Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification </emphasis></para>
      <para>Although performing a numerical analysis has numerous benefits, experimental vali- dation of the numerical model remains a complementary and fundamental step to determine  the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the per- spective of the intended use of the model. Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quan- tification (VVUQ) is a complex set of procedures for the assessment of the overall quality  of the physical system results that are obtained with numerical simulations. The process of  determining the accuracy with which a computational model can produce results deliverable  by the physical system on which it is based is a development process that follows several  steps.</para>
      <para>The flowchart presented in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis> from the American Society of Mechanical Engi- neers (ASME) guide on Standard for Verification and Validation in Computational Solid  Mechanics (135) is a good outline of all the necessary steps that are required in the VVUQ  process.  The VVUQ can be essentially divided into three fundamental steps: (1) the veri- fication of the numerical code implemented (2) the validation of the numerical results with  experimental measurements, and (3) the quantification of the uncertainty of both numerical  and experimental results. In accordance with this guidance from the ASME, these steps can  be defined as:</para>
      <para>•  Verification: The process of determining that a computational model accurately repre- sents the underlying mathematical model and its solution from the perspective of the in- tended uses of modeling and simulation.</para>
      <para>•  Validation: The process of determining the degree to which a model or a simulation is an  accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the  model or the simulation.</para>
      <para>•  Uncertainty Quantification: The estimated amount or percentage by which an observed or  calculated value may differ from the true value.</para>
      <para>Ultimately, the numerical outcomes can be considered a good representation of the re- ality if the data are within the combined uncertainty of the numerical and experimental re- sults. However, it is important to understand that a numerical code can never be fully  verified for any conditions, but every code is verified against a set of numerical tests for  the specific physical system of interest.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">636</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</emphasis></para>
      <para>Over the years, the FDTD methods were thoroughly verified with respect to experi- mental results. Verification of the code is typically performed for simplified geometries and  must be done for any algorithm implementing the numerical method. In the context of the  RF fields associated with MRI, one of the first procedures was followed by Chen, et al.  (136) in 1998. The main goal of their investigation was to analyze the SAR and electro- magnetic fields in a realistic human head model excited by shielded RF coils. The re- searchers proposed a numerical method based on the combination of the FDTD with the  MoM. To verify the numerical code, Chen, et al. (136) compared the numerical solutions  of the magnetic field generated in a square waveguide excited by a current sheet with respect  to the analytical calculation of the same distribution.</para>
      <para>Similar approaches were also followed by Bowtell and Bowley for the magnetic fields  generated by a gradient coil (137), and Collins, et al. (138) for the evaluation of the tem- perature rise and SAR in a human head exposed to electromagnetics field at 64 and 300  MHz.  Once the implemented algorithm had been verified, the specific physical scenario  modeled had to be validated with respect to the experimental measurements. In the context  of the RF fields used for MRI, this step was not trivial, considering that it is not possible to  measure the electromagnetic field distribution in a real-life situation, inside patient. How- ever, over the years, several suggestions were made to validate the numerical results. Seifert,  et al. (139) validated the numerical results with respect to the absolute value of the complex  amplitude of the positively rotating component of the RF magnetic field, and the phase of  the MRI signal. Those quantities were, indeed, part of the information included within the  MR images obtained in a patient. The validation of results based on the B1 maps was also  followed by Homann, et al. (140) for different patient locations within the transmit RF coil,  by Voigt, et al. (141), and by Van den Berg, et al. (142).</para>

      <para>A good alternative for the validation of numerical results with experimental data is the  use of phantoms. Because of their reproducibility in terms of geometric and physical char- acteristics (e.g., electrical properties, thermal properties), phantoms can be easily imple- mented in the numerical environment with a high physical accuracy. Furthermore, a second  advantage of the use of phantoms is the possibility of measuring field values and distribution  inside of the medium. Regarding imaging the human body, results obtained in a phantom  can be validated as well with respect to B1 maps. Ibrahim, et al. (143) validated FDTD re- sults of three implementations of a transmit RF coil at 340 MHz, loading the numerical and  physical coil with a plastic cylindrical phantom (diameter, 15.0 cm; length, 21.2 cm) filled  with mineral oil. Cabot, et al. (144) extended the validation process measuring the electro- magnetic field within a 64 MHz transmit RF coil, and Mattei, et al. (53) in terms of the  return loss of the resonant coil and currents along the rungs.</para>
      <para>Of note is that the uncertainty quantification comes both from experimental and nu- merical data. This can be due to several factors, such as instrumental, environmental, the  operator, or the followed measurement process. Typically, experimental uncertainty is as- sessed by performing the measurement process more than one time and then estimated using  statistical analysis of the set of measurements. Several investigations showed a high vari- ability of results with respect to the mesh used, simulation setup (such as boundaries con- ditions), or computation convergence. Oberkampf, et al. (145) categorized the numerical  uncertainty as:</para>
      <para>•  Aleatory uncertainty to describe the inherent variation associated with the physical sys- tem or the environment under consideration. Sources of aleatory uncertainty can com- monly be singled out from other contributors to total modeling and simulation uncertainty  by their representation as distributed quantities that can take on values in an established  or known range, but for which the exact value will vary by chance from unit to unit or  from time to time.</para>
      <para>•  Epistemic uncertainty as a potential inaccuracy in any phase or activity of the modeling  process that is due to lack of knowledge.</para>
      <para>The aleatory uncertainty is usually an irreducible uncertainty that is typically quantified  by a probability distribution. Whereas the epistemic uncertainty is considered a reducible  uncertainty. An important and thorough investigation including experimental and numerical  uncertainty was performed by Neufeld, et al. (146). The goal of the study was to compare  experimental setup and simulations of RF energy-induced heating at the tip of two generic  implants for standardized testing. For each quantity of interest studied (e.g., electric field,  SAR, and temperature), the uncertainty was calculated assuming a linear dependence of the  measured values with respect to a varying parameter. Examples of parameters that were  considered included: phantom position and electrical properties, positions of the temperature  probe relative to the implant, lead geometry, and numerical resolution.</para>

Modeling data was the primary vehicle used to demonstrate safety  for the first MR Conditional cardiac pacemaker (i.e., the EnRhythm™ in Europe and the  Revo MRI™ in the U.S., Medtronic, Inc., www.medtronic.com), which was introduced into  the market in 2008. (However, it should be noted that nearly twenty years ago, the first  active implant that incorporated leads and implantable pulse generators to receive MR Con- ditional labeling was the deep brain stimulator system from Medtronic, Inc. The labeling  for this device relied solely on physical testing of MRI-related issues that included force,  torque, heating, induced currents, and artifacts.) These data were submitted only to compe- tent regulatory authorities and, thus, were unavailable to the general public. Nevertheless,  a general idea of the approach that was utilize to assess the MR Conditional cardiac pace- maker was presented in the work by Wilkoff, et al. (67): a comprehensive modeling frame- work was developed to predict the probability of a change in the pacing capture threshold  (PCT) due to lead electrode heating associated with MRI. The effects of the MRI were nu- merically evaluated over approximately 2.4 million unique cases (i.e., equal to 19 body  models * 9 positions in the transmit RF coil * 7 transmit RF coils * 2 electric field polar- izations * 1,000 lead routes). At that time, comprehensive international standards or guide- lines that the device manufactures could adopt and follow to demonstrate the safety of active  implants were unavailable, so that the first MR Conditional devices were essentially ap- proved based on the evidence that each manufacturer produced following its own method- ology.</para>
      <para>Presently, what facilitated getting to the current state of MR Conditional devices today  is a joint effort that started in 2006 across the MRI safety community, including represen- tatives from device manufacturers, MR system manufacturers, and regulatory bodies. Ex- perts in each area formed a Joint Working Group that participated in various technical  venues helping to shape and update multiple standards. A major outcome of this effort was  the publication of an international Technical Specification (TS), from the International Or- ganization for Standardization (ISO), ISO/TS 10974:2018 (123), documenting guidelines  on the assessment of MRI safety for patients with active implantable medical devices  (AIMDs). The first version of this TS was published in 2012 and the second, updated version  was published in 2018. The work is ongoing, and the group is updating and transitioning  the TS into an international standard, with expected publication in 2021 or 2022.</para>
      <para>The ISO/TS 10974:2018, entitled “Requirements for the safety of magnetic resonance  imaging for patients with an active implanted medical device”, is today the only interna- tional technical specification that provides tests intended to be carried out on samples of a  device to characterize interactions with the electromagnetic fields associated with an MR  system. In particular, the technical specification is applicable to implanted parts of active  implanted medical devices intended to be used in patients who might undergo an MRI ex- amination using 1.5 Tesla, cylindrical bore, whole-body MR scanners for imaging hydrogen  protons (i.e., the most widely used type of MR system in the world). Although, no require- ments contained in the TS construe or imply any burden or obligation on the part of MR  system manufacturers, it can be used to demonstrate device operation according to its MR  Conditional labeling.</para>

To this aim, a four-tiered testing approach is  described (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). Tier 1 is the most conservative and computationally simple and re- quires no additional electromagnetic modeling: the maximum energy deposition is assessed  through experimental measurements, by exposing the AIMD inside a physical model of the  human body to worst-case electromagnetic field levels, according to what specified in the  TS. Tiers 2 and 3 provide successively less overestimation of test field magnitudes, justified  by electromagnetic computational analysis. According to Tier 2, modeling is used to deter- mine the incident field for testing the AIMD over any averaged 10 g tissue for the anatom-</para>

      <para>In Tier 3, the model of human body is used to determine the incident field in terms of  the tangential electric field (i.e., magnitude and phase) and magnetic field, averaged over  any 20 mm of anatomically relevant elongated AIMD path, for anatomically relevant im- plant locations. From the tangential electric field distribution, the deposited power can be  assessed by experimental measurements or numerical analysis. In particular, the transfer  function concept can be adopted, as described in the previous section.</para>
      <para>Tier 4 requires the development of an electromagnetic model (i.e., full-wave or lumped  element) of the AIMD being evaluated, placed in the anatomically relevant implant locations  inside the human body model. The full electromagnetic model provides direct access to the  evaluation of the deposited power in the human model around the implant, and it is associ- ated with the least overestimation of test fields but requires the most stringent electromag- netic computational analysis.</para>
      <para>Thus, Tier 2 through Tier 4 require electromagnetic simulation results using numerical  human body models to identify the electric and magnetic field magnitudes used in the <emphasis role="italics">in </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">vitro</emphasis> phantom test procedure. The TS provides a general overview of the requirements for  the development, the assessment, and the validation of the numerical models. In particular,  it is highlighted how the RF excitation of the AIMD is proportional to the B1 field generated  by the MR system’s transmit RF coil and the relevant parameters that necessitates careful  evaluation in the transformation of the B1 field to the induced fields, as follows:</para>

      <para>As for the assessment procedure, the TS identifies three steps to be followed in order  to obtain from the electromagnetic simulations conservative <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> test conditions:|</para>
      <para>(1) Identify the patient population and divide it into subgroups with respect to anatomical  properties such as height, BMI, age, etc. and choose the 95th percentile of the patient  population for each relevant property.</para>
      <para>(2) Compute the incident field distributions as defined in the applied tier and determine the  95th percentile incident field value for each subgroup in any of the clinically relevant  postures and positions with respect to the isocenter of the MR system for the specified  relevant transmitting RF coil designs.</para>
      <para>(3) Determine the largest 95th percentile incident field of all subgroups and RF coil designs  for use as the incident field amplitude.</para>
      <para>Validated electromagnetic simulation packages and human models must be used and  an uncertainty budget of the incident field assessment is required and must be documented.  In the uncertainty analysis, at least the following elements must be taken into considera- tion:</para>
      <para>• transmitting RF coil design (including variations, for example, polarization, etc.);</para>
      <para>• inner and outer anatomy (BMI, size, tissue distribution, dielectric, and thermal tissue pa- rameters);</para>

      <para>• AIMD pathways in anatomy (i.e., the geometrical distribution of the AIMD’s location in- side the body).</para>
      <para>Tier 3 and Tier 4 require (or may require for Tier 3) modeling the response of the AIMD  to an incident electromagnetic field. The TS provides a possible <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> approach that may  be used to validate the AIMD model. The following steps are suggested:</para>
      <para>(1) Create a numerical model (e.g., full model or lumped element model) of the AIMD con- figuration to be tested that represents all of its relevant RF field characteristics and con- duct a comprehensive uncertainty analysis for the AIMD model by a robust analysis (e.g.,  by Monte Carlo analysis).</para>
      <para>(2) Evaluate multiple conditions including high and low conductivity medium (if applicable),  which provide differences in the maximum energy depositions larger than the relative un- certainty of the assessment techniques and that represent the AIMD’s major electromag- netic properties. The test conditions shall be sufficiently large to validate the model  prediction over the range of <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> field conditions, one of which shall be the resonant</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">642</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</emphasis></para>
      <para>length. If no differences are larger than the uncertainty of the assessment techniques, then  choose the worst cases with respect to performance.</para>
      <para>(3) Experimentally test the AIMD for all of the above test conditions.</para>
      <para>(4) Determine the relative differences of experimental and numerical assessments for each  test condition.</para>
      <para>If the relative differences between simulations and measurements for each of the test  cases are within the combined relative uncertainties of measurement and simulation, the  AIMD model can be considered validated and the combined relative uncertainties should  be considered as the uncertainty of the AIMD model.</para>
      <para>After completing the assessment of the RF energy deposition around the AIMD, the  second step for the evaluation of the possible harm to the patient caused by RF field-induced  heating is the assessment of the maximum i<emphasis role="italics">n vivo</emphasis> temperature rise. According to the tier  adopted, this can be achieved by performing the thermal modeling of the energy deposition  into a temperature distribution or by performing experimental measurements. If numerical  analysis is adopted, an uncertainty assessment of the thermal modeling must be performed  and then combined to the uncertainty of the electromagnetic modeling to obtain the overall  uncertainty.</para>
      <para>It should be noted that the TS does not provide tissue-specific thermogenic damage  threshold values or guidance on how to determine specific risk factors for the determined  temperature rise, which would inform the third and final step in a complete assessment.  This final step is demanded to the risk analysis performed by the manufacturer.</para>
      <para>A similar four-tiered approach is also applied to demonstrate the protection from harm  to the patient caused by RF field-induced malfunction. The RF fields associated with the  MR system could have certain effects on the AIMD such as, but not limited to, a failure to  deliver the intended therapy, re-programming the device, resetting the device, and/or causing  permanent damage to the device. These effects are caused by the unwanted induction of  voltage on the leads or directly on internal circuits if RF fields penetrate the device’s en- closure. The TS describes a series of functional tests that shall be performed, during which  the device behavior and performance shall be monitored for proper functionality in accor- dance with the device’s MR Conditional labeling. Either radiated or injected immunity tests  are used, and the four-tiered approach is used to determine the field/signal levels to be  adopted during the tests. An overview the four-tiered testing approach is presented in <emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">7</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>Beginning with Tier 1, each tier describes a progressively more rigorous analytic  method for determining the electric field induced in the body by the B1 field. The electric  field is either used directly for radiated immunity testing or for determining injected voltage  test levels. Although no electromagnetic modeling or computational analysis is required for  Tier 1 because it uses pre-determined electric field levels, this tier utilizes the most conser- vative (highest) electric field test values. Tier 2 and Tier 3 require an electromagnetic com- putational analysis using numerical human body models. Tier 4 requires the most rigorous  electromagnetic computational analysis and the development of AIMD models but has the  potential to predict the lowest <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> electric field and, hence, the lowest injected voltage  test levels.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">643</emphasis></para>
      <para>Different from the approach adopted for the evaluation of the hazards caused by RF  field-induced heating, the tiers are now used to calculate electric field and induced voltage  exposure levels for assessing device behavior. The choice of tier requires, at a minimum,  consideration of device type, implant location, lead configuration and orientation, immunity  to radiated fields and signal levels, and the availability of test equipment, among other fac- tors.</para>
      <para>The more susceptible the device is, the higher the tier (i.e., four is higher than one) will  be required, in all likelihood. The choice of tier can also influence the choice of test method,  that is, radiated versus injected. For example, lower tiers, in particular Tier 1, will have  electric field values (e.g., hundreds or thousands of V/m) that make radiated testing imprac- tical. While Tier 4 is only applicable to the injected method since the intermediate analytic  electric field values cannot be used for radiated testing. Injected testing is recommended in  most cases, not only because of repeatability, but because the electric field can be scaled  downwards to a practical level, and then the induced voltage can be measured at the ports  of the device (e.g., the proximal end of a lead), and then the measured voltage scaled back  up accordingly to use for the injected test level. The E-field cannot be scaled for radiated  testing. The radiated method is also not appropriate for testing devices with attached leads.  The <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> induced electric fields associated with an MR system are non-uniform, and al- though the tiered approach described in this clause have steps in the method for multiplying  the measured induced voltage with a resonant length weighting factor (also called the phase  factor) to account for non-uniform fields, this factor cannot be applied to a uniform radiated  electric field test.</para>
      <para>Numerical modeling is also suggested for the test that the TS prescribes to evaluate the  protection from harm to the patient caused by gradient magnetic field-induced malfunction.  In a similar way to the case of RF field-induced malfunction, functional testing is based on  tiered test levels and uses radiated and injected immunity tests. The radiated test shall be  applied to all devices (with or without conductive leads) unless it can be shown that the de-</para>

The injected test shall be applied to all devices with conductive patient electrodes, leads, or  other conductive elements such as external antennas or leadless electrode terminals.</para>
      <para>Three tiers can be chosen, considering the device type, implant location, lead configu- ration and orientation, and immunity to injected signal levels, among other factors. Tier 1  is based on worst-case values for the rate of change of the incident magnetic field, dB/dt,  on the surface of two different defined volumes. Test levels are derived from look-up tables,  as a function of the implant lead length and location. This method results in very conserva- tive test values without computational or modeling requirements. Less conservative results  can be obtained with Tier 2 and 3. Tier 2 requires either electromagnetic computational  analysis of the maximum incident magnetic field over the specific AIMD lead loop area or  device area, or computational analysis of the maximum specific AIMD lead loop area. Tier  3 requires the most rigorous electromagnetic computational analysis, computing the induced  tangential electric field over the lead path, and has the potential to predict the lowest injected  voltage test levels.</para>
      <para>In conclusion, the technical standard ISO/TS 10974:2018, that is today the only inter- national technical specification that provides a consistent testing methodology for implant  manufacturers on how to assess the potential risks for implanted medical devices arising  from an MRI examination, explicitly recognizes the importance of numerical modeling.  For many aspects, although pure experimental methodologies are allowed as well, the results  obtained adopting a complete electromagnetic computational analysis are always less con- servative than other approaches. Besides the primary purpose of the document, that is to  provide a standard test methodology for manufactures that want to demonstrate the MR  Conditional status of their devices, the TS represents an extremely useful source of infor- mation. It can be used as guidance to properly account for all the crucial aspects (e.g., model  validation, uncertainty analysis, etc.) that must be considered during the numerical modeling  of the interactions between the MR system and an implanted device.</para>

      <para>Starting from the late 1990s, the effort to make implanted devices less likely to cause  harm to patients undergoing MRI examinations has resulted in the development of MR Con- ditional AIMDs including cardiac pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and  various neurostimulation systems. Today, more than 10 years have passed since the first  cardiac pacemaker received MR Conditional labeling, first in Europe and then in the U.S.,  extending to implanted patients the undisputed diagnostic imaging benefits of MRI. Most  major cardiac device manufacturers (e.g., Abbott/St. Jude Medical, Biotronik, Boston Sci- entific, LivaNova, and Medtronic) now have MR Conditional products that include cardiac  pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and loop records with labeling that per- mits MRI examinations to be performed in patients at 1.5 Tesla and, in some, cases even at  3 Tesla. The same scenario has occurred for manufacturers of neuromodulation systems,  which have similar components, namely implanted pulse generators and leads (147-149).  Accordingly, there are now a wide range of MR Conditional AIMDs used for neuromodu-</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">645</emphasis></para>
      <para>lation therapies that include deep brain stimulation systems, spinal cord stimulation systems,  vagus nerve stimulation systems, and others. Reports and studies conducted in the following  years on the performances of these AIMDs have not revealed any MRI-related complica- tions or MRI-attributed device damage or malfunction (150-159). Thus, the enhancements  in the device technology and the improved understanding of the interactions between device  components and the electromagnetic fields generated by MR systems have finally allow  more patients to receive the benefits of both these technologies. Numerical modeling and  simulations played a crucial role for these achievements and, given the constant growth of  the computational capability, which today can be easily accessed, will continue to be of  fundamental importance for the future steps that still have to be made in this field.</para>
      <para>The RF energy-induced heating is still the major concern for MRI simulations that are  performed to evaluate implanted leads. To assess the RF field-related safety of an AIMD  for all possible clinical scenarios, the incident electromagnetic field is typically characterized  using the incident tangential electric field along the AIMD lead pathway (160). As already  explained in the previous sections, the assumption that the RF field responses of an AIMD  depends only on the tangential electric field (Etan) allows splitting the RF-induced energy  heating evaluation into two less complex sub-tasks: (1) analysis of human exposure to elec- tromagnetic field generated by MRI RF-transmit coils, that is, calculation of a set of clini- cally relevant Etan, and (2) estimation of the RF responses of an AIMD for this set of  clinically relevant Etan.</para>
      <para>Experimental or numerical assessment of the RF field responses to the set of clinically  relevant Etan is still a sophisticated task, because: (1) the assessment must be performed in  different inhomogeneous tissue environments that correspond to the AIMD lead surrounding  tissues in a human, and (2) generating a set of clinically relevant Etan requires the construc- tion of a multichannel RF transmitter with properties that are difficult to implement. The  lead TF can be used to obtain the analytical lead electromagnetic model, by which it is pos- sible to evaluate an RF field response for an arbitrary Etan. Different approaches such as  piecewise excitation (161), reciprocity (133), transmission line model (162), and base func- tion (163) can be adopted to assess the TF.</para>
      <para>Even if the TF can be obtained for an inhomogeneous media, different AIMD lead path- ways in the patient population result in a large variety of multi-tissue lead environments,  leading to a quite complex assessment. To avoid this, ISO/TS10974:2018 Tier 3 (122) sug- gests using a homogeneous medium with electrical properties close to the tissue predomi- nantly in contact with the AIMD lead. If the AIMD lead pathway spans more than 10% of  its cumulative physical length in different tissues, the TF should also be evaluated in dif- ferent media with appropriate electrical properties. Numerical simulation and realistic nu- merical models of the human tissues are unquestionably key players that can be utilized to  achieve this goal.</para>
      <para>Following the modern paradigm of medicine of the “four P” (predictive, preventive,  personalized and participatory), the main aim for future years is to transform the generic  model of interactions between the MR system and the patient implanted with a medical de- vice into a patient-specific model, able to account for the contributions of realistic anatom- ical structures specific to each individual. High-resolution diagnostic images, such as those</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">646</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">The Role of Numerical Modeling and Simulations</emphasis></para>
      <para>obtainable with MRI or CT, have allowed the means of representing at a high-resolution  the different anatomical districts of the human body in the form of discrete elements suitable  to be imported into the most common simulation environment.</para>
      <para>An extremely efficient semi-automatic processing pipeline to generate individualized  surface-based models of the human body from the MR images of individual subjects has  been recently described by Kalloch, et al. (164). This comprehensive workflow covers image  acquisition, atlas-based segmentation of relevant structures, generation of segmentation  masks, and surface mesh generation of the single, external boundary of each structure of  interest. Similar processes can be adopted to customize the simulation on the specific posi- tioning/lead path of the device inside the patient. High-resolution images can be used to  identify and reproduce in the numerical model the patient-specific configuration of the im- planted device, and the body tissues in direct contact with the device. This information,  combined with the electromagnetic model of the lead, has to be considered in the develop- ment of a personalized tool for the risk assessment of patients with implanted lead under- going MRI. It has been demonstrated, indeed, that the transfer function of a lead can vary  as a function of its position inside the body (165) and consequently, for the same lead, the  expected interaction with the MR system can be different even for the same value of E- field exposure (i.e., the same Etan).</para>
      <para>The role of the manufacturer of the medical device becomes critical, since in most cases,  the electromagnetic model of the lead and its transfer function is known only to the manu- facturer. Hopefully, this information can be explicated and made available to grant the proper  implementation of the numerical analysis.</para>
      <para>A patient-specific model able to account for the anatomical peculiarities of different in- dividuals (e.g., gender, age, physical structure) and for the structural characteristic of the  implanted device under evaluation could become an excellent tool to be used for design,  forecasting, and optimization purposes. Simulations can be used as a virtual prototyping  tool, to evaluate the performances of new design and solutions. It has obvious advantages  in economic terms, including, before producing a real prototype, simulations can be carried  out to better understand which of the possible solutions are worth investing more time and  effort in.</para>
      <para>Numerical models can also become a valuable tool to support the physician in his de- cisions and in the risk versus benefits evaluations (e.g., whether or not to perform an MRI  examination in a patient with a non-MR Conditional device). That is, “try” in the virtual  world of simulations what can be expected in real-life and, in case, test the different solu- tions that could be adopted, to choose the best one for the specific patient. Once the best  solution is chosen, numerical simulation could still be used for optimization purposes, to  minimize as much as possible the risks for the patient with an AIMD.</para>
      <para>In order to adequately meet the objectives listed above, future studies and further efforts  should be spent to increase the multi-physical and multi-scalar properties of the numerical  model. Besides electromagnetic and thermal analysis, the overall model could also benefit  from the integration of mechanical and biological aspects. As an example, electromagnetic  and thermal models can be integrated with biological models of cellular dynamics capable  of characterizing, on a microscopic scale, the effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields,</para>
