      <para>Since its introduction into clinical practice in the early 1980s, magnetic resonance im- aging (MRI) has exhibited exceptional growth and created a paradigm shift in medicine.  Not only has this imaging modality markedly expanded the roles of imaging in medical di- agnoses, opening up vistas in neurological, musculoskeletal, oncological, cardiovascular  and a variety of other diseases not accessible to prior imaging techniques, but it has also  had a profound impact on our basic understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of  abnormal conditions and disease processes.</para>
      <para>The continuous growth of MRI has led to an explosion in the number of patients, health- care professionals, and other individuals exposed to the powerful static magnetic fields,  rapidly changing magnetic fields, and intense radiofrequency fields used during the proce- dures. Numerous investigations have been performed during the past 35+ years in an effort  to characterize the bioeffects and safety aspects of MRI. However, the interactions of the  MRI-related electromagnetic fields with biologic tissues are still incompletely understood  and safety issues persist despite best efforts to implement preventive practices. Unfortu- nately, this has led to many adverse consequences, including injuries to patients and health- care workers, as well as several patient deaths.</para>
      <para>The transformative impact of MRI on medicine continues to progress and advances in  technology continue unabated. Whereas the highest magnetic field used in routine clinical  imaging was 1.5-Tesla during most of the 1990s, 3-Tesla is currently the standard. Presently,  a 7-Tesla scanner is approved for clinical use and research is routinely performed at 9.4- Tesla, 10.5- and an 11.7-Tesla MR system recently came on line to scan human subjects. In  addition to the high static magnetic fields, both the speed of magnetic field gradient switch- ing and the levels of radiofrequency field exposures are pushing limits well beyond what  was possible just a few years before. Therefore, we strongly believe that, for progress to  continue in this field, appropriate safeguards must be in place to protect all human subjects  exposed to MRI, which includes both patients and healthcare workers, alike. This is best  accomplished by conducting careful research directed towards studying the effects of the  electromagnetic fields used in clinical and research MRI settings and implementing cau- tionary measures based on the knowledge acquired during the last three and a half decades.</para>
      <para>Ultimately, MRI safety must begin with understanding the interactions of the elec- tromagnetic fields used in MRI with biologic tissues. The issues concerning human safety  in the MRI environment led us to enlist leading physicians and scientists around the world  to collaborate on the first edition of this textbook, published in 2014, which organized and  reviewed the scientific literature on the safety aspects of MRI. Since then, there have been  thousands of new articles published in the scientific literature detailing MRI safety issues  from every conceivable approach. Thus, the first edition of this textbook rapidly became  outdated. Accordingly, we once again brought together an internationally respected group</para>

      <para>of experts who are directly involved in all areas of MRI bioeffects, safety, and patient man- agement to update this important book. Notably, several new chapters were added to this  second edition, with the intent of covering advanced or emerging topics for the MRI com- munity. The unique collective expertise of these physicians (radiologists, cardiologists, in- ternists, etc.), scientists, engineers, and other professionals has once again resulted in vital  contributions to this resource of essential scientific knowledge that covers all of the critical  topics of interest to physicians, MRI technologists and radiographers, physicists, scientists,  healthcare professionals, imaging center managers, bioengineers, regulatory affairs profes- sionals, and laypersons. The ambitious purpose of this textbook is to provide actionable in- formation that will be used to ensure that the MRI environment is as safe as possible under  all circumstances. We hope that we have accomplished this important goal and that the MRI  community will benefit from the indispensable contents of this textbook.</para>
