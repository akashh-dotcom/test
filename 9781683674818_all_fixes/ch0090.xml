      <para id="ch0090s0000p0001">Bacterial pathogens have developed resistance to antibacterial agents via multiple routes. When any given pathogen mutates and becomes resistant, it can rapidly result in innumerable resistant daughter cells. Mutants that develop following exposure to antibiotics favor mechanisms that confer resistance with the least cost to fitness; that is, the strains that are least burdened by their resistance will survive. This enhanced survival may also include increased virulence. Antimicrobial resistance complicates the treatment for bacterial infections, sometimes requiring therapy with multiple antibiotics, prolonged courses of therapy, and excess hospitalizations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a report on antibiotic resistance in the United States in 2019 regarding the continued threat in the treatment of bacterial infections. They estimated that at least 2.8 million people yearly acquired infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, and that at least 35,000 deaths in the U.S. could be attributed to infectious caused by these organisms (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0001">1</link>). It is important to understand the mechanisms by which bacterial pathogens become resistant, and to recognize this resistance when it occurs.</para>
      <para id="ch0090s0000p0002">The emergence of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes is directly linked to the use of any given antimicrobial agent. Subsequently, when an effective antibiotic eliminates a susceptible pathogen, resistant varieties soon fill the niche within the environment or the patient’s microbiome. Once a resistance phenotype has emerged within a previously susceptible species, the rapidity and efficiency with which it spreads are affected by a host of different factors, including localization of the gene on a mobile genetic element, the expression level of that resistance, the ability of the organism to tolerate the resistance mechanism, linkage to other genes, site of primary colonization, and others. The rapidity and completeness of resistance gene spread are often unpredictable. For example, the staphylococcal β-lactamase gene (conferring resistance to penicillin) was first described shortly after the introduction of penicillin into clinical use and is now almost universally present within staphylococci in hospitals and communities. It was not until the early 1980s that this gene was described to occur in<emphasis>Enterococcus faecalis</emphasis>, and it has never spread widely in this genus (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0002">2</link>). The reverse appears to be true with the vancomycin resistance genes, which are found widely in <emphasis>Enterococcus faecium</emphasis> but remain exceedingly rare in <emphasis>Staphylococc</emphasis><emphasis>us aureus</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="ch0090s0000p0003">An important cause of the spread of antimicrobial resistance is the failure to adhere to appropriate infection control techniques, both within and outside hospitals. It is well established that strains of methicillin-resistant<emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> (MRSA) within individual hospitals, and even within entire cities, are often clonally related, as previously determined by genetic techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing, and staphylococcal protein A typing and now routinely characterized using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0003">3</link>). The spread of these problematic pathogens has been attributed to transmission from patient to patient, presumably by transiently or persistently colonized health care workers (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0004">4</link>). The primary site of <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> colonization is the anterior nares. Colonization of the nares facilitates aerosol transmission of the resistant bacteria, particularly during periods of viral upper respiratory tract infection in colonized workers. It also facilitates direct transmission, given the frequent contact between hands and nose of many people and the frequently poor hand-washing practices of health care workers. The clinical consequences of patient colonization can be significant. Studies have shown a correlation between patient colonization with MRSA and subsequent infection during periods of high risk, such as the postoperative period (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0005">5</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0090s0000p0004">Although antibiotic resistance is predominantly a health care-related problem, resistant bacteria are also spread in the community setting. Sites in which resistant bacteria have been known to spread include day care centers and nursing homes (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0006">6</link>). For example, transmission of respiratory pathogens probably reaches its peak in the winter months, when viral upper respiratory tract infections are prevalent (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0007">7</link>). The prevalence of viral upper respiratory tract infections works in two ways to increase transmission: (i) it probably increases the inoculum of resistant organisms being spread by those already colonized and (ii) it makes those who are not colonized more likely to become colonized because of the increased likelihood that they will receive antimicrobial therapy. Nursing homes are predisposed to resistance for a variety of reasons, including the debilitated state of much of their population, frequent movement back and forth to tertiary care hospitals, and frequent use of antimicrobial agents in an effort to ward off infections that necessitate hospital admissions.</para>

      <beginpage pagenum="1376"/>
      <para id="ch0090s0000p0005">When community-associated MRSA infections were first identified, an investigation usually exposed a history of recent hospitalization; close contact with a person who had been hospitalized; or previous antimicrobial-drug therapy. However, there were some notable exceptions. During 1980–1981 there was an outbreak of MRSA infections in Detroit among people with no history of hospitalization (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0008">8</link>). The majority of these patients were found to be injection drug users. The source of the Detroit outbreak was never identified, but it is assumed that frequent needle sharing was the mode of transmission in the community setting. The unexpected deaths of four Native American children with no known risk factors for acquiring MRSA in the late 1990s launched a new concern over community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0009">9</link>). These strains of CA-MRSA tend to be microbiologically distinct from hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and typically more susceptible to commonly used antibiotics than are HA-MRSA. A common clone of CA-MRSA belonging to PFGE type USA300 was originally widespread only in the United States; however, it has now become widespread throughout North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0010">10</link>–<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0012">12</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0090s0000p0006">A final important source of the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is the use of antibiotics in agriculture. It is now well established that antimicrobial use in food animals is associated with resistance in bacterial species that contaminate food and infect humans, primarily<emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> spp., and the transfer of resistance determinants to their human counterparts, such as <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0013">13</link>). Compelling evidence also exists that high rates of ciprofloxacin resistance in <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis> can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones in poultry (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0014">14</link>). Finally, the European outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci with the <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> determinant in the 1990s was almost certainly fueled by the use of the glycopeptide antibiotic avoparcin as a growth promoter in livestock (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0015">15</link>).</para>

      <anchor id="ch0090s0000a0005"/>
      <para id="ch0090s0000p0007">Bacterial resistance to antibiotics can result via three main pathways: modification of the bacterial target for the antibacterial, decreased intracellular concentrations due to reduced permeability or efflux, or enzymatic inactivation of the drug. In some cases, all members of a given species might be resistant to a particular antibiotic. For example, all isolates of the Gram-negative nonfermenter<emphasis>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</emphasis> express a chromosomally encoded metallo-β-lactamase (MBL). Therefore, resistance to imipenem and other carbapenems can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying this organism. Alternatively, resistance can develop in previously susceptible organisms through genetic mutation or by acquisition of foreign DNA encoding resistance genes.</para>

        <anchor id="ch0090s0000a0006"/>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0008">The use of antibacterial drugs disrupts the microbiome of the patient being treated, which can lead to the selection and overgrowth of drug-resistant bacteria. As a consequence, an entire species of bacterial pathogen might be selected with antibiotic pressure due to natural resistance occurring in that species. In turn, the hospital unit, or other groups of people in close proximity such as in day care centers or in long-term care facilities, can be affected. For example, the increased role of enterococci as opportunist pathogens in the 1980s and 1990s correlated with the introduction and increased usage of cephalosporins, as these organisms are inherently resistant to those agents (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0016">16</link>). Similarly, fluoroquinolone therapy was associated with a higher incidence of staphylococcal and streptococcal infections in hematology patients with indwelling central lines (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0017">17</link>). Among Gram-negative pathogens, <emphasis>Acinetobacter baumannii</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. maltophilia</emphasis> have become increasingly prevalent in many intensive care units (ICUs) following the increased usage of carbapenems, especially among patients on mechanical ventilation (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0018">18</link>). The introduction of each of these new therapies has led to the unexpected consequence of shifting the etiology of some of the common hospital-based infections to species that are naturally more resistant than the pathogens they replaced.</para>

        <title>Resistance by Mutation</title>
        <anchor id="ch0090s0003a0003"/>
        <anchor id="ch0090s0000a0007"/>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0009">As bacteria grow, chromosomal and plasmid DNA is replicated through a process that is highly prone to errors in base incorporation. These errors leading to base substitutions occur randomly, at a frequency of approximately 10<superscript>–9</superscript> per gene (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0019">19</link>). Even one amino acid substitution can greatly alter the functionality of a gene. For example, the substitution of serine for glycine at residue 238 in the SHV-1 β-lactamase led to the first extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), SHV-2, which conferred resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0020">20</link>). In addition to these random point mutations, replication errors may lead to deletions or insertions of small pieces of genes. Each of these mutations interferes with the interaction of antibacterial agents with the bacterium due to changes in the drug target, enzymatic inactivation of the drug, or changes in efflux or uptake. Some of these genes are inactivated by the importation of insertion sequences. For example, the <emphasis>ccrA</emphasis> gene expressing a MBL in <emphasis>Bacteroides fragilis</emphasis> is only expressed if an insertion sequence is found upstream of this structural gene (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0021">21</link>). Exposure to antibiotics does not cause the mutations, but rather it selects for strains that have pre-existing mutations that allow the bacterial cell to survive in the presence of the antibiotic.</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0010">Most mutations occurring in the drug target or in an antibiotic-modifying enzyme affect only a single antibacterial class. However, mutations also occur in genes encoding outer membrane porin proteins (OMPs) that allow penetration through the outer membrane by passive diffusion, or in those encoding efflux systems that expel out of the cell multiple antibiotic classes as well as other cell toxins such as dyes, which can greatly impact the susceptibility of a bacterial cell to the antibiotic (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0022">22</link>). The maintenance of a mutation in a bacterial pathogen causing antibiotic resistance is completely dependent upon whether or not that mutation affects the fitness or virulence of that organism. If resistant mutants emerge at high frequency and are still able to replicate and cause disease, they can gain a foothold in the bacterial population that is further selected through continued use of the drug (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0023">23</link>). Several antimicrobials introduced in the 1980s and 1990s had reduced utility following mutational resistance in certain species. Resistance to fluoroquinolones among staphylococci rapidly emerged by the upregulation of NorA-mediated efflux (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0024">24</link>). Another example was the use of imipenem, which led to the selection of <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis> strains that have lost the OprD porin, which provides carbapenem-specific pores through the outer membrane (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0022">22</link>). Interestingly, the recent development of resistance to linezolid due to modification of the domain V of 23S rRNA (the binding site for linezolid) in <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> spp. has resulted in only infrequent resistance among clinical isolates (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0025">25</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0090s0000p0011">DNA transfer among bacteria primarily occurs via plasmids, some of which are self-transmissible, in that they carry genes to initiate the direct transfer to another bacterium. Many plasmids are large and are able to accommodate multiple resistance genes. These large transferable plasmids are the ideal vector for the dissemination of resistance genes because they can harbor and express multiple resistance determinants and often carry genes that self-promote their transfer to another bacterial cell. Within plasmids, resistance genes are often carried by transposons, which can transfer determinants between plasmids or transport them into and out of the chromosome (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0026">26</link>). In addition, resistant bacteria often contain integrons that have the capability to acquire and express resistance determinants behind a single promoter. They are widely distributed among Gram-negative bacteria, and are found within plasmids and transposons (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0026">26</link>). Very diverse resistance determinants have been found in integrons, including genes conferring resistance to trimethoprim and fosfomycin, efflux-mediated quinolone resistance, and MBL-mediated carbapenem resistance (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0027">27</link>–<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0029">29</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0012">The dissemination of plasmids, transposons, and integrons among bacterial pathogens has resulted in “gene epidemics” (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0023">23</link>). For example, the TEM-1 plasmid-mediated β-lactamase was first described in 1965 in an <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> isolate from a patient in Greece, but has since spread globally to multiple species. It has been found in up to 60% of clinical isolates of <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>, in a few <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>, and up to 50% of <emphasis>Haemophilus influenzae</emphasis> and <emphasis>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis> isolates (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0030">30</link>). There are probably multiple factors that determine whether or not a mobilized gene will spread widely, but these are not well understood. For example, the TEM-2 β-lactamase differs from TEM-1 by only a single amino acid substitution and provides an identical spectrum of resistance. It is also found on similar kinds of plasmids and transposons. However, TEM-2 is at least 10-fold less prevalent than TEM-1 in every region (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0030">30</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0013">Many of the resistance determinants now found on plasmids, integrons, and transposons are believed to have originated in the chromosomes of other bacterial species, a phenomenon that has been well documented in plasmid-mediated β-lactamases. The SHV-type β-lactamases are derived from the chromosomal β-lactamases of<emphasis>Klebsiella pneumoniae</emphasis>; plasmid-encoded AmpC enzymes expressed in <emphasis>K. pneumoniae</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> are nearly identical to chromosomal AmpC genes found in <emphasis>Enterobacter cloacae</emphasis> (ACT-1, MIR-1), <emphasis>Citrobacter freundii</emphasis> (CMY-type), <emphasis>Hafnia alvei</emphasis> (ACC-1), and <emphasis>Morganella morganii</emphasis> (DHA-1) and the very successful cefotaxime-hydrolyzing CTX-M-type ESBLs from <emphasis>Kluyvera</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0090s0000li0031">31</link>–<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0033">33</link>). In addition, many aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes found in pathogenic bacteria were determined to have originated in environmental species of <emphasis>Acinetobacter</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0034">34</link>). Tn<emphasis>916</emphasis> is an 18-kb element originally described for <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> but which has a very broad host range and is now found in multiple species of Gram-positive bacteria (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0035">35</link>). Tn<emphasis>916</emphasis> encodes the <emphasis>tet</emphasis>(M) resistance gene, which encodes resistance to tetracycline and minocycline. Many different Tn<emphasis>916</emphasis>-like transposons have now been described for enterococci and other organisms, and some of them, such as Tn<emphasis>1545</emphasis> from <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis>, harbor additional resistance genes (Tn<emphasis>1545</emphasis> conferring resistance to erythromycin and kanamycin) (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0035">35</link>). Transposons with structural similarity to Tn<emphasis>916</emphasis> have been implicated in the transfer of vancomycin resistance between strains of <emphasis>E. fae</emphasis><emphasis>cium</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0036">36</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0014">Many genes that are responsible for resistance to antibiotics that are natural products have migrated from the antibiotic-producing organisms (mostly streptomycetes), which have developed and retained these genes in order to protect themselves against their own by-products. For example, the<emphasis>erm</emphasis> determinants that methylate 23S rRNA and block binding of macrolides, lincosamides, and group B streptogramins to the target ribosome are thought to have originated with the natural antibiotic product-producing organism, <emphasis>Saccharopolyspora erythraea.</emphasis> Many plasmids, integrons, and transposons now carry multiple resistance genes conferring resistance to antibacterials of many different drug classes. Selection for any one of these resistance determinants will concurrently select for all of the resistance genes contained on this plasmid. A few bacterial genera such as alpha-hemolytic <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Haemophilus</emphasis> spp., and some <emphasis>Acinetobacter</emphasis> spp. are naturally transformable or competent and can absorb and incorporate fragments of DNA released by lysed organisms in close proximity, resulting in the creation of “mosaic” genes (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0090s0000li0038">38</link>).

        <para id="ch0090s0000p0015">Many antibiotic-modifying enzymes, including the β-lactamases, the aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs), and chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (CATs), have been described. Although these enzymes are in many cases acquired, some are intrinsic to certain genera. For example, chromosomal β-lactamases are intrinsic to many species of<emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> and nonfermenters. Expression of these enzymes is often only at a very low level, conferring low levels of resistance to early-generation β-lactams. In some bacterial species such as <emphasis>Enterobacter</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>, chromosomal β-lactamases are under regulatory control, resulting in high-level, broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0040">40</link>). In some instances, AMEs are also intrinsic to bacterial species, as in the case of the chromosomal acetyltransferases of <emphasis>Providencia stuartii</emphasis> and <emphasis>Serratia marcescens</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0090s0000li0042">42</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0016">Modifying enzymes can confer high levels of resistance to the antibiotics against which they have activity.

The degree of resistance conferred by target modifications is variable and may be dependent upon the ability of the mutated target to perform its normal function.

        <para id="ch0090s0000p0019">An antibiotic must reach its target within the bacterial cell in order to be effective. Therefore, for intracellular targets, barriers must be crossed by the antibiotic, and strengthening these barriers can be a highly effective mechanism of resistance. All Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane through which the antibiotic must traverse before the cytoplasmic membrane can be reached. As shown in<anchor id="ch0090s0000a0015"/><link linkend="ch0090s0000a0018">Fig. 1</link>, this is accomplished through water-filled channels formed by the OMPs.

Barriers to entry can also exist in the cytoplasmic membrane. Movement of aminoglycosides across the cytoplasmic (inner) membrane is an oxygen-dependent process, so these antibiotics are inactive in anaerobic environments (and hence against strictly anaerobic species) (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0049">49</link>).</para>

For example, resistance to imipenem in<emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> is contributed to reduced access through downregulation of OprD and production of AmpC β-lactamase (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0048">48</link>). Neither mechanism alone is sufficient to yield clinically significant levels of resistance, and both are required for high levels of resistance to result.</para>

        <para id="ch0090s0000p0021">Pathogenic bacteria contain efflux pumps that extrude toxins, dyes, and antibiotics from the cell. Several classes of pumps have been described for Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative bacteria. They may be quite selective, or they may have a broad substrate specificity. The majority of these pumps are located in the cytoplasmic membrane and use proton motive force to drive drug efflux. The major families of efflux transporters are (i) the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), which includes QacA and NorA/Bmr of Gram-positive bacteria and EmrB of<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>; (ii) the small multidrug resistance family, including Smr of <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> and EmrE of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>; and (iii) the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family, including AcrAB-TolC of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and MexAB-OprM of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0090s0000a0018">Fig. 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0050">50</link>). The ABC family differs from the other families in that they derive energy to drive active efflux from hydrolysis of ATP, whereas the other families derive energy from the proton gradient maintained at the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. In all of the families, the pump proteins that recognize the compounds and are responsible for this energy-dependent extrusion are situated in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Members of all pump families except RND pumps are found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and span only the cytoplasmic membrane. Depending on the context, all of the families can contribute to resistance in Gram-negative pathogens, but non-RND family pumps can only efflux compounds into the periplasmic space between the cytoplasmic and outer membrane and not to the outside of the cell.</para>

The general architecture of efflux pump families and placement in the Gram-negative cell envelope are shown. The Gram-negative envelope has two membranes: the inner membrane, shown here as a symmetrical bilayer in yellow, and the outer membrane, which is asymmetrical and has phospholipid (yellow) at the inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharide (pink) at the outer leaflet. Only the RND family pumps have an architecture that spans both membranes. Antibiotics (green) can enter the cells via water-filled porins and then are extruded by the efflux pump.</title>

        <para id="ch0090s0000p0022">The RND family of pumps, found only in Gram-negative bacteria, have additional components that consist of tripartite structures composed of the inner-membrane-located pump component, an outer membrane channel component (OMC), and a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP) that links these components to span both the inner and outer membranes (<link linkend="ch0090s0000a0018">Fig. 1</link>). Solving the crystal structure of this pump was a major achievement and revealed that there was a periplasmic opening in the pump that could allow passage of molecules, explaining the observation that RND pumps included β-lactam antibiotics (which do not enter the cytoplasm) among their substrates (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0051">51</link>). In addition, RND pumps are notable for their large binding pockets that have the ability to recognize and extrude a very broad range of structurally unrelated molecules, including antibiotics of many different classes, and are the most significant efflux pumps that contribute to resistance in Gram-negative pathogens (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0052">52</link>). RND pumps are typically named in the order “MFP-pump-OMC,” and the best-studied RND pumps are AcrA-AcrB-TolC (shortened to AcrAB-TolC) of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and MexAB-OprM of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa.</emphasis> In some instances, combinations of different types of pumps can result in higher levels of resistance than are achieved by the activity of a single pump alone (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0053">53</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0090s0000p0023">Resistance to aminoglycosides occurs by several different mechanisms that can coexist in the same bacterial cell. The most common resistance mechanisms among clinical isolates that affect the aminoglycosides are (i) enzymatic inactivation of the aminoglycoside molecules by AMEs; (ii) decreased uptake of the antimicrobial agent due to loss of cell permeability; (iii) extrusion of the antimicrobial agent from the cell by efflux pumps; and (iv) alterations in the ribosome that prevent binding of the aminoglycoside molecule, which include methylation by 16S rRNA methyltransferases (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0054">54</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0090s0000p0024">Among the mechanisms described above, AMEs and 16S rRNA methyltransferases are worrisome because they are usually carried as part of transferable genetic elements, such as integrons, plasmids, and transposons, that can spread among other bacteria (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0055">55</link>). In addition, they confer resistance to all aminoglycosides including plazomicin. Additionally, these genetic elements often harbor genes encoding resistance to other antimicrobial classes, including β-lactamases, quinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides, and chloramphenicol.</para>

        <para id="ch0090s0000p0025">Aminoglycoside inactivation by AMEs is the most important aminoglycoside resistance mechanism in terms of frequency (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0056">56</link>). AME genes are intrinsic among certain species and can be acquired by several other organisms which can include aerobic Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli, anaerobes, and <emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0055">55</link>). AMEs encode high resistance levels by catalyzing the covalent modification of different amino or hydroxyl groups in the aminoglycoside molecule, generating a product that poorly binds to the ribosome (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0057">57</link>). AMEs are grouped according to the type of modification that they catalyze and are designated aminoglycoside acetyltransferases (AACs), nucleotidyltransferases or adenyltransferases (ANTs), or phosphotransferases (APHs) (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0056">56</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0026">The nomenclature of the AMEs is complex, and there are two systems currently in use (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0055">55</link>). One system applies a three-letter identifier for the functional groups described above that is followed by a number in parentheses corresponding to the site of modification in the aminoglycoside molecule. A roman number to characterize the resistance profile encoded in the host follows a dash, and a lowercase letter is used as an individual identifier; e.g., <emphasis>aac(6</emphasis>′<emphasis>)-Ib</emphasis> is used for a gene encoding an acetyltransferase that acetylates position 6′, conferring the same resistance pattern as other AAC(6′)-I (gentamicin and/or amikacin resistance) enzymes, and is designated variant b. The other naming scheme also uses three-letter codes for the groups above (<emphasis>aac, aad</emphasis>, and <emphasis>aph</emphasis>), followed by a capital letter to identify the site of modification and a number as a unique identifier (e.g., <emphasis>aadA1</emphasis>, encoding a nucleotidyltransferase that modifies position A). Both naming conventions have advantages and disadvantages; however, a consensus scheme is needed to avoid confusion. This scheme should take into consideration the advent of sequencing techniques and the frequent absence of phenotypic characterization for recently described genes. <anchor id="ch0090s0000a0022"/><link linkend="ch0090s0000a0024">Table 1</link> summarizes the main classes and subclasses of AMEs, their clinical relevance, and their modifying substrate(s), when available. There are four major groups of acetyltransferases: AAC(<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0001">1</link>), AAC(<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0003">3</link>), AAC(2′), and AAC(6′), with the last named being the most common AME reported among aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0055">55</link>). Among AAC(6′) enzymes, AAC(6′)-Ib, encoded by <emphasis>aacA4</emphasis>, is very prevalent; at least 45 variants have been deposited in the NCBI database, with 32 of them named AAC(6′)-Ib despite different sequences (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0058">58</link>). It is noteworthy that one of these variants, named <emphasis>aac(6</emphasis>′<emphasis>)-Ib-cr</emphasis>, acetylates quinolone molecules in addition to aminoglycosides, resulting in resistance to both antimicrobial classes (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0059">59</link>). This enzyme has been reported to be prevalent among isolates worldwide (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0060">60</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0027">Seven major phosphotransferase classes have been described: APH(<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0004">4</link>), APH(<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0006">6</link>), APH(<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0009">9</link>), APH(3′), APH(2″), APH(3″), and APH(7″). Among those, APH(3′) is the most clinically relevant class, being responsible for acquired resistance to several aminoglycoside molecules among Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Among nucleotidyltransferase classes reported, ANT(<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0006">6</link>), ANT(<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0009">9</link>), ANT(4′), ANT(2″), and ANT(3″), the last two are the most important since they are often located in gene cassettes embedded in class 1 and 2 integrons carried by <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> and non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli. ANT(2″)-Ia, encoded by <emphasis>aadB</emphasis>, is the only variant in its class, and although several variants of ANT(3″) have been described, ANT(3″)-Ia, encoded by <emphasis>aadA1</emphasis>, is the most commonly reported (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0055">55</link>). Initial studies evaluating the occurrence of AMEs included the evaluation of the aminoglycoside resistance patterns and limited molecular characterization of these genes. More recently, with the broad use of sequencing methods and a better understanding of the complexity of the AME genes, inferences of the AMEs present in a bacterial isolate by its phenotypic profile became futile.</para>

        <para id="ch0090s0000p0032">β-Lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems) act by inhibiting PBPs, which are transpeptidases and transglycosylases that synthesize the peptidoglycan that composes the bacterial cell wall. PBPs are all members of a larger family of serine peptidases that includes most of the β-lactamases. β-Lactam molecules are structural analogues of the peptidyl-<phrase role="small">D</phrase>-alanyl–<phrase role="small">D</phrase>-alanine termini of peptidoglycan precursors, and mimic the natural substrates for PBPs (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0067">67</link>). PBPs and β-lactamases both interact with β-lactam antibiotics by catalytically hydrolyzing the β-lactam bond, resulting in a serine ester-linked acyl enzyme complex (<anchor id="ch0090s0000a0030"/><link linkend="ch0090s0000a0032">Fig. 2</link>). With β-lactamases, a water molecule hydrolyzes the ester linkage of the acyl enzyme intermediate, opening the ring and inactivating the drug molecule. It then releases the irreversibly damaged penicilloyl (or cephalosporyl) moiety and the active enzyme is regenerated. The complexes that are made between PBPs and β-lactams are more stable, having a very long turnover rate resulting in the functional inactivation of the PBP. The stability of this interaction allows identification of these proteins by binding to radiolabeled penicillin and is the genesis of their designation as PBPs (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0067">67</link>). Some PBPs are essential for cell viability (generally the high-molecular-weight transpeptidases and their partners, transglycosylases), whereas the low-molecular-weight carboxypeptidase PBPs are not. It has long been suspected that some PBPs are redundant and can perform the functions of others. Inhibition of PBPs interrupts cell wall synthesis, which by itself should inhibit cell growth, rather than kill the cell. However, the interaction of β-lactam molecules with PBPs triggers the activity of cell wall-degrading molecules known as autolysins, which degrade the existing cell wall, leading to cell death (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0068">68</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0033">Some bacterial species are intrinsically resistant to some β-lactam antibiotics by virtue of decreased PBP affinity. For example, enterococci are resistant to clinically achievable levels of cephalosporin antibiotics because of the presence of the low-affinity PBP 5. PBP-mediated resistance for normally susceptible bacteria takes several forms, including (i) overproduction of PBPs, (ii) acquisition of a foreign PBP with low affinity, (iii) recombination of a susceptible PBP with more resistant varieties, and (iv) point mutations within PBPs that lower affinity for the β-lactam antibiotic. PBP-mediated resistance is predominantly found in Gram-positive bacteria.</para>

Increasing the number of target molecules can, under the correct circumstances, result in resistance. Increased expression of a PBP as a mechanism of conferring resistance is relatively uncommon; however, it has been noted in some specific instances. For example, increased levels of methicillin resistance in<emphasis>mecA</emphasis> negative strains has been found in <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> strains overexpressing PBP 4.

PBP 2a is classified as a class B PBP, because it has a functional C-terminal transpeptidase domain but an N-terminal domain whose function has yet to be determined. This contrasts with class A PBPs, which have N termini with glycosyltransferase activities and C termini with transpeptidase activities. As a result, the transglycosylase domain of the naturally occurring <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> PBP 2 is required for expression of β-lactam resistance by PBP 2a (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0073">73</link>).</para>

The deduced amino acid sequences of the two enzymes exhibited 88% similarity across the entire protein and 91% identity within the transpeptidase domain. Expression of methicillin resistance in <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> is commonly under regulatory control, either by the product of the upstream <emphasis>mecI</emphasis> gene or in <emphasis>trans</emphasis> by the homologous <emphasis>blaI</emphasis> gene, which regulates the expression of the staphylococcal β-lactamase (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0075">75</link>).

The efficiency of induction varies with the mechanism (<emphasis>blaR1</emphasis>-<emphasis>blaI</emphasis>-mediated induction is faster), leading to complications in detecting the methicillin resistance phenotype. In fact, only a small minority of a resistant population may express high levels of resistance. Several techniques are used in the laboratory to enhance detection of this resistance, such as prolonged incubation, increased salt in the media, and susceptibility testing with cefoxitin. In addition, techniques have been developed to bypass phenotypic expression in favor of directly identifying the <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> gene or directly detecting PBP 2a (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0076">76</link>).</para>

These data indicate that minor perturbations of the normal processes prevent PBP 2a from functioning, suggesting that it is a very particular enzyme.

Several bacterial species have intrinsic, chromosomally encoded β-lactamases that can be either constitutively expressed or inducible. Many other β-lactamases represent acquired resistance and are carried on mobile genetic structures such as plasmids, transposons, and integrons that can be transferred among strains from the same species or other bacterial species. These mobile genetic elements often carry genes encoding resistance to additional, unrelated antimicrobial classes, conferring a multidrug resistance phenotype to their recipient.</para>

These proteins are synthesized as precursor proteins and exported from the cytoplasm by an amino-terminal signal peptide. After transport, the signal peptide of the β-lactamase is cleaved and the enzyme is released. In Gram-negative bacteria, β-lactamases are secreted into the periplasm, resulting in a concentration of these enzymes in a limited space and efficient interactions with the β-lactam molecules that penetrate the outer membrane. In Gram-positive bacteria, β-lactamase molecules are secreted into the surrounding environment, where they get diluted and have less impact in the resistance phenotype.</para>
          <para id="ch0090s0000p0046">There are two main types of β-lactamases based on their mechanism of action and molecular structure: serine- and MBL. Serine enzymes are diverse in structure and hydrolytic profile; however, all these enzymes hydrolyze β-lactams in a two-step reaction through a serine residue at the catalytic site. Initially, the negatively charged carboxylate group of the β-lactam molecule is attracted to the active site by the enzyme’s positively charged residues. There, the β-lactam is properly positioned, making key hydrogen bonding interactions with the enzyme (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0102">102</link>). Next, the β-lactam is acylated (<link linkend="ch0090s0000a0018">Fig. 1</link>), and a conserved serine residue (Ser70) serves as the reactive nucleophile in this acylation reaction. Then, a strategically positioned water molecule is activated, deacylating the β-lactam, and the active β-lactamase is regenerated.</para>
          <para id="ch0090s0000p0047">MBLs require two zinc atoms, which are bridged by a hydroxide ion that facilitates the nucleophile attack on the carbonyl oxygen atom of the β-lactam ring, leading to the hydrolysis of the molecule. One zinc atom is held in place by three histidine residues and a water molecule. Some MBLs contain a second zinc binding site. The two zinc binding sites function separately, with the primary zinc binding site assisted by the secondary site (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0103">103</link>).</para>

The Ambler classification separates β-lactamases into four distinct molecular classes (A to D) based on their amino acid sequence. Classes A, C, and D are serine β-lactamases, whereas class B comprises MBLs.

The two commonly encountered class A β-lactamases found in <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> are designated TEM-1 and SHV-1. TEM-1 and SHV-1 β-lactamases are primarily penicillinases with diminished activity against cephalosporin substrates. Prior to the emergence of ESBLs, TEM-1 was the primary cause of ampicillin resistance among <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and remains the highest contributor to penicillin resistance among <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae.</emphasis> High-level expression of TEM-1 has been associated with resistance to cephalosporins and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0106">106</link>). SHV-1-like enzymes are ubiquitous among <emphasis>K. pneumoniae</emphasis> isolates, and many are encoded by genes that have been incorporated into the chromosome.</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0051"><emphasis role="strong">Extended-spectrum β-lactamases.</emphasis> ESBLs are serine-β-lactamases belonging to Ambler class A and Bush-Jacoby-Medeiros group 2be. These enzymes hydrolyze narrow and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins in addition to penicillins. ESBLs are susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam and newer inhibitors such as avibactam. In the early ESBL definition, inhibition by a β-lactamase inhibitor was a main characteristic of this group, but in recent years, this requirement has been challenged by the diversity of the enzymes described that meet one or more of the characteristics of the ESBL group (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0107">107</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0052">The first occurrences of ESBL enzymes were TEM and SHV variants displaying amino acid substitutions that “expanded” or changed their substrate profile. Among the TEM family enzymes, five amino acid residues appear to be most important for conferring the ESBL phenotype: Gly238 and Ala237, located on the b3 β-pleated sheet; Arg164 and Asp179, located on the neck of the Ω loop; and Asp104, located directly across from G238 and A237 at the opening of the active-site cavity (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0102">102</link>). The replacement of Gly with Ser, Ala, or Asp at position 238 is a common mutation in both TEM- and SHV-type ESBLs. Both TEM- and SHV-type ESBLs were described in several countries, but slowly these enzymes’ importance diminished due to the worldwide dissemination of CTX-M-producing isolates.</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0053">First reported in the 1980s, CTX-M-type β-lactamases have spread worldwide and are now the most common ESBLs (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0108">108</link>). These enzymes can be divided into distinct clusters that are phylogenetically related (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0109">109</link>). There are five major groups of acquired CTX-M enzymes, for which the members of each group share &gt;94% identity (in contrast, ≤90% identity is observed between the members belonging to distinct groups). The groups are as follows: (i) the CTX-M-1 group includes enzymes CTX-M-1, -3, -10, -12, -15, -22, -23, and -28 and FEC-1; (ii) the CTX-M-2 group includes enzymes CTX-M-2, -4, -4L, -5, -6, -7, and -20 and Toho-1; (iii) CTX-M-8 (a singleton); (iv) the CTX-M-9 group includes enzymes CTX-M-9, -13, -14, -16, -17, -19, -21, -24, and -27 and Toho-2; and (v) the CTX-M-25 group includes enzymes CTX-M-25 and -26 (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0109">109</link>). In general, CTX-M β-lactamases hydrolyze cefotaxime and ceftriaxone better than ceftazidime. CTX-M-15 is able to hydrolyze ceftazidime at higher rates when compared to CTX-M-3 (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0110">110</link>).

Class C cephalosporinases acylate β-lactam antibiotics by the same mechanisms that are seen for class A enzymes; however, the catalytic event differs (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0125">125</link>).

These findings imply that not only the amounts of these enzymes produced, but also their sequences, influence the level of resistance to β-lactams.</para>
        <para id="ch0090s0000p0061">AmpC enzymes are particularly important in clinical isolates of<emphasis>C. freundii, K. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> because they are inducible in these species. AmpC basal expression is generally low but can be induced to high levels upon exposure to some β-lactams. In bacteria where AmpC is inducible, the <emphasis>ampC</emphasis> gene is accompanied by the repressor <emphasis>ampR</emphasis>, encoding a member of the LysR transcriptional regulator family. Repression and activation are closely linked to the processes of cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis and breakdown. Disruption of peptidoglycan synthesis following exposure to β-lactams causes accumulation of peptidoglycan fragments that dislodge oligopeptides of UDP-<emphasis>N</emphasis>-acetylmuramic acid normally bound to AmpR in its repressed state, causing a conformational change where AmpR then positively activates transcription of <emphasis>ampC.</emphasis> The activity of AmpR is controlled indirectly by the activities of AmpD, an <emphasis>N</emphasis>-acetyl-muramyl-<phrase role="small">L</phrase>-alanine amidase, and AmpG, an inner membrane permease, which are both involved in recycling of peptidoglycan intermediates (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0129">129</link>, <link linkend="ch0090s0000li0130">130</link>).

Under these circumstances, a constant high level of anhydro-MurNAc tripeptide is present in the cytoplasm, and AmpR constantly activates <emphasis>ampC</emphasis> transcription. Mutations in <emphasis>ampR</emphasis> causing AmpC hyperexpression have been reported but are not as common. The AmpR protein serves as both the repressor and the activator of <emphasis>ampC</emphasis> transcription and is a transcriptional regulator of the LysR family. AmpR acts as a repressor by interacting with UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide, a peptidoglycan precursor molecule. This prevents AmpR from binding to the <emphasis>ampR</emphasis> gene and subsequently activating <emphasis>ampC.</emphasis> When the concentrations of the cell wall breakdown product anhydro-MurNAc tripeptide (or anhydro-MurNAc pentapeptide) increase (as with exposure to certain antibiotics), the UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide is displaced from its site in AmpR, resulting in the conversion of AmpR to an activator of <emphasis>ampC</emphasis> transcription.</para>

Surprisingly, plasmid-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance determinants were characterized in the late 1990s (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0189">189</link>), and now they include at least three groups of genes that lead to (i) target protection (QnR family), (ii) efflux of these agents (Qep, OqxAB, and QacBIII), or (iii) modification of the molecule [Aac(6′)-Ib-cr]. Additionally, resistance to fluoroquinolones can be caused by alteration of permeability of the cell by decreased expression or loss of OMPs or overexpression of chromosomal efflux systems in Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.</para>

        <para id="ch0090s0000p0093">Tetracycline efflux proteins are all membrane associated and members of the MFS pumps. They expel tetracycline from the cell by exchanging a proton for a tetracycline-cation complex, preventing the intracellular accumulation of the tetracycline to a level sufficient to fully inhibit its ribosomal target. These MFS pumps are tetracycline-H<superscript>+</superscript> antiporters that operate through the exchange of a proton for the tetracycline molecule, which drives transport of the tetracycline against a chemical concentration gradient (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0217">217</link>). Examples of pumps that are commonly found in pathogenic bacteria are listed in <link linkend="ch0090s0000a0057">Table 3</link>. The tetracycline-specific efflux pumps are located in the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane of the bacterial cell. The pumps found in Gram-negative pathogens have 12 transmembrane-spanning regions and transport tetracyclines from the cytoplasm across the inner membrane into the periplasmic space (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0217">217</link>). Most of the time, tetracycline-specific efflux pump genes reside on mobile genetic elements and are horizontally acquired resistance determinants. The plasmid-encoded <emphasis>tet</emphasis>(A) was the first bacterial antibiotic efflux pump identified, in 1980, and is the most broadly distributed among important Gram-negative pathogens (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0217">217</link>). The genes encoding Tet(A) and Tet(B) efflux pumps were likely transferred from <emphasis>Streptomyces rimosus</emphasis>, which produces the natural product oxytetracycline to protect this antibiotic-producing organism from the effects of the tetracycline it manufactures (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0218">218</link>). Genes such as <emphasis>tet</emphasis>(A) are commonly included in cloning vector plasmids and are used as antibiotic selection markers for genetic engineering in bacteria. The genes encoding tetracycline-specific efflux pumps are usually accompanied by <emphasis>tet</emphasis>(R), which encodes a tetracycline responsive repressor that controls expression of the Tet(A) efflux pump through an inducible response to tetracycline exposure (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0219">219</link>). In Gram-negative bacteria, the Tet(R) protein represses the expression of <emphasis>tet</emphasis>(A) by binding to tandem operator sequences upstream of <emphasis>tet</emphasis>(A) as a homodimer and blocking expression (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0220">220</link>). Following the binding of tetracycline, Tet(R) dissociates from the DNA, allowing transcription of <emphasis>tet</emphasis>(A) to occur. The Gram-positive efflux genes are not associated with specific protein repressors, but sequence analysis suggests that these determinants may be regulated by mechanisms similar to translational attenuation (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0221">221</link>). In general, the efflux proteins confer resistance to tetracycline but do not affect minocycline and doxycycline (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0215">215</link>). The single exception to this rule is the Tet(B) protein of Gram-negative organisms, which confers resistance to both tetracycline and minocycline.</para>

They act by binding to the ribosome, thereby changing its conformation and inhibiting binding of tetracycline. Tet(M) and Tet(O) are the best characterized of these proteins. The genes encoding RPPs are widespread in bacteria, in many cases as a result of their incorporation into broad-host-range conjugative transposons (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0215">215</link>). Like the efflux proteins, RPPs are also upregulated in the presence of tetracyclines (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0222">222</link>). Plasmid-encoded <emphasis>tet</emphasis>(O) was first identified in a clinical isolate of <emphasis>Campylobacter jejuni</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0223">223</link>). The <emphasis>tet</emphasis>(O) gene shared similarity to <emphasis>otr</emphasis>(A), found in the tetracycline-producing organism <emphasis>Streptomyces rimosus</emphasis>, suggesting that ribosomal protection also likely originated as a mechanism to protect tetracycline-producing organisms (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0224">224</link>). RPPs are GTPases that exhibit homology to the elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0225">225</link>). RPPs bind to a site on the 50S ribosomal subunit similar to that used by EF-G and subsequently cause the tetracycline to be released from the ribosome (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0226">226</link>). Although the binding site for RPPs is distant from the tetracycline binding site on the 30S ribosomal mRNA, it is thought that the binding causes an overall conformational shift in the ribosome sufficient to dislodge bound tetracycline from the ribosome complex. Subsequently, this stimulates binding of tRNA to the A site, which also reduces rebinding of tetracycline (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0227">227</link>). Newer information using cryoelectron microscopy and modeling of Tet(O) and Tet(M) bound to the 70S ribosome suggested that RPPs may also directly block the binding site of tetracyclines located around residue C1054 of the 16SrRNA (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0228">228</link>, <link linkend="ch0090s0000li0229">229</link>).</para>

The most common mechanism of resistance to chloramphenicol is the production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (CATs), which inactivate chloramphenicol via acetylation. Chloramphenicol contains two hydroxyl groups that are acetylated in a reaction catalyzed by CAT, in which acetyl coenzyme A serves as the acyl donor. Initial acetylation occurs at the C-3 hydroxyl group to yield 3-acetoxy-chloramphenicol (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0260">260</link>). Following nonenzymatic rearrangement to 1-acetoxy-chloramphenicol and reacetylation, the 1,3-diacetoxy-chloramphenicol product is formed.

The folate pathway is essential for bacterial growth because it is required for the synthesis of building blocks of several amino acids and purines. The functionality of the folate pathway depends upon the availability of tetrahydrofolate, because bacteria are unable to absorb preformed folic acid and therefore must rely upon their ability to synthesize it. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are inhibitors of two enzymes (dihydropteroic acid synthase [DHPS] and dihydrofolate reductase [DHFR]) that act sequentially in the manufacture of tetrahydrofolate.

However, the large size of vancomycin exceeds the exclusion limits of the porins in the outer membranes of most Gram-negative bacteria; therefore, vancomycin cannot access the target in these species, which is located in the periplasmic space.

Polymyxins act via an initial interaction of the cationic peptide with negative charges on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that forms the outer leaflet of the Gram-negative outer membrane (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0394">394</link>). Binding of polymyxin is thought to displace the divalent cations Mg<superscript>2+</superscript> and Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> that cross-link adjacent LPS molecules. This disrupts the permeability barrier of the outer membrane, which in turn increases uptake of the polymyxin. <emphasis>Proteus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Providencia</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Serratia</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> spp., and some <emphasis>Enterobacter</emphasis> spp. have cell walls that prevent access of the drug to the cell membrane and display innately elevated MICs for polymyxins (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0395">395</link>).

      <para id="ch0090s0000p0148">Several mechanisms conferring resistance to fosfomycin have been described. The main mechanism of acquired fosfomycin resistance involves mutations in any of the chromosomally encoded target genes encoding the antibiotic transporters, resulting in the reduction of permeability of fosfomycin into the bacterial cell. In<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, fosfomycin uptake occurs via two main nutrient transporters, the glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (GlpT) and the G6P transporter (UhpT). Spontaneous mutations conferring various levels of fosfomycin resistance to <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and other <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> have been shown to occur in the structural transport genes (<emphasis>glpT</emphasis> and <emphasis>uhpT</emphasis>), transport regulatory genes (<emphasis>uhpA, uhpB</emphasis>, and <emphasis>uhpC</emphasis>), and genes involved in cAMP synthesis (<emphasis>cyaA, ptsI</emphasis>), all resulting in a decrease in antibiotic uptake (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0405">405</link>). Diminished activity of both transporters (GlpT and UhpT) is also evident when inactivation of cAMP-CRP occurs (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0405">405</link>, <link linkend="ch0090s0000li0406">406</link>). Mutations in both transporters are associated with a fitness cost in <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> because these species rely on G3P and G6P substrates for energy sources (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0405">405</link>, <link linkend="ch0090s0000li0406">406</link>). In <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>, uptake of fosfomycin occurs exclusively through the GlpT transporter, as the UhpT permease is absent in this organism (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0407">407</link>). Mutations occur in the gene encoding GlpT in <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>; however, these mutations do not appear to cause reduced fitness, most likely due to this species not relying on G3P as its sole carbon source, even in <emphasis>glpT</emphasis> wild-type strains. The high frequency of fosfomycin resistance mutations in <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> and the lack of fitness cost suggest that fosfomycin-resistant variants will likely occur <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> upon treatment with fosfomycin.</para>
      <para id="ch0090s0000p0149">Another chromosomal mutation causing fosfomycin resistance is modification of the antibiotic target, UDP-GlcNAc enolpyruvyl tranferase (MurA). Fosfomycin inactivates the MurA enzyme by irreversibly binding to the protein in a dose-dependent manner. In<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, mutation of the fosfomycin binding site in MurA, Cys115, results in resistance to fosfomycin. The mutation consists of a Cys115 substitution to Asp which prevents fosfomycin from binding to the active site, while the enzyme continues to retain full enzymatic activity (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0406">406</link>). Increased MurA levels in <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> correlate with fosfomycin MICs of up to 32 μg/ml at a low fitness cost. It has been shown that enhanced expression of the <emphasis>murA</emphasis> gene contributed to the acquisition of fosfomycin resistance in several <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> clinical isolates (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0408">408</link>).</para>

Modification of fosfomycin by pathogenic strains involves one of three different fosfomycin-hydrolyzing enyzmes (FosA, FosB, or FosX). The <emphasis>fosA</emphasis> gene found in Gram-negative bacteria mediates resistance through a 141-amino-acid-polypeptide, a glutathione transferase, which catalyzes the formation of a covalent bond between the sulfhydryl residue of the cysteine in glutathione and the C-1 of fosfomycin. The reaction results in opening of the epoxide ring of the fosfomycin molecule to form an inactive adduct. The reaction depends on glutathione, as mutants defective in glutathione biosynthesis are susceptible to the drug (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0410">410</link>). The FosB enzyme is an Mg-dependent <phrase role="small">L</phrase>-cysteine thiol transferase, and FosX is a, Mn-dependent epoxide hydrolase (<link linkend="ch0090s0000li0406">406</link>).</para>
