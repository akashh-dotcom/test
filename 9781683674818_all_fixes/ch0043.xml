        <para id="ch0043s0000p0001"><emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> and <emphasis>Erysipelothrix</emphasis> are genera of small, non-spore-forming, Gram-positive bacilli that include the opportunistic human pathogens <emphasis>Listeria monocytogenes</emphasis> and <emphasis>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae</emphasis>. These hardy species are found worldwide and cause significant diseases in domestic farm animals in addition to humans. <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> causes listeriosis, a primarily foodborne illness that can occur sporadically or in outbreaks linked to contaminated food products. Though <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> infections in immunocompetent people generally manifest as mild gastroenteritis, listeriosis is a severe, invasive disease in susceptible populations, capable of causing fetal loss and death in neonates, pregnant women, older adults, and people with cell-mediated immunodeficiencies. <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> is an uncommon cause of foodborne illness but a significant pathogen due to the impact and high mortality rate of listeriosis in vulnerable populations.</para>
        <para id="ch0043s0000p0002"><emphasis>E. rhusiopathiae</emphasis> is a comparatively minor human pathogen and cause of zoonotic disease. Infections are rare and usually linked to occupational exposure to animals. This species is the causative agent of erysipeloid, which is localized cellulitis that develops following cutaneous inoculation of the organism, most often on the fingers and hands. Less frequently, <emphasis>E. rhusiopathiae</emphasis> can cause diffuse cutaneous disease and invasive infections, including bacteremia and endocarditis.</para>
        <para id="ch0043s0000p0003">Both<emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. rhusiopathiae</emphasis> exhibit intrinsic resistance to antibiotics used in the empiric treatment of severe infections. Accurate identification of these less commonly encountered Gram-positive bacilli in the clinical microbiology laboratory is necessary to ensure the selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy for patients with invasive infections.</para>

      <para id="ch0043s0000p0004"><emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Bacilli, order Bacillales, and family <emphasis>Listeriaceae</emphasis>. The phylum Firmicutes contains Gram-positive organisms defined by their low G+C DNA content. Other genera of the order Bacillales related to <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> include <emphasis>Staphylococcus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0001">1</link>). Differences in 16S rRNA sequence and distinct branched-chain fatty acid profiles separate <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> from the morphologically similar genus <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0002">2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0043s0000p0005">Twenty-six species of<emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> have been described, which can be subdivided into two major groups based on genomic and phenotypic data: <emphasis>Listeria sensu stricto</emphasis>, comprising <emphasis>L. monocytogenes, L. innocua, L. ivanovii, L. seeligeri, L. marthii, L. welshimeri, L. farberi, L. immobilis,</emphasis> and <emphasis>L. cossartiae</emphasis>, and those species which belong to <emphasis>Listeria sensu lato</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0003">3</link>–<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0008">8</link>). A complete listing of <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> species is found in <anchor id="ch0043s0000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0043s0000a0009">Table 1</link>.</para>
      <para id="ch0043s0000p0006"><emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> was the first species described in the genus and remains the species most frequently encountered as a cause of human infection. It was identified at Cambridge University in 1926 as the causative agent of an outbreak in laboratory animals, which were noted to have peripheral monocytosis, and named <emphasis>Bacterium monocytogenes</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0009">9</link>). The genus was renamed <emphasis>Listerellahepatolytica</emphasis> and, finally, <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis>, in honor of Joseph Lister and his pioneering work in antiseptic practices (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0010">10</link>). In recent years, the genus has expanded with new species identified through environmental sampling, none of them pathogenic.</para>

      <para id="ch0043s0000p0007"><emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> species are Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming rods (0.5 to 2 μm by 0.4 to 0.5 μm) occurring singly or in short chains (<anchor id="ch0043s0000a0007"/><link linkend="ch0043s0000a0011">Fig. 1</link>).

Mycolic acids are not present, and branching is not observed. The optimal growth temperature is between 30 and 37°C, but the organism is notable for its ability to replicate within a wide temperature range (0 to 50°C). Growth is slower at 4°C, requiring several days for macroscopic colonies to appear on solid media.</para>
      <para id="ch0043s0000p0008">Catalase is positive, with rare exceptions (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0043s0000li0014">14</link>). Oxidase and indole are negative. Esculin is hydrolyzed within a few hours. Urea and gelatin tests are negative, and no H<subscript>2</subscript>S is produced. Methyl red and Voges-Proskauer tests are positive for organisms of the <emphasis>Listeria sensu stricto</emphasis> group. Species within <emphasis>Listeria sensu stricto</emphasis>, except the newly described species <emphasis>L. immobilis</emphasis>, are motile with peritrichous flagella. Motility is temperature dependent, with a characteristic “tumbling motility” observed at 20 to 28°C that is greatly diminished at 37°C. Members of <emphasis>Listeria sensu lato</emphasis>, except <emphasis>L. grayi</emphasis> and <emphasis>L. costaricensis</emphasis>, are nonmotile.</para>

      <para id="ch0043s0000p0009">All<emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> species can be found as saprophytes in the environment and can be isolated from soil, water, vegetation, and human-constructed surfaces (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0015">15</link>–<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0018">18</link>). Most species are nonpathogenic, and <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> accounts for nearly all infections attributed to the genus. Environmental exposure to <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> can lead to clinical disease or asymptomatic carriage in birds, fish, crustaceans, and mammals, including humans (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0019">19</link>–<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0021">21</link>). Ruminants are at particularly high risk of listeriosis, which can present as septicemia, encephalitis, or fetal loss (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0022">22</link>). In both humans and animals, the primary mode of transmission for <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> is ingestion. It is a potential contaminant of food products and food production facilities and equipment due to its ubiquity in the environment (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0023">23</link>). Efforts to control the organism are impeded by its ability to multiply at refrigeration temperatures and to endure environmental insults, including drying, elevated osmotic pressure, and extremes in pH (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0043s0000li0025">25</link>). Studies have shown <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> can be isolated from 3 to 7% of raw milk samples in the United States, making consumption of unpasteurized milk or milk products particularly risky (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0026">26</link>). However, food products can be contaminated at different points during production, including after pasteurization. Listeriosis is primarily associated with ready-to-eat foods not cooked by the consumer, including a variety of processed meats and fruits and vegetables, in addition to dairy products.</para>
      <para id="ch0043s0000p0010"><emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> can be transmitted vertically. Vertical transmission is most often transplacental, resulting from hematogenous spread of the organism and tropism for placental tissue (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0027">27</link>). The source of neonatal listeriosis with an onset 7 or more days after birth is less clear, but may involve exposure during delivery (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0028">28</link>). Health care-related transmission is also possible, and outbreaks of <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> have been reported in neonatal wards (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0043s0000li0029">29</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0043s0000p0011">Between 2011 and 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 21 outbreaks of listeriosis. However, reported<emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> gastrointestinal infection remains uncommon, with an incidence of approximately 0.3 cases per 100,000 population—the incidence of <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> or <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infection is &gt;50 times higher (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0030">30</link>). Most cases of gastrointestinal listeriosis are self-limiting and cannot be diagnosed with techniques commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories, so cases reported to public health authorities are likely artificially low. Despite its low prevalence, listeriosis is the third leading cause of death due to foodborne disease, and outbreaks are associated with significant loss of life. In the U.S., an outbreak of listeriosis from cantaloupes in 2011 resulted in 147 infections and 33 deaths (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0031">31</link>). It was the second deadliest foodborne outbreak in the U.S. since the advent of modern tracing, surpassed only by a listeriosis outbreak in 1985 associated with queso fresco that killed 52 people (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0032">32</link>). <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> is similarly the cause of the deadliest foodborne outbreak globally in recent times. An outbreak that began in South Africa in 2017 linked to contaminated “polony,” an inexpensive form of processed meat, sickened 1,060 people and resulted in the loss of 216 lives (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0033">33</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0043s0000p0012">Human infections due to other<emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> species are extremely rare.

      <para id="ch0043s0000p0013">The clinical presentation of an individual exposed to<emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> varies from asymptomatic to mild gastroenteritis to life-threatening illness, depending on a combination of factors that include bacterial virulence, inoculum size, and underlying host defenses (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0038">38</link>). Bacteremia, central nervous system infections, and maternal-fetal infections are the most common manifestations of severe <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> infections. The majority of nonpregnant patients who develop invasive listeriosis have one or more underlying immunosuppressive comorbidities, particularly impaired cell-mediated immunity (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0039">39</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0043s0000p0014">Bacteremia is the most common manifestation of severe listeriosis and can lead to focal infection.<emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> can cross the blood-brain barrier, and neurolisteriosis is the second most common form of invasive disease (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0040">40</link>). Neurolisteriosis presents as meningoencephalitis (84%), meningitis (13%), or, less commonly, a more localized central nervous system infection (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0039">39</link>). Average incubation times are 2 days for bacteremia and 9 days for neurolisteriosis (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0043s0000li0042">42</link>). The prognosis of invasive listeriosis is grim, with a 3-month mortality rate of 46% in patients with bacteremia and 30% in patients with neurolisteriosis. Outcomes in pregnant women and neonates are also poor: while seldom associated with maternal mortality, nearly one-quarter of cases of listeriosis in pregnancy result in fetal loss or newborn death (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0039">39</link>).</para>

Pregnancy-associated cases of invasive listeriosis have a long average incubation period of 27.5 days and typically present with nonspecific obstetrical signs or fetal loss, although the disease is generally mild in the mother herself (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0042">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0043s0000li0043">43</link>). The majority (82%) of patients experience major pregnancy complications, including fetal loss, preterm delivery, and neonatal listeriosis (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0039">39</link>). Neonatal listeriosis takes three forms: early-onset, late-onset, and, rarely, granulomatosis infantiseptica. Early-onset neonatal listeriosis is associated with preterm birth and presents within the first few days of life, commonly with acute respiratory distress and bacteremia or meningitis (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0028">28</link>). The majority of cases of neonatal listeriosis are early-onset (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0027">27</link>). Late-onset neonatal listeriosis occurs after day 7 of life and more commonly presents with meningitis (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0019">19</link>). Granulomatosis infantiseptica is a rapidly fatal disseminated infection present at birth, characterized by widespread micro abscesses and granulomas of the liver, spleen, and sometimes skin (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0044">45</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0043s0000p0016">Symptomatic<emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> infection in immunocompetent adults is typically a mild, self-limited febrile gastroenteritis. Gastrointestinal illness generally occurs following exposure to a high inoculum of the organism in contaminated food. Exposure to <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> likely occurs regularly despite the rarity of reported disease. Symptoms, if present, arise approximately 24 hours after exposure and include fever, watery/non-bloody diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, and pains in joints and muscles. Symptoms last an average of 2 days and typically resolve without treatment (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0038">38</link>). After exposure, transient stool carriage of <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> can occur in asymptomatic individuals and is notably more prevalent in patients receiving long-term treatment with gastric acid-suppressive medications (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0043s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0043s0000li0045">46</link>). Sporadic cases of <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> gastroenteritis are diagnosed infrequently outside of foodborne outbreaks but may occur more frequently in patients with underlying gastrointestinal disease (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0046">47</link>). <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> can be considered as a potential cause of febrile gastroenteritis in a patient, particularly when testing for more common stool pathogens is negative.</para>
      <para id="ch0043s0000p0017"><emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> is a rare cause of a variety of other focal infections, such as endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, typically through hematogenous spread (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0047">48</link>–<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0051">52</link>).

As with infections of <emphasis>E. rhusiopathiae</emphasis>, most cases occur in individuals with occupational risks, such as veterinarians and farmers exposed to animal products of conception (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0052">53</link>). These infections typically present with a papulopustular rash on the arms and hands, accompanied by fever, and are usually self-limited. Ocular infections are also possible through both direct inoculation and hematogenous spread (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0054">55</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0043s0000p0018"><emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> is an intracellular pathogen capable of both surviving phagocytosis and promoting its own internalization into a variety of nonphagocytic host cells (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0040">40</link>). Invasion of otherwise nonphagocytic cells is mediated by internalins, a family of bacterial surface proteins that promote receptor-mediated endocytosis. Each internalin binds to specific host cell receptors, which may partially explain the tropism of <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> for placental tissue and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0055">56</link>–<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0057">58</link>). After entry into host cells, <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> escapes the phagocytic vacuole using a combination of listeriolysin O, a pore-forming toxin, and phospholipase enzymes. Once in the cytoplasm, <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> is notable for its ability to polymerize actin using the ActA protein, forming characteristic “actin comet” structures that propel the bacterium through the cell and allow spread directly to neighboring cells (<link linkend="ch0043s0000li0058">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0043s0000li0059">60</link>).

They are facultatively anaerobic and catalase negative and ferment glucose weakly without the production of gas. <emphasis>E. rhusiopathiae</emphasis> is the only species encountered clinically. On Gram stain, bacteria may assume a range of morphologies from slender and short (0.2 to 0.4 μm by 0.8 to 2.5 μm), to coccobacillary, to long, nonbranching filaments (60 μm or longer). Individual cells may be straight or slightly curved and arranged singly, in short chains, or in “V” shapes.

      <para id="ch0043s0000p0041">On solid media, colonies generally develop in 1 to 3 days, with pinpoint growth (&lt;0.1 to 0.5 mm in diameter) at 24 hours. As colonies mature, two morphologies are possible: rough (R-form) and smooth (S-form). With the S-form, colonies are small (0.3 to 1.5 mm in diameter), convex, transparent with a smooth glistening surface, and circular with an entire edge. With the R-form, colonies are larger, flatter, and more opaque, with a matte, uneven surface, and have an irregular edge. The R-form is favored by growth at higher temperatures (37°C) and the S-form by growth at lower temperatures (30°C). On blood agar, colonies are frequently alpha-hemolytic after 48 hours of incubation. Bacteria from smooth colonies are typically small, straight, or slightly curved Gram-positive bacilli and may even appear coccobacillary.

Care should be taken to cleanse and disinfect the skin before sampling, as <emphasis>E. rhusiopathiae</emphasis> is difficult to isolate from polymicrobial specimens due to its small colony size and slow growth rate. The organisms typically are located deep in the subcutaneous layer of the leading edge of the lesion; hence, a biopsy of the entire thickness of the dermis at the periphery of the lesion should be taken for Gram stain and culture. Swabs from the surface of the skin are not useful. In disseminated disease, the organism can be cultured from blood in standard blood culture bottles or from tissue biopsy or aspirates of the infected body site. Standard procedures should be followed for the transport and storage of specimens.</para>
