      <para id="ch0119s0001p0002">This chapter focuses on the viruses capable of causing viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) from two taxa, the families<emphasis>Arenaviridae</emphasis> and <emphasis>Filoviridae.</emphasis> Some, but not all, members of these virus families can cause severe VHF with high mortality in localized areas of the world. Although disease due to these viruses is uncommon in North America, these viruses have the potential of being introduced into countries where they are not endemic, either intentionally during acts of bioterrorism or unintentionally by travelers returning from areas of endemicity in Africa and South America, where they remain an important public health threat. Filoviruses and arenaviruses have been associated with serious health care-related outbreaks involving health care workers and laboratory personnel, especially in settings where infection control has been suboptimal. The implementation of enhanced infection control practices is recommended, such as isolation of patients; use of appropriate personal protective equipment that fully covers skin, clothing, and mucous membranes by individuals trained in appropriate donning and doffing procedures; and respirator use if aerosol-generating procedures are unavoidable, to prevent virus spread within the medical care setting and to minimize risks to health care workers. However, implementation of these infection control measures may be more challenging in low-resource settings compared to high-resource settings, such as the United States or Europe. Progress in the availability of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for human disease caused by arenaviruses and filoviruses has been made in recent years, particularly with the new availability of vaccines and treatments for Ebola virus disease, although much work remains to mitigate the threats posed by these pathogens.</para>
      <para id="ch0119s0001p0003">Continuing detection and isolation of new arenavirus and filovirus species from new geographic locations remains important for public health. The similarity of initial isolation, general clinical management, and viral diagnostic procedures for patients with suspected arenavirus or filovirus infections is the rationale for grouping these taxonomically distinct viruses in this chapter, although once the causative virus is identified, pathogen-specific treatment may additionally be indicated. Viruses from other taxonomic families, including<emphasis>Bunyaviridae</emphasis> and <emphasis>Flaviviridae</emphasis> (<ulink url="ch0117#ch0117s0001">chapters 98</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0118#ch0118s0001">99</ulink>), have also been associated with VHF.</para>

      <para id="ch0119s0002p0001">The family<emphasis>Arenaviridae</emphasis> comprises 54 named enveloped viruses with two or three segmented, ambisense, single-stranded RNA genomes which have unique morphologic and physiochemical characteristics (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0001">1</link>). Arenaviruses are divided into four genera based on the type of animal infected: viruses in the <emphasis>Antennavirus</emphasis> genus infect fish and have three genome segments; viruses in the <emphasis>Hartmanivirus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Reptarenavirus</emphasis> genera infect snakes and have two genome segments; and viruses in the <emphasis>Mammarenavirus</emphasis> genus infect mammals and have two genome segments. Arenaviruses that infect humans are classified in the <emphasis>Mammarenavirus</emphasis> genus (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0001">1</link>). Antigenic relationships are established mainly on the basis of broadly reactive antibody binding assays, including complement fixation, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0002">2</link>). Both serologic and phylogenetic analyses of the viruses divide the mammarenaviruses into two complexes. Multiple other mammarenaviruses have been identified, but not yet classified. The Lassa-lymphocytic choriomeningitis, or Old World, complex contains four viruses associated with human disease: lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0003">3</link>), Lassa virus (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0004">4</link>), Lujo virus (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0005">5</link>), and the Cardamones variant of Wenzhou virus (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0006">6</link>), along with many viruses not currently known to cause human disease: Mopeia (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0007">7</link>), Mobala (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0008">8</link>), Ippy (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0009">9</link>), Merino Walk (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0010">10</link>), Morogoro (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0011">11</link>), Kodoko (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0012">12</link>), Luna (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0013">13</link>), Lunk (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0014">14</link>), Luli (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0001">1</link>), Souris (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0001">1</link>), Solwezi (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0001">1</link>), Gairo (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0015">15</link>), Mariental (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0016">16</link>), Okahandja (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0016">16</link>), Wenzhou (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0017">17</link>), Lijiāng (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0018">18</link>), Loei River (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0006">6</link>), Alxa (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0018">18</link>), and Kitale (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0019">19</link>) viruses.

These viruses are further subdivided into three clades, with a fourth clade being considered, based on the N protein gene sequence (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0046">46</link>). Some of the viruses have not yet been isolated and are known only from molecular sequence data. All the rodent isolates of New World complex viruses have been from rodents of the family <emphasis>Cricetidae</emphasis> subfamily <emphasis>Sigmodontinae</emphasis>, while Tacaribe virus was originally isolated from bats and has been isolated from a single mosquito pool (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0020">20</link>) and from <emphasis>Amblyomma americanum</emphasis> (Lone Star) ticks (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0047">47</link>), although the reservoir of Tacaribe virus remains unclear. The Old and New World arenavirus complexes are distantly related; only when very high-titer antisera are used can cross-reactions be observed. Monoclonal antibodies with specificities for structural proteins of arenaviruses suggest that the N protein is the group-reactive determinant, whereas the envelope glycoproteins (G1 and G2) are responsible for type specificity (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0048">48</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0119s0002p0002">The morphology of arenaviruses is distinctive in thin-section electron microscopy (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0049">49</link>) and was the basis for first associating LCMV with Machupo virus and ultimately associating these viruses with all the viruses in the present family. Three major virion structural proteins are usually found (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0048">48</link>). The virus glycoprotein precursor is processed into two glycoproteins, G1 (50,000 to 72,000 Da) and G2 (31,000 to 41,000 Da), which constitute the virion envelope and spikes and which both serve as highly type-specific neutralization targets. In addition, a stable signal peptide is retained as an essential subunit in the mature glycoprotein complex on mammarenaviruses and hartmaniviruses (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0051">51</link>). The third major protein is the N protein (63,000 to 72,000 Da), which is clearly associated with the virion RNA and is considered the nucleocapsid protein. Four RNA species can be isolated from intact arenavirus virions. Two are virus specific and are ambisense in coding strategy: the small (S) RNA (22S) (encoding the N protein and virus glycoprotein precursor) and the large (L) RNA (31S) (encoding the viral L polymerase and the Z protein, a transcriptional regulatory element that also mediates assembly and budding of virions) (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0002">2</link>). In addition, ribosomal 28S and 18S species are isolated in virions in different proportions depending on external conditions.</para>
      <para id="ch0119s0002p0003">Arenaviruses mature by budding at the cytoplasmic membrane, and host proteins are incorporated into the virion envelope. Vero cells infected with each of the viruses contain distinctive intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, immunoreactive with anti-N but not anti-G1 or anti-G2 antibody. All arenaviruses are readily inactivated by ethyl ether, chloroform, sodium deoxycholate, and acidic media (pH less than 5). β-Propiolactone (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0052">52</link>) and gamma irradiation (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0053">53</link>) are both reported to inactivate arenavirus infectivity while preserving reactivity in standard serologic tests.

The virion shape may vary, but is usually filamentous. Six genera have been identified within the <emphasis>Filoviridae</emphasis> family, although only viruses in two genera, <emphasis>Ebolavirus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Marburgvirus</emphasis>, are known to infect humans.</para>
        <para id="ch0119s0002s0001p0002">Ebolaviruses and marburgviruses have a common morphology and similar genomic organization and complement of structural proteins (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0056">56</link>). Viral RNAs are approximately 19 kb long and 4.0 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> to 4.5 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> Da and encode at least seven virus-specific structural proteins, expressed from seven genes (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0056">56</link>). For ebolaviruses, the ribonucleoprotein complex contains L (180 kDa), N (104 kDa), VP30 (30 kDa), and VP35 (35 kDa) in loose association. L is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and VP35 may play a role similar to the P protein of paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses. GP (125 kDa) is the major spike protein; VP40 (a matrix protein) plus VP24 make up the remaining protein content of the multilayered envelope (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0056">56</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0057">57</link>). The GP of ebolaviruses and marburgviruses can be differentiated by the presence or absence of <emphasis>N</emphasis>- and <emphasis>O</emphasis>-linked glycans and by the lack, in marburgviruses, of the second open reading frame coding for the small/soluble glycoprotein expressed during ebolavirus infection <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> and <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0056">56</link>).

        <para id="ch0119s0003s0001p0001">Marburg and Ebola hemorrhagic fevers are now referred to as Marburg virus disease (MVD) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) because fewer than 50% of confirmed patients present with any kind of hemorrhage. Marburg virus was first recognized in 1967, when 31 people in Germany and Yugoslavia became infected following contact with monkey kidneys or primary tissue cultures derived from monkeys imported from Uganda, or providing care to or performing pathological exams on patients who became ill from direct contact with infected animals or tissue cultures (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0073">73</link>). Ebolaviruses first emerged in two major disease outbreaks, which occurred almost simultaneously in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Sudan (now South Sudan) in 1976. Despite their simultaneous emergence, these viruses were later shown to be two distinct viruses (now known as EBOV and SUDV), based on serologic and sequence analysis criteria (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0056">56</link>). In 1989 and 1990, RESTV was isolated from cynomolgus monkeys being held in quarantine in Reston, VA, and Perkasie, PA, following their importation from the Philippines (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0074">74</link>), while in 1994, the only known human infection with TAFV occurred in a veterinarian investigating deaths among chimpanzees in Côte d’Ivoire who survived the illness (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0075">75</link>). From 1995 to 2005, EBOV emerged sporadically in Zaire (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Gabon, and the Republic of Congo, with some human cases associated with exposure to infected non-human primates (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0077">77</link>). The emergence of SUDV has thus far been restricted to Uganda and southern Sudan (South Sudan), causing outbreaks in 2000 (425 cases), in 2004 (17 cases), and in a series of small clusters in 2011, 2012, and 2013 (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0078">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0079">79</link>). An outbreak due to marburgviruses, both MARV and RAVV, involving gold miners and secondary contacts, started in 1998 and continued into 2000 in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0056">56</link>) and was linked to bats found in that mine, based on reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and serology (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0080">80</link>). The highest seroprevalence was found in the cave-dwelling Egyptian rousette bat (species <emphasis>Rousettus aegyptiacus</emphasis>). The largest known outbreak of MVD occurred in 2005 in Uige, northern Angola, causing 252 cases with 227 deaths (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0082">82</link>). The source of the outbreak was not determined.</para>
        <para id="ch0119s0003s0001p0002">In 2005, Ebola virus RT-PCR-positive fruit bats were found in Gabon (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0083">83</link>), the first time genetic material for any ebolavirus was found in a bat. In 2007 and 2008, EBOV was responsible for two small outbreaks in Kasai-Occidental (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0084">84</link>). In 2007, a new distinct ebolavirus, BDBV, was isolated during an outbreak centered in and around Bundibugyo in western Uganda, where 131 suspected, probable, or confirmed cases were reported from August to December 2007 (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0085">85</link>). In 2008, RESTV was isolated from swine tissues during the laboratory investigation of samples from a 2007 outbreak of high-mortality disease in swine in farms in the Philippines, which was thought to be atypical porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0086">86</link>). PRRS and Circo 2 viruses were also isolated from the swine, leaving it unclear to what extent RESTV contributed to the disease symptoms. The exact role of RESTV in the clinical process is still unclear. In 2011, RESTV was detected by RT-PCR in piglets in Shanghai, China, as part of routine screening efforts for PRRS virus (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0087">87</link>). This finding may be indicative of continued maintenance of RESTV in pigs, with possible distribution to other countries through trade. Experimental infections of swine with RESTV isolated from Philippine pigs did not cause clinically notable disease, although the virus was shed and detectable antibodies developed in experimental infections in the laboratory (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0088">88</link>). In contrast, another study found that experimental infection of young pigs with RESTV produced clinical illness (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0089">89</link>). This virus species appears to be less virulent for humans than are other filovirus species, since in 1990, four workers at a U.S. quarantine facility were found to have antibody to RESTV without having experienced disease (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0090">90</link>), and several slaughterhouse and pig farm workers from the outbreak in the Philippines were also found with RESTV antibodies without associated clinical disease (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0091">91</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0119s0003s0001p0003">In 2007, four workers from a lead ore mine near Ibanda, Uganda, were infected with marburgviruses, three with MARV and one with RAVV. Two patients died, and the subsequent investigations led to the detection of marburgvirus RT-PCR-positive Egyptian rousette fruit bats and, for the first time, the isolation of both marburgviruses from this potential reservoir (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0092">92</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0093">93</link>). In 2008, MVD was diagnosed in two tourists infected with MARV who independently visited the same Egyptian rousette bat-inhabited cave (Python Cave, Queen Elizabeth National Park) in western Uganda. The first case was a Dutch woman who subsequently died of MVD in the Netherlands (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0094">94</link>). The second patient was an American woman from Colorado who, following hospitalization in the United States, recovered and was diagnosed retrospectively (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0095">95</link>). Through 2018, a total of 21 marburgvirus isolates have been obtained directly from Egyptian rousette bats caught in Uganda. A single case of EVD associated with SUDV was reported in 2011 in Uganda (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0096">96</link>), but in 2012, four unrelated outbreaks occurred: SUDV in Kibaale district (Uganda) in July and August, BDBV in Isiro (Democratic Republic of the Congo) from August to October, MARV in Kabale (Uganda) in October and November, and SUDV in Luwero (Uganda) in November (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0097">97</link>). In early 2014, the Guinean Ministry of Health reported an outbreak of EVD in the forest region of the country. This outbreak, caused by EBOV, quickly became the biggest outbreak ever, causing more than 28,000 confirmed and probable cases primarily in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. For the first time, multiple public health institutions and research laboratories deployed and supported mobile laboratories for rapid diagnostic detection of EVD in all the affected countries. There were multiple medical evacuations of infected medical responders to Europe and the United States, as well as infected travelers sometimes causing secondary cases in Senegal, Mali, Nigeria, and the United States (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0098">98</link>). Multiple health care workers in developed countries, including the United States, became infected. In response, the CDC defined multiple tiers of hospital readiness, consisting of (i) frontline health care facilities, (ii) Ebola assessment hospitals, and (iii) Ebola treatment centers. Ultimately, 81 facilities in the United States were evaluated for their readiness to care for EVD patients, resulting in the certification of 55 hospitals by state health departments as Ebola treatment centers. In 2017, four cases of MVD were identified as a family cluster in Kween (Uganda), although no transmission occurred outside of the affected family. In 2017 and 2018, EVD (caused by EBOV) reemerged three times in separate outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Bas Uélé, Équateur, and Nord-Kivu provinces, respectively. While the outbreaks in Bas Uélé (8 cases, 4 deaths) and Équateur (54 cases, 33 deaths) provinces lasted only a few months, the outbreak in North Kivu lasted until 2021, causing 3,470 cases and 2,287 deaths. Outbreaks due to EBOV emerged again in Équateur (130 cases, 55 deaths) and North Kivu (12 cases, 6 deaths) provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo again in 2020 and 2021, respectively, with concern in both outbreaks that some cases might have resulted from sexual transmission or relapse of a previous EVD survivor (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0099">99</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0101">101</link>). A separate outbreak of EBOV occurred in Guinea in 2021, causing 23 cases and 12 deaths, with genetic analysis demonstrating a resurgence of EBOV from the 2013–2016 outbreak rather than a new animal-to-human spillover event (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0101">101</link>). In 2020, MARV was found to be circulating in bats in West Africa, and the first human case of MVD acquired in West Africa was reported in 2021 from Guinea (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0102">102</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0103">103</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0119s0003s0002p0001">Human infection with filoviruses and arenaviruses can cause a wide spectrum of illness. Symptomatic patients with filovirus or arenavirus infections often present with similar, nonspecific clinical signs resembling malaria, typhoid fever, and many arboviral infections. Signs and symptoms during the initial prodromal phase are nonspecific, and bleeding manifestations usually do not develop until the second week of illness, if they develop at all. Asymptomatic infection with EBOV and arenaviruses, including those that can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality such as Lassa virus, Junín virus, and Machupo virus, have been described. A detailed travel and exposure history, coupled with a high index of suspicion and use of definitive diagnostic virologic tools, should facilitate rapid diagnosis and the timely implementation of appropriate patient isolation, clinical management procedures, and public health measures.

        <para id="ch0119s0003s0003p0001">Among the known arenavirus human pathogens, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) produces the least severe infection (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0104">104</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0106">106</link>), although severe cases have been reported, especially among immunocompromised individuals. A modest proportion of LCMV infections are subclinical or asymptomatic. A “typical” LCMV case is usually heralded by fever, myalgia, retro-orbital headache, weakness, and anorexia. During the first week, prominent symptoms may include sore throat, chills, vomiting, cough, retrosternal pain, and arthralgia. Rash occurs but is infrequent. Symptoms often resolve after several days; however, a biphasic febrile disease can recur in approximately one-third of patients, coinciding with the onset of frank neurologic involvement, usually aseptic meningitis but less frequently meningoencephalitis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis. Fatal disease is rare among immunocompetent patients, even among patients with neurological manifestations, and the majority of patients recover, although full symptom resolution may take weeks to months. Disease outside of the nervous system may occur, although it is uncommon. <emphasis>In utero</emphasis> infections with LCMV are a cause of significant birth defects of the central nervous system, hydrocephalus, and ocular system abnormalities, often resulting in long-term disability, and can lead to spontaneous abortion (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0107">107</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0109">109</link>). Disease manifestations in other organ systems are often absent in congenital LCMV infection. Fatal forms of LCMV infections have been reported in several clusters following transplantation of organs from LCMV-infected donors to immunosuppressed recipients (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0110">110</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0112">112</link>).</para>

Symptomatic Lassa virus infection, known as Lassa fever, often develops gradually, beginning with fever, myalgia, and malaise in the first few days followed by the development of sore throat, pain in the abdomen, back, chest, or joints, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Pharyngitis, usually exudative in nature, has been observed in 70% of hospitalized patients (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0113">113</link>). Severe illness often develops towards the end of the first week of symptoms or in the second week of illness. Dizziness, difficulty breathing, cough, swelling of the face, tinnitus, and painful urination may develop. Pleural and pericardial effusions with friction rub frequently occur. A maculopapular rash may develop, but frank hemorrhage is seen in only a proportion of the more severe cases. Bleeding from puncture sites and mucous membranes and melena are more common. Severe cases may develop neurological symptoms, including tremors, seizures, and decreased consciousness. Focal hearing loss may also occur. Among survivors, recovery usually begins in the second or third week after symptom onset. Approximately 30% of hospitalized patients die (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0114">114</link>), usually as a result of sudden cardiovascular collapse resulting from hepatic, pulmonary, and myocardial failure. Lassa fever is associated with particularly severe disease course among pregnant women, for whom mortality rates are somewhat higher. The disease course in children is similar to that in adults, although infants can present with a distinct “swollen-baby syndrome,” characterized by anasarca, abdominal distension, and bleeding associated with high mortality (83%) (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0115">115</link>). Clinical laboratory studies are not usually helpful for differentiating Lassa fever from other conditions found in regions of endemicity; specific virologic testing is required, especially in a setting where Lassa fever is less common or when mild, atypical presentations are suspected. Testing for Lassa fever may be limited outside of settings of endemicity. In the United States, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified assays for Lassa fever are not available.</para>
        <para id="ch0119s0003s0003p0003">The clinical pictures for New World arenaviruses associated with hemorrhagic fever manifestations are well characterized for Junín and Machupo viruses, although less information is available on disease manifestations due to Guanarito, Sabia, and Chapare viruses, due to only a small number of cases of each identified to date. However, these five arenavirus infections are sufficiently similar to each other to be summarized as a single entity, South American or New World arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers. Incubation periods range from 3 to 21 days, and existing information suggests that asymptomatic infection is uncommon. Following gradual onset of fever, anorexia, myalgia, headaches, and malaise over several days, gastrointestinal symptoms, conjunctivitis, dizziness, and bleeding symptoms, such as gingival bleeding and petechiae, develop. Difficulty swallowing, tonsillar exudates, and cough have been described among patients with Guanarito virus infection, although not with Junín, Machupo, Sabia, and Chapare virus infections. During the second week of illness, clinical improvement may begin or complications may develop. A minority of infected individuals develop neurological manifestations in the second week of illness, including ataxia, tremors, decreased reflexes or muscle tone, seizures, and coma. Hemorrhagic complications include extensive petechial hemorrhages, blood oozing from puncture wounds, melena, and hematemesis. These manifestations of capillary damage and thrombocytopenia do not result in life-threatening blood loss. However, hypotension and shock may develop, leading to death. Survivors begin to show improvement by the third week. Recovery is slow; weakness, fatigue, and mental difficulties may last for weeks. A “late neurologic syndrome” can develop after apparent recovery, which includes headache, cerebellar deficits, and cranial nerve palsies manifesting in symptoms such as double vision, blurry vision, tinnitus, or ataxia. Although the exact mechanism of late neurological syndrome symptoms is unclear, evidence to date suggests a role for direct viral infection of the brain and astroglia reaction in symptom development (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0116">116</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0119">119</link>). Late neurological syndrome is most commonly described among patients with Junín virus infection, in which up to 11% of patients treated with convalescent plasma develop late neurological syndrome (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0120">120</link>). In contrast to Lassa fever, clinical laboratory studies are frequently useful. Total leukocyte counts usually fall to 1,000 to 2,000 cells/mm<superscript>3</superscript>, although the differential remains normal. Platelet counts fall precipitously, usually to between 25,000 and 100,000/mm<superscript>3.</superscript> Routine clotting parameters are usually normal or slightly abnormal; however, patients with severe cases may show evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.</para>
        <para id="ch0119s0003s0003p0004">In the single Lujo virus outbreak in southern Africa, involving five confirmed cases in 2008, the patients presented with febrile illness following an incubation ranging from 7 to 13 days (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0121">121</link>). Four of the five cases represented human-to-human spread. The clinical symptom presentation resembles that described for Lassa fever, although symptom onset for Lujo virus infection is described as sudden rather than gradual. Initial symptoms including fever, headache, myalgia, sore throat, and malaise are followed by gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding symptoms (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0121">121</link>). A morbilliform rash was evident in four patients on days 6 to 8 of illness (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0069">69</link>). In the four fatal cases, the disease course was biphasic. The second phase, starting around 1 week post symptom onset, was characterized by a rapid deterioration with significant edema, respiratory distress, neurological signs, and circulatory collapse. All patients had thrombocytopenia on admission to hospital (platelet count range, 20 × 10<superscript>9</superscript> to 104 × 10<superscript>9</superscript>/liter). Three patients had normal white cell counts, and two had leukopenia on admission, while four developed leukocytosis during the illness.

        <para id="ch0119s0003s0004p0001">EVD and MVD cases are clinically similar, although the frequencies of reported signs and symptoms vary among individuals. Both EBOV and MARV can cause a spectrum of disease manifestations, including asymptomatic infection and nonspecific febrile illness in the absence of hemorrhagic manifestations (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0123">123</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0126">126</link>); however, the classic hemorrhagic fever disease course of EVD and MVD is outlined as follows. Following incubation periods of 2 to 21 days, onset is sudden and is marked by fever, chills, headache, anorexia, and myalgia. These signs are soon followed by nausea, vomiting, sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Cough, dyspnea, hiccups, or localized pain may also occur. When first examined, patients are usually overtly ill, dehydrated, apathetic, and disoriented. Pharyngeal and conjunctival injection is usual. Within several days, a characteristic maculopapular rash over the trunk, petechiae, and mucous membrane hemorrhages can appear. Gastrointestinal bleeding, accompanied by intense epigastric pain, is common, as are petechiae and bleeding from puncture wounds and mucous membranes. In the West Africa EVD outbreak, hemorrhages were less frequent, but profuse diarrhea was frequently observed and was responsible for severe dehydration (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0127">127</link>). High titers of EBOV are found in bodily fluids, including blood and diarrheal stool, and present a major risk factor for environmental contamination and those caring for EVD patients. Shock develops shortly before death, often 6 to 16 days after the onset of illness. Abnormalities in coagulation parameters include fibrin split products and prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, suggesting that disseminated intravascular coagulation is typically a terminal event and is usually associated with multiorgan failure (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0128">128</link>). Clinical laboratory studies usually reveal profound leukopenia early, and sometimes moderately elevated at a later stage. Platelet counts decline to 50,000 to 100,000/mm<superscript>3</superscript> during the hemorrhagic phase. Severe hypokalemia can be seen when profuse vomiting and diarrhea are seen.</para>
        <para id="ch0119s0003s0004p0002">In fatal filovirus infections, disseminated infection and necrosis in major organs such as liver, spleen, lung, kidney, skin, and gonads are extensive. Extensive hepatocellular necrosis associated with the formation of characteristic viral inclusion is seen in fatal Ebola virus infections. Lymphoid depletion, microvascular infection, and injury are seen in all filovirus infections. Abundant antigens and nucleic acids can be seen in all major organs by using immunohistochemistry and<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization (<anchor id="ch0119s0003s0004a0003"/><link linkend="ch0119s0003s0004a0006">Fig. 2</link> and <anchor id="ch0119s0003s0004a0004"/><link linkend="ch0119s0003s0004a0008">3</link>).

For laboratories, basic guidance written for EBOV, but applicable to other high-consequence pathogens, can be found at <ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/laboratories/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/laboratories/index.html</ulink>. However, for the arenavirus LCMV, diagnostic specimens and cell culture manipulations are performed at BSL-2, while procedures that might generate aerosols of concentrated virus are performed at BSL-3 (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0147">147</link>). Most of these viruses are also classified in the United States as select agents by the Department of Health and Human Services and should be handled as such (<ulink url="http://www.selectagents.gov/">http://www.selectagents.gov/</ulink>). Ebolaviruses and marburgviruses have been classified as tier 1 select agents, and additional regulations exist for possessing, using, or transferring tier 1 select agents and toxins (<ulink url="https://www.selectagents.gov/regulations/index.htm">https://www.selectagents.gov/regulations/index.htm</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0119s0004p0002">When such facilities are available, patients infected with filoviruses or Lassa, Lujo, Junín, Machupo, Sabia, Guanarito, or Chapare viruses should be transferred to a dedicated high-containment patient care facility experienced with the extra precautions used to manage the collection, transport, and storage of patient specimens. Guidance on personal protective equipment to be used when Ebola infection is suspected (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/ppe/guidance.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/ppe/guidance.html</ulink>) is also appropriate for the care of other high-consequence filoviruses and arenaviruses. At a minimum, barrier nursing procedures should be implemented, and personnel caring for the patient and handling diagnostic specimens should wear disposable caps, impermeable gowns, shoe covers, two pairs of surgical gloves, face shields, and face masks (preferably full-face respirators equipped with high-efficiency particulate air filters or N-95 or higher respirators) (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0148">148</link>). Gloves should be disinfected immediately if they come in direct contact with infected blood or secretions. Manipulation of these specimens and tissues, including sera obtained from convalescent patients, may pose a serious biohazard and should be minimized outside a BSL-4 laboratory (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0147">147</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0148">148</link>). Use of Vacutainer tubes is considered safer than use of syringes and needles, which must be disassembled before their contents are transferred to another tube. Procedures which generate aerosols (e.g., centrifugation) should be minimized and performed only if additional protective measures, such as keeping the equipment in a class I or II laminar flow hood, are taken. Chemical agents and gamma irradiation can decrease the infectivity of patient samples; however, the activity of these measures and their appropriate delivery vary substantially between individual viruses and specimen types, and care must be taken to avoid agents that will interfere with test results. The use of specific chemicals for inactivation is not currently outlined in the general CDC guidance for laboratories handling specimens concerning for Ebola virus disease (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0149">149</link>); however, the use of Triton-X was previously recommended by the CDC (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0150">150</link>) and is still listed as an option by the World Health Organization and Pan American Health Organization (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0151">151</link>). A 1% final concentration of Triton X-100 reduces, but does not eliminate, infectivity (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0152">152</link>), and serum may interfere with the Triton X-100-mediated viral inactivation (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0153">153</link>). We therefore recommend that anyone considering measures to decrease specimen infectivity consult appropriate references (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0151">151</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0154">154</link>) to determine the appropriateness of specific agents for the virus of concern, specimen type, and planned laboratory test.</para>

A unit membrane envelops the structure and is covered with club-shaped, 8- to 10-nm projections. No symmetry has been discerned. The most prominent and distinctive feature of these virions is the presence of different numbers of electron-dense particles (usually 2 to 10), which may be connected by fine filaments. These particles, 20 to 25 nm in diameter, are identical to host cell ribosomes by biochemical and oligonucleotide analysis (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0049">49</link>).

This approach was successfully adapted to the diagnosis of RESTV in impression smears from blood, tissues, and nasal turbinates, as it was to the detection of Junín virus-infected cells in peripheral blood and urinary sediment. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the liver reveals hepatocellular necrosis and numerous intracytoplasmic, eosinophilic ebolavirus inclusions, as well as sinusoidal dilatation and congestion (<link linkend="ch0119s0003s0004a0006">Fig. 2A</link>).

Obtaining frozen sections for diagnosis is rarely worth the biohazard incurred, especially since the threshold sensitivity for detection exceeds 6 log<subscript>10</subscript> PFU/g. For filoviruses, paraffin blocks of tissues are sectioned. Sections are deparaffinized, hydrated, digested with protease, and stained for the presence of viral antigens with immune rabbit serum or cocktails of murine monoclonal antibodies (74, 165–167). Biotinylated secondary antibodies are often used, although substitution of other chromogens can further increase sensitivity while reducing background (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0163">163</link>). In the 2007–2008 epizootic of Reston virus in swine in the Philippines, ebolavirus antigens were detected in different tissues, including lymph nodes (<link linkend="ch0119s0003s0004a0008">Fig. 3A</link>) (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0086">86</link>).

      <para id="ch0119s0009p0002">An antigen capture ELISA for quantitative detection of arenavirus and filovirus antigens in viremic sera and tissue culture supernatants can be used for early detection and identification of these agents (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0169">169</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0183">183</link>). These tests reliably detect antigens in samples inactivated by heat-detergent treatment, β-propiolactone, or irradiation; therefore, they can be conducted safely without elaborate containment facilities. The threshold sensitivities for these assays are approximately 2 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> to 1 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> PFU/ml, so they are sufficiently sensitive to detect antigen in most acute-phase VHF viremias and to detect viruses at the concentrations present in throat wash and urine samples. Further, antigen capture ELISAs are much more tolerant of genetic variation than RT-PCR-based detection methods and consequently are more likely to be successful at detecting new viruses (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0169">169</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0184">184</link>). Substitution of one or several monoclonal antibodies of high avidity and appropriate specificities for polyclonal sera (mostly against nucleoprotein, VP40, and glycoprotein) generally increases the sensitivities and specificities of these rapid antigen enzyme immunoassays (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0173">173</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0175">175</link>).

Although FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) was granted to several antigen detection-based assays, and the OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test Kit was cleared for use in 2019, these assays reportedly suffered from lower sensitivity relative to RT-PCR-based methods and from false positives and negatives (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0189">189</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0190">190</link>). A retrospective analysis of three rapid diagnostic tests (QuickNavi-Ebola, OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test, and Coris EBOLA Ag K-SeT rapid test) found that these tests had lower sensitivity (87.4%, 57.4%, and 38.9%, respectively) than the WHO target product profile (&gt;95%) (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0191">191</link>). Sensitivity was dependent on viral load, but some samples with high viral load were misclassified as negative. Archived blood and plasma samples from the West Africa outbreak have allowed for comparative assessments of the specificity and sensitivity of different commercialized lateral flow immunoassays for Ebola virus antigen detection, and a recently developed lateral flow assay relying on the detection of secreted GP reports greater sensitivity than PCR-based tests in laboratory models (141, 192–195). Assessments on archived samples suggest that the specificity of these assays may be higher on whole blood samples compared to plasma samples.</para>

      <para id="ch0119s0010p0001">For rapid acute case identification, RT-PCR followed by genome analysis has generally replaced antigen-antibody methods, primarily due to its ease of use, lower detection limits, high specificity, and complete inactivation of the samples in the first extraction step (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0196">196</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0197">197</link>). RT-PCR assays are common because of their automation potential, machine reporting capabilities, and ability to rapidly quantitate virus loads, features that are useful for measuring convalescence and potential effects of antiviral therapies (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0196">196</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0198">198</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0199">199</link>).

        <para id="ch0119s0010s0001p0001">The considerable genetic variation among Lassa viruses requires caution in primer design if diagnosis of infection originating in more than one geographic area is being considered, and false negatives may occur if primers are poorly matched to the genome of the infecting virus (29, 202–206). To remediate this problem, primers targeting the 5′ region of the S RNA have been developed (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0206">206</link>) and are used on a routine basis on a very large set of patients presenting at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Nigeria (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0207">207</link>). In limited-resource settings, real-time PCR assays would reduce the reported low rate (13/1,650 or 0.8% in Irrua) of PCR contamination but still lack field validation (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0196">196</link>). Likewise, various strategies for RT-PCR have been devised to detect Junín virus RNA in clinical materials (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0202">202</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0208">208</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0213">213</link>). Some of these are reputed to be far more sensitive than conventional isolation procedures, especially in the presence of antibody. Any method that promises to be a reliable substitute for procedures that entail the manipulation of infectious BSL-4 virus deserves attention. However, the ability to isolate and retain the virus has obvious advantages and should not be abandoned. Even in instances in which the etiological agent has been identified, the shipment of clinical material to an appropriate reference laboratory should be highly encouraged.</para>

During the SUDV outbreak in Gulu, Uganda, a nested RT-PCR-based assay was very valuable because of its ability to identify early patients prior to identification by any other available tests and for early convalescent specimens, which had already cleared detectable antigen.

The U.S. FDA granted Ebola virus EUAs for over 10 nucleic acid amplification-based assays, including the BioFire and GeneXpert systems, although not all EUA-approved diagnostic systems have gone on to receive full FDA approval (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0224">224</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0225">225</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0227">227</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0230">230</link>). The vast majority of clinical specimens in West Africa were tested using real-time RT-PCR, including the CDC lab in Bo, Sierra Leone, which tested over 27,000 samples during 15 months of operation, and RT-PCR, particularly the GeneXpert system, remains the routine test when Ebola virus disease is suspected (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0101">101</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0231">231</link>). Next-generation sequencing (NGS), although limited in clinical application due to high turnaround times, high cost, and the requirement of bioinformatics skills, has nonetheless been useful in categorizing filovirus species from patient samples, as it does not require prior knowledge of species or sequence. For example, the EBOV variants causing the 2018 Équateur Province EVD outbreak and the Nord-Kivu/Sud-Kivu/Ituri Province EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were identified by the use of the nanopore sequencing technology MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0232">232</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0233">233</link>).</para>

Virus isolates in cell culture supernatant fluids or tissue homogenates are presumptively or specifically identified by their reactivity with diagnostic antisera in various serologic tests (see below). Specific polyclonal antisera are prepared in adult guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, rats, or mice inoculated intraperitoneally with infectious virus. Rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys that are convalescent from experimental infections are also reasonable sources for larger quantities of immune sera. Polyvalent polyclonal “typing” sera or ascitic fluids made by immunization with a number of viruses within the families have also been useful in early identification of virus isolates and in immunohistochemistry on unknown patient materials. Diagnostic antisera produced by single injection of infectious virus are less cross-reactive and usually have higher titers than those produced by multiple injections of inactivated antigens. To further reduce the induction of extraneous antibodies, input virus should be derived from tissues or cells homologous to the species being immunized; likewise, the virus suspension should be stabilized with homologous serum or serum proteins. Sera produced for use in the IFA tests and ELISA should be collected 30 to 60 days after inoculation; sera for neutralization tests should be collected later. All sera must be inactivated and rigorously tested for the presence of live virus before being removed from a BSL-4 environment.</para>

A simplification of this procedure, which entails diluting the target antigen in phosphate-buffered saline and adsorbing it directly to the microtiter plate wells, has been developed for ebolaviruses (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0170">170</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0172">172</link>) and adapted to marburgviruses (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0175">175</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0176">176</link>) and LCMV (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0179">179</link>). Test sera are serially diluted, with a 1:100 initial dilution, and incubated with adsorbed antigen. Following incubation, washing, and addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human antibodies, 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid) (ABTS) or 3,3′,3,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate is added for color development. Samples are considered positive if the optical density at 410 nm (ABTS) or 450 nm (TMB) exceeds the mean plus 3 standard deviations for the normal-serum controls. This procedure can be further modified to detect virus-specific IgM by coating the plates with anti-human IgM followed by test serum dilutions and cell slurry antigens and then using the antigen capture protocol. Species-specific conjugates allow testing of other animal species during epidemiological studies. Using non-species-specific antigens for IgG and IgM ELISA procedures has worked well with specimens obtained from humans during natural infection and from animals experimentally infected with Lassa, Machupo, Junín, and filoviruses (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0254">254</link>).

For measuring the levels of neutralizing antibody to Lassa virus and LCMV, which are both difficult to neutralize and are poor inducers of this antibody, test sera are diluted, usually 1:10, in medium containing 10% guinea pig serum as a complement source, and mixed with serial dilutions of challenge virus. Titers are expressed as a log<subscript>10</subscript> neutralization index, defined as log<subscript>10</subscript> plaque forming units (PFU) in control minus log<subscript>10</subscript> PFU in test serum. For Junín and Machupo viruses, the more conventional serum dilution–constant virus format is normally used, although the constant serum–virus dilution format is equally useful for distinguishing among virus strains. Neutralizing-antibody responses require weeks to months to evolve but persist for years. Performance of these tests is restricted to laboratories equipped to handle the infectious viruses.</para>
      <para id="ch0119s0017p0002">In survivors, neutralizing antibodies to Lassa virus first appear very late in convalescence (6 weeks or later), long after the viremia has disappeared. This pattern of early IFA and delayed neutralizing-antibody response is similar for LCMV infections. Neutralizing antibodies against Junín and Machupo viruses become detectable 3 to 4 weeks after onset, soon after the termination of viremia. While these antibodies are thought to be important in protection against reinfection, their role in resolution of acute infections is less firmly established.</para>

An envelope-deficient, replication-incompetent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is complemented with EBOV GP to create a single-cycle infectious pseudovirus which is subsequently incubated with the sera of interest. The neutralizing ability of a sample is generally expressed as that dilution of plasma that provides a 50% reduction of virus infection. This pseudovirus system correlates well with neutralization of EBOV Makona (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0141">141</link>).

Early recognition of these infections should also trigger strict isolation procedures to prevent the spread of disease to patient contacts, health care workers, and laboratorians. In areas where specific viruses are endemic, the index of suspicion is often high, and experienced clinicians may be remarkably accurate in rendering an accurate diagnosis of fully developed cases on clinical grounds alone. However, even in these areas of endemicity, specific virologic and serologic tests are required to confirm clinical impressions, since many other diseases, including malaria, measles, typhoid, rickettsial infections, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and viral hepatitis, may masquerade as an arenavirus or filovirus infection. In other countries where evacuated suspected (or confirmed) patients or recent travelers showing symptoms are evaluated, RT-PCR or real-time PCR-based tests are preferred for rapid diagnostic confirmation (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0205">205</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0206">206</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0224">224</link>–<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0226">226</link>).</para>

Junín virus, Machupo virus, and LCMV are recovered less frequently, and diagnosis is usually based on the detection of specific antibodies later in the course of the disease. The presence of specific IgM ELISA-detectable antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of LCMV patients constitutes a definitive diagnosis. By immunofluorescence, LCMV antibodies can frequently be detected in the first week of illness (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0285">285</link>); however, antibody development may be delayed by several weeks (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0112">112</link>, <link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0286">286</link>). Among transplant-associated LCMV infections, antibodies may not develop at all (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0112">112</link>). For all arenavirus infections, the presence of specific IgM antibodies is indicative of recent infection. The extent to which heterologous arenavirus infection and/or reinfection broadens antibody specificity has not been systematically evaluated for any of the available serologic tests. Neutralizing antibodies against arenaviruses persist for long periods, perhaps for life, and thus provide the most reliable basis for determining the minimum resistance of a population to reinfection. The role of neutralizing antibody in acute recovery is less clear, as neutralizing antibody development may be delayed several months following recovery among patients with LASV infection (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0287">287</link>). The protective efficacy of passively administered immune plasma is believed to be a direct function of neutralizing-antibody titers, and plasma should be selected on this basis if being considered for use, especially for Junín and Lassa fever.</para>

        <para id="ch0119s0018s0002p0005">For filoviruses, RT-PCR, antigen detection, and IgM are the more valuable techniques for acute case diagnosis. The FDA issued over 10 EUAs to authorize the emergency use of both nucleic acid amplification and rapid antigen assays, although not all have gone on to receive subsequent full FDA approval. Because of the time required for culture and the biohazard, virus isolation data for these viruses are usually available only retrospectively. Marburgviruses and ebolaviruses are usually easily isolated from acute-phase serum samples. A rising IgM or IgG ELISA titer constitutes a strong presumptive diagnosis, although it is important to use ELISA assays that do not target proteins utilized in filoviral vaccines if using serological diagnostic methods among individuals recently vaccinated against filoviruses, in order to differentiate antibodies induced by infection from those induced by vaccination. Since IgM titers do not persist for long, a decreasing titer suggests a recent infection which occurred perhaps only within the several months. In general, IgG and IgM antibodies show a stronger reactivity to homologous ebolavirus antigens. Because of the low sensitivity of the IgM ELISA to heterologous antigen, there are some limitations in using the IgM ELISA prior to identification of the virus species. In contrast, IgG antibodies are relatively cross-reactive to heterologous antigens, particularly within<emphasis>Marburg marburgvirus</emphasis> and between some of the ebolavirus species (<link linkend="ch0119s0018s0003li0288">288</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0119s0018s0002p0006">The highest priority for future development is refinement of the available diagnostic tools to permit definitive diagnosis and virus identification in the field, at the bedside, or in the frontline clinic. PCR-based assays enable field laboratories to diagnose acute disease almost in real time. Proper tailoring of primers should permit the design of tests with the proper degree of specificity. However, the emergence of new arenaviruses and filoviruses in the past decade serves as a reminder that broadly reactive, grouping reagents are still required to augment the newly evolving tools of conventional and real-time PCR and capture ELISAs based on extremely specific monoclonal antibodies and gene sequences.</para>
        <para id="ch0119s0018s0002p0007">An investment in rapid diagnosis should result in more timely intervention with effective implementation of appropriate public health measures and use of evolving treatment regimens. The implementation of appropriate infection control measures has been demonstrated to greatly reduce the transmission and dissemination of these highly virulent viral pathogens.</para>
