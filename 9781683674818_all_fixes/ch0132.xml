          <para id="ch0132s0001s0001s0001p0001">Prion diseases (1), originally called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (2), are invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and animals. The unusual biological and biochemical properties of the infectious agent causing the disease were first recognized in studies of scrapie in sheep, which is the prototypic prion disease (3). Specifically, the resistance of the scrapie agent to inactivation by formalin and heat treatments, which were commonly used to produce vaccines against viral illnesses, suggested that the scrapie agent might be different from viruses. Two decades later, the scrapie agent’s extreme resistance to inactivation by radiation was documented (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0004">4</link>–<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0006">6</link>). The partial purification of the transmissible agent in rodent-adapted disease led to the discovery that a protein is required for transmission (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0007">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0010">10</link>), and procedures that eliminate or damage nucleic acids do not alter scrapie infectivity (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0011">11</link>). On the basis of these seminal findings, Stanley Prusiner proposed the term “prion” to distinguish these proteinaceous infectious particles from both viroids and viruses, and he was subsequently awarded a Nobel Prize for this work (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0012">12</link>). The currently accepted model of prion disease posits that the infectious pathogen is a misfolded protein, designated PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript>, where “Sc” is an abbreviation for “scrapie.” This protein is a pathogenic conformational isoform of the normal cellular prion protein, PrP<superscript>C</superscript>, which is encoded by the host’s prion protein (<emphasis>PRNP</emphasis>) gene (13) and is expressed in variable amounts in all healthy mammalian cells. The discovery that misfolded proteins may be infectious represented a new biological paradigm, and although originally deemed heretical, this protein-only model is now supported by a wealth of biochemical, genetic, and animal studies (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0014">14</link>–<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0019">19</link>), including recent success in generating infectious prions <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> from recombinant protein (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0020">20</link>–<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0023">23</link>). Prions cause scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids, camel prion disease in camels, and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease (GSS), fatal insomnia (FI), kuru, variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr), and several types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.</para>

          <para id="ch0132s0001s0001s0002p0001">The remarkable progress in the past decade has provided new insights into the biology and pathophysiology of prion diseases and indicates that the pathogenic and infectious PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> conformer is largely composed of beta-sheets. PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> propagates by binding to alpha-helical monomers of PrP<superscript>C</superscript>, which causes a conformational conversion of PrP<superscript>C</superscript>to PrP<superscript>Sc.</superscript> This conformational change has a domino-like cascade with more protein converting to the oligomeric, amyloid-forming PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> state with a predominantly beta-sheet secondary structure (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0024">24</link>–<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0028">28</link>). Although the exact structural intermediate steps remain poorly understood, many lines of evidence show that multiple diseases and clinical presentations are attributable to the variations in the conformational structure of PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0029">29</link>–<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0033">33</link>) (see “Epidemiology and Transmission” below).</para>
          <para id="ch0132s0001s0001s0002p0002">The human<emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> gene, which codes for normal PrP<superscript>C</superscript>, is composed of two exons, the second of which contains the single open reading frame encoding a 253-amino-acid preprotein (34). Both N-terminal and C-terminal signal peptides are cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum. The C-terminal signal peptide is replaced with the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol cell membrane anchor, and two complex sugar chains are linked to asparagines 181 and 197 (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0029">29</link>–<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0031">31</link>). In normal PrP<superscript>C</superscript>, five glycine-rich octapeptide repeats are coded for by <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> codons 51 through 90. Codon 129 encodes either a methionine (M) or a valine (V), and this polymorphism plays a significant role in the susceptibility to disease and in disease phenotypes (see “Epidemiology and Transmission” below).</para>
          <para id="ch0132s0001s0001s0002p0003">Monomeric PrP<superscript>C</superscript>in the alpha-helical conformation is susceptible to proteolytic degradation. The predominantly beta-sheet conformation that is present in PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> results in resistance to degradation by proteinase K treatment. PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> typically forms large insoluble aggregates. These characteristics of PrP<superscript>C</superscript>and PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> have been used to aid in the diagnosis of prion disease (see “Identification” below). The conformational transition that underlies these pronounced changes is believed to involve refolding of the C-terminal region whereby the alpha-helical structures of PrP<superscript>C</superscript>are replaced by beta-sheets with variable particle assembly patterns (35). Although insolubility and protease resistance were the original defining features of PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript>, the finding of protease-sensitive small oligomers of pathogenic PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0037">37</link>) significantly broadened our knowledge of the spectrum of pathogenic conformers, and this finding has led to the discoveries of new animal and human prion diseases, such as atypical scrapie in sheep (38) and VPSPr in humans (39).</para>

          <para id="ch0132s0001s0001s0002p0004">In healthy individuals, PrP<superscript>C</superscript>is a membrane-associated glycoprotein, evolutionarily similar to the zinc iron protein family of metal ion transport proteins (40). The flexibility and structure of octapeptide repeats coordinating zinc and copper transport are able to impact diverse biological endpoints (41). Although data accumulated in the past indicate that PrP<superscript>C</superscript>serves as an essential receptor for cytotoxicity of PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> as well as a substrate for the conversion to PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0042">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0043">43</link>), the exact physiological function of PrP<superscript>C</superscript>remains elusive (44). The variable neurotoxicity and specific infectivity of PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript>, and the absence of amyloid fibrillar forms in a growing number of newly recognized prion diseases (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0039">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0045">45</link>), led some researchers to question the causative link with PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> and to predict a hypothetical lethal (PrPL) subform, presumably responsible for the toxicity and symptomatic stage of the disease (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0047">47</link>). The PrPL protein remains to be found, and recent experiments demonstrated that the high replication potency of CJD prions correlates with the brain levels of oligomeric PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> and the progression rate of human prion diseases <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0032">32</link>) and that rising levels of these small oligomeric species of PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> convert the asymptomatic plateau of prion infectivity into a symptomatic stage (48). Cumulatively, these recent data argue that small PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> particles control the prion conversion as well as the cytotoxic effect mediated by PrP<superscript>C</superscript>and that they represent the previously proposed PrPL species.</para>

          <para id="ch0132s0001s0001s0003p0001">Most cases of prion disease in humans arise sporadically, but some are attributed to<emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> mutations, and still others are caused by zoonotic or iatrogenic transmission (<anchor id="ch0132s0001s0001s0003a0003"/><link linkend="ch0132s0001s0001s0003a0004">Table 1</link>) (30). Human prion diseases include variant CJD (vCJD), GSS, FI, kuru, VPSPr, and clinically and histologically diverse forms of sporadic CJD (sCJD). Human prion diseases—for which there is no therapy or cure—are characterized by deposits of pathogenic prion protein (PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript>) in the brain and multifocal neuropathological features with neuronal loss, spongiform changes, and astrocytic proliferation (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0049">49</link>). CJD generally occurs with an incidence between 0.5 and 2 cases per million annually (50). In the United States, the average annual death rate due to prion disease is one death per 6,239 individuals and with its aging population, the incidence of CJD in those ≥65 years of age is approximately 5.9 cases per million individuals (51). However, the rising age-adjusted incidence of CJD observed independently in the United Kingdom (<ulink url="http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/report24.pdf">http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/report24.pdf</ulink>) and in the United States (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cjd/occurrence-transmission.html">https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cjd/occurrence-transmission.html</ulink>) in the past 10 years suggests that factors other than age, but as of yet unidentified, may be contributing to this trend. At least part of this increase may be attributed to better diagnostic tests over this time frame.</para>

        <para id="ch0132s0001s0002p0001">Several explanations have been proposed for the etiology of sporadic forms of CJD, which account for approximately 85% of all prion diseases in humans. One hypothesis is that spontaneous somatic mutations in the<emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> gene may occur, which would lead to production of PrP<superscript>C</superscript>that can easily convert to PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript>, and this pathophysiology would be analogous to the pathophysiology of genetic CJD (gCJD). A second hypothesis is that rare stochastic conformational changes in the structure of PrP<superscript>C</superscript>occur, which can result in spontaneous creation of the PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> conformer, which can then propagate (53). A third hypothesis is that at least some cases of apparent sCJD are actually acquired forms of CJD that have resulted from covert, low-level exposure to a “common external factor,” which has not been identified (54). These three explanations presuppose that the PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> would have to be capable of recruiting wild-type PrP<superscript>C</superscript>; this process might occur with some mutations or conformations but is unlikely to occur with others (55). A fourth hypothesis suggests that small amounts of PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript>-like isoforms are normally present in the brain but are bound to other proteins (e.g., heat shock proteins), which prevent PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> from causing disease. In this hypothesis, disease would occur when this protective mechanism fails with aging (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0056">56</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0057">57</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0132s0001s0002p0002">A number of<emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> polymorphisms that play a role in sCJD have been described (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0059">59</link>). One of the most commonly studied risk modifiers in developing CJD is <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> codon 129. Homozygosity of methionine at codon 129 (129M) is a risk factor for developing sCJD, whereas valine at codon 129 is somewhat protective (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0049">49</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0061">61</link>). Worldwide, the prevalence of this polymorphism varies. In individuals of Asian descent, the 129M allele has a frequency of up to 0.97 (62), and in Europeans, the 129M allele frequency is about 0.65 (59). In those from areas where kuru is endemic, the valine variant is slightly more prevalent than the methionine allele (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0059">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0060">60</link>). Additionally, a recent international genome-wide association study of 5,208 cases collected between 1990 and 2014 found 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms at three loci associated with sCJD risk that are common variants altering the protein sequence or are implicated in intracellular trafficking and sphingolipid metabolism (63). These findings suggest that sCJD may share some causal pathogenetic mechanisms with other age-related neurodegenerative disease associated with protein misfolding (e.g., tauopathies).</para>

        <para id="ch0132s0001s0003p0001">Several genetic prion diseases have been described: gCJD, GSS, and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). Various mutations in<emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> have been identified and linked to these genetic prion diseases. The <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> mutations are missense or nonsense point mutations, or the mutations result in an increase in the number of glycine-rich octapeptide repeats present in PrP (see “Description of the Agent” above) (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0064">64</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0065">65</link>).

Allele counts in 16,025 definite and probable prion disease cases in 9 countries reported 59 rare <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> variants, but many of these variants have unknown or low penetrance and also exist in the general population (58). The most common mutation associated with gCJD is the E200K <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> mutation, which has a clinical presentation that is indistinguishable from sCJD. FFI and GSS are other well-described genetic prion diseases (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0066">66</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0067">67</link>). The <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> mutation associated with FFI is D178N coupled with methionine at codon 129 of the mutated gene (68). Some FI cases are not familial and are not associated with a <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> mutation, and therefore, the disease is called sporadic FI (68). A number of <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> mutations have been associated with GSS, but the classic mutation is P102L. GSS usually presents with isolated cerebellar or parkinsonian symptoms and typically has a duration longer than that of sCJD (mean duration of 5 years). Symptoms in genetic prion disease typically begin sometime after 50 years of age, with wide variability between mutations and even in family members with the same mutation.</para>

In the recent past, the Fore people of Papua New Guinea practiced endocannibalism as part of their death and mourning ritual (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0070">70</link>). Through these ritualistic feasts, the prions that cause kuru were spread within the tribe, mainly to the women and children, who were the predominant participants in the feasts. The Fore have an increased frequency of the 129V <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> allele compared to those in other groups. The Fore individuals with methionine-valine heterozygosity at <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> codon 129 (M129V) who developed kuru did so later in life, and the progression of symptoms after onset was slower than for other homozygous genotypes (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0071">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0072">72</link>). Additionally, a novel PrP variant, G127V, with strong protection against the disease in the heterozygous state, was likely under positive evolutionary selection during the epidemic of kuru (73). The cessation of endocannibalism within the tribe brought an end to the kuru epidemic, but the study of kuru and the Fore people revealed that the incubation period for prion disease from transmission to symptomatology can exceed 50 years (74).</para>

BSE is sometimes referred to as “mad cow disease” and is a prion disease of cattle, which is analogous to scrapie in sheep and CJD in humans. Prions from cattle with BSE can be transmitted to humans, which can result in human prion disease; this human disease is termed new vCJD or vCJD (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0075">75</link>–<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0077">77</link>). vCJD was first identified in 1996 in the United Kingdom, where, as of October 2020, 178 probable and definite cases have been reported (<ulink url="https://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/figs.pdf">https://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/figs.pdf</ulink>).

Epidemiological evidence from the four vCJD cases in U.S. residents indicated that they were infected in the United Kingdom (two cases), in Saudi Arabia (one case), and in either Kuwait or Russia (one case) (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/prions/vcjd/vcjd-reported.html">https://www.cdc.gov/prions/vcjd/vcjd-reported.html</ulink>).</para>
        <para id="ch0132s0001s0004p0003">An outbreak of BSE in the 1980s in the United Kingdom is thought to have originated from feeding protein-rich by-products, most likely contaminated with scrapie, from animal carcasses (including neural tissue remnants containing prions) to cattle (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0075">75</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0078">78</link>). Subsequently, an outbreak of vCJD in the United Kingdom began in the late 1990s (75–77, 79). The individuals who developed vCJD have been typically younger than those affected with sCJD. Additionally, three individuals who developed vCJD likely acquired the disease via therapeutic transfusion of human blood products that were donated from individuals with preclinical vCJD (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0080">80</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0081">81</link>).</para>

In this 2017 case report, the authors described the first case of vCJD in an individual who was heterozygous at <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> codon 129. Because of the potential for developing transmitted prion disease decades after exposure, it is unclear if individuals with other <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> codon 129 polymorphisms who were exposed to BSE are more resistant to developing vCJD or if they will have a longer incubation time before onset of symptoms, similar to those exposed to kuru. At this time, it is not known if this case represents the first case in a “second wave” of vCJD that will occur in <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> M129V individuals or if the case is an atypical isolated occurrence.</para>

The origin of this disease is unknown, and there is currently no evidence that it has been transmitted to humans, but extrapolation from experimental humanized transgenic data suggests that L-BSE may propagate in humans as an unrecognized form of sCJD (85).</para>
        <para id="ch0132s0001s0004p0006">In addition to BSE, another prion disease of potential public health concern in the United States is CWD of deer and elk (86). CWD in farmed and free-ranging cervids (e.g., deer, elk, and moose) has been endemic in areas of Colorado and Wyoming for decades but has now been detected in a total of 26 states, in three Canadian provinces, and in South Korea, Norway, Finland, and Sweden (87) (<ulink url="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/expanding-distribution-chronic-wasting-disease">https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/expanding-distribution-chronic-wasting-disease</ulink>). Unlike in the BSE outbreak in cattle, CWD prions are highly infectious among cervids, and the disease is easily transmissible from animal to animal through direct contact and through exposure to CWD prions in the environment (e.g., via cervid feces) (88). No reports have suggested that exposure of humans to CWD prions can cause disease (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cwd/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cwd/index.html</ulink>) (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0089">89</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0090">90</link>). The experimental evidence suggests the existence of a species barrier against CWD transmission to humans, but it is unclear how protective this species barrier may be, because other primates are not protected. As many as 100% of intracerebrally and 92% of orally inoculated squirrel monkeys developed prion disease after CWD prion exposure, but CWD was not successfully transmitted to cynomolgus macaques (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0091">91</link>–<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0093">93</link>). The potential transmission of animal prion diseases, such as BSE and CWD, to humans directly or via an intermediate animal host has resulted in ongoing public health surveillance (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0094">94</link>–<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0097">97</link>). Additionally, CWD is caused by an unknown spectrum of prions and has become enzootic in populations of cervid species that express PrPC molecules varying in amino acid composition. These PrPC polymorphisms drive continuously evolving diversity of CWD prions that can lead to emergence of new prion strains and affect prion transmission (98). The public health efforts monitoring CWD are proactive and precautionary given the current high level of uncertainty (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0087">87</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0132s0001s0004p0007">Iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) is the result of transmission of prion disease via the therapeutic use of prion-contaminated human products or prion-contaminated reusable devices. More than 200 cases of iatrogenic transmission of sCJD have been attributed to the use of growth hormone derived from cadaveric pituitary glands, and more than 200 cases have been attributed to contaminated dura mater grafts (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0099">99</link>). Since the discovery of prion transmission via cadaveric growth hormone and dura mater grafts, measures have been implemented to prevent further exposure of individuals to prions via therapeutic products derived from humans. Although vCJD appears to have been transmitted via therapeutic blood transfusions, blood transfusion has not been identified as a means of transmission of sCJD (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0080">80</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0100">100</link>). About a dozen cases of iCJD have been attributed to uncommon transmission sources, including neurosurgical instruments, electroencephalogram needles, cadaver-derived growth hormone, and corneal transplants (81). Because of the potential for transmitting prions via reusable instrumentation exposed to neural tissue, guidelines recommend quarantine and/or more extensive decontamination and/or destruction of these instruments if it is suspected that they may have been exposed to prions (see “Decontamination” below).</para>

        <para id="ch0132s0001s0005p0001">The potential for prion transmission causes concern for several reasons. First, prion disease is infrequently encountered, so many individuals have only a cursory working knowledge of prion transmission. Second, laboratory studies indicate that standard decontamination and sterilization procedures may be insufficient to completely remove infectivity from prion-contaminated instruments. Third, uncertainty still remains regarding how prions can and cannot be transmitted. For example, vCJD appears to be potentially transmitted via blood transfusions or ingestion of contaminated beef products, but sCJD appears to be potentially transmissible only through more invasive exposures (e.g., neurosurgery or exposure to cadaver-derived therapeutics derived from neural tissue). Fourth, the incubation period between prion exposure/transmission and symptomatology can be decades, so it is difficult to definitively conclude that certain exposures (or potential exposures) to prions do not result in the transmission of the disease. Fifth, there is no prophylaxis or cure for prion disease.</para>
        <para id="ch0132s0001s0005p0002">Although a large epidemiological study of health care professionals concluded that the data did not support any overall increased occupational risk for health care workers (101), increased caution should be taken in specific health care settings, particularly in the instance of neurosurgical patients. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have devised risk assessment and decontamination protocols for the prevention of iatrogenic transmission of prion diseases (see “Decontamination” below), incidents of possible exposure to prions have unfortunately occurred in the United States (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0102">102</link>). The experience of vCJD after BSE exposure and the experience of kuru indicate that a delay of 10 years or longer between exposure and detectable human prion disease is likely, so short-term human outcomes cannot be used to gauge the efficacy of prion infection control practices. These characteristics of prion disease and the methodological limitations of retrospective epidemiological studies support a conservative approach in maintaining current precautionary measures (92). Although specific procedures are required to completely remove prion infectivity, the fact that no neurosurgical instrumentation-related iatrogenic cases have occurred since 1976 is somewhat reassuring that modern sterilization procedures remove a majority of infectivity (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cjd/infection-control.html">https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cjd/infection-control.html</ulink>).</para>

This combination of characteristics makes prion diseases an important entity for public health monitoring. The variability in clinical presentation can make prion diseases difficult to differentiate from other age-related brain neurodegenerative disorders, and postmortem brain analysis is currently the “gold standard” for diagnosing prion diseases (52, 103–105). However, recent advances in radiological imaging and clinical laboratory testing have significantly improved the predictive value of antemortem testing (see “Identification” below).</para>

Individuals with vCJD have been noted to have infectivity in reticuloendothelial tissues, albeit lower than in the CNS (114). The current WHO guidelines, published in 1999, recommend handling blood and body fluids other than CSF using routine handling precautions (115). These WHO guidelines recommend against testing prion-contaminated CSF on automated instruments, but this guideline is difficult to practically implement because the diagnosis of CJD is often obtained days, weeks, or months after CSF has been tested in clinical laboratories. Moreover, delaying some of these diagnostic tests may result in poor patient outcomes if treatable diagnoses are missed or delayed. Given the likelihood that CSF from CJD patients is unknowingly being processed on these instruments and that there is no increased incidence of prion disease in medical personnel, there is likely minimal, if any, risk to laboratory staff as long as standard laboratory protocols are followed.</para>

Specific neuropathological findings can be used to predict the prion subtype (120). Key histological findings can guide the diagnosis. Immunohistochemical staining of PrP is used to characterize the disease; for example, florid plaques of PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> deposited in the cortex are a key feature of vCJD. Other histological features and the location within the brain where those features are identified can be used to suggest one of the six subtypes of sCJD (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0119">119</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0120">120</link>).

        <para id="ch0132s0001s0013p0001">Several diagnostic tests can be performed on CSF, which can be helpful in diagnosing or ruling out prion disease. Two types of tests are typically performed. The first type examines the CSF for nonspecific markers of neurodegeneration. The second type examines the CSF for PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript>, which is the causative agent of prion disease.</para>

A 14-3-3 assay is the classic test used to detect prion disease, and it is often still used despite the availability of more sensitive and specific assays (140). Either a Western blot or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay can be used to identify elevated 14-3-3. Another important nonspecific marker is total tau, which is commonly identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0049">49</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0140">140</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0141">141</link>). Because prion disease causes rapid deterioration of the brain tissue, these markers are sensitive in detecting prion disease. Because these tests reveal markers of neuronal injury and many other phenomena can cause elevated levels, these markers lack specificity.More slowly progressive forms of prion disease, such as some genetic prion diseases, may have levels of markers of neurodegeneration that are lower than in more rapidly progressive prion diseases.</para>
        <para id="ch0132s0001s0013p0003">Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) was recently developed as a novel assay to detect PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> (<link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0142">142</link>, <link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014s0002li0143">143</link>). This assay does not identify surrogate markers of disease, but it detects replication (seeding) activity of prions. The assay uses recombinant PrP<superscript>C</superscript>as a reagent substrate, and the assay is typically seeded with CSF from a patient that is suspected of having prion disease. If PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> is present in the CSF, the PrP<superscript>Sc</superscript> template induces misfolding of the PrP<superscript>C</superscript>substrate <emphasis>in vitro.</emphasis> These misfolded proteins are detected by an increase in relative fluorescence of the reporter reagent, thioflavin T (<anchor id="ch0132s0001s0013a0003"/><link linkend="ch0132s0001s0014a0006">Fig. 4</link>). The improved second generation of CSF RT-QuIC reached a sensitivity of 92 to 95% and a specificity of 98.5% in the detection of human prion diseases (144) and allows, together with <emphasis>PRNP</emphasis> gene sequencing, antemortem classification of human prion disease subtypes. Although rare sporadic and some genetic prion diseases can have a negative RT-QuIC result (145), these second-generation assays demonstrated high reproducibility and transferability in a recent multicenter evaluation (ring trial), with 98 to 100% concordance between the results obtained by the testing of these CSF samples and nasal brushings at the six laboratories (146). Although false-positive RT-QuIC results have been documented, they are rare, and there is no evidence for a common cause.</para>

Laboratories should be informed of this consideration before receiving CSF or CNS tissue specimens for testing, so appropriate laboratory precautions and subsequent decontamination can be undertaken. Laboratory evaluation of CSF or CNS tissue from individuals suspected of having prion disease should follow institutional policies and procedures for handling, testing, and decontamination (see “Decontamination” above). The diagnosis or exclusion of prion disease should be based on the whole clinical picture, including clinical and family history, symptomatology, neurological signs, radiographic findings, and laboratory results. MRI and CSF testing can play an especially important role in evaluating the likelihood of prion disease in living patients (see “Identification” above). Autopsy remains the gold standard in definitively diagnosing and characterizing prion disease, and autopsy plays an essential role in investigating the etiology and epidemiology of each individual’s prion disease.</para>
