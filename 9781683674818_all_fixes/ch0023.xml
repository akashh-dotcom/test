      <para id="ch0023s000000p0001">Molecular methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases can be broadly grouped into three categories: (i) probe-based methods without amplification, (ii) signal amplification methods, and (iii) target amplification methods. The core principle underlying all of these approaches is that the detection of specific nucleic acid sequences can be used to identify target pathogens in clinical specimens. These methods differ significantly in terms of their technical requirements, analytical sensitivity, and specificity, which inform the role of individual techniques in specific clinical applications.</para>

        <para id="ch0023s000000p0002">Probe-based methods without amplification are among the earliest-described and simplest molecular tests. The underlying mechanism of these assays is the binding of target nucleic acids by sequence-specific probes. Through various chemistries, these probes subsequently generate a measurable signal, which correlates with the presence or absence of the target sequence. No amplification of the target or signal occurs during testing; therefore, the target itself must be present in sufficient quantity prior to testing (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0011">Fig. 1</link>). This restricts the use of amplification-free probe-based methods to situations in which targets are biologically amplified <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> (i.e., high organism burden or rRNA target) or <emphasis>ex vivo</emphasis> (i.e., cultured isolate).</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0003">While the basic principle of probe-based chemistry is the binding of an oligonucleotide probe to an oligonucleotide target in a sequence-specific manner, the way this binding is detected varies from assay to assay. For example, the BD Affirm VPIII assay (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) utilizes capture and color development probes to generate signal to detect potential pathogens in vaginal specimens (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0013">Fig. 2</link>) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0002">2</link>). Chemiluminescent probes have been described for the identification of cultured fungal isolates (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0003">3</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0006">6</link>). Yet another assay, the AccuProbe system (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA), identifies cultured mycobacterial isolates utilizing a detection technique known as hybridization protection (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0015">Fig. 3</link>) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0007">7</link>). All of these techniques are designed to detect target nucleic acid from clinical samples or cultured isolates following the lysis of target cells. As such, they inform on the qualitative presence of a target, though they cannot inform regarding which cells are positive for the target in question in a complex specimen.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0004">In contrast, probe-based<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization (ISH) techniques have been specifically designed to distinguish cells containing a target of interest from target-negative cells. When ISH is performed, sequence-specific probes are directly hybridized with paraffinized tissue sections mounted on glass slides. By providing histologic context, this can be a sensitive and specific way to diagnose diseases caused by viruses (i.e., Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus). A drawback of ISH is that staining can be more difficult to prepare and interpret than traditional staining techniques, which is why, for most viral targets, traditional immunohistochemistry is more commonly utilized (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0009">9</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0005">The<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization testing of live organisms is of great utility though technically challenging. Traditional oligonucleotide probes are unable to cross cell membranes to reach their nucleic acid targets. This can be addressed through peptide nucleic acid (PNA) fluorescent <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization (FISH). PNA-FISH probes have a neutral peptide backbone added to the oligonucleotide probe. The altered structure is more hydrophobic, allowing the probe to better penetrate cellular membranes. This approach has been used to rapidly identify both bacteria and yeasts from specimens such as positive blood cultures and sterile body fluids with high accuracy (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0010">10</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0015">15</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0023s000000p0007">The analytical sensitivity of nucleic acid probes can be greatly enhanced through signal amplification, which allows the detection of low quantities of nucleic acid directly from clinical specimens. Signal amplification is commonly accomplished through a chemiluminescent or enzymatic approach. An advantage of these methods is that, since the nucleic acid target itself is not amplified, they are not susceptible to amplicon contamination (discussed below). Nevertheless, even without the amplification of target nucleic acids, signal amplification techniques can be extraordinarily sensitive.</para>

The specimen is then transferred to a separate reagent well, where the color development probes are added. A washing step is critical to clear the beads of any unbound target or probe. Finally, an enzyme conjugate solution (horseradish peroxidase [HRP]) followed by an indicator solution with a chemical substrate is added, which reacts with the color development probe if present, producing a colorimetric change.

        <para id="ch0023s000000p0008">An early form of signal amplification, using branched DNA (bDNA), was described as a technique to enhance the sensitivity for viral hepatitis and HIV viral load assays (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0016"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0023">Fig. 4</link>). This technology had been shown to have high correlation with quantitative PCR-based assays for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and HCV (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0016">16</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0019">19</link>). While a primary advantage of bDNA technology is the avoidance of amplicon contamination, a significant disadvantage is the multiple pipetting steps required for testing. In clinical practice, the minimal handling steps and reduced risk of contamination of PCR-based assays relative to bDNA methods make them more efficient techniques for use in clinical laboratories (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0020">20</link>). As such, the bDNA method is no longer a commonly utilized molecular method.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0009">In contrast to bDNA, several other forms of signal amplification are routinely used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Hybridization capture utilizes RNA oligonucleotides to bind complementary single-stranded DNA targets (<link linkend="ch0023s000000a0015">Fig. 3</link>). Hybrid capture has emerged as a mechanism for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing through the Hybrid Capture 2 molecular assay, which simultaneously detects 13 different types of high-risk HPV strains (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0021">21</link>). Yet another form of signal amplification is known as Invader (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0017"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0025">Fig. 5</link>) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0022">22</link>). This technology has been used to accurately perform viral genotyping in patients infected with HCV, a setting in which target nucleic acids have typically been biologically amplified (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0024">24</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0010">In some instances, the analytical sensitivity of signal-based amplification techniques can rival that of target-based amplification. T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR; T2 Biosystems, Lexington, MA) can detect biomolecules in complex patient samples. Its application to pathogen detection has historically been limited due to poor sensitivity in relevant specimen types, such as blood (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0025">25</link>). However, an adjustment to this technique has made it one of the most sensitive molecular methods described, capable of detecting concentrations as low as 1 CFU/ml in whole blood. Rather than utilizing T2MR to directly detect pathogens in the patient sample, nucleic acid of the pathogen is first amplified through PCR and then bound to oligonucleotide probes on magnetic beads. The resultant reconfiguration of the magnetic beads creates a signal readily detected by T2MR (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0018"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0027">Fig. 6</link>). The analytical sensitivity of this approach is high enough to detect agents of fungemia and bacteremia directly from whole blood, without the need for initial blood culture (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0026">26</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0029">29</link>). When directly compared to fungal culture, T2MR has a sensitivity of approximately 91% and a specificity of approximately 98% (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0030">30</link>). Despite a 98% specificity, when pretest probability for candidemia is low, the positive predictive value will be poor (i.e., testing in a 2% prevalence setting will have a 50% positive predictive value). Thus, when this technique is utilized for the detection of candidemia, it is important to consider the population being tested when interpreting results. When it is utilized for the detection of bacterial sepsis, data have shown a high rate of unique bacterial detections in comparison to blood culture (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0026">26</link>). Discrepant analysis and patient chart review suggest that a large proportion of these extra detections likely reflects true episodes of bacteremia (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0026">26</link>). While T2MR holds promise as an ultrasensitive approach to the diagnosis of sepsis, one major limitation is panel inclusivity. The bacterial panel is limited to five organisms (<emphasis>Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>), while the yeast panel is also limited to only five targets (<emphasis>Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Candida parapsilosis</emphasis>).</para>

Collectively, these processes are referred to as extraction. Current methods for nucleic acid extraction differ slightly based on the specimen matrix (whole blood, plasma, urine, tissue, etc.), location of nucleic acid (intracellular, bacterial, or viral), biochemical nature of the target (RNA or DNA), and the specific size of nucleic acid being extracted (viral genome segments, antibiotic resistance plasmids, bacterial whole genome, etc.).</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0013">The two commonly used methods of obtaining sufficiently pure nucleic acids incorporate liquid-phase and solid-phase extraction. Liquid-phase extractions rely primarily on the separation of nucleic acids from microbial lysates with the use of organic acids and/or centrifugation density gradients, whereas solid-phase extraction involves the selective binding of DNA or RNA to an immobilized matrix. Although used frequently in the research setting, liquid-phase phenol-chloroform extraction techniques are less often employed in clinical laboratories, due to the careful handling required for toxic waste products. In contrast, solid-phase extraction methods have gained widespread adoption in the clinical laboratory due to enhanced flexibility for both manual and automated platforms as well as less toxic waste products. The basic principle of solid-phase extraction for nucleic acids relies on the differential binding of molecules to beads or membranes under specific ionic conditions. Similar to liquid-phase extraction, purification and concentration of nucleic acid from eluates are ultimately achieved, but in a less labor-intensive manner. Commonly, a silica-based matrix provides the solid-phase surface for DNA binding that is subsequently enhanced under high-salt and alkaline conditions (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0032">32</link>). The positively charged silica particles attract negatively charged nucleic acids, which is critical for the effective separation of nucleic acid from impurities. The volume of the final extract containing the purified nucleic acid can be adjusted by the addition of variable amounts of elution buffer. With smaller elution volumes, nucleic acid extracts are obtained at a higher concentration but potentially with a decreased total yield.</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0014">The details of the complex chemistry underlying both solid-phase and liquid-phase extraction have been reviewed extensively (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0033">33</link>). During manual and automated extractions, the separation processes often require either centrifugation or vacuum filtration. Alternative solid-phase reagents include magnetic beads, which can be separated from the liquid phase magnetically on automated platforms (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0034">34</link>) (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0031"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0032">Table 2</link>). Whether bead-based, alkaline lysis, or sonication methods are used, the final nucleic acid is directly available for downstream analysis. The efficiency of extraction methods may be affected by the specific matrix of the specimen. For example, lower respiratory tract specimens (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, tracheal aspirates, and sputum) tend to be more heterogeneous and viscous than upper respiratory tract specimens collected on swabs submitted in transport media. To mitigate these effects, the laboratory can liquefy difficult specimens with dithiothreitol and surfactant-containing buffers (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0035">35</link>) or perform lysis separately (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0036">36</link>) prior to continuing with automated extraction or direct detection.</para>

      <para id="ch0023s000000p0015">Certain pathogens are incredibly stable in the specimens in which they are found. Coupled with the development of robust DNA polymerases that retain functionality in the presence of impurities and variable salt conditions, simple protein denaturation and heat inactivation may be sufficient to prepare samples for nucleic acid detection. This was most recently shown by extraction-free methods for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0037">37</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0039">39</link>). The basic principle underlying these methods is the use of heat inactivation to lyse eukaryotic cells and decrease sample viscosity while simultaneously reducing the pathogenicity of the specimen. A portion of the heat-treated and denatured mixture is added directly to a reaction well containing the appropriate enzymes and components for amplification and detection. The final detection of amplified product is similar to other indirect methods (see “Target Amplification”). Importantly, the sensitivity and specificity of extraction-free methods may be lower than in traditional extraction-based methods (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0040">40</link>). Additionally, as with extraction-based detection, internal controls are required to assess for PCR inhibition. Two commonly used methods are addition of exogenous DNA and specific reagents (primers and probes) to detect amplification and inclusion of specimen adequacy control reagents for a target routinely present in the biological specimen. An example of the latter is the inclusion of targets for RNase P in direct assays for SARS-CoV-2 (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0037">37</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0039">39</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0023s000000p0016">Amplification of nucleic acids is often required to detect pathogens from extracted specimens. Amplification of DNA is the cornerstone of PCR, initially described by Mullis and Faloona in 1983 (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0041">41</link>). While RNA targets are also amenable to detection by amplification, they must first be converted to cDNA, by taking advantage of the function of viral reverse transcriptase. Successful amplification requires careful selection of the microbial target as well as a detailed understanding of the reaction chemistry. Optimization of the amplification parameters is often the difference between success and failure in PCR (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0042">42</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0023s000000p0017">Many microbial targets, including viruses and the ribosomal sequences of bacteria and fungi, are composed of RNA. A major limitation of either viral RNA or 16S/18S rRNA as a substrate for amplification is that it cannot be used directly for PCR without an initial conversion to cDNA. Mammalian retroviruses encode endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) enzymes to facilitate host genomic integration which can be repurposed as laboratory reagents for cDNA conversion (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0043">43</link>). Target-specific reverse transcription utilizes short oligonucleotides that bind target nucleic acid in a sequence-specific manner (primers) to initiate cDNA synthesis. Once converted, cDNA represents a more stable copy of the RNA that also serves as a template for amplification. Most clinical workflows utilize one-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), in which cDNA synthesis precedes the PCR amplification in the same tube through temperature-dependent inactivation of RT enzymes coupled with thermally controlled activation of the DNA polymerase. RT enzymes often function at a lower temperature (37 to 42°C) than that required for annealing of the primer; thus, nonspecific RNA priming and decreased overall processivity can be a concern. In order to mitigate this, a new class of RT and DNA polymerase molecules has been developed (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0044">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0045">45</link>); this type of RT functions at higher temperatures, which enhances the specificity of primer binding and RNA unwinding. This approach obviates subsequent handling (tube opening and sample transfer), minimizing the risk of laboratory contamination.</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0018">Degradation of RNA by ribonucleases (RNases) can significantly impact the performance and reliability of RNA-based testing. RNases are ubiquitous, found in the environment and within the samples that are being assessed. They are also extremely stable, being resistant to heat and pH fluctuations (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0046">46</link>). Thus, it is imperative that careful attention be given to all facets of the workflow that can introduce RNases into the process. This includes contaminated tubes, solutions, pipettors, and even fingers. In order to mitigate this risk, gloves should be worn at all times and changed frequently. Dedicated solutions marked for use in RNA-sensitive applications should be used when available. Microcentrifuge and storage tubes should not be handled without gloves and should be opened only in a dead-air box to prevent unintentional RNase carryover from the environment. Since RNases are incredibly heat resistant, even autoclaved supplies may retain active RNases. Therefore, manufacturer-certified molecular biology-grade tubes and filtered pipette tips are recommended for use in the clinical laboratory performing RNA-based testing. Finally, at the start and end of every shift, all work surfaces and pipettors should be cleaned with wipes or solutions (such as RNase Away; Molecular Bioproducts, San Diego, CA) specifically designed to reduce RNase contamination.</para>

Following extraction, and conversion to cDNA if interrogating RNA targets, DNA molecules are exponentially amplified to generate amplicons at a concentration orders of magnitude greater than the input amount. The critical biochemistry underlying PCR is the thermostable polymerase that synthesizes DNA at high temperatures and remains active at temperatures that would denature most proteins.<emphasis>Taq</emphasis> DNA polymerase, from the extreme thermophile <emphasis>Thermus aquaticus</emphasis>, was the first enzyme isolated and purified for laboratory PCR use (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0047">47</link>). Since then, alternative polymerases have been purified and recombinantly expressed, and/or wholly synthesized, with improved performance characteristics (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0048">48</link>). These enhanced features include increased fidelity, the ability to synthesize long stretches of DNA, and enhanced processivity, which enable applications including molecular cloning, nucleic acid detection, and sequencing.</para>

As faster temperature changes, or ramping rates, are achieved, newer polymerases are developed to dramatically decrease the total time for a PCR from approximately an hour and a half to less than 30 min (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0049">49</link>). Recently described assays have demonstrated PCRs completed in under 3 min (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0051">51</link>).</para>

To prevent carryover amplicon contamination, the addition of uracil-<emphasis>N</emphasis>-glycosylase (UNG) to PCR mixes will cleave dUTP-containing targets during a 50°C incubation, prior to PCR amplification. Additionally, incorporation of biotinylated or fluorescently labeled primers during PCR can be used for subsequent downstream detection of products, through capillary electrophoresis or streptavidin hybridization.</para>

      <para id="ch0023s000000p0022">The cycling conditions depicted in<link linkend="ch0023s000000a0047">Fig. 8</link> are typical of routine PCR amplification; however, certain circumstances necessitate specialized protocols that are based on these general principles. Hot-start PCR is now more common and relies on a reversible inactivation of the DNA polymerase or deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) until the inhibitor is denatured at high temperature (&gt;90°C) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0053">53</link>). This allows one to assemble the PCR at room temperature without concern for nonspecific premature amplification. A second technique to increase the specificity of target amplification is nested PCR, in which one pair of outer primers amplifies a region external to the final target amplicon. A subsequent PCR with primers internal to the first pair then targets the specific region of interest. Nested PCR increases specificity by mitigating the impact of mispriming (i.e., when PCR primers bind to and amplify partially complementary off-target sequences), because it is unlikely that both sets of primers will bind to off-target regions. A second benefit of nested PCR is that this approach increases the yield of target from limited input nucleic acid. As a manual process, this approach has not been widely used in the clinical microbiology laboratory, as the second PCR step requires the open transfer of PCR amplicons, dramatically increasing the risk of workspace contamination. However, the benefits of increased specificity and decreased starting material needed for nested PCR have been leveraged by the automated (sample-to-answer) BioFire (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) FilmArray, which achieves multitarget amplification in a completely enclosed process (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0054">54</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0023s000000p0023">Another strategy to increase both yield and specificity is touchdown PCR, in which the annealing temperature is gradually decreased after each cycle of PCR (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0055">55</link>). The effect is that specific (on-target) products are preferentially amplified during the initial cycles and are then more abundant and provide more template (compared to off-target regions) for the cycles performed at lower temperatures. Similar to nested PCR, the impact of touchdown PCR on test performance is an overall increase in specificity and a decrease in the minimum starting material. Finally, multiplex PCR is an approach where more than one target is amplified in a given reaction (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0056">56</link>). The alternative of testing targets in separate reaction wells may decrease throughput and increase the risk of contamination. Multiplex PCR products can be detected via conventional gel-based methods or more routinely through fluorescent probe-based detection. Optimization of probe-based analysis includes ensuring that fluorescence emission signals do not overlap (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0044"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0048">Table 3</link>) and ensuring that primers are specific for products and do not interfere with each other. Similarly, the amplicon sizes must all be similar, as shorter products tend to amplify more efficiently than longer ones. The primer and probe concentrations must also be optimized such that all targets have an equal chance of amplification if present. Finally, if high-copy-number and low-copy-number targets are anticipated in the same mixture, competition for PCR reagents (polymerase, dNTPs, and Mg<superscript>2+</superscript> ions) may skew the quantification results. As a result of these challenges unique to multiplex PCR design, the number of targets routinely tested in such reactions is two to four; however, mixtures with seven or more targets have been described (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0058">58</link>).</para>

(A) The PCR process consists of serial temperature shifts, or cycles, that allow primer annealing, polymerase extension, and denaturation. Target DNA is initially denatured at temperatures exceeding 90°C, effectively dissociating all PCR components, including primers and enzymes. The subsequent annealing step decreases the temperature so that primers can specifically bind to complementary regions of the target DNA. Primers of 15 to 30 bases are annealed to target regions below the primer <emphasis>Tm</emphasis>, typically 50 to 65°C, based on nucleotide complementarity. DNA polymerase then binds this double-stranded complex and catalyzes phosphodiester bond formation between the 5<emphasis role="strong">′</emphasis> phosphate groups of incoming nucleotides and the 3<emphasis role="strong">′</emphasis> hydroxyl groups at the terminal ends of the primers (or newly incorporated nucleotides). This DNA synthesis reaction is typically performed at 68 to 72°C and results in the extension of primer-initiated DNA strands in the 5<emphasis role="strong">′</emphasis> to 3<emphasis role="strong">′</emphasis> direction. The polymerase will either dissociate once the 3<emphasis role="strong">′</emphasis> end of the template strand is reached or continue synthesis if amplifying the original (native) DNA molecule. Following a temperature increase to &gt;90°C, the primers, polymerase, and DNA strands dissociate. This completes one cycle of PCR, and both the original and newly synthesized DNA can serve as templates for the next cycle. (B) The PCR cycle is repeated multiple times to exponentially generate copies of the original and amplified target sequences. As a result, 2<superscript><emphasis>n</emphasis></superscript> DNA molecules can potentially be produced, where <emphasis>n</emphasis> is equivalent to the number of PCR cycles. With 100% PCR efficiency and unlimited reagents in a 40-cycle reaction, one molecule of DNA could theoretically generate 2<superscript>40</superscript>, or over one trillion, amplified copies.</title>

      <para id="ch0023s000000p0024">A common method to assess whether a nucleic acid target is present in an extracted specimen is to determine if there was any amplification during PCR. Classically this has been accomplished through gel electrophoresis. However, assessment of PCR products can occur through multiple, more user-friendly methodologies, including detection of sequence-specific fluorescent reporters or intercalating dyes (see below). Detection of PCR products is characterized as either “endpoint,” meaning that only the final signal or product is detected, or “real time,” where amplification signal is measured continuously during the process. Endpoint methods used in molecular microbiology laboratories include hybridization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and sequencing. In addition, specialized methods that utilize fluorescence-based detection of endpoint PCR products include melting curve analysis, high-definition PCR (HDPCR), and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), which are discussed below. One of the most common uses of end-point PCR products is a specific hybridization assay termed the line probe assay (LiPA). LiPA has generally been used for applications that involve genotype determination (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0052"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0056">Fig. 9</link>) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0059">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0060">60</link>). An advantage to LiPa and similar methods is an ability to differentiate between different endpoint products which may have been generated in the same reaction.</para>

      <para id="ch0023s000000p0025">Contrasting with endpoint methods, real-time PCR provides information about the amplification process in a continuous (real-time) manner. This is accomplished through measurements of PCR products after each cycle, as opposed to at the end of all cycles. An added advantage for the clinical laboratory is that performing amplification and detection in the same sealed reaction tube decreases the risk of amplicon contamination. Several requirements must be satisfied in order to leverage real-time PCR for pathogen detection, including the use of reagents that provide a signal proportional to the amount of PCR product, a PCR instrument capable of sensitively and specifically measuring that signal, and software to interpret the acquired data. Real-time instruments can vary in size and shape depending on the format for amplification and detection. Conventional instruments are simply 96-well thermocyclers outfitted with sensitive cameras and fluorescence excitation sources. The number of fluorescent wavelengths that can be simultaneously detected is fixed by the excitation source within the instrument. Iterations of these instruments include spinning disks or rotors holding capillary tubes with heated air to allow cycling (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0061">61</link>). The specific chemistries allowing detection of PCR products are described below and include various fluorescent dyes and sequence-specific probes. While real-time PCR has the potential for quantitative measurements, the vast majority of clinical assays take advantage of qualitative resulting.</para>

(A) The test device is impregnated with oligonucleotide probes specific for target sequence. Shown is an assay that differentiates HCV genotypes. Patient specimen containing HCV is amplified in an endpoint PCR, incorporating a fluorescent label during the reaction. Alternatively, biotin can be incorporated; however, this requires additional streptavidin-based detection. The entire PCR is then applied to the lateral-flow assay. Following subsequent temperature changes and wash steps, only the specific target remains bound. (B) The bound target can then be detected via a streptavidin-conjugated reporter that generates a color change when a chromogenic substrate is applied. Alternatively, one primer can be labeled with a specific fluorophore and detected with a fluorescence reader. Two controls often included in LiPA identify potential PCR inhibition (internal control) and false positives from nontarget hybridization (genotype-agnostic pathogen probe). In this image, a pan-HCV probe specific for all HCV genotypes and a hybridization control (HC) are used to ensure that the lateral flow reaches the adsorbent pad.</title>

TaqMan and similar hydrolysis probe-based approaches require both primers and separate probes for the PCR to proceed. The main differences between traditional PCR primers and hydrolysis probes are that the latter are blocked at their 3′ end, so that they cannot participate in PCR extension, and the annealing temperatures of hydrolysis probes are 5 to 10°C higher than those of PCR primers, so that they hybridize prior to the annealing and extension of the PCR primers. The specificity of this fluorescent detection system is a direct result of three sequence-specific oligonucleotides: the hydrolysis probe and the two flanking primers. Additionally, the use of differentially labeled probes with specific fluorophores facilitates multiplexing of two or more targets in the same reaction, maximizing the information about the targets present while minimizing DNA input and handling steps. Multiplexing also allows the user to incorporate internal controls to help discriminate PCR failure from a true negative result.</para>

        <para id="ch0023s000000p0031">Hybridization probes can be either a single molecule that hybridizes to the amplicon (molecular beacon) or one of two adjacent molecules that bind to target DNA (FRET [fluorescence resonance energy transfer] probes). There are many variations of these two mechanisms, including HyBeacons (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0070">70</link>), minor groove binding (MGB) probes (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0071">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0072">72</link>), and partially double-stranded linear probes (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0073">73</link>).

Thus, multiple molecular beacons can be used with the same PCR primers, which is useful if the same amplicon contains two alleles that can be used to differentiate pathogens.

While the fluorescence increases with the quantity of amplicons, this signal is not specific, so any amplicons, even if not the intended target, generate signal. Therefore, intercalating-dye-based methods are often coupled with melting curve analysis to evaluate specificity. SYBR green, EvaGreen, or SYTO dyes (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0075">75</link>) can be added to the PCR and fluorescence monitored over time. An important advantage over target-specific probes is cost, given that no specific oligonucleotide synthesis is required.

(B) Following extension, regions of DNA complementary to the stem-loop sequence of the Scorpion probe is synthesized. The 5<emphasis role="strong">′</emphasis> end does not specifically bind to the target sequence in its native form; however, as the temperature increases and DNA is synthesized during the elongation step, sequence complementarity allows a previously stable stem-loop structure to destabilize and the loop portion to hybridize to the newly created amplicon. (C) Following denaturation at the end of a PCR cycle, annealing of the covalently attached step-loop is favored, thus releasing the fluorophore from the quencher. The stem of the stem-loop structure is destabilized at 72°C, facilitating this reaction only during the elongation step. Note that the Scorpion probe is not degraded during this process.</title>

(B) FRET-based probes require two different probe molecules that bind adjacently on the target DNA. If one probe fails to anneal or nonadjacent binding occurs, the donor fluorophore will not be in close enough proximity to the acceptor fluorophore to be excited and emit fluorescence. With FRET technology, no quencher molecule is required, as the acceptor probe will not fluoresce unless these specific conditions are met.</title>

While the quantity of pathogen in whole blood, plasma, serum, urine, or CSF can be determined as a copy number in a given volume, usually copies per ml or international units per ml, lesion swabs and scrapings or upper and lower respiratory tract specimens can be greatly influenced by the adequacy of collection. The possibility of insufficient sampling must always be considered, but this is often difficult to identify unless a specific sample adequacy control is simultaneously included (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0079">79</link>). Finally, although one can easily conceptualize copies per volume, assay-to-assay differences may lead to effects on copy number commutability. For example, differences in amplicon sizes and biological fragmentation of target nucleic acid can lead to differences in sensitivity, even if a different version of the test from the same manufacturer is used (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0080">80</link>). Laboratories have addressed interassay variability through the use of calibrators traceable to a common or universal control material. International units (IUs) are assigned to a reference material (or international standard [IS]) by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the purpose of standardization, harmonization, and quality control (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0081">81</link>). These materials are then supplied to regional and national manufacturers of secondary reference reagents (traceable to the WHO IS) and indirectly to manufacturers who develop quantitative molecular assays calibrated to the IS. Importantly, the WHO IS is intended to resemble the analyte being measured as closely as possible. Therefore, patient-derived virus in plasma, not culture derived, is preferred for establishing the reference material.

While these relative amounts can be converted to absolute copy numbers if the assay is appropriately calibrated, digital PCR (dPCR) estimates the absolute quantity of target molecules at the conclusion of the PCR, without the specific need for calibration. While similar to endpoint PCR, instead of measuring the average fluorescence of amplicons in a single reaction, dPCR evaluates the qualitative presence or absence of PCR products in up to millions of individually partitioned reactions. Given the massively parallel nature of the PCRs, the technology used to compartmentalize individual reactions is critical to the success of dPCR (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0084">84</link>). These methods include the use of physical partitions (chambers in microwell plates and nanoplates) or liquid droplets (oil emulsion) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0084">84</link>). PCR performed within a chamber requires numerous physical partitions that allow filling, thermocycling, and result readouts. High-density low-volume partitions support increased throughput but often require complex automation for sample preparation. The most recent addition to dPCR is the use of nanoplate technology (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), in which five targets can be multiplexed in under 2 h and which has a capacity of 26,000 partitions per plate (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0085">85</link>). ddPCR (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0091"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0094">Fig. 17</link>) is a term reserved for oil emulsions in a single tube of &gt;20,000 reactions, which are subsequently interrogated for amplification through a flow-based method, similar to flow cytometry (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0086">86</link>).

The ability to dynamically modulate the reaction temperature adds complexity to the hardware required for testing, often resulting in large instruments with fastidious power and environmental requirements. The need to thermocycle also limits the speed at which testing can be performed, since the testing cannot end until an adequate number of cycles is reached. Finally, the requirement for a thermocycler can limit where PCR-based methods can be used, particularly in resource-disadvantaged countries.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0040">Innovative ways to amplify target nucleic acids independently of PCR have been described. Most of these techniques are isothermal, meaning that they can be performed at a single temperature. This dramatically simplifies hardware requirements, allowing the use of instruments that are essentially simple hot plates. The different chemistries employed also allow reactions that are often more rapid and robust than those in PCR-based approaches. The simplicity of instrumentation also makes isothermal techniques uniquely suited for testing in a variety of settings, including point of care. This has proven particularly useful in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during which the broad availability of molecular testing in a variety of locations was essential. Multiple assays amenable for point-of-care testing were designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 utilizing the technologies described below (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0091">91</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0092">92</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0041">Transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) is a commonly utilized form of PCR-free target amplification. The general principle of TMA is the use of RT to reverse transcribe RNA to cDNA (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0096"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0101">Fig. 18</link>). Since a single cDNA molecule can be used to generate hundreds of RNA molecules through transcription, the amplification achieved using TMA is more robust than that in PCR-based approaches, which rely on product doubling. The high sensitivity and relative ease of TMA have led to applications for the diagnosis of a wide variety of bacterial (e.g., <emphasis>Mycoplasma genitalium</emphasis>), parasitic (e.g., <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis>), and viral (e.g., West Nile virus) pathogens (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0093">93</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0095">95</link>). Although ease of performance and high sensitivity are advantages of TMA, this technology also has several disadvantages. The technology precludes the use of an internal control, which limits its ability to detect inhibitors of amplification or determine specimen adequacy. Given the nature of replication, product detection is often endpoint, rather than performed in real time. This limits the ability of most TMA assays to quantify target. However, quantitative TMA assays were recently described that utilize real-time product detection (similar to real-time PCR). These assays have been designed for viral load testing, including quantitative assays for HIV and HBV (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0096">96</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0097">97</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0042">Similar to how TMA utilizes the properties of reverse transcriptase, different forms of isothermal amplification exploit other unique molecules. While traditional PCR utilizes heat denaturation to expose single-stranded nucleic acid, there are naturally occurring enzymes that are also capable of doing this. For example, nicking endonucleases cleave single strands of the DNA double helix, opening sites on the intact strand for primer binding. These enzymes have been used for two different isothermal amplification approaches: strand displacement amplification (SDA) and nicking-enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR) (<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0097"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0107">Fig. 19</link>).

A limitation of this method is the potential for nonspecific binding of primers and resultant background signal.

The simple chemistry allows the Alethia platform (Meridian, Cincinnati, OH) to be small and amenable to point-of-care testing. However, the reliance on four different primers for assay function makes the actual design of LAMP assays challenging, often requiring specialty software. From a practical standpoint, the robust amplification can be a contamination risk if appropriate preventive measures are not taken. Another challenge with LAMP-based assays is in regard to assay specificity. Amplification detection is typically determined through a nonspecific measure, such as the precipitation of pyrophosphate produced during nucleic acid synthesis. As such, false positives may occur through nonspecific generation of nucleic acid product (i.e., primer dimers) or specimen-related factors which may impact the indirect measurement (i.e., specimen turbidity or color) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0115">115</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0117">117</link>).

Microarrays are dense grids of short DNA sequences (capture probes) bound to a solid phase at defined positions. When assays are performed, probes are hybridized to labeled nucleic acids, and the quantity of target sequences is determined by the signal at each position. Given their speed, throughput, and cost-effectiveness, microarrays have emerged as compelling platforms for diagnostic testing, and multiple tests have obtained regulatory clearance for use in diagnosing respiratory tract and bloodstream infections (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0125">125</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0127">127</link>).</para>

LAMP utilizes a combination of four different primers to create a dumbbell-shaped single-stranded nucleic acid intermediate with hairpin loops at either end. A key aspect of this structure is that it is self-priming at the hairpin loop sites. Elongation from these sites creates additional hairpin loops and additional primer-binding sites, all without the need for thermal separation of double-stranded nucleic acid. Whether nucleic acid amplification is occurring can then be determined utilizing precipitation of magnesium in the presence of pyrophosphate (released through nucleic acid synthesis) as an indirect measure of amplification. This allows the determination of positivity or negativity simply by measuring the change in reaction turbidity.</title>

Alternatively, advances in microfluidics have enabled sample-to-answer qPCR formats that are performed in a single reaction volume. For example, the BioFire platform (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) performs qPCR in single-use pouches composed of hard plastic reservoirs containing lyophilized reagents attached to flexible pieces of film harboring compartments (blisters) where individual reaction steps occur (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0149">149</link>). In an assay, lyophilized reagents are reconstituted, and specimens are added to the system. The pouch is then loaded into a desktop instrument that uses inflatable bladders to move the sample through sequential blisters where lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and reverse transcription are performed. To enhance specificity, the BioFire platform uses nested PCR to amplify target sequences. The first round of PCR is performed in a common reaction volume, and the products are then diluted and transferred to an array of microliter wells prespotted with secondary (internal) PCR primers. The array is sealed, and qPCR is performed using a fluorescent intercalating dye. Finally, melting curve analysis is used to confirm the specificity of the products, and results are integrated over targets to make detection calls.</para>

DNA probe sets are then hybridized to target sequences, with each set consisting of two half-probes. The 5′ end of each half-probe includes a universal PCR handle, and one half-probe also includes a variable-length spacer. The hybridized probes are then ligated, which generates novel templates that can be amplified using fluorescently labeled universal primers.

In particular, the need for test availability in a variety of settings has led to the development of assays that are easier to perform. These “sample-to-answer” assays are often capable of being performed without separate extraction steps, multiple instruments, technically demanding reagent handling, or manual result interpretation. While some chemistries, like isothermal amplification, are more amenable to this format than others, even more complex multistep processes like qPCR have been developed in sample-to-answer formats. This is often accomplished through the utilization of cartridge-based assays, in which liquid or freeze-dried reagents needed for testing are preloaded into single-use cartridges by the manufacturer. Multistep processes (e.g., extraction and PCR) are typically performed in separate chambers, with different strategies used to move patient samples from chamber to chamber. These strategies vary from a revolving pump and piston approach (used in the GeneXpert system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA)) to an electrostatic approach (used in the ePlex system) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0153">153</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0154">154</link>).

        <para id="ch0023s000000p0057">Testing using a sample-to-answer approach has significant advantages compared to traditional molecular methods. The simplicity of performance allows the availability of molecular testing in locations without extensive expertise or equipment. In its simplest form, this can even allow molecular testing at the point of patient care, the availability of which creates both new possibilities and new challenges. Point-of-care molecular testing allows rapid and highly sensitive testing for pathogens in a way that allows providers to obtain results during the patient interaction. This in turn can allow adjustments in therapy and counseling. The availability of testing for sexually transmitted infections in this way illustrates the dramatic impact that sample-to-answer molecular testing can have when performed at or near the point of care, as rapid molecular testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia yields definitive diagnosis of infection during the initial patient encounter. This allows diagnosis-directed treatment as well as patient counseling, which may help prevent infection spread (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0155">155</link>). In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, point-of-care applications allow testing to be available in a greater variety of sites. The ability to test patients outside a traditional hospital setting allows patients who are less critically ill to obtain results faster and prevents both overcrowding and subsequent disease spread. This also allows accurate molecular SARS-CoV-2 screening in a variety of settings, including airports, schools, and organized public gatherings. This trend of increasing availability suggests that molecular tests and platforms will soon become readily available for consumer purchase and at-home testing, which may further change the landscape of infectious disease testing.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0058">Cartridge-based sample-to-answer testing is not without its challenges. Test cartridges are complex in design, contain reagents necessary for testing, and are specific to the instrument used for testing. As such, they are not easily substituted. When a manufacturer is unable to supply the cartridges needed for testing, a laboratory may lose the ability to test altogether. Also, while the manual portion of the testing is simplified, the instrumentation itself is often more complex. Testing can fail secondary to mechanical issues inherent to the instrument, cartridge, or patient specimen (e.g., an overly mucoid specimen). Several manufacturers have added extra internal controls to their assay design to specifically detect mechanical malfunction of the assay. For example, several assays marketed by Cepheid utilize a “probe check” control to specifically determine whether the freeze-dried reagents were appropriately hydrated. Another limitation to some cartridge-based assays is the limited throughput that can be achieved on a single instrument. While smaller instruments may be more amenable to applications like point-of-care testing, these instruments can typically test only a limited number of cartridges at one time. Because of this, multiple instruments are often needed to achieve the throughput needed for high-volume clinical testing.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0059">The need for high-throughput, large-volume testing is addressed by another area of innovation in molecular testing.

These instruments are typically large, with extensive power and space requirements, so they are not very amenable to testing outside a centralized clinical laboratory. Most are designed to test specimens in large batches that are simultaneously loaded, though some have separate workflows that allow the testing of specimens on demand. Using robotic pipettes, transfer arms, conveyer belts, and other automated mechanisms, these instruments are able to combine extraction and amplification on a single platform. Since these instruments typically require only loading of specimens and reagents in order to function, they are still considered sample-to-answer technologies. However, since they often have long run times and are designed for batched testing, they are more amenable to high-volume testing that can tolerate longer turnaround times.</para>

The strategy underlying Sanger sequencing is to generate all possible subsequences of a region of interest while maintaining a fixed 5′ end and incorporating base-specific labels into the terminal nucleotides.

This is followed by a unique elongation step that randomly incorporates chain-terminating dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs). In contrast to dNTPs, ddNTPs lack 3′ hydroxyl groups, which are required to add nucleotides to DNA molecules via phosphodiester bond formation. By using a single (sequencing) primer and a mixture of dNTPs spiked with ddNTPs, this elongation step generates a population of DNA molecules with identical 5′ sequences and variable lengths.</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0063">Historically, Sanger sequencing was performed by running separate elongation reactions with different radiolabeled ddNTPs (ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, and ddTTP) and then separating the products by gel electrophoresis.

      <para id="ch0023s000000p0064">An important consideration for Sanger sequencing is that all fragments of a particular size contribute to the observed signal, so mixed populations of template molecules generate overlapping profiles that may be uninterpretable. Accordingly, primers must amplify target regions with high specificity to generate high-quality data. However, in some clinical scenarios, such as the emergence of a resistance mutation, it is desirable to detect the presence of two highly similar sequences in the same sample. Sanger sequencing can detect these mutations with a limit of detection of approximately 20%—i.e., mutations must be present in more than 20% of template molecules to be detected (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0165">165</link>).</para>

With the emergence of integrase inhibitors, these assays were expanded to target the HIV integrase as well (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0170">170</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0171">171</link>). Similar tests are available for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and cytomegalovirus. In general, these assays illustrate that Sanger sequencing is particularly effective for applications where the target space is limited and can be covered by a small number of sequencing reactions.</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0066">Another common clinical use of Sanger sequencing is the identification of bacterial and fungal isolates that are challenging to identify by routine testing. Sequence-based identification begins by amplifying target regions that are shared across broad groups of organisms (i.e., broad-range PCR). For bacteria, the most commonly targeted gene is 16S rRNA, the RNA component of the 30S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0172">172</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0173">173</link>). 16S rRNA harbors regions that are highly conserved across bacteria, meaning that they can be amplified with universal primers, as well as nine hypervariable regions, whose sequences can be used for genus- or species-level identification. Notably, not all clinically relevant species can be differentiated by 16S rRNA sequencing (e.g., <emphasis>Bacillus anthracis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Bacillus cereus</emphasis>). Other genes used to identify bacteria include the beta subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase (<emphasis>rpoB</emphasis>), elongation factor thermal unstable (<emphasis>tuf</emphasis>), gyrase A and B (<emphasis>gyrA</emphasis> and <emphasis>gyrB</emphasis>), manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (<emphasis>sodA</emphasis>), and heat shock proteins (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0174">174</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0180">180</link>). For fungi, the most commonly sequenced regions are the two internal transcribed spacers located between the genes encoding the 18S and 5.8S rRNAs (ITS1) and those encoding the 5.8S and 28S rRNAs (ITS2) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0181">181</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0183">183</link>). In addition, the sequences of the divergent domains (D1 and D2) of the 28S rRNA gene are used to differentiate certain fungi (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0184">184</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0185">185</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0067">In addition to identifying cultured isolates, broad-range PCR and sequencing can be used to detect pathogens directly from clinical specimens (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0172">172</link>). This approach is particularly valuable when pathogens are difficult to culture (e.g., due to antimicrobial therapy or the nature of the organism) and has been shown to improve the diagnostic yield in infective endocarditis, meningitis, and prosthetic joint infections (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0186">186</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0190">190</link>).

Next-generation sequencing workflows can generally be organized into (i) library preparation, (ii) clonal amplification, and (iii) sequencing. As described below, each of these steps is highly customizable, which allows next-generation sequencing to be adapted for a range of applications, including pathogen detection, quantification, and mutation analysis.</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0069">Next-generation sequencing begins with the preparation of a sequencing library—a population of DNA fragments consisting of insert molecules flanked by sequencing adapters (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0159">159</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0160">160</link>). Sequencing adapters are short (40- to 60-bp) oligonucleotides whose 5′ ends can be used to immobilize fragments on a solid phase as well as for amplification. Internal to these sequences, at least one sequencing adapter contains a primer binding site that is used to sequence the insert molecule. Often, both sequencing adapters have sequencing primer binding sites, so insert molecules can be sequenced from both ends (paired-end sequencing). In addition, sequencing adapters may contain additional primer binding sites that are used to read short (5- to 10-bp) adapter-specific indexes, which allows multiple libraries to be pooled and sequenced together. Alternatively, multiplexing can be achieved by placing adapter-specific barcodes immediately after the primary or secondary sequencing primer binding sites, so they are read with the insert sequences (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0193">193</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0070">The first step of sequencing library preparation is typically fragmentation, in which sonication or enzymatic digestion is used to reduce purified DNA molecules to a desired size range, usually 100 to 300 bp (<link linkend="ch0023s000000a0136">Fig. 24</link>). For RNA, fragmentation can be performed directly (e.g., using chemical shearing) or following reverse transcription. Fragmented molecules then undergo end repair to generate blunt-end DNA inserts with 5′ phosphate groups. This is followed by the addition of a deoxyadenosine to the 3′ end of each strand, which allows sequencing adapters with 3′ thymidine overhangs to be ligated onto both ends. Alternatively, tagmentation is an increasingly popular method for adding sequencing adapters in which a hyperactive transposase is used to simultaneously fragment input DNA and insert sequencing adapters (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0194">194</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0195">195</link>). After ligation or tagmentation, PCR is performed to enrich for library fragments with properly incorporated sequencing adapters. Finally, fragments within the desired size range are selected by gel purification or polyethylene glycol precipitation with polystyrene magnetic beads (AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0196">196</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0197">197</link>).</para>

For smaller target spaces, targeted next-generation sequencing is achieved by amplifying regions of interest via PCR and then preparing sequencing libraries from PCR amplicons. For longer PCR products, sequencing libraries can be prepared using the methods described above. Alternatively, sequencing adapters can be added directly to shorter PCR products either by incorporating the adapter sequences into the PCR primers or by restriction enzyme-mediated ligation. For larger target spaces, where amplification of individual targets is not practical, targeted sequencing is performed by preparing sequencing libraries from total nucleic acids and then enriching for target sequences via hybridization capture using biotinylated RNA or DNA baits (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0198">198</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0200">200</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0023s000000p0072">Once library preparation is complete, individual next-generation sequencing platforms use different technologies to generate signal and capture sequence information. One of the most widely used platforms, offered by Illumina (San Diego, CA), uses a sequencing-by-synthesis approach based on reversible terminator chemistry (<link linkend="ch0023s000000a0136">Fig. 24</link>) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0201">201</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0203">203</link>). Illumina sequencing begins by capturing denatured library fragments on a slide (flow cell) coated with oligonucleotides complementary to the sequencing adapters. In addition to capturing library fragments, the oligonucleotides bound to the flow cell act as forward and reverse PCR primers that are used to amplify captured fragments in an isothermal reaction called bridge amplification (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0204">204</link>). Bridge amplification produces localized clusters of thousands of PCR products whose sequences are identical to an individual library fragment. Depending on the flow cell type, bridge amplification generates hundreds of thousands to millions of clusters per square millimeter. The sequence of each cluster is then determined one nucleotide at a time using fluorescently labeled nucleotides with chemically reversible azidomethyl blocking groups (<link linkend="ch0023s000000a0136">Fig. 24</link>) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0201">201</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0203">203</link>).</para>

Compared to Illumina platforms, Ion Torrent produces longer reads (up to 600 bp), although its accuracy is modestly lower (per-nucleotide error rate of 1 to 2% for Ion Torrent versus &lt;1% for Illumina), particularly within homopolymer runs (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0206">206</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0074">A third next-generation sequencing platform, pyrosequencing, was actually the first massively parallel sequencing technology developed, although it is not widely used for clinical testing (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0207">207</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0209">209</link>). Pyrosequencing uses emulsion PCR to generate clonal populations of DNA molecules bound to agarose beads, which are then transferred to a fiber-optic slide etched with millions of picoliter-volume wells mounted in a flow chamber. Sequencing primers and polymerase are added, and individual nucleotides are added one at a time. Whereas Ion Torrent uses electrochemical sensors to detect hydrogen ions released by nucleotide incorporation, pyrosequencing uses bioluminescence to detect the release of pyrophosphate groups. This is achieved by an enzymatic cascade in which pyrophosphate is first converted to ATP via ATP sulfurylase. Luciferase then uses ATP to oxidize luciferin and generate light, which is detected by a charge-coupled device camera (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0210">210</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0075">Given the scale and complexity of next-generation sequencing data, computational tools play an important role in data analysis. A comprehensive review of next-generation sequencing bioinformatics is beyond the scope of this chapter, but we provide the following overview for context (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0211">211</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0217">217</link>). The initial process of inferring nucleotides from raw signal (e.g., fluorescence or voltage data) is known as base calling and is performed using platform-specific software. For each read, base callers output a unique identifier (including relevant metadata), the observed sequence, and quality scores (estimated accuracies) for each nucleotide. For multiplexed runs, reads from distinct libraries are split into separate files based on index reads or barcodes. Sequencing reads are then quality controlled to trim reads with an excess of low-quality bases, remove adapter sequences if present, and/or remove other undesired sequences (e.g., reads aligning to the human genome). Depending on the application, processed reads are then aligned to a reference sequence, assembled <emphasis>de novo</emphasis>, or their sequence content can be directly queried against reference databases. The choice of appropriate reference databases can be challenging, as the most comprehensive databases (such as the aggregated nucleotide database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information) are more likely to contain erroneous or misannotated sequences, whereas more curated databases (such as the d<emphasis role="underline">a</emphasis>tabase for <emphasis role="underline">r</emphasis>egulatory-<emphasis role="underline">g</emphasis>rade micr<emphasis role="underline">o</emphasis>bial <emphasis role="underline">s</emphasis>equences [ARGOS], maintained by the Food and Drug Administration) include fewer pathogens (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0218">218</link>). Importantly, as public reference databases and bioinformatic tools are updated frequently, clinical microbiology laboratories must implement structured plans to monitor, update, and revalidate their bioinformatic pipelines on an ongoing basis.</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0076">Currently, clinical applications of next-generation sequencing are somewhat limited by cost as well as testing complexity. Nevertheless, next-generation sequencing is playing an increasingly important role in specific analytical tasks, such as the detection of resistance mutations. For example, the Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay (Vela Diagnostics, Fairfield, NJ) was recently shown to improve the sensitivity of antiretroviral resistance mutation detection, accurately identifying mutations down to a threshold of 5% (compared to 20% for Sanger sequencing) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0219">219</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0220">220</link>).

      <para id="ch0023s000000p0077">In principle, one of the most powerful clinical applications of next-generation sequencing would be to directly sequence total nucleic acids (both RNA and DNA) from specimens of interest to comprehensively identify clinically relevant pathogens. This approach, known as metagenomic next-generation sequencing, has been the focus of intense development, but its clinical role is not yet well defined (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0223">223</link>). The potential value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing is the ability to identify, quantify, and characterize pathogens directly from patient specimens with limited bias (i.e., without requiring pathogens to be cultured or harbor specific genes). The challenges that have constrained the implementation of metagenomic next-generation sequencing include turnaround time, cost, standardization, and the complexity of analysis. Furthermore, given the high sensitivity of metagenomic next-generation sequencing, interpretation can be challenging, as it can be difficult to determine if detected organisms contribute to a given patient’s presentation and/or how that information should guide clinical decision-making. Despite these limitations, several metagenomic next-generation sequencing tests are now available, and early studies have suggested clinical utility in carefully selected patient populations. Currently, these include the Galileo viral panel (Arc Bio, Cambridge, MA) for viral detection from multiple specimen types (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0224">224</link>), the Karius test (Karius, Redwood City, CA) for comprehensive pathogen detection (excluding RNA viruses) from plasma cell-free DNA (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0225">225</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0228">228</link>), and metagenomic next-generation sequencing performed at the University of California, San Francisco, for comprehensive pathogen detection from plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0229">229</link>–<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0231">231</link>).</para>

In addition, long-read sequencing determines the sequence of individual molecules, whereas short-read sequencing analyzes clonal populations of library fragments. Long-read sequencing technologies therefore offer several key advantages: long reads improve the quality of genome assemblies, minimal library preparation mitigates amplification bias related to GC content, the sequencing process is faster, and many instruments require less initial capital expenditure. Nevertheless, long-read sequencing has not been widely adopted in clinical laboratories, largely due to higher error rates (approximately 10%) and a lack of standardized assays, but these are areas of active development (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0233">233</link>).</para>

To prepare material for PacBio sequencing, purified DNA is first fragmented to approximately 10 to 20 kb. This is followed by end repair and the addition of hairpin adapters, yielding double-stranded DNA that forms circular templates when denatured. Sequencing primers with poly(A) tails are annealed to the adapter sequences, and these complexes are bound by DNA polymerase. The free poly(A) tails are then used to immobilize polymerase-bound DNA on oligo(dT)-coated magnetic beads.</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0080">After template molecules are prepared for sequencing, they are loaded onto an array of millions of nanometer-scale cylindrical wells (zero-mode waveguides) adhered to a glass surface (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0236">236</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0237">237</link>). The diameter of these structures is approximately 70 nm, smaller than the wavelength of light used to illuminate the array, which prevents light from propagating through the waveguides and confines the observable space to an extremely small (zeptoliter) volume. Following template loading, polymerase-bound DNA complexes are magnetically immobilized at the bottom of each waveguide, and DNA elongation is performed using nucleotides with base-specific fluorophores conjugated to their terminal phosphates. Labeled nucleotides diffuse through the observable volume on a time scale of microseconds, but nucleotide incorporation leads to fluorophores being retained in the detection volume for several milliseconds (until the pyrophosphate is cleaved). This generates transient increases in fluorescence (pulses), and the series of color-coded pulses from individual waveguides corresponds to the sequence of the template molecules. Notably, the per-base error rate of PacBio is relatively high (approximately 13%) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0238">238</link>). One strategy to address this is circular consensus sequencing, in which individual template molecules are sequenced continuously (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0239">239</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0240">240</link>).

In contrast to other sequencing methods, which monitor DNA replication, nanopore sequencing determines nucleotide identities directly from native nucleic acids. Nanopore sequencing is a flexible technology that has been adapted for a range of applications using different library preparation techniques. Notably, Oxford Nanopore Technologies offers benchtop instruments comparable to the platforms described above as well as a pocket-sized instrument, MinION, that is particularly promising for field applications and epidemiologic surveillance (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0246">246</link>). Library preparation for nanopore sequencing typically begins with a high-molecular-weight DNA extraction followed by the addition of sequencing adapters (with or without fragmentation and/or end repair). These sequencing adapters include at least one double-stranded oligonucleotide known as a leader sequence, which is bound on one strand by a motor protein (e.g., phage phi29 polymerase or a helicase) (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0244">244</link>). The second sequencing adapter is either a second leader sequence or a hairpin oligonucleotide. Finally, depending on the application, tethering oligonucleotides conjugated to hydrophobic moieties are annealed to each adapter.</para>
      <para id="ch0023s000000p0082">These complexes are loaded onto a nanopore sequencing instrument, which contains chambers filled with an ionic solution separated by a polymer membrane embedded with hundreds to thousands of nanometer-scale protein pores. Tethered library molecules associate with the membrane, and the adapter-bound motor proteins unzip double-stranded DNA and guide one strand through each pore. A voltage is then applied across the membrane, generating ionic currents that are monitored continuously by a sensor array. This voltage also drives single-stranded DNA molecules through the pores, producing sequence-specific disruptions in current. Because several nucleotides occupy the pore at any one time, the profile of current over time is generated by small overlapping subsequences, called k-mers. Therefore, determining the underlying DNA sequence requires segmenting these profiles into discrete events and then inferring the associated k-mers. The motor proteins act to slow DNA translocation so that changes in current can be measured more accurately, but the raw signal is still noisy, and the overall error rate is 10 to 15%. Of note, preparing libraries with hairpin adapters leads to both strands being sequenced in series, generating reads that can be used for error correction to reduce the error rate to 5 to 10%.</para>

        <para id="ch0023s000000p0085">SHERLOCK is based on the same principle as DETECTR, except that it uses Cas13a, which recognizes RNA target sequences and harbors nonspecific RNase (as opposed to DNase) activity (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0258">258</link>). Accordingly, SHERLOCK incorporates an <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> transcription step after isothermal amplification to generate a population of RNA molecules for detection, and SHERLOCK probes are RNA oligonucleotides labeled with a quenched fluorophore. Of note, a second version of this assay, SHERLOCK v2, incorporates activator RNA oligonucleotides as well as an additional CRISPR-associated protein, Csm6, to enhance sensitivity (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0256">256</link>). In SHERLOCK v2, target-mediated activation of Cas13a leads to the degradation of nontarget (collateral) RNAs, including probes as well as activator RNAs. The cleaved activators act as second messengers to activate Csm6, which also cleaves probe molecules, amplifying signal generation (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0262">262</link>). Like DETECTR, SHERLOCK can also be implemented as a lateral-flow assay (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0263">263</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0086">Both DETECTR and SHERLOCK have the potential to enable rapid and sensitive pathogen detection using assay formats that require minimal specialized equipment. For example, research studies have reported that DETECTR can be run in under 40 min with positive and negative agreements of 95% and 100%, respectively, compared to conventional qPCR (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0261">261</link>). Similarly, SHERLOCK can be run in under an hour, with positive and negative agreements of 93% and 99% (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0263">263</link>). Nevertheless, additional prospective studies are needed to evaluate the performance of CRISPR-Cas pathogen detection using clinical samples.</para>

There are, however, several unique aspects of molecular testing that should be considered when developing a quality control and quality assurance strategy. As with all clinical laboratory testing, external quality controls are needed to ensure proper assay performance. Qualitative assays require at least one positive and one negative control, whereas quantitative assays require a low-positive, high-positive, and a negative control (to ensure proper qualitative and quantitative result reporting). The results from external quality control testing should be monitored over time, and deviations from expected results should be investigated.</para>
        <anchor id="ch0023s000000a0146"/>
        <beginpage pagenum="166"/>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0088">One challenge of molecular testing is that assays may be implemented in a way that utilizes multiple instruments (for example, extraction followed by amplification). When separate extraction and amplification instruments are utilized, it is important that the external control strategy apply to the entirety of the testing process. External controls should be used in a way that proves that each extraction and amplification associated with a given sample is effective prior to result reporting. Examples of potential external control strategies are given in<anchor id="ch0023s000000a0147"/><link linkend="ch0023s000000a0149">Fig. 26</link>.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0089">The ideal external control material should also be as close as possible to the makeup of the actual target to be tested. For instance, using plasmid as positive control material does not test the ability of the extraction process to physically extract nucleic acids from an intact virion. Many manufacturers have addressed this by utilizing “armored viral constructs” as control material (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0264">264</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0265">265</link>). The availability of acceptable control material can be particularly challenging when considering highly multiplexed syndromic assays with often more than 20 targets per test. In this setting, it may be necessary to purchase or prepare control material that is positive for numerous targets.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0090">Internal controls are also an important component of most molecular assays. Molecular assays all have some degree of susceptibility to inhibition by external substances. Internal controls are substances either added to or intrinsic to a tested sample that can be assayed in parallel to the target of interest. Failure to detect an internal control could signify the presence of assay inhibitors, suggesting that the result should more appropriately be reported as indeterminate or invalid, rather than negative. Intrinsic internal controls are targets that should be present in every adequately collected sample (e.g., human housekeeping genes) so they can be used to make determinations regarding specimen adequacy (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0266">266</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0091">Quality assurance plans should be designed with consideration of the challenges and potential pitfalls of molecular testing. Molecular methods are exquisitely sensitive, making them very susceptible to false positivity due to environmental contamination. Traditionally, one of the most significant sources of environmental contamination has been amplified target (amplicon) from positive specimens. This risk can be partially mitigated through the adoption of laboratory practices that separate the working of patient specimens and specimen extraction from the amplification of patient specimens and the manipulation of amplified product. The evolution of real-time PCR techniques and testing cassettes that completely seal off amplified product from the environment has also done much to mitigate this risk over recent years (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0267">267</link>). Though amplicon contamination is still a possibility in areas of molecular testing, perhaps of greater concern now is the risk of contamination with actual target. This is because highly sensitive molecular tests are more often being employed in point-of-care settings, many of which are the same settings in which patients are actively shedding pathogen.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0092">Environmental contamination can be detected through different mechanisms. Unexpected positivity in a negative external control can be an indicator of environmental contamination. Laboratories can also indirectly monitor for environmental contamination by following positivity rates over time. Unfortunately, this mechanism often recognizes the problem after it has had a significant impact, and it can be challenging for targets that are expected to vary over time (e.g., seasonal respiratory viruses). A more proactive approach to monitoring for contamination is the use of scheduled environmental testing. This entails sampling different areas of the laboratory involved in the testing process and testing the swab specimens for positivity. Any positivity should prompt thorough cleaning and retesting.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0093">While monitoring for environmental contamination is an important component of a molecular quality assurance plan, there are other aspects which should be considered. Many of the pathogens targeted by molecular assays undergo mutations over time that may affect assay performance. Enrollment in a proficiency testing program including challenges with contemporary isolates can help laboratories ensure that their testing is up to date. Differences in performance may also be secondary to problems with reagents (e.g., reagent contamination or breakdown secondary to improper storage). As such, laboratories should verify the performance of new lots of reagents prior to putting them into use and carefully track lot numbers to be prepared in the event of a manufacturer recall. Monitoring of error rates and associated factors can also be helpful early indicators of potentially serious assay issues. Perhaps the most important aspect of a quality assurance plan is making sure it is based on an adequate risk assessment of the setting in which the testing is being performed. Since this can change over time, quality assurance plans for molecular testing should be dynamic and re-evaluated frequently.</para>

        <para id="ch0023s000000p0094">There are several unique aspects to the reporting of molecular diagnostic tests which must be considered. Of utmost importance is communication in the result report of the methodology utilized for testing. In comparison to other testing modalities, such as culture and antigen detection, molecular methods have nuances that providers must consider. They are exquisitely sensitive, which may lead to the detection of subclinical levels of pathogen (e.g., detection of latent cytomegalovirus [CMV] nucleic acid in a whole-blood specimen). Since they are designed solely to detect nucleic acid, their positivity does not necessarily signify the presence of active pathogen. In fact, many pathogens have well-documented periods of clinically insignificant persistent molecular positivity following disease resolution (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0268">268</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0269">269</link>). Given these challenges in the interpretation of molecular results, it is imperative that health care providers know whether a test result was obtained using a molecular test.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0095">The amount of detail that goes into describing the methodology used in a patient report is variable. While the information regarding the specific test utilized should always be available to share in the event of provider inquiries, sharing the exact method utilized in each patient result may result in more confusion than clarity. For instance, providers may more readily understand a report stating the testing was performed by “nucleic acid amplification” rather than a report stating that the testing was performed by “helicase-dependent amplification.” In some instances, a laboratory may even be utilizing different molecular technologies to report testing for the same analyte, as became common during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, during which most clinical laboratories had to distribute testing among different platforms to meet demand. Provided that the methods have been shown to have similar clinical performance, considering them all nucleic acid amplification tests in clinical reports may suffice. However, instances in which there are significant differences in method performance should be readily distinguished in the result report. For example, PNA-FISH performed directly on a body fluid would be expected to have a much different performance than real-time PCR, so the two should be reported in such a way that providers can tell which test was performed.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0096">The introduction of broadly multiplexed assays presents another reporting challenge. Since many of these tests have &gt;10 targets, providers may not be aware of what pathogens are actually being tested for, potentially leading to unnecessary additional testing. To prevent this, all results from multiplexed assays should be reported with an inclusive list of targets that were evaluated. Whether the result was obtained as a part of a multiplexed assay should therefore be easily discernible to providers interpreting results.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0097">The reporting of qualitative results requires several important considerations. The language utilized when referring to a positive result matters and for most commercially available assays is specifically prescribed. Since molecular assays simply measure the presence or absence of nucleic acid, targets are typically reported with exact language, such as “detected/not detected” or “present/absent”. Reporting results as “positive/negative” is occasionally utilized, though for targets whose mere presence does not necessarily indicate disease status (e.g., CMV in blood), this may be misleading. Careful attention should also be paid to instances in which it is inappropriate to report either as “detected” or “not detected.” For instance, real-time PCR specimens that fail to detect both target and internal control are often better reported as “indeterminate,” since they cannot safely be assumed to be negative. In this situation, an added comment regarding the possible presence of inhibitory substances may be appropriate.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0098">Every quantitative molecular infectious disease test has both a qualitative (detected/not detected) and quantitative (numerical value) component, so these assays are still affected by the nuances of qualitative reporting. There are additional considerations, though, when reporting the quantitative component. Every quantitative assay should have a range of results established by the manufacturer and reporting laboratory for which quantitation is deemed accurate. This range is referred to as the analytical measurement range (AMR) and is bound by the lower limit of quantitation (LLQ) and the upper limit of quantitation (ULQ). Results within this range can be reported as discrete quantities, whereas results outside of this range should be reported as “less than LLQ” or “greater than ULQ”. Accurate quantitation of results greater than the ULQ can be obtained through specimen dilution and mathematical correction of the dilution factor, though this is a process that needs to be validated by the performing laboratory.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0099">Another important component of quantitative reporting is the units utilized and the way the numerical values are provided. Most quantitative assays report results in copies/ml, though if an assay is calibrated to international units, results should be reported in IU/ml to preserve assay-to-assay commutability. Since many quantitative results are used to trend positivity over time, attention should be paid to the way numerical values are reported. While a difference between 100,000 copies/ml and 200,000 copies/ml may seem significant, patient results from viral load assays can vary as much as half a log (base 10) based on physiological and assay variance (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0270">270</link>). As such, it is recommended that viral load results be reported as base 10 log-transformed values. Care should also be given as to how exactly results trend in electronic medical records, particularly when different specimen types may be utilized. For example, providers may wish to monitor trends in BK virus in both urine and plasma, though, since these specimen types are expected to have very different kinetics, monitoring trends in both sample types together could be misleading.</para>
        <para id="ch0023s000000p0100">Consideration should also be given to when it is appropriate to report a quantitative value. As stated previously, quantitative assays require thorough evaluation of the range of quantitation to ensure quantitative accuracy. There are many assays that should not be reported in a quantitative manner due to preanalytical (e.g., variable specimen dilution), analytical (e.g., wide variance of<emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>T</emphasis></subscript>values), or postanalytical (e.g., quantitation means little clinically) factors. While these qualitative assays may provide quantitative information in the form of <emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>T</emphasis></subscript>values or relative light units, laboratories must use the same rigor in reporting these results as they would any other quantitative value (including formal evaluation of quantitative accuracy across the AMR). If the laboratory cannot formally establish quantitative accuracy, the quantitative result should not be reported.</para>

        <para id="ch0023s000000p0101">The process of reporting results has been an area of innovation in recent years. Many new molecular devices are designed to deliver results rapidly, with the assumption that this will allow improvements in patient care. However, the impact of rapid molecular testing is variable, and often less than anticipated. This can be mitigated through unique postanalytical reporting strategies. For instance, rapid molecular results containing information regarding the presence or absence of antimicrobial resistance genes may be difficult for unfamiliar providers to interpret, making them reluctant to change therapy without consultation. Developing a system in which results are directly reported to subject matter experts (i.e., infectious disease specialists or pharmacists) has been shown to more reliably result in treatment adjustments. For less complex molecular results, mechanisms of direct-to-patient reporting have been shown to be effective ways to capitalize on the speed of rapid molecular testing. This has been utilized in outpatient and emergency department settings, where patients leave shortly after providing a clinical sample for testing. Through this type of reporting, patients can be given conditional instructions (e.g., fill a prescription) based on the result. Direct-to-patient reporting strategies have been described for various pathogens, including group A<emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> and those causing sexually transmitted infections (<link linkend="ch0023s000000li0271">271</link>, <link linkend="ch0023s000000li0272">272</link>).</para>
