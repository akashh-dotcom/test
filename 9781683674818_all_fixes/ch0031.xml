      <para id="ch0031s0001p0001">History is full of accounts of humans using bioweapons for destructive purposes. Because of incidents such as the release of chemical and biological agents by the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo in the Tokyo subway system in the 1990s and the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States (<link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0001">1</link>), clinical microbiology laboratories must be prepared to rapidly rule out potential biothreat agents. Many nations destroyed stocks of biological weapons and toxins and stopped biothreat agent development as a result of signing the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972. The BWC prohibits developing, producing, or stockpiling biological and toxin weapons (<ulink url="https://www.un.org/disarmament/biological-weapons/">https://www.un.org/disarmament/biological-weapons/</ulink>). Unfortunately, biothreat agents are still a very real possibility in the modern world.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0001p0002">The ideal qualities of a successful biothreat agent are a high rate of illness in exposed persons/animals, a high case fatality rate, a short incubation period, and a paucity of immunity in the target population. In addition, success is also influenced by whether treatment is available, the person-to-person transmissibility of the agent, the ease with which the agent can be produced and disseminated, and a disease that is difficult, at least initially, to recognize clinically or to diagnose.</para>
      <para id="ch0031s0001p0003">General clues that one may be dealing with an unrecognized biothreat event include a large outbreak of illness with a high death rate, a recognized case(s) of an uncommon disease, illness in a geographic region where the disease is not endemic, disease occurring out of season, simultaneous outbreaks of the same disease in various parts of the country/world, and the presence of sick and dying animals. Organisms that pose the greatest threat as potential biothreat agents are classified as tier 1 select agents (<anchor id="ch0031s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0031s0001s0001a0004">Table 1</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0031s0001s0001p0001">The Laboratory Response Network (LRN) was established through the work of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the CDC, in accordance with Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 39 (dated 21 June 1995) and PDD 62 (dated 22 May 1968). Presidential Decision Directive 39 made the fight against terrorism a top national security priority and defined policies regarding the federal response to threats or acts of terrorism involving nuclear, biological, and/or chemical material and/or weapons of mass destruction. Specifically, this directive outlined the United States’ efforts to “deter, defeat, and respond vigorously to all terrorist attacks on our territory and against our citizens, or facilities, whether they occur domestically, in international waters or airspace, or on foreign territory. The United States regards all such terrorism as a potential threat to national security as well as a criminal act and will apply all appropriate means to combat it.” In doing so, “the U.S. shall vigorously pursue efforts to deter and preempt, apprehend and prosecute, or assist other governments to prosecute, individuals who perpetrate or plan to perpetrate such attacks” (<ulink url="http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd39.htm">http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd39.htm</ulink>).</para>
        <para id="ch0031s0001s0001p0002">Through a collaborative effort involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), the LRN was established in August 1999. Its objective was to improve and ensure an effective laboratory response to bioterrorism. The LRN worked toward this goal by improving the public health infrastructure, increasing laboratory capacity and staffing, and training laboratory personnel in advanced diagnostic technologies. The LRN forms an integrated network of more than 120 local and state public health, federal, and military laboratories (representing all 50 states) that can respond to bioterrorism, chemical terrorism, and other public health emergencies. There are also international laboratories involved in the LRN (<ulink url="https://emergency.cdc.gov/lrn/faq.asp">https://emergency.cdc.gov/lrn/faq.asp</ulink>).</para>

        <para id="ch0031s0001s0001p0004">There are thousands of private and commercial laboratories (including clinical, food testing, veterinary diagnostic, and environmental testing laboratories) in the United States, a large number of which serve as critical sentinel laboratories. While the majority of these laboratories do not perform confirmatory testing, they represent the first contact with patients and are in a position to alert public health officials of possible biothreat agents. These laboratories conduct tests to rule out other diseases and send possible biothreat samples/organisms to the designated LRN reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. The LRN structure is shown in<anchor id="ch0031s0001s0001a0007"/><link linkend="ch0031s0001s0001a0009">Fig. 1</link>.</para>

LRN reference laboratories are responsible for investigation and/or referral of specimens to LRN national laboratories. LRN national laboratories, including those operated by the CDC, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) have specialized infrastructure, training, and biosecurity that are necessary for handling highly infectious biological agents. These laboratories are responsible for confirming the referred isolates from the sentinel and LRN reference laboratories utilizing techniques and assays not available to those laboratories, to determine specialized strain characterizations, perform susceptibility testing, and carry out bioforensics.</para>

These protocols were developed by subject matter experts from ASM and APHL to assist LRN sentinel laboratories to rapidly rule out biothreat agents or refer suspected biothreat agents to the appropriate or designated LRN reference laboratory. Through the partnership with APHL and CDC, ASM serves as a resource for training and education for microbiologists in hospital and commercial laboratories.

        <para id="ch0031s0001s0002p0001">The Federal Select Agent Program was established in response to a heightened concern about the ease with which disease-causing agents could be obtained (<ulink url="https://www.selectagents.gov/">https://www.selectagents.gov/</ulink>). Section 511 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-132) directed the HHS to establish a list of biological agents and toxins that could threaten public health and safety, procedures for governing the transfer of those agents, and training requirements for entities working with these select agents. HHS delegated the authority to implement this Act to the CDC, which then established the CDC Select Agent Program.</para>
        <para id="ch0031s0001s0002p0002">Congress significantly strengthened oversight of select agents after the anthrax attacks of 2001 by passing the USA Patriot Act and the Bioterrorism Act, which together restricted access to select agents and increased safeguards and security measures, as well as oversight of the possession and use of select agents. In addition to strengthening the regulatory authorities of the CDC, the Bioterrorism Act also granted comparable regulatory authorities to the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over select agents that pose a severe threat to animal and plant health or products. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) then established the Agricultural Select Agent Program. These two programs constitute the Federal Select Agent Program.</para>
        <para id="ch0031s0001s0002p0003">The Program greatly enhances the nation’s oversight of the safety and security of select agents by developing, implementing, and enforcing the Select Agent Regulations, maintaining a national database, inspecting entities that possess, use, or transfer select agents, and ensuring that all individuals who work with these agents undergo a security risk assessment performed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation/Criminal Justice Information Service. Laboratories that possess, use, or transfer select agents must register with the select agent program using APHIS/CDC Form 1 (Application for Registration for Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins [<ulink url="https://www.selectagents.gov/forms.html">https://www.selectagents.gov/forms.html</ulink>]). The list of agents that the Federal Select Agent Program regulates is summarized in <link linkend="ch0031s0001s0001a0004">Table 1</link>. The list is reviewed by the CDC and APHIS at least every 2 years to determine if agents need to be added to or deleted from the list. For example, <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> species were deleted from the select agent list in 2012. The most recent addition to the select agent list was chimeric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)/SARS-CoV-2 that result from manipulation of SARS-CoV-2 to incorporate nucleic acid from SARS-CoV. A laboratory that identifies a select agent or toxin is required by the select agent program to report the identification within 7 days using APHIS/CDC Form 4A (the requirement is 30 days for botulinum neurotoxin and staphylococcal enterotoxins A to E). Identified select agents must be transferred or destroyed within 7 days (30 days for botulinum neurotoxin and staphylococcal enterotoxins A to E).</para>

The use of automated systems when performing testing for select agents may lead to unnecessary exposure to these potentially dangerous organisms. In addition, automated systems, including MALDI-TOF MS, may not identify select agents or may misidentify these pathogens without the proper databases. For example,<emphasis>Yersinia pestis</emphasis> may be misidentified as <emphasis>Y. pseudotuberculosis</emphasis>, or <emphasis>Burkholderia pseudomallei</emphasis> may be misidentified as <emphasis>B. thailandensis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0003">3</link>).</para>

In addition, the case fatality rate for anthrax associated with release as a biothreat agent is usually very high if treatment is delayed. In 1979, an outbreak of anthrax with a large number of fatalities occurred in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg), in the former USSR (<link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0006">6</link>).

The organisms primarily associated with human disease produce toxin types A, B, E, and F (<link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0018">18</link>). Foodborne botulism is naturally acquired from contaminated food products processed by methods that do not destroy spores.

Wound botulism is often associated with injection of black tar heroin (<link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0018">18</link>). The clinical presentation associated with a bioterrorism attack with botulinum would include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) followed by neurological signs, including dry mouth and blurred and/or double vision. In cases of severe disease, symptoms include difficulty swallowing, voice impairment, and peripheral muscle weakness. If the muscles of the respiratory tract are involved, respiratory failure and death may result (<link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0005">5</link>). Botulism is usually a clinical diagnosis. While it is possible for clinical laboratories to recover <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> from clinical specimens, there are no recommended tests that sentinel-level laboratories should perform.

Disease consists of symptoms such as malaise, fever, chills, vomiting, headache, and backache, with the eventual formation of a papular rash on the face, hands, and arms, later spreading to the legs and, lastly, the trunk.

        <para id="ch0031s0011s0001p0001">Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) was part of the United States’ bioweapons program and was stockpiled and weaponized until the early 1970s (<link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0019">19</link>). SEB was thought to be useful as a weapon due to its ease of aerosolization, stability, and ability to produce multisystem organ failure and death if inhaled in large amounts. Even if inhaled in smaller amounts, this toxin produces a debilitating disease that takes up to 2 weeks for recovery. In addition, SEB was considered a possible bioweapon because the toxin causes disease if ingested. The former USSR probably also experimented with weaponizing SEB (<link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0019">19</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0031s0011s0002p0001">SEB is one of several enterotoxins produced by<emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>, which is a ubiquitous, nonmotile, Gram-positive coccus found on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and animals. SEB is also a potent superantigen capable of massive overstimulation of the immune system, resulting in an overwhelming inflammatory response and an endotoxin-like shock which can result in multisystem organ failure and death (<link linkend="ch0031s0011s0004li0005">5</link>). See ASM’s sentinel-level clinical microbiology laboratory guidelines for staphylococcal enterotoxin B (<ulink url="https://asm.org/Articles/CPHMC/Laboratory-Response-Network-LRN-Sentinel-Level-C">https://asm.org/Articles/CPHMC/Laboratory-Response-Network-LRN-Sentinel-Level-C</ulink>). There are no tests that sentinel laboratories should perform for SEB. Samples should be sent to an LRN reference-level laboratory, which will assist in locating an appropriate testing laboratory. Additional information regarding SEB can be found in <ulink url="ch0037#ch0037s0001">chapter 21</ulink>.</para>

        <para id="ch0031s0011s0003p0001">Bioweapons are still a potential threat in the modern world. Clinical laboratories participate in the LRN as sentinel laboratories and enhance our ability to respond to these potential threats. Clinical laboratories are often the first entities in the medical system to notice that a potential biothreat agent has been recovered and thus have a very important readiness function. Sentinel laboratories refer specimens and culture isolates to reference laboratories, which are often state-level public health laboratories. The reference laboratories perform confirmatory testing and refer to national laboratories for definitive characterization.</para>
        <para id="ch0031s0011s0003p0002">The Federal Select Agent Program oversees the safety and security of select agents for the United States.<link linkend="ch0031s0001s0001a0004">Table 1</link> shows the regulated select agents and toxins. The select agents and toxins that pose the greatest risk for a high-consequence event are designated tier 1 agents. ASM, with the APHL and the CDC, maintains sentinel laboratory protocols for these high-risk agents. Sentinel laboratories should routinely use these protocols to rule out potential select agents.</para>

        <para id="ch0031s0011s0003p0003">It is important to remember that sentinel laboratories should not perform confirmatory testing for any of the organisms or toxins discussed in this chapter. Thus, sentinel laboratories should not report definitive identifications of these agents until results have come back from a reference laboratory. Instead, sentinel laboratories should give only preliminary results and provide a comment that the isolate will be referred to an LRN reference laboratory for identification. See the flowcharts in this chapter for examples.</para>
