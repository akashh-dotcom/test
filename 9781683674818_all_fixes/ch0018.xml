      <para id="ch0018s0000p0001">Patient evaluation begins with a thorough symptom review and history, followed by physical examination to develop differential diagnoses for the patient’s clinical presentation. Diagnostic testing is subsequently requested to confirm or exclude specific diagnoses. Further interventions may be either directed against a definitive diagnosis, or empirical, based on likelihood, if a definitive diagnosis cannot be made. With the improvement of medical testing technologies and increasing complexity of laboratory testing, clinicians are challenged to select the best test(s) to optimize patient management and outcomes while avoiding the pitfalls of performing obsolete and inappropriate tests. As a result, diagnostic stewardship plays a crucial role in patient care.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0002">Specific concepts underlying diagnostic stewardship such as quality, cost-effectiveness, and clinical relevance are not new (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0211">1</link>), although there is some debate on the precise terminology (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0212">2</link>). The term “diagnostic stewardship” has been articulated most clearly by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), which defined it as “coordinated guidance and interventions to improve appropriate use of microbiological diagnostics to guide therapeutic decisions. It should promote appropriate, timely diagnostic testing, including specimen collection, and pathogen identification and accurate, timely reporting of results to guide patient treatment” (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0213">3</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0003">In essence, diagnostic stewardship may be defined as performing the right test for the right patient for the right reasons at the right time, with the right interpretation which results in the right treatment, optimizing patient care (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0214">4</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0216">6</link>). A key component of GLASS’ definition is the word <emphasis>appropriate</emphasis>: clinical context dictates the suitability of the test ordered. The term “stewardship” in diagnostics may be misconstrued as being primarily aimed at reducing test usage and associated costs, but this definition also encompasses other aspects such as timeliness of testing and reporting. In addition, while this chapter will focus on diagnostic testing for infectious diseases, diagnostic stewardship remains vital to all aspects of clinical diagnostics.</para>

        <para id="ch0018s0000p0004">In this chapter, diagnostic stewardship will be discussed for the three phases of diagnostic testing: preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical. Clinicians, microbiologists, and support staff are all involved in various parts of the diagnostic cycle, but their roles and duties vary depending on the stage of the cycle (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0213">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0217">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0218">8</link>). Diagnostic stewardship principles are applicable not just in test selection (preanalytical phase), but also in the analytical and postanalytical phases of testing.</para>

      <title>Preanalytical Phase</title>
      <anchor id="ch0018s0002a0001"/>
      <anchor id="ch0018s0000a0003"/>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0005">The preanalytical phase consists of appropriate test selection, sample collection, and acquisition of required clinical details to ensure that the laboratory performs the correct test and reports its interpretation appropriately. In this phase, clinicians are the primary drivers of the choice of diagnostic tests, and typically the onus is on them to request appropriate tests to ensure accurate diagnosis and minimize resource wastage. However, specialist-led decision support can assist clinicians in rationalizing tests ordered, either through input from multidisciplinary expert groups (e.g., combined infectious diseases specialists, microbiologists, and pharmacists) or through gating of tests by requiring specialist permission. Computerized decision support and diagnostic algorithms can also be integrated into the request system. Electronic order sets may also be used to facilitate and steward test orders, alongside therapeutic orders, and these serve to standardize care in accordance with evidence-based guidelines and improved efficiency.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0006">On a broader scale, deciding on the panel of tests offered to clinicians should account for factors such as test performance, turnaround time, and cost-effectiveness. Institutions have reported some success in these areas following the formation of multidisciplinary laboratory formulary committees consisting of laboratory, clinical, administrative, and operations staff. These committees regularly audit and review appropriateness of test utilization and costing (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0219">9</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0007">Clinical and laboratory staff must also ensure that patient specimens are appropriate for testing in both type and quality. These include the monitoring of specimen volume and quality, as well as ensuring that specimen storage and transport capabilities (including availability of transport media) are well supported to minimize specimen deterioration between collection and laboratory processing. The laboratory should provide up-to-date and accessible guidance in the form of a test catalog which provides key information on the appropriate testing indications, methodology, specimen collection and transport, rejection criteria, performance characteristics, interpretation, and turnaround times.</para>

        <title>Minimum Retesting Intervals</title>
        <anchor id="ch0018s0002a0002"/>
        <anchor id="ch0018s0000a0005"/>
        <para id="ch0018s0000p0008">Repeated testing may be essential for purposes of patient monitoring and management for certain conditions. However, testing at excessively frequent intervals may provide no useful information and result in resource wastage and inconvenience to patients. As a result, minimum retesting intervals (MRIs) are directed at optimizing testing frequency, which may be affected by the following factors: physiological properties and biological half-life of the monitored biomarker; the analytical aspects of the test being performed; and the treatment and monitoring requirements of the condition being assessed (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0220">10</link>). For example, cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral loads have an expected half-life of 3 to 8 days, and a longer half-life predicts disease recurrence. This was the basis for consensus guideline recommendations for a CMV viral load MRI of 5 to 7 days during treatment (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0221">11</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0223">13</link>). Another area where MRIs may be applied is repeat antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of isolates of the same species from subsequent cultures from the same anatomic site. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommends that this may be performed after 3 to 4 days, as resistance may develop (for example, in <emphasis>Enterobacter, Citrobacter</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Serratia</emphasis> spp. with the extended-spectrum cephalosporins), or earlier, if by request, or in complicated infections such as prolonged <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> bacteremia (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0224">14</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0226">16</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0018s0000p0009">However, compared to other branches of pathology, it is not always feasible to prescribe definitive intervals in microbiology due to the relative lack of investigation into this field. For example, while the UK RCPath’s guide to National Minimum Retesting Intervals in Pathology prescribes MRIs based on existing literature and treatment guidelines, a large number of microbiology tests either do not have an MRI recommended, or have MRIs recommended based on good practice points (i.e., the authors’ clinical experience). The main tests for which evidence-based MRIs are recommended are (i) biomarker-based (galactomannan and β-<phrase role="small">D</phrase>-glucan) screening for invasive fungal infection in patients with hematological malignancies or who are post-allogenic stem cell transplant; (ii) serological and molecular testing for the diagnosis and monitoring of blood-borne viral infections; and (iii) fecal testing in <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> infection (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0220">10</link>). The RCPath MRIs are described in <anchor id="ch0018s0000a0006"/><link linkend="ch0018s0000a0017">Table 1</link>, along with guidance, where available, from various U.S. guidelines. MRIs may be built into electronic test order systems as “hard-stops” or prompts as part of the preanalytical component for diagnostic stewardship. MRIs, however, should consider certain exceptions. Repeat testing on a different specimen type may be appropriate—for example, lower respiratory tract specimens such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may yield a pathogen despite initial negative nasopharyngeal specimen testing when pathology is predominantly in the lungs rather than the upper airways (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0227">17</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0010">The analytical phase of the diagnostic cycle is the phase over which the laboratory has the most direct control. Microbiologists and laboratory staff are the main stakeholders, as they oversee the technical components of test methodology and performance. It is their responsibility to implement adequate quality control and quality assurance measures to ensure accurate results in a clinically relevant turnaround time.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0011">Performance standards of diagnostic laboratories must be ensured. The two main considerations for determining if a new test is suitable for deployment are (i) assurance of the test’s performance metrics and quality and (ii) how the test will be utilized in the specific population serviced by the laboratory.

      <anchor id="ch0018s0004a0001"/>
      <anchor id="ch0018s0000a0008"/>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0012">The postanalytical phase involves final reporting and interpretation of results, as well as the clinician’s application of the results to guide patient management. Results issued should be accurate and comprehensible to the end users and should be received in time for appropriate interventions to be taken. This requires a strong reporting network and close collaboration between clinical and laboratory staff.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0013">Communication between the laboratory and clinicians is largely via issued laboratory reports. However, adequate engagement with clinicians goes beyond the unidirectional communication of a written report, particularly when introducing new diagnostic tests and discussing appropriate indications, sample collection and transport, and interpretation of results. The recent COVID-19 pandemic saw the rapid emergence of diagnostic tests with different modalities, with new tests including molecular testing (PCR), antigen detection, and serological testing being made available in real time. Communication with relevant stakeholders was paramount in ensuring that clinicians ordered the correct tests and understood diagnostic algorithms to safely exclude infection or interpret the timeline of infection.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0014">Stewardship of result interpretation and patient interventions are often linked. Diagnosis of infectious diseases often requires the performance and interpretation of multiple tests, and multistep testing is common (e.g., initial screening by serology, followed by a confirmatory test which may be a second serological test or a test using a completely different modality, such as molecular testing). In such scenarios, clinicians commonly order only the first test and leave investigations incomplete. Cases may also be managed incorrectly due to faulty interpretation of the results issued: it has been shown that early reporting of results may fail to have an appreciable impact on antimicrobial stewardship, in the absence of guided intervention (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0228">18</link>). As in the preanalytical phase, this is an area where specialist intervention can improve diagnostic outcomes. Direct specialist input may come in the form of early intervention by multidisciplinary teams (e.g., antimicrobial stewardship teams consisting of infectious diseases specialists, microbiologists, and pharmacists) or regular audits of preventive measures taken (e.g., infection prevention and control specialists and microbiologists in conjunction with epidemiology and surveillance staff). Intervention at the design level can be implemented through the crafting of reported comments, automatic reflex testing pathways in the laboratory’s routine workflow, implementation of test cascades to guide clinicians’ ordering of follow-up tests, and the integration of laboratory information systems with the electronic medical record and other associated systems.</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0277">Laboratories, together with clinical teams and with support from hospital administration, may implement assays for rapid detection of pathogens (e.g., via MALDI-TOF MS on early growth, multiplex molecular and probe-based assays) and antimicrobial resistance (e.g., disk diffusion testing, rapid genotypic or phenotypic tests) direct from positive blood culture bottles, or even directly from whole blood (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0240">30</link>). Randomized controlled trials with these technologies have found that these rapid methods can decrease time to pathogen/resistance detection but need to be coupled with a robust antimicrobial stewardship program to reap the benefits of time to optimal therapy (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0217">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0228">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0233">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0241">31</link>). Although these investigations have not yet shown significant differences in other clinical outcome measures (e.g., mortality, length of stay, or adverse events), further studies with more patients and in different contexts (e.g., areas with high antimicrobial resistance or low/middle-income countries) will be required to fully evaluate the impact of these technologies (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0240">30</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0278">Some studies propose using host biomarkers (e.g., procalcitonin, CRP, IL-6, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor [suPAR]), blood indices such as the neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR), predictive scores, and machine learning algorithms to predict bacteremia and guide the use of blood cultures or other diagnostic tests (e.g., direct-from-blood molecular assays) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0242">32</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0246">36</link>). One small retrospective study found that limiting blood cultures to patients with a procalcitonin of &gt;0.1 μg/liter would detect 99% of bacteremia cases (albeit with a specificity of 24.4%), while reducing blood culture sampling by 20% (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0244">34</link>).

The clinical setting broadly separates pneumonia into community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0247">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0248">38</link>). The usual bacterial pathogens vary between these classifications, but one shared feature is that many organisms may exist as colonizers in the respiratory tract. Poorly collected specimens may represent upper respiratory tract and oral microbiota as opposed to true pathogens. Sensitivity and specificity of testing are therefore highly impacted by sample quality. For this reason, testing should be limited to patients with a compatible clinical history, and ideally supported by radiological findings, whether on chest X-ray or computed tomography. Laboratories can play a role in rationalizing testing requests prior to culture by assessing specimen quality. In the analytical phase, the laboratory should have rejection criteria such as not culturing poor-quality sputum (e.g., &gt;10 squamous epithelial cells/high-power field) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0249">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0250">40</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0280">Conventional diagnostic testing for bacterial pathogens is lower-yield in mild cases of CAP, while playing a larger role in management of severe infection. In one study of over 21,000 U.S. patients comparing severe versus nonsevere CAP, the yield of blood cultures in identifying a causative pathogen was 10% versus 4.5%, and for sputum cultures this was 34% versus 21%. Further, an increased resistance to first-line antimicrobials was also found in severe versus nonsevere CAP (34% versus 21%) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0251">41</link>). Another study found that positive blood cultures changed management in 13% (12 of 92) of CAP patients with a Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) score of IV or V, compared to 0% with a PSI of I to III (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0252">42</link>). In light of these findings, treatment of uncomplicated CAP is often empirical, and diagnostic testing is not recommended in the latest American Thoracic Society (ATS)/IDSA guidelines unless the patient is hospitalized with severe CAP or has organism-specific risk factors (e.g., previous infection with methicillin-resistant <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> [MRSA], <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>, or other multidrug-resistant oragnisms [MDROs], or receipt of parenteral antibiotics within 90 days, or risk for legionellosis [travel or as part of outbreak]) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0247">37</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0281">Diagnosing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is complicated by the frequent colonization of the respiratory tract with<emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> and nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli. The spectrum of disease in the ventilated patient can range from asymptomatic colonization to frank VAP, with intermediate conditions such as tracheobronchitis. As a result, diagnostic stewardship in the management of VAP is primarily focused on rationalizing the types and frequency of respiratory specimens obtained, as well as the interpretation of culture results and their correlation with clinical findings. The current ATS/IDSA guidelines do not support routine treatment of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis, and there is no evidence supporting treatment of asymptomatic colonization (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0248">38</link>). The data supporting routine tracheal surveillance cultures for guidance of VAP treatment are also inconclusive, with some studies suggesting that routine cultures may predict the bacterial etiology of subsequent VAP episodes, but only if performed within 72 h prior to the onset of VAP (i.e., twice to thrice weekly) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0253">43</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0255">45</link>). Sufficiently scaled randomized control trials have not been conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness or outcome benefits of such a program. The value of invasive sampling techniques (e.g., BAL, protected specimen brush, or blind bronchial sampling) over noninvasive techniques (endotracheal aspirates) is also unclear. There is currently no clear evidence from meta-analyses of randomized trials that performing quantitative cultures via invasive sampling techniques significantly improves clinical outcomes (e.g., antibiotic changes, mortality, length of intensive care unit stay, ventilator-days) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0256">46</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0258">48</link>). In particular, two randomized clinical trials (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0259">49</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0260">50</link>) reported differences in the role of invasive quantitative cultures in decreasing antibiotic exposure, which has resulted in differences in management guidelines in North America (ATS/IDSA) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0248">38</link>) and Europe (ERS/ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0261">51</link>). Both guidelines recognize that the strength of the evidence supporting either approach is low, and benefits will depend heavily on patient selection (e.g., suitability for monotherapy) and available diagnostic support (which facilitates treatment de-escalation via clinical algorithms). The authors of this chapter cautiously recommend the use of invasive quantitative respiratory cultures if they are available in the readers’ institution and recommend their utilization in conjunction with specialist input or an algorithm for de-escalation.</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0282">The use of culture-independent diagnostics for identification of respiratory pathogens is widespread. Given the potential benefits of antiviral therapy, particularly in high-risk individuals with comorbidities, influenza and SARS-CoV-2 testing should be considered in patients with CAP or a compatible influenza-like illness, during periods of increased activity. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are more sensitive and should be considered when initial antigen tests are negative and clinical suspicion or risk for severe disease is high. The role and stewardship of SARS-CoV-2 testing in asymptomatic individuals for infection prevention and control in health care settings is an evolving area needing more high-quality evidence, although preliminary guidance has recently been issued (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0262">52</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0283">Several commercial, multiplexed NAAT panels for pathogen identification in pneumonia (both bacterial and viral) are available. These offer more rapid turnaround (1 to several hours, compared to days for culture) and have been shown to detect more pathogens compared to culture-based/conventional methods (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0263">53</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0266">56</link>). For example, one such assay, the Biofire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Étoile, France), found 875 additional targets in 1,764 patients with valid results. Of the 875 additional targets, 25% were positive on culture but below quantitative cutoffs, and the remaining 75% were determined to be true positives through a second molecular test (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0265">55</link>). In another study, the Biofire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel displayed a sensitivity of 91.7 to 100% compared to routine microbiology at 27 to 69% (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0263">53</link>). In both aforementioned studies, a larger proportion of results were obtained from sputum cultures compared to BAL. Detection by molecular testing (even if discordant with conventional cultures) correlated with host inflammatory responses (e.g., BAL polymorphs, temperature), indicating that these detections may be clinically relevant (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0264">54</link>). One retrospective multicenter evaluation found that in 159 pneumonia episodes, results from the Biofire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel potentially would have led to antibiotic de-escalation in 40% of patients, escalation in 22%, and increased appropriateness of therapy to 87% (versus 77% for routine microbiology) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0267">57</link>). Real-world impact studies are needed for commercial, multiplexed NAATs because such assays incur significant upfront costs (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0266">56</link>). Given that multiple assays may be available for the same pathogen (e.g., monoplex PCR or as part of a multiplex PCR), the use of multiplex PCR panels should also be closely monitored for appropriateness. For example, repeat performance of a multiplex respiratory virus PCR (e.g., Biofire FilmArray Respiratory Panel) within a 12-h period yielded an additional 5.6% discordant results, of which only 0.9% (4 of 462 repeats) changed clinical management. Repeat testing in this situation is not recommended (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0268">58</link>). The algorithms for appropriate use should be codeveloped by clinicians and the laboratory to guide rational use as part of diagnostic stewardship. An example of such an algorithm for respiratory pathogen testing is found in <anchor id="ch0018s0000a0040"/><link linkend="ch0018s0000a0045">Fig. 1A</link>.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0284">Other adjuncts on how diagnostics may impact the management of respiratory infections include the utilization of a negative MRSA nares screen (by either culture or NAAT) to de-escalate empirical anti-MRSA therapy (e.g., with vancomycin). The evidence supporting de-escalation is stronger in CAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) compared to VAP, with an NPV of 98.1% in CAP and HAP combined compared to 94.8% in VAP. Also, stronger evidence exists for de-escalation when MRSA is not detected by NAAT compared to other methods such as culture (with a specificity of 92% versus 88%) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0269">59</link>).</para>

In two recent meta-analyses of ICU patients (which included patients with nonpulmonic infections and some overlapping studies), a modest reduction was seen in mortality with procalcitonin-guided therapy (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0272">62</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0273">63</link>). The IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP guidelines suggests, based on low-quality evidence, using procalcitonin levels plus clinical criteria to guide discontinuation of antibiotics (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0248">38</link>). The IDSA/ATS CAP guidelines however, do not recommend using procalcitonin to guide initiation or withholding of antibiotics, due to a lack of a sufficient discriminatory threshold.

This might lead to overtreatment of positive cultures in the absence of definitive urinary tract infection (UTI) findings (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0274">64</link>).

Two-step testing, where urine culture is not performed unless urinalysis results are suggestive of a UTI, is one method to reduce inappropriate urine culture requests. Suggested screening criteria include the presence of bacteriuria or pyuria on microscopy, a positive leukocyte esterase (a marker for the presence of leukocytes), or a positive nitrite (a marker for the presence of <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>) on urinalysis (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0280">70</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0281">71</link>). However, not all patient demographics are suitable for two-step testing: these populations include noninfective pyuria in the presence of ASB or when a catheter-related UTI is suspected. In addition, the delay between urinalysis and culture in two-step testing raises concerns regarding the timely transport and proper storage of urine samples, which may result in bacterial overgrowth and artificially elevated organism counts. In view of this, it is recommended that two-step testing should be implemented only if a robust specimen storage and transport chain is in place.

Most laboratory guidelines recommend collection of midstream urine with periurethral cleansing for both genders, as first-void urine reflects urethral colonization (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0282">72</link>).

Direct urine collection via indwelling catheters should be avoided where possible, as catheters are rapidly colonized following insertion.

(rule out enteral feeds and laxative use causing diarrhea prior to microbiologic investigations); (ii) is the diarrhea acute or chronic (most pathogens identified with routine stool cultures and multiplex gastrointestinal panels represent acute etiologies); (iii) are risk factors for<emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection present (e.g., if health care-related onset, admission &gt;72 h, and recent antibiotic receipt); (iv) is the diarrhea inflammatory (e.g., dysenteric) and/or is the patient ill or at risk of severe illness (e.g., dehydrated or septic) and (v) are there specific host or seasonal factors which are associated with particular etiologies (e.g., travel or immunocompromise may be associated with certain parasites).

In the preanalytical phase, patients to test should be properly selected. In general, since gastroenteritis is usually self-limited, testing should focus on those with persistent diarrhea (≥7 days duration), in patients who are at high risk for severe disease, or when enteric fever is suspected. Stool cultures or molecular panels should be restricted in inpatients to those who have acute, community-onset diarrhea within &lt;72 h of admission, given the lower diagnostic yield beyond that period (~1.4% by culture-based methods and ~3% by molecular methods) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0308">98</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0310">100</link>), except for certain special hosts (e.g., the immunocompromised) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0311">101</link>). Only diarrheal stool (i.e., stool that takes shape of container) should be accepted for testing, and clinicians should ensure that patients tested do have diarrhea (at least three bowel movements in a 24-h period) and avoid testing if patients have received laxatives or oral contrast or have been commenced on enteral tube feeds in the preceding 48 h. CDSS or electronic prompts have been successfully deployed to facilitate such diagnostic stewardship efforts (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0310">100</link>). Patients with unexplained, new-onset diarrhea who have been hospitalized for &gt;72 h should be evaluated for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> by a directed <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> assay, given that community causes of diarrhea are unlikely and this approach is likely to be more cost-effective than upfront use of a multiplex molecular panel (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0312">102</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0313">103</link>), although it should be borne in mind that <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection may also be of community onset.</para>

Implications of organisms such as EAEC, EPEC, EAEC, ETEC, and EIEC may, however, be difficult to interpret as they are not identified by conventional methods and their detection may not necessarily indicate causation, especially if multiple potential pathogens are detected (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0317">107</link>). Many of these infections may be self-limiting and do not necessitate treatment. Interpretive comments should be considered to guide clinicians. For example, when ETEC is detected, the laboratory report may comment that diarrhea due to ETEC is usually self-limited and that antibiotic therapy may not be indicated. The general consensus of professional societies (e.g., IDSA, American College of Gastroenterology) and expert opinion is that testing in acute diarrhea (whether by conventional or multiplex molecular methods) should not be performed for immunocompetent patients with self-limited acute community-onset or traveler’s diarrhea without any clinical warning features (e.g., dysentery) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0313">103</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0318">108</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0319">109</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0018s0000p0306"><emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection (CDI) is often antibiotic associated and a major cause of health care-related diarrhea and morbidity. The optimal testing algorithm is still somewhat controversial. The ASM recommends (i) NAAT only and (ii) a glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) enzyme immunoassay followed by NAAT, or (iii) GDH/toxin A/B EIA arbitrated by NAAT, as all acceptable for the detection of the <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> toxin gene or toxin-producing organism (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0321">111</link>). The IDSA/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) 2017 guidance document recommends a multistep algorithm (GDH/toxin A/B EIA arbitrated by NAAT or NAAT plus toxin) rather than NAAT alone if there are no institutional criteria for patient stool submission (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0322">112</link>). The ACG 2021 guidance recommends incorporating “both a highly sensitive and highly specific testing modality” to distinguish colonization from active infection, starting with either GDH EIA or NAAT followed by toxin EIA. For patients with discrepant testing results (GDH or NAAT positive, EIA negative), clinicians are to consider alternate causes, to consider empiric treatment if there is high clinical suspicion, and also to consider NAAT testing for GDH-negative patients (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0323">113</link>). ESCMID guidance recommends a two-step algorithm starting either with NAAT or GDH EIA followed by toxin A/B EIA (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0324">114</link>). In symptomatic patients who do not have an alternative cause of diarrhea, a NAAT-only algorithm has also been supported as a stand-alone test, as NAAT offers the highest sensitivity, and the risk of overcalling disease is mitigated when patients to test are carefully selected (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0324">114</link>). These different approaches have recently been comprehensively reviewed, with the pros and cons of each approach delineated (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0321">111</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0325">115</link>). At the heart of these varying recommendations is the question of the sensitivity and specificity of various assays for diagnosing CDI and the varying gold standards that studies have used. Variable rates of asymptomatic colonization have been reported, but this is especially common in infants (up to 40%) and young children less than 1 year of age, for whom testing for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> should not be routine unless there is no alternate cause of diarrhea or if there is pseudomembranous colitis/toxic megacolon (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0322">112</link>). With the introduction of multiplex panels that include <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>, users should recognize that some positive cases may be due to colonization and may not be the cause of a patient’s illness. This not only may result in unnecessary antibiotic use, but the true diagnosis may be delayed. Regardless of the algorithm used in one’s institution, diagnostic stewardship activities should be directed toward selecting patients who have a clinical syndrome consistent with CDI (diarrhea defined as ≥3 unformed stools over 24 h), in particular those patients who may have risk factors for CDI (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0322">112</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0323">113</link>). This improves the pretest probability and also specificity of testing. One study of diagnostic stewardship, for both <emphasis>C. difficile-</emphasis>specific and multiplex gastrointestinal panel testing, studied best-practice alerts requiring preauthorization by a pharmacist-led antimicrobial stewardship (ASP) team for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> EIA or GI panel in patients who had been hospitalized &gt;72 h, but had received tube feeding, oral contrast, or laxatives in the preceding 48 h. This study found that the number of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> EIA and GI panels decreased significantly from 6.05 to 4.87 orders/1,000 patient days and 1.72 to 0.89 orders/1,000 patient days, respectively, with a reduction of the hospital-onset <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> rate (albeit not statistically significant) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0310">100</link>). Of note, this study utilized existing processes in order to minimize administrative burdens, in comparison to other studies which have looked at batch approvals or laboratory or clinician approvals. It was felt that pegging <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> testing to a pharmacy-led ASP program was easily integrated and non-onerous, and this is an important but sometimes neglected facet of diagnostic stewardship activities (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0310">100</link>). Repeat testing for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> with an EIA or PCR within 7 days is also not recommended and is an area for diagnostic stewardship intervention, as yield is low (1.1 to 1.7% for PCR and 1.9% with EIA) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0326">116</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0327">117</link>).</para>

Specific stains are also required depending on suspected pathogens, and adequate adherence to sample collection and transport procedures is important to optimize yield.</para>
          <para id="ch0018s0000p0308">As such, diagnostic stewardship principles can be applied at multiple junctures along this diagnostic process. Requests should be submitted only for appropriate indications where there is a true possibility of parasitic infection. The onus for this typically rests with the requesting clinician. Laboratories may apply some rejection criteria such as symptom onset as an inpatient (&gt;3 days after admission), due to the low likelihood of new parasitic infection in such patients (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0328">118</link>). Clinicians should specifically request special stains or indicate particular risk factors where appropriate. Traditionally, at least three separate stool specimens should be collected over 7 to 10 days and submitted for examination where there is a strong suspicion, and this is supported by studies which found a sensitivity of 72 to 76% when only the first in a series of at least three specimens was examined (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0329">119</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0330">120</link>).

Underscoring the importance of physician-laboratory communication, if the index of suspicion is high, additional samples (up to six or seven, submitted over 14 days) may be considered, particularly if <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> is suspected, which may also be investigated using the agar plate culture technique (which is a more sensitive method than microscopy) or serology (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0332">122</link>).

One study also found an increased rate of treatment (e.g., with metronidazole) of nonpathogenic intestinal parasites detected with conventional microscopy in a cohort of HIV-infected patients, which did not occur in patients receiving the Luminex (Austin, TX) gastrointestinal pathogen panel (GPP) tests (as these are not included on the panel) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0317">107</link>). The College of American Pathologists requires identification of all parasites in stool samples, and while nonpathogenic parasites may indicate exposure to contaminated water or food, and such patients may be at risk of pathogenic parasites, the identification of nonpathogens should be accompanied by the appropriate postanalytical comments as part of diagnostic stewardship so as to avoid overtreatment (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0317">107</link>).</para>

This can be facilitated via diagnostic stewardship partnership between the laboratory, the infectious diseases service, and the orthopedists (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0338">128</link>). Preoperative identification of a pathogen (e.g., joint aspiration for PJI) should be attempted if feasible, as it has moderate to high sensitivity and is highly specific.

One such study found that blood culture bottles had a sensitivity of 90% and 100%, respectively, in detecting fungi and RGM causing PJIs, and recommended fungal and mycobacterial cultures only for patients who are immunocompromised, have a history of fungal and mycobacterial PJI, have disseminated fungal or mycobacterial infection, or have recurrent culture-negative PJI (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0340">130</link>).

If and when near-patient or point-of-care assays such lateral flow assays for alpha-defensin are used (in the United States this may occur if a CLIA waiver is obtained), it is important that their use is in conjunction with other standard evaluations for PJI and that their use be governed by a quality management system with laboratory oversight, which ensures quality control, performance, and documentation/reporting (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0357">147</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0313">Diagnostic stewardship activities for central nervous system (CNS) infections in the preanalytical phase include deciding who should be tested and what tests should be ordered. Lumbar puncture/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling and blood cultures should be performed in all patients with suspected community or health care-associated meningitis/ventriculitis. In adults, less than two-thirds of patients have all features of the typical triad of acute meningitis (fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental state); however, the absence of all three of these features effectively rules out meningitis (sensitivity, 99 to 100%) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0358">148</link>). In infants and young children, the signs and symptoms of meningitis may be more variable (e.g., lethargy, poor feeding, irritability, bulging fontanelles in infants) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0359">149</link>). In certain populations, such as ICU patients, altered mental status is a common finding and is often due to reasons other than CNS infection. CSF examination may be deferred in such patients who have not undergone neurosurgery and have not sustained head trauma (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0214">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0360">150</link>). CNS infection may be due to a variety of agents, usually bacteria (<emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis</emphasis>, and tuberculosis are important causes) and viruses (common etiologies: non-polio enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus [HSV], and arboviruses), while fungi and parasites may occasionally also be causative. The laboratory should discourage the use of insensitive tests and encourage providers to use appropriate tests for CNS infection. Examples of insensitive tests include latex agglutination tests performed on CSF specimens for acute bacterial meningitis (particularly in the context of antibiotic pretreatment) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0361">151</link>) and India ink staining of CSF for <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> (cryptococcal antigen should be performed instead) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0237">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0362">152</link>). Another example of an insensitive test is NAAT for West Nile virus (WNV) on CSF from patients with neuroinvasive disease. While analytically sensitive (limit of detection, 10 to 100 copies/ml), it is clinically insensitive (4 to 57%) due to the short-lived duration of viremia and low levels of WNV in CSF (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0363">153</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0364">154</link>). Serology for WNV on CSF should be performed instead to diagnose WNV neuroinvasive disease. If NAAT is performed, it should be done on plasma/urine samples where the yield is actually higher, to supplement CSF antibody testing (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0364">154</link>). In one diagnostic stewardship study performed over 1.5 years, CSF WNV NAAT was removed from the test menu. This resulted in a decrease of 93.5% in test spending, with an increased diagnostic yield from serology when clinicians were using the appropriate test (0 cases diagnosed via NAAT during the study, versus 8 cases diagnosed by serology after the intervention) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0365">155</link>).</para>

CSF should not be refrigerated, as fastidious organisms may not tolerate this temperature (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0237">27</link>). The European Monitoring Group on Meningococci (EMGM) has recommended PCR as essential for the diagnosis of meningococcal disease (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0366">156</link>).

However, both false positives and false negatives have been reported. False positives have been attributed to possible contamination in the preanalytical phase (e.g., during collection and processing in specimen preparation areas), and included reports of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0368">158</link>), <emphasis>S. agalactiae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0368">158</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0369">159</link>), and <emphasis>Haemophilus influenzae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0370">160</link>). False negatives have been reported, possibly due to in-pouch reagent degradation (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0371">161</link>), antimicrobial treatment (e.g., <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> antigen-positive, PCR-negative CSF specimens for patients on antifungal treatment) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0369">159</link>), or a possible higher limit of detection for certain analytes (e.g., HSV) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0372">162</link>). More recent studies on the FilmArray ME Panel, including one study of &gt;4,000 patients, and a large meta-analysis of &gt;11,000 participants from 19 studies corroborate a lower sensitivity for HSV-1 at 82.4% (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0373">163</link>) and 75.5% (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0374">164</link>), respectively. This finding is clinically significant because of the potentially life-threatening nature of CNS HSV-1 infection. Diagnostic stewardship activities should include advice/guidance provided in the form of testing algorithms, test comments, and/or antimicrobial stewardship. For example, guidance may entail continuing antiviral treatment, repeat sampling, and testing with an alternate PCR assay (e.g., a singleplex assay with a lower limit of detection) if HSV meningoencephalitis is still suspected (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0368">158</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0374">164</link>). The detection of latent viruses such as HSV, CMV, and human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) should be interpreted carefully (e.g., distinguishing between active infection, reactivation of latent infection, versus contamination from a traumatic tap) as part of diagnostic stewardship.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0315">Diagnostic stewardship activities should also center on selecting appropriate patients for multiplex PCR testing. In children ≥2 years and adults, one study found that immunocompetent patients with ≤10 WBCs in their CSF had a 2% (4/184) positivity rate (1 HHV-6, 1 enterovirus, 2 varicella-zoster virus in patients with concurrent shingles), all of which were not considered clinically significant, whereas 4 of 6 positive results in immunocompromised patients with ≤10 WBCs in their CSF were considered significant (1 HSV-1, 2 CMV, 1<emphasis>H. influenzae</emphasis>). Limiting testing to patients with &gt;10 WBC in their CSF or to patients aged &lt;2 years, or to those with immunosuppression, would have decreased FilmArray ME Panel use by 41% (saving &gt;$56,000) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0375">165</link>). Previous work on HSV encephalitis found that the median CSF WBC count ranged from 22 to 484 cells/mm<superscript>3</superscript> (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0376">166</link>). Corroborating these criteria, a study involving both pediatric and adult patients, examining a cutoff of &gt;5 cells/mm<superscript>3</superscript> versus &gt;10 cells/mm<superscript>3</superscript> and/or protein levels &gt;50 mg/dl for CSF specimens tested with HSV PCR, found no positive HSV results in 70 specimens analyzed with &lt;5 or 5 to 10 cells/mm<superscript>3</superscript>, regardless of protein level. This finding indicates that a higher cutoff of &gt;10 cells/mm<superscript>3</superscript> may be reasonable in those aged ≥2 years and the nonimmunocompromised, with the proviso that the clinician is able to still contact the laboratory to request testing if the clinical suspicion remains high (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0376">166</link>). A pre-post quasi experimental cohort study in a children’s hospital, which applied one or more of the following criteria—(i) &lt;2 months of age, (ii) suspicion of encephalitis (e.g., seizures and other focal neurologic abnormalities, altered mentation, imaging, or electroencephalographic changes), and (iii) ≥5 WBC/μl—for testing with the FilmArray ME Panel with real-time antimicrobial stewardship decision support (weekdays, 8–5 pm), found that time to optimal antimicrobial therapy fell from 28 to 18 h, time to results fell from 9.6 to 4.8 h, intravenous antimicrobial duration decreased from 36 to 24 h, and rates of pathogen identification increased from 10 to 15%, without changes in time to effective antimicrobials, admission rates, length of stay, or total hospital costs (although cost of testing increased) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0377">167</link>). While some have advocated for a more “universal” approach to using multiplex PCR panels for meningitis (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0378">168</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0379">169</link>), such an approach will likely lead to overuse (in one study, up to one-third of ME panels were requested in patients with low likelihood of CNS infection), and an approach guided by diagnostic stewardship utilizing clinical, demographic, and CSF parameters is likely to be more optimal (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0377">167</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0381">171</link>), although further studies are needed. Nevertheless, multiplex PCR panels cannot be stand-alone tests for meningitis because cultures are required for AST for bacterial causes of meningitis.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0316">Other areas of diagnostic stewardship in the analytical phase would be to avoid performing routine CSF mycobacterial and fungal cultures in nonimmunocompromised patients with normal CSF cell counts and chemistry, unless by request (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0382">172</link>). In a low-prevalence setting, a mandatory screen policy where the laboratory discontinued acid-fast bacilli (AFB) analysis if CSF characteristics met all of the following criteria—WBC &lt;3 cells/μl, protein &lt;60 mg/dl, glucose &gt;3.3 mmol/liter—decreased CSF AFB testing from 18.6% to 7.7% over a 2-year period (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0383">173</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0317">Molecular tests (e.g., PCR) are more sensitive than viral culture and have largely replaced it in clinical laboratories. In some cases where standard tests fail, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has been used with success to detect CNS pathogens. Molecular testing is also now offered as a validated clinical test in some laboratories. In one trial of 204 patients with meningoencephalitis, in which 58 infections were eventually detected in 57 patients, an mNGS approach identified a pathogen in 13 (22%) infections that was not detected by standard source hospital testing, impacting treatment decisions for about half of these patients (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0384">174</link>). However, in the trial, 26 (45%) infections were detected by conventional testing only and missed by mNGS. Of these, 8 misses were secondary to low titers of organism, below the detection threshold of mNGS. While a promising strategy, further work is required to optimize the performance of mNGS, and diagnostic stewardship should play an important role to ensure its appropriate use and interpretation (e.g., via mNGS sequencing expert boards) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0385">175</link>).</para>

Pre- to postanalytical phases need to be examined closely for potential pitfalls (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0282">72</link>). In the preanalytical stage, laboratories should provide clear protocols for specimen collection and ensure that specimens submitted for anaerobic culture are processed within 2 h of collection (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0282">72</link>). In the analytical phase, positive Gram stains may be indicative of the presence of anaerobes in cases where aerobic cultures are negative and/or may suggest the need for additional measures to rule out slow-growing or nonviable anaerobes. This may also assist in determining the quality of the cultures obtained. Cultures on enriched anaerobic media (with additional selective media where indicated) are usually required, and attention should be paid to the uninterrupted maintenance of an anaerobic incubation milieu.

In addition, susceptibility testing may not be routinely performed due to technical difficulty in maintaining proper test conditions, achieving interlaboratory reproducibility with existing susceptibility testing methods, and the lack of clinical breakpoints for many anaerobes. But it is increasingly clear that specific identification and susceptibility testing may be indicated in certain scenarios such as persistent infections despite therapy, or syndrome-specific infections where long-term therapy is needed (e.g., osteomyelitis, endocarditis, brain abscess, and Lemierre’s syndrome which is associated with<emphasis>Fusobacterium necrophorum</emphasis>), or when there are concerns over organism-specific resistance patterns.

Presently, for molds, EUCAST has breakpoints for some antifungals against select<emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp., and CLSI has breakpoints for voriconazole against <emphasis>Aspergillus fumigatus</emphasis> only. Methods from both organizations are different, and one cannot extrapolate breakpoints from one group using MICs determined by methods of the other (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0400">190</link>).

Various fungal markers exist (e.g., β-<phrase role="small">D</phrase>-glucan, galactomannan), and institutions should develop guidance for the utilization of these non-culture-based fungal assays and include them in diagnostic-driven pathways (incorporating radiological and clinical signs) for early and accurate diagnosis of IFI (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0402">192</link>).

In the analytical phase, susceptibility should be performed on at least one isolate from a patient newly diagnosed with TB, or if isolated from a different specimen source, and can be repeated after 60 days if there is no clinical improvement or if the patient has not converted to AFB smear negative (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0411">201</link>).</para>

Both mNGS or PCR followed by conventional sequencing have been used for the direct detection of resistance from clinical specimens such as sputum by the CDC and Public Health England (now the UK Health Security Agency). An mNGS approach has been demonstrated to have faster detection of resistance (within 5 days of specimen receipt, with a 87.5% success rate in specimens with a 3+ smear/high bacterial load), and was 24 and 31 days more rapid compared to sequencing from mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT (Becton-Dickinson)) broth cultures or conventional drug susceptibility testing, respectively (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0413">203</link>).

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0327">Test selection should be appropriate for the parasite suspected and stage of infection and should be guided by consultation with the laboratory and infectious diseases specialists. For example, while microscopy is the mainstay for many blood and tissue parasites, for some parasites and in particular stages of infection, serology may be more appropriate. For example, only 1 to 2% of patients with trypanosomiasis present in the acute phase, and serology would have a higher yield than microscopy on a blood specimen; alternatively, microscopy of tissue aspirates or biopsies may also be helpful (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0237">27</link>). Another preanalytical concern is the number of specimens tested for malaria. It is recommended that smears be repeated every 12 to 24 h for a total of three evaluations (both thin and thick smears) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0414">204</link>). Also, samples should be transported and processed within 1 h for blood parasites such as malaria and trypanosomes to preserve morphology and be performed “STAT” on arrival in the laboratory (for malaria films). In the analytical phase, certain assays (e.g., NAAT) may be useful for patients with low-level parasitemia, for identifying organisms which cannot be differentiated microscopically or for detecting coinfections (e.g., with &gt;1 malarial species) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0415">205</link>). Postanalytically, test comments are helpful to guide clinicians in the interpretation of results (e.g., serology may show significant cross-reaction within the helminths) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0237">27</link>). Diagnostic stewardship in the analytical phase may include the incorporation of telemicrobiology in difficult cases. This has been used with success by the CDC’s DPDx, which routinely receives &gt;400 telediagnostic cases annually for parasitology. They complete cases more expeditiously compared to shipping specimens, saving about 80% of costs. About one-third of cases are malaria related, and about 70% of teleconsults led to a confident diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0416">206</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0328">Diagnostic stewardship in blood-borne viral infections like HBV, HCV, and HIV faces two unique hurdles. First, formal diagnosis and management usually require that multiple tests be performed. Second, while supplemental tests are required for management of these chronic viral infections, inappropriate supplemental or repeat testing is redundant and incurs unnecessary costs. However, a lack of appropriate follow-up testing may lead to missed care opportunities, particularly when providers are unfamiliar with management.</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0329">Due to the implications of a diagnosis of HIV infection, standard-of-care HIV diagnostic testing incorporates reflex confirmatory testing (either by an antibody differentiation immunoassay or by nucleic acid testing) when the initial screen with a fourth-generation antigen/antibody immunoassay is positive. Reflex confirmatory testing may not be routine for HCV and HBV infection in many laboratories. Some studies have found that up to 50% of those with a positive HCV antibody may not receive HCV RNA testing for a variety of reasons. These include failure of the provider to request RNA testing for confirmation and patients not returning for testing (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0417">207</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0418">208</link>). Laboratory-initiated reflex testing of HCV nucleic acid testing following a positive initial antibody screen can reduce loss to follow-up and improve diagnosis rates of HCV (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0419">209</link>). Likewise, the diagnosis of occult hepatitis B, which is particularly important in high-risk or immunocompromised patients and for which there are different permutations of serologic patterns, may be challenging. The diagnosis may be missed in the absence of a diagnostic algorithm or if providers are less experienced (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0420">210</link>). Conversely, hepatitis serologies are also often unnecessarily or inappropriately requested. A study in New York from 2006 to 2010 found over 70,000 instances of duplicate HCV antibody testing costing $1.4 million. In that study, 23%, 18%, and 9% of patients received 1, 2 or 3, and 4 tests to a maximum of 37 duplicate tests (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0421">211</link>). Persons in correction or substance abuse treatment facilities comprised 38% of the study population, and this was a predictor of duplicate testing, as screening is routine in these facilities. Decreasing duplicate testing requires a systems-based approach with information sharing (e.g., via comprehensive electronic health records) accessible to providers when patients move across facilities. Various studies have found inappropriate rates of test repeats of up to 14% for anti-HAV, 18% for anti-HBc and anti-HBs, 20.8% for HBsAg, 37.4% for anti-HBc, 44.9% for HBeAg, and 37.8% for anti-HBe (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0422">212</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0425">215</link>). Inappropriate test repeats may arise for several reasons, including difficulty in retrieving or nonawareness of past results (e.g., failure to check), nonfamiliarity with testing algorithms, and duplicate testing when specimens are referred from one laboratory to another for reflex testing, with a lack of coordination of specimen testing protocols (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0422">212</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0423">213</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0425">215</link>). Both overuse and underuse are amenable to diagnostic stewardship processes, and besides provider education on diagnostic algorithms, studies have successfully decreased overuse via CDSS automated alerts (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0426">216</link>) or low-cost laboratory interventions (e.g., via a requisition stamp on paper forms) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0423">213</link>), and reduced underuse by both laboratory- or clinic-based reflex testing (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0419">209</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0427">217</link>). The WHO recommends reflex HCV viral load testing in those with positive HCV antibody results (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0428">218</link>). One study of 633 participants under the care of trained general practitioners in a decentralized, community setting in Myanmar, using rapid point-of-care HCV antibody and RNA testing (GeneXpert), found 606 (96%) to be HCV positive, of which 88% were RNA positive. Of 489 (91%) eligible for HCV direct-acting antivirals, retention in care was excellent, with 477 (98%) completing therapy and 92% achieving a sustained virologic response, evidencing that even in a resource-limited setting, rapid testing can facilitate retention in care and successful treatment, which should be the end goal of a successful DSP (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0427">217</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0330">In relation to HIV infection, a review by Bolles et al. of their institution’s ordering practices for HIV-positive patients also suggests that when such patients are admitted for inpatient treatment, unfamiliarity on the clinicians’ part may result in inappropriate ordering of (i) tests which are normally reserved for chronic disease management, such as genotyping, resistance testing, and viral loads for HIV and HCV; (ii) tests for opportunistic infections such as CMV PCR; and (iii) others with no clear indication, e.g., immunological testing for<emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> IgE (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0429">219</link>). The inappropriate ordering of such high-complexity tests incurred unwarranted costs, and the institution was only able to mitigate this through a combination of default test panels and specialist restriction in the computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems, with clinician education recognized as a minor factor (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0429">219</link>). Other areas of diagnostic stewardship for HIV-infected patients include the avoidance of routine CMV IgG testing as part of baseline serologies in those who have a high likelihood of previous CMV infection (highlighted in the Choosing Wisely initiative and the HIVMA guidelines) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0430">220</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0431">221</link>). HSV IgG and toxoplasma IgG are also not indicated as part of routine testing in asymptomatic persons (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0430">220</link>). The laboratory should consider hard-stops for tests that should not be repeated at all (e.g., once-in-a-lifetime CDSS alert for genetic tests such as HLA*B5701 for abacavir hypersensitivity) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0430">220</link>). Other areas to potentially target include frequency of HIV viral loads—the laboratory could potentially set an alert if these are repeated too soon in relation to a preceding test (e.g., ≤2 weeks). HIV viral loads should be done at diagnosis, before initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), at 2 to 4 weeks (but not later than 8 weeks) after initiation or modification of HAART, and at 4- to 8-weekly intervals until the viral load is undetectable (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0431">221</link>). CD4 monitoring is also not useful and may be omitted if patients have had CD4 counts consistently &gt;500 cells/mm<superscript>3</superscript> for the preceding 2 years and remain virologically suppressed (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0431">221</link>). Diagnostic stewardship in the analytical phase includes performing HIV genotyping only on samples with an appropriate and recent viral load (most conventional assays require at least 500 to 1,000 copies/ml); in more complex cases with lower level viremia where testing is indicated, alternate methods may be needed (e.g., proviral DNA by NGS), although these assays may miss some previous drug resistance mutations and their full clinical utility is still being elucidated (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0431">221</link>). In the postanalytical phase, interpretive test comments should be incorporated to guide clinicians (e.g., to consider retesting or obtaining a viral load if acute HIV infection is suspected) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0431">221</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0018s0000p0332">The increasing use of molecular methods in microbiology also results in new challenges in diagnostic stewardship that are unique to this subset of tests, as detailed by Messacar et al. in their review (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0217">7</link>). It may be difficult to assess the performance of molecular tests due to various factors: the absence of a gold standard due to increased sensitivity compared to conventional culture-based gold standards; multiple ways of assessing positive and negative predictive values for multiplex tests, depending on whether one assesses values for detection of each individual organism, all organisms on the panel as a whole, or the clinical syndrome which the panel is designed to diagnose (regardless of whether or not the target organisms are on the panel); the difficulties in regulating direct-from-specimen rapid diagnostic tests, which can be mitigated through implementing diagnostic algorithms and computerized decision support; and difficulties in result interpretation, such as unfamiliarity with uncommon organisms and the inability to differentiate between various disease states, which may range from colonization to acute infection to nonviable genetic material post-therapy. Despite these challenges, bacterial pathogen identification and antibiotic therapy guidance has been established using molecular methods (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0228">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0240">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0435">225</link>). There is also an emerging role for this testing in the genotyping of viruses beyond HIV and HCV and to guide therapy and support infection control intervention. For example, genotyping SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., by whole-genome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, or allele-specific qPCR typing) may help guide therapy (e.g., with an appropriate monoclonal antibody which retains activity) and infection control efforts and contact tracing, and is anticipated to become more widely used in the future (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0436">226</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0018s0000p0333">A nascent area where diagnostic stewardship is anticipated to play an important and growing role is mNGS for infectious diseases, which represents an unbiased approach unlike targeted or even multiplex PCRs. Its utility has been demonstrated in pathogen identification from usually sterile sites such as in neurological and bone/joint infections undiagnosed by conventional methods (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0384">174</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0385">175</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0437">227</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0441">231</link>). It has also been studied in patients with febrile neutropenia, in both blood and respiratory samples (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0442">232</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0443">233</link>), and in plasma to detect cell-free microbial DNA in various infectious syndromes (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0444">234</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0446">236</link>). Certainly mNGS has proven to be very helpful for identifying novel pathogens, such as the initial detection of SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0447">237</link>). SARS-CoV-2 was subsequently identified by traditional methods such as viral culture, electron microscopy, and subsequent whole-genome sequencing. mNGS is an important tool in both public health and sentinel/reference laboratories. In most countries, few laboratories offer mNGS as a clinically validated test. mNGS is usually a “send-out” test where it is available. It is usually more costly than conventional testing and is usually considered when standard evaluations fail. Determining when mNGS should be performed, and its cost-effectiveness in various contexts and disease processes, are areas needing further clarity. One retrospective study on mNGS of plasma cell-free DNA on 82 patients over 1.5 years found a positive impact in 7.3% of patients, a negative impact in 3.7%, no impact in 86.6%, and was indeterminate in 2.4%, underscoring the importance of patient selection and the role of diagnostic stewardship (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0448">238</link>). In the preanalytical phase, the use of mNGS should be guided by expert consultation, given the current significant degree of nonfamiliarity among most clinicians. For example, one schema would be to only use it when routine tests are negative or diagnostic samples cannot be obtained (e.g., brain lesions or deep-seated abscesses that cannot be biopsied), with approval from the laboratory director and/or infectious diseases specialists (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0446">236</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0449">239</link>). In the analytic phase for mNGS there are important steps in both the “wet-bench” phase (e.g., the incorporation of negative extraction controls to normalize reads and facilitate the setting of thresholds for what are true pathogens versus contaminants, and other quality control measures such as internal/external controls and quality checks at different steps of sample preparation) and the post-sequencing phase (assessing sequencing quality metrics, the application of various computational approaches, and the filtering of taxa known to be contaminants) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0450">240</link>–<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0454">244</link>). Confirmation of mNGS positives by a secondary method may also be considered (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0453">243</link>). There are no standard bioinformatic or clinical criteria for distinguishing pathogens from colonizing bacteria in mNGS, although various thresholds and criteria have been suggested, and this is an area needing further work (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0442">232</link>). In the postanalytical phase, diagnostic stewardship activities include facilitating interpretation of results via test comments, and discussion with an expert specialist panel has been proposed (e.g., a “clinical microbial sequencing board” akin to a tumor board) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0385">175</link>).</para>

The IDSA recommends a two-pronged approach based on the core principles of (i) prospectively auditing antimicrobial use, with the team providing immediate feedback to the ordering clinician, and (ii) restriction of the antimicrobial agents available for use, either through revising the hospital formulary or through requiring specialist authorization for use of select agents. The latter principle requires close monitoring of trends in antimicrobial use. These initiatives may be further supported by supplemental measures such as prescriber education, the appropriate use of guidelines, pathways, and order forms to guide clinical practice, and active initiatives to promote antimicrobial de-escalation, dosing optimization, and step-down from parenteral to oral antimicrobials (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0241">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0455">245</link>).</para>

Selective reporting of antibiotics by the laboratory allows the stewardship team to reduce the indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as potentially to reduce the costs associated with the testing of multiple antimicrobial agents that may not be utilized in treatment. However, an audit by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia’s Quality Assurance Program (RCPA QAP) in 2019 found that the majority of microbiology laboratories surveyed either over-reported broad-spectrum antibiotics, or reported inappropriate antibiotics for the site of infection (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0457">247</link>). As such, laboratories that report antibiotics selectively should consider the first-line and select second-line antibiotics in their routine test panel, and should also have criteria to prompt reflex testing for less frequently used agents in the event that first-line antibiotics are unsuitable for use, either because of resistance or patient-specific contraindications (e.g., allergies). The CLSI stratifies their recommended agents for testing priority based on various considerations, including “clinical efficacy, prevalence of resistance, minimizing emergence of resistance, cost, FDA clinical indications for use, and current consensus recommendations for first-choice and alternative drugs” (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0226">16</link>).

Diagnostic stewardship activities include working with infection prevention and control (IPC) units to define the best screening approach appropriate for an institution. Approaches generally involve defining the target population(s) to screen (i.e., “high-risk” screening versus “universal” screening, and preoperative screening) and screening methodologies (e.g., culture-based methods versus molecular versus a combination of methods). While universal admission screening for certain pathogens (e.g., MRSA) has been advocated or legislated in some jurisdictions, it is not clear that such an approach offers an advantage over targeted screening. The cost-benefit analysis of an approach will depend on compliance to screening and the prevalence of MRSA carriage. It is also clear that screening does not diminish acquisition or infection rates for antibiotic-resistant organisms, but the associated measures taken do (e.g., hand hygiene, contact precautions, isolation, and decolonization, as applicable). The relative importance of these downstream measures has been difficult to dissect in clinical trials, and the value of isolation (placing the patient in a single room with barrier precautions) over hand hygiene and decolonization strategies in diminishing the spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms such as MRSA has also been questioned (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0459">249</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0460">250</link>). For VRE, a targeted screening strategy is usually adopted. While hand hygiene was shown in a meta-analysis to decrease the acquisition rate by 47%, it is not clear if other measures (e.g., contact precautions) diminish acquisition. Relaxation of screening measures may have a variable impact on acquisition/infection rates (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0461">251</link>) and may reflect the tendency of VRE to preferentially affect a circumscribed susceptible population (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0462">252</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0463">253</link>).

While the CDC recommends against routine, undirected sampling, the clinical microbiology laboratory may be engaged in microbiologic sampling in select instances, for example for an outbreak investigation, for quality assurance purposes (e.g., when there is a change in infection control practice), where findings may either help to determine the role of the environment or fomites in the outbreak and lead to specific actions to mitigate and prevent future occurrences, or help to evaluate the robustness of the process change (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0473">263</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0474">264</link>). It is important to note that not all outbreaks require environmental sampling, and this decision should be informed by various factors such as the organism implicated, engineering factors, the suspected source, frequency, and the context in which the outbreak has occurred (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0474">264</link>). Such testing may not always be suitably undertaken by the clinical microbiology laboratory, whose primary ambit is to provide diagnostic testing for patient care. It may be better situated with a contract testing laboratory specializing in environmental microbiology testing and monitoring. Nonetheless, clinical laboratories may face requests, due to their proximity to the clinical care environment, to assist in environmental cultures for outbreak investigations, to conduct testing for pharmaceutical clean rooms (surface sterility and fingertip sampling and viable air counts), and to evaluate the quality of reverse osmosis water for dialysis and duodenoscope surveillance sampling. The laboratory would need to make an assessment, together with IPC and hospital administration, of whether such testing may be supported or more properly outsourced to a laboratory providing such specialized services (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0474">264</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0475">265</link>). In particular, for sterility testing of advanced therapeutic medicinal products (e.g., cellular and gene therapies) in the United States, requirements are governed by the FDA under Title 21 (parts 210–212) and should be performed in microbiology laboratories operating under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), which are quite different from the usual standards that govern diagnostic clinical microbiology laboratories (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0476">266</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0477">267</link>). Such specialized testing should ideally be outsourced to cGMP laboratories unless the clinical laboratory has the necessary expertise and is able to comply with the regulations.</para>

        <para id="ch0018s0000p0340">While there are numerous facets to diagnostic stewardship as outlined in this chapter, several key elements will facilitate the successful establishment of a DSP. These revolve around the following questions: (i) what should the goals of a DSP be? (ii) who should be involved in a DSP team? (iii) what focus areas and which diagnostic tests should be prioritized in a DSP? (iv) what tools can be used by a DSP? (v) how does the proposed DSP program interface with existing quality efforts (such as ASP, IPC, perioperative care, and DSP programs beyond clinical microbiology) within acute care and community settings (e.g., intermediate and long-term care facilities and primary care)? and (vi) how does a DSP measure impact and outcomes, demonstrate value, and get buy-in from various stakeholders and leadership? These questions are summarized in<anchor id="ch0018s0000a0079"/><link linkend="ch0018s0000a0081">Table 5</link>. Diagnostic stewardship is not primarily about cost-saving, although both direct and indirect savings may be a welcomed “side effect” of diagnostic stewardship activities. Its focus is on ensuring the right test at the right time, for the right patient, with the right interpretation and ensuing right action. A DSP should ensure value (which may be defined as the measured improvement in health outcomes for the cost spent for that improvement) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0478">268</link>) and implement evidence-based practice in clinical microbiology, where attention is paid to both accuracy and optimal patient outcomes (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0479">269</link>). The DSP team should be multidisciplinary, comprising laboratorians, clinicians, pharmacists, and IPC practitioners, and should involve informatics and information technology specialists. Early involvement of institutional leadership and stakeholders is key for buy-in and broad support of initiatives, and so that the appropriate manpower and resources may be allocated (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0233">23</link>). A DSP in clinical microbiology should interface well with ASP and IPC programs (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0215">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0236">26</link>) and also the broader, non-microbiology diagnostic stewardship efforts in the institution. It should ideally transcend hospital boundaries to primary and long-term community care facilities through collaborative partnerships and adoption of best practices. DSP teams may initially prioritize the stewardship of tests which are rapidly actionable—this may include the discontinuation of tests of low or no value, and the implementation of stewardship for high-cost or high-volume tests with questionable clinical value. DSPs should also prioritize common clinical syndromes, diseases, or pathogens with high clinical impact (e.g., morbidity or mortality) for which an accurate and/or time-sensitive diagnosis is needed (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0215">5</link>). This may involve implementation of new tests, optimizing utilization of existing tests (underutilization or inappropriate utilization may also be issues), development of diagnostic algorithms, or facilitation of clinical decision-making with more timely downstream antimicrobial stewardship or IPC actions. DSP tools should be directed at root causes of suboptimal diagnostic practices, and often a combination of tools may be required. These may include computerized decision support and IT solutions (e.g., prompts, hard-stops, or algorithms, displaying test costs), while bearing in mind that processes should minimize administrative and cognitive burden (“death by a thousand clicks”); developing a laboratory test formulary (i.e., restricting certain tests to specialists); making specimen collection instructions accessible and providing adequate training; providing clear laboratory acceptance and rejection criteria; reflex or reflective testing; cascade reporting for susceptibility results; and other measures targeting the analytical and postanalytical phases of testing (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0480">270</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0481">271</link>) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000a0081">Table 5</link>). In implementing these measures, laboratories and the DSP should not neglect engaging clinicians and other stakeholders via formal (e.g., policy changes, newsletters, laboratory catalog updates) and nonformal communication (personal and ad hoc) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0482">272</link>). Outcome measures may include metrics such as test utilization rates and appropriateness (which may sometimes need to be defined by other surrogate measures such as minimum retesting intervals or duplicate test rates), improved timing (i.e., not limited to test turnaround times, but also including decreased pre- and postanalytical delays, time to appropriate downstream actions such as appropriate therapy or institution of infection control measures, and also timing of diagnostic sampling), the proportion of patients receiving appropriate therapies, cost savings from prevention of unnecessary testing, and ultimately, clinically meaningful patient outcomes, which may comprise improved outcomes or non-inferior outcomes when diagnostic stewardship tools are applied; all measures should encompass cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, or cost-utility analyses (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0482">272</link>). The activities and clinical impact of a DSP should be documented by, for example, annual published reports to clinical leadership. These reports can strengthen institutional support, raise awareness, and allow dissemination of best practices (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0483">273</link>). While well-conducted randomized clinical trials may regenerate the most robust data, well-collected data from DSPs can generate very helpful data where real-time assessment of clinical interventions can be measured via a dissemination and implementation science framework such as PRISM (the Practical, Robust, Implementation and Sustainability Model) (<link linkend="ch0018s0000li0233">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0479">269</link>, <link linkend="ch0018s0000li0484">274</link>) and facilitate uptake by other laboratories.</para>
