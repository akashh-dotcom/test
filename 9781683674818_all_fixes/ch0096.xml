      <para id="ch0096s000000p0001">Anaerobic bacterial pathogens cause serious infections, particularly in the hospital environment. Antimicrobials are a mainstay of treatment, and as with aerobic pathogens, resistance in anaerobic bacteria is increasingly becoming problematic (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0005">1</link>). However, the ability of clinical microbiologists and patient-facing clinicians to ascertain the effects of antimicrobial resistance on infections by anaerobic bacterial pathogens is more difficult than with their aerobic counterparts. Among the issues are inadequate identification of the pathogen genus or species, frequent coexistence of anaerobes with aerobes in mixed infections, taxonomic name changes and reclassification of anaerobic pathogens, lack of consensus regarding susceptibility testing methods, and disagreements among breakpoint-setting organizations concerning breakpoints and interpretive categories. Susceptibility testing of anaerobes is difficult because anaerobes are slow growing and often fastidious. Empiric therapy for infections has often been started well before results of susceptibility testing are available. Consequently, few straightforward objective conclusions can be drawn about the impact of changes in antimicrobial therapy on the course of infection.</para>
      <para id="ch0096s000000p0002">Recent applications of molecular and proteomic identification methods such as 16S rRNA gene PCR and sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) are shifting clinical laboratory identification of isolates away from general categorization (e.g., Gram-positive anaerobic cocci) to pathogen genera and species. Compared to the limited identifications of anaerobes in the past by phenotypic or biochemical methods, MALDI-TOF MS offers faster, more accurate, and often more specific organism identification. An expected result is that increasing attention is being given to anaerobes in their roles in human infections. More anaerobes are being recognized as potential pathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory, and taxonomic changes are rapidly advancing the field. Consequently, many organisms previously classified together (such as<emphasis>Gleimia, Schaalia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Winkia</emphasis> spp. previously grouped within the genus <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis>) are now emerging with different antimicrobial susceptibility testing patterns, further emphasizing the importance of performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing for anaerobes. Past susceptibility studies have been somewhat limited by the grouping of various separate genera in one morphologic group (e.g., Gram-positive anaerobic cocci).</para>
      <para id="ch0096s000000p0003">Antimicrobial resistance in anaerobes has been increasing globally, particularly among<emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0006">2</link>). Antimicrobial susceptibility surveys demonstrate that resistance patterns differ by geographic location, not only between countries but also within a country or even among hospitals within the same region. For these reasons, it is becoming evident that antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobes is increasingly important. Review of prior antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance surveys aids clinical microbiologists in predicting possible resistance trends in certain organisms over time, but such surveys can be limited. Some surveys inappropriately apply broth microdilution as a testing method to a variety of anaerobes beyond <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Parabacteroides</emphasis> spp. Some utilize disk diffusion for anaerobes, which is not currently recognized by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for anaerobes. Finally, some surveys employ commercial agar gradient diffusion methods but fail to follow package inserts by altering inoculum concentration, agar medium types, or times of endpoint reading.</para>
      <para id="ch0096s000000p0004">In addition to details of the testing method used, it is also important to be aware of which breakpoints are being applied, since they can differ between breakpoint-setting organizations (<anchor id="ch0096s000000a0002"/><link linkend="ch0096s000000a0004">Table 1</link>). For example, a higher prevalence of resistance may be reported for meropenem if the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoint is applied for <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> spp. rather than the CLSI breakpoint. The reason for the different breakpoints is in part the different testing methods used to gather data for setting breakpoints and differences in interpretation of breakpoint data. Both committees reassess the anaerobe breakpoints periodically; therefore, it is important to use the latest edition of the respective CLSI and EUCAST documents. In 2018, CLSI lowered the piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible and intermediate breakpoints for anaerobes. Therefore, readers should play close attention to particular breakpoints applied when assessing resistance rates over time in the literature or in antibiograms at their own institutions. Throughout this chapter, CLSI breakpoints are used, unless otherwise noted.</para>

      <para id="ch0096s000000p0005">Antimicrobial resistance in anaerobes can be acquired; some resistance is intrinsic. All anaerobes are considered resistant to aminoglycosides, since these antibiotics cannot reach their target ribosomes. Uptake of aminoglycosides requires the use of oxygen- or nitrogen-dependent electron transport, which anaerobes do not possess (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0007">3</link>). Anaerobes are also considered innately resistant to fosfomycin, aztreonam, and trimethoprim. The quinolones ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are generally ineffective against anaerobes due to poor penetration at target sites and low affinity for target enzymes. However, the fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin demonstrates good activity against anaerobes. Resistance in specific anaerobe-antimicrobial agent combinations (e.g., resistance of <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> spp. to metronidazole) is covered in specific sections of this chapter.</para>
      <para id="ch0096s000000p0006">This chapter outlines susceptibility testing methods and emphasizes the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Susceptibility data are summarized for major antimicrobials within four groups of anaerobic pathogens (Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive spore-forming bacilli, Gram-positive non-spore-forming bacilli, and cocci). Pertinent trends of increasing resistance for each group are noted. Specific recommendations for testing and reporting are reviewed.</para>

        <para id="ch0096s000000p0007">The CLSI-recommended reference method for susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria is agar dilution, also called the Wadsworth method (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0008">4</link>). All other methods of anaerobic susceptibility testing are compared to agar dilution for method validity. This method involves making a series of 2-fold dilutions of a given antibiotic and adding them to molten agar, which is then poured into petri dishes and allowed to solidify. Standardized inocula of up to 36 anaerobic bacterial isolates are applied in spots across the agar surface using an inoculum-replicating device. Once the inoculum has been absorbed onto the agar, the plates are inverted and incubated under anaerobic conditions. After plates have been incubated approximately 48 h under anaerobic conditions, they can be visually examined. The reported MIC for an isolate is the lowest concentration at which the isolate is inhibited by the antimicrobial agent. Agar dilution is labor-intensive and requires technical expertise to perform. Due to the amount of time and labor required to perform the agar dilution method, it is generally impractical for daily and routine susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria in most clinical microbiology laboratories. An overview of the agar dilution method, including advantages and disadvantages, is presented in <anchor id="ch0096s000000a0014"/><link linkend="ch0096s000000a0016">Table 2</link>.</para>

          <para id="ch0096s000000p0008">The recommended CLSI medium is supplemented Brucella blood agar, which supports the growth of essentially all anaerobes (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0009">5</link>). EUCAST recommends fastidious anaerobe agar (FAA) for agar dilution testing. FAA powder can be purchased in the United States and plates made in-house. For the Brucella blood agar, Brucella base is supplemented with hemin (5 μg/ml) and vitamin K<subscript>1</subscript> (1 μg/ml) prior to autoclaving. Once the medium has cooled to 48 to 50°C, 5% (vol/vol) laked (lysed) sheep blood is added. Additional details regarding the preparation of this agar and its supplements can be found in CLSI document M11 (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0008">4</link>). Stock solutions can be made in advance for hemin, vitamin K<subscript>1</subscript>, and laked (lysed) sheep blood; the storage conditions and shelf life of these stocks are detailed in CLSI document M11 (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0008">4</link>). For preparation of 15- by 100-mm plates, a final volume of 20 ml should be used. Agar deeps containing 17 ml of Brucella agar base, hemin, and vitamin K<subscript>1</subscript> without laked (lysed) blood can be autoclaved and stored at 4 to 8°C for up to 1 month. When needed for testing, the agar deeps are melted and then cooled in a water bath to 48 to 50°C. When the agar has cooled, the laked (lysed) sheep blood (1 ml) and the antimicrobial dilutions (2 ml) are added. The tubes are gently inverted twice to mix the tube contents, and then the medium is poured into a single petri dish (15- by 100-mm). For square petri dishes, the process is similar; however, 25.5 ml of Brucella agar is used with 1.5 ml of laked (lysed) sheep blood, and 3 ml of the antimicrobial dilution is added. Care should be taken to avoid introduction of bubbles during mixing and pouring. Plates should be left undisturbed for 15 to 20 min to solidify. Once the agar is solid, the plates are placed in an incubator or laminar flow hood in an inverted position with the lids ajar for 30 min to dry. Antimicrobial-free control plates should be made by adding 2 ml of sterile, distilled water or buffer to the melted deeps for use as anaerobic controls between series of antibiotics and for aerobic control plates. Plates should be used the day they are made unless storage times have been validated with the tested antimicrobial(s).</para>

Alternatively, the initial suspension may be prepared by inoculating colonies into enriched prereduced thioglycolate or other clear broth medium that supports good growth and incubating for 4 to 24 h to obtain adequate turbidity (dilution may be required). Incubation time is dependent on the starting inoculum suspension concentration and the growth rate of the bacterial species being tested. Equivalence to a 0.5 McFarland standard can be measured visually by comparison to a Wickerham card or with a photometer. The use of different broth media can affect photometer readings; therefore, validation of the photometer is recommended.</para>

QC testing with anaerobic control organisms has two functions during MIC gradient diffusion testing: (i) it ensures that the antimicrobial strip has the right concentration, and (ii) it verifies that anaerobiosis was maintained during incubation.</para>

It is labeled as research use only and contains 15 antimicrobial agents (<ulink url="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AN02B">https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AN02B</ulink>). Currently, there is no commercially available panel that has FDA approval. Custom panels are also available from Thermo Fisher Scientific in both dried and frozen formats based on the clinical laboratory’s testing needs. Studies evaluating the performance of these commercially available panels for anaerobic susceptibility testing are limited. Dowzicky et al. compared meropenem on this Sensititre panel to agar dilution for 47 Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes, with the majority being Gram-negative organisms (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0021">17</link>). An overall agreement of 93% (plus or minus one 2-fold dilution) between the two methods was seen.

Thus, chromogenic cephalosporin testing does not need to be performed on these species. β-Lactamase testing may be performed for other Gram-negative organisms, such as <emphasis>Prevotella, Porphyromonas</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Fusobacterium</emphasis>, or Gram-positive organisms, such as <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp. Chromogenic cephalosporin disks can be purchased from several manufacturers such as Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD), Hardy Diagnostics and Thermo Fisher Scientific, although not all chromogenic disks are FDA cleared for use with anaerobes. When β-lactamase is produced, the enzyme hydrolyzes the β-lactam ring, resulting in a color change on the disk from yellow to red. Reactions typically occur within 5 to 10 min for most anaerobes. However, in some <emphasis>Fusobacterium</emphasis> spp., the enzymatic reaction can be much slower (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0022">18</link>). Therefore, it is recommended to hold all chromogenic cephalosporin disk tests for a full 30 min when testing anaerobes before resulting the test as negative. It is important to keep in mind that resistance to β-lactam antibiotics can be mediated by mechanisms other than β-lactamase production; thus, a negative β-lactamase test does not ensure susceptibility to ampicillin or penicillin. Other mechanisms of β-lactam resistance, such as alteration of penicillin-binding proteins, have been found in some strains of <emphasis>Parabacteroides distasonis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0023">19</link>). If an isolate tests positive, it should be reported as resistant to penicillin and ampicillin regardless of the MIC result. If the penicillin or ampicillin is susceptible or intermediate despite a positive β-lactamase result, the laboratory may choose to hide the MIC result and change the penicillin or ampicillin interpretation to resistant. Alternatively, the laboratory may choose to change the tested MIC to ≥2 μg/ml (CLSI resistant breakpoint) when reporting the interpretive category as resistant.</para>

Work by Johnson et al. has shown that oxygen toxicity plays an important role in altering the number of viable organisms in the inoculum suspension (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0024">20</link>). The authors of a recently published paper reevaluated the use of disk diffusion testing with <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Parabacteroides</emphasis> spp. using Brucella blood agar with some antimicrobials (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0025">21</link>). Their study showed adequate reproducibility, with 88.5% of repeated measurements within 0 to 3 mm. The disk diffusion results agreed with the interpretive category based on the broth microdilution method for some antimicrobials (e.g., metronidazole, imipenem, moxifloxacin, and tigecycline). However, the zone sizes overlapped intermediate and resistant interpretive categories for other antimicrobials, including cefoxitin and β-lactam–β-lactamase inhibitor combinations.</para>
      <para id="ch0096s000000p0039">In September 2021, EUCAST published a disk diffusion method using FAA supplemented with 5% mechanically defibrinated horse blood and set tentative QC criteria for select rapidly growing anaerobic bacteria. Commercial FAA medium plates are not widely available yet in the United States, but FAA powder can be purchased and plates made in-house. Agar depth for the FAA plates must be 4.0 ± 0.5 mm. Plates must be dry prior to inoculation, and it is not recommended to prereduce the FAA plates before use. A 1.0 McFarland is required for the inoculum suspension, and the inoculum should be plated within 15 min of preparation. There are also restrictions on the amount of oxygen exposure at the various steps of the EUCAST disk diffusion process. Zone sizes are measured at 16 to 20 h. EUCAST recommends including testing of<emphasis>Clostridium perfringens</emphasis> DSM 25589 with a 5-μg metronidazole disk to control for the anaerobic environment when testing. A reading guide has also been published by EUCAST to aid with this method. EUCAST QC is currently limited to benzylpenicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, vancomycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole, which are the six antimicrobial agents for which disk diffusion EUCAST breakpoints are set. The associated publication of the studies supporting this guidance also included testing of amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, chloramphenicol, and moxifloxacin, but breakpoints were not set for these antimicrobials. One hundred seventy <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> sp. isolates were tested at three laboratories. CLSI has not completed a reassessment of disk diffusion testing for anaerobic bacteria, but efforts are under way. Caution should be used with disk diffusion and anaerobes, and strict adherence to the EUCAST method is recommended if disk diffusion testing is performed.</para>

Seifert et al. (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0045">41</link>) reported ≥90% ertapenem and meropenem susceptibility (according to prior EUCAST resistance breakpoints for ertapenem of &gt;1 mg/liter and for meropenem of &gt;8 mg/liter) for various <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> spp. isolated from intra-abdominal infected sources collected in a multicenter German study in 2007; of note, EUCAST carbapenem susceptibility breakpoints are 1 to 2 doubling dilutions lower than CLSI susceptibility breakpoints, which may account for the lower level of susceptibility compared to studies that apply CLSI breakpoints (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0045">41</link>). One of the highest rates of carbapenem resistance reported in <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> is 13.5% resistance to ertapenem in an agar dilution study of isolates in northern Taiwan (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0046">42</link>). The newest agent on the market with FDA-approved anaerobe indications is imipenem-relebactam. Several studies have shown potent activity of imipenem-relebactam against anaerobic species.

        <para id="ch0096s000000p0048">Carbapenem resistance in<emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> is typically chromosomal and associated with the presence of the <emphasis>cfiA</emphasis> resistance gene, which encodes a zinc metallo-β-lactamase enzyme that confers resistance to β-lactams and β-lactam–β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0049">45</link>). However, the presence of the <emphasis>cfiA</emphasis> gene is not sufficient for expression of phenotypic carbapenem resistance; <emphasis>cfiA</emphasis> in <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> is silent unless an insertion sequence element activates it (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0050">46</link>). Upregulating insertion sequences associated with <emphasis>cfiA</emphasis> lead to carbapenem resistance in most, but not all, cases. Sóki et al. explored the carbapenem resistance mechanisms of 22 European strains of <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> and <emphasis>Parabacteroides</emphasis> with imipenem MICs of ≥4 μg/ml as tested by Etest or agar dilution (4 mg/liter was the prior intermediate category by EUCAST standards; ≤4 μg/ml is susceptible by CLSI standards) (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0050">46</link>). The authors discovered that 3/12 isolates with an imipenem MIC of 4 μg/ml possessed the <emphasis>cfiA</emphasis> gene, and only one of those three contained an insertion sequence which presumably activated the <emphasis>cfiA</emphasis> gene. On the other hand, 7/10 isolates with MICs of 8 to &gt;32 μg/ml contained the <emphasis>cfiA</emphasis> gene. Three of those seven isolates did not contain an insertion sequence; the MICs for these three isolates were 8, 32, and &gt;32 μg/ml. Therefore, activation of the <emphasis>cfiA</emphasis> gene by undetermined mechanisms other than insertion sequences may lead to imipenem resistance. Nakamura and colleagues reported a case of fatal sepsis due to multidrug-resistant <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> originating from an intra-abdominal infection and possessing an insertion sequence element upstream of the <emphasis>cfiA</emphasis> gene, leading to an MIC of &gt;8 μg/ml of meropenem and imipenem as tested by broth microdilution (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0051">47</link>). Investigators confirmed carbapenemase production in this isolate by use of the carbapenem inactivation method and the presence of a metallo-β-lactamase by use of the carbapenem EDTA Etest strip (MBL IP/IPI; bioMérieux).

Compared to ertapenem susceptibility determination by Etest, the anaerobic mCIM performed well, with a categorical agreement of 87% (52/60) with no very major errors and an elevated major error rate of 11%. Although many phenotypic assays have not been well studied for use with anaerobes, molecular and phenotypic studies such as these may increase our understanding of resistance mechanisms in the future.</para>

Resistance of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> to metronidazole is relatively infrequent in most areas of the world, but this conclusion depends upon which breakpoints are used to interpret the data (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0075">71</link>). CLSI metronidazole breakpoints for anaerobes, including <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>, are susceptible at ≤8 μg/ml, intermediate at 16 μg/ml, and resistant at ≥32 μg/ml. EUCAST has established breakpoints specifically for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> that differ from the breakpoints of metronidazole for other anaerobes and are lower than the CLSI breakpoints: susceptible, ≤2 mg/liter; resistant, &gt;2 mg/liter (<ulink url="https://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints">https://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints</ulink>). In a U.S.-based survey of 925 <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> isolates obtained in 2011 and 2012, 3.6% displayed resistance to metronidazole based on the EUCAST breakpoint, while no isolate was classified as resistant based on the CLSI breakpoint (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0076">72</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0096s000000p0063">Elevated MICs of vancomycin for<emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> have also been reported. Most studies have applied the EUCAST vancomycin breakpoint (susceptible, ≤2 mg/liter; resistant, &gt;2 mg/liter), since the CLSI has not set a vancomycin clinical breakpoint for anaerobes. Surveys have generally reported vancomycin resistance below 5%, but higher percentages have been reported (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0077">73</link>). A 2011 to 2012 U.S. survey reported 17.9% of 925 <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> isolates with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin; the MIC<subscript>90</subscript> of vancomycin was 4 μg/ml, which was higher than the 1 μg/ml noted in a similar study 8 years prior (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0076">72</link>, <link linkend="ch0096s000000li0078">74</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0096s000000p0064">There are no EUCAST or CLSI breakpoints for rifampin, but elevated MICs (&gt;16 μg/ml) have been reported, present in 8 to 13% of isolates in different regions (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0077">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0096s000000li0079">75</link>). Decreased susceptibility to fidaxomicin is rare. In early clinical trials of fidaxomicin, the reported MIC<subscript>90</subscript> was 0.25 μg/ml, and the highest reported MIC was 1 μg/ml (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0080">76</link>). One <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> isolate with an MIC of 16 μg/ml of fidaxomicin was discovered in the clinical trials, reported from a subject with recurrence of disease 6 days after disease resolution following fidaxomicin treatment (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0081">77</link>). A recent survey of 925 <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> isolates recovered from toxin-positive stool specimens showed that all isolates were inhibited by fidaxomicin at ≤1 μg/ml, with an MIC<subscript>90</subscript> of 0.5 μg/ml (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0076">72</link>). <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> has also shown resistance to a variety of antimicrobials, including clindamycin (8 to 100%), erythromycin (13 to 100%), and fluoroquinolones (8 to 100%), based on 30 antimicrobial susceptibility studies published between 2012 and 2015 (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0075">71</link>). Resistance to cephalosporins is almost universal in <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0007">3</link>). Among the cephamycins, resistance to cefoxitin and cefotetan is common, with at least 80% resistance in tested isolates (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0075">71</link>). A recent U.S. survey of 925 <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> isolates demonstrated 33.5% resistance to moxifloxacin and 23.8% resistance to clindamycin, confirming high resistance rates in binary toxin-producing strains (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0076">72</link>). CLSI 2013-2016 antibiogram data from U.S. medical centers for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> isolates from intestinal sources demonstrated resistance rates of 37% for penicillin, 38% for clindamycin, and 25% for moxifloxacin (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0011">7</link>). Only 4% of isolates demonstrated resistance to imipenem, while no resistance was noted for ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, or metronidazole.</para>
        <para id="ch0096s000000p0065">Differences in susceptibility rates have been observed when comparing ribotypes. In North America, ribotype 027 is resistant to multiple antimicrobials, including rifampin, clindamycin, and moxifloxacin (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0079">75</link>). Another hypervirulent strain, ribotype 078, showed elevated MICs (≥8 μg/ml) to ciprofloxacin in 94% of 49 tested isolates, and 29% resistance (≥16 μg/ml) to imipenem (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0082">78</link>). Antimicrobial resistance of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> is important to monitor, not only for patient treatment, but also for the epidemiologic associations with certain ribotypes. For example, the emergence of the hypervirulent <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> strain 027/BI/NAP1 has been associated with consumption of fluoroquinolones (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0083">79</link>). Even though fluoroquinolones are not used clinically to treat CDI, antimicrobial pressure from widespread use of these agents is believed to have allowed the spread of this fluoroquinolone-resistant, hypervirulent strain.</para>

However, CLSI breakpoints for anaerobes are not divided by genus and were developed for the anaerobes as a group, irrespective of genus. Different antimicrobials are also suggested for aerobic testing of lactobacilli compared to those listed in CLSI M100 for anaerobic testing. In addition, M45 and M100 breakpoints differ for antimicrobials present in both the <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> table and the anaerobe table (ampicillin, penicillin, imipenem, meropenem, and clindamycin) with aerobic lactobacilli breakpoints set at least two doubling dilutions lower than the anaerobe breakpoints.

Laboratories may choose to report aerobic lactobacilli using the CLSI M45 table and report anaerobic lactobacilli using the CLSI M100 table breakpoints. If this approach is taken, it is best to clearly define aerobic and anaerobic lactobacilli by species using the M45 definition as a guide. One drawback to this approach includes possible confusion on the part of the clinical teams when different interpretive categories are provided for lactobacilli of different species but with the same MIC.

Finally, Gram-positive cocci are also highly associated with diabetic foot infections (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0133">129</link>). They are less commonly causes of bloodstream infections or intra-abdominal infections compared to <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> or other Gram-negative bacilli.</para>
      <para id="ch0096s000000p0089">Gram-negative cocci include<emphasis>Veillonella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Megasphaera</emphasis>, among others. <emphasis>Veillonella</emphasis> is the most commonly recovered Gram-negative coccus in the clinical microbiology laboratory. It is found as part of the normal microbiota in the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and may cause disease in these anatomic sites when defenses are compromised. <emphasis>Veillonella</emphasis> is often recovered as part of a mixed culture; thus, its virulence capabilities are poorly understood (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0134">130</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0096s000000p0090">More than any other group of anaerobes, the Gram-positive cocci have undergone major taxonomic updates within the past 20 years (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0134">130</link>).

Therefore, if an isolate of <emphasis>S. saccharolyticus</emphasis> grows only under anaerobic conditions, and considering the lack of data supporting an anaerobe antimicrobial susceptibility testing method for this organism, testing <emphasis>S. saccharolyticus</emphasis> by agar dilution or agar gradient diffusion under anaerobic conditions is of questionable value. More research is needed to determine the most appropriate testing approach. However, it is possible to test for β-lactamase activity with a rapid β-lactamase nitrocefin disk, following the procedure for anaerobes by waiting approximately 30 min for disk positivity. The inducible β-lactamase protocols highlighted by CLSI (M100) for aerobic <emphasis>Staphylococcus</emphasis> spp. have not been validated for <emphasis>S. saccharolyticus</emphasis> under anaerobic conditions and therefore are not recommended for use.</para>

      <para id="ch0096s000000p0103">For Gram-negative anaerobes, penicillin and ampicillin may be tested. An MIC may be obtained and the antimicrobials selectively reported. If a positive β-lactamase disk test is obtained with a Gram-negative anaerobe, report it as resistant to penicillin and ampicillin.

      <para id="ch0096s000000p0105">Information collected from clinical laboratories can be used to determine the prevalence of resistance for a particular pathogen, antimicrobial agent, and region. Resistance is fundamentally a local phenomenon. Data from such resistance surveys (e.g., antibiograms) guide clinicians in their choices of antimicrobial for empiric therapy (i.e., treatment either without culturing the pathogen or when the organism identification is known but susceptibility results have not yet been released). When surveys are carried out in the same location over a period of years, they can provide insight into how quickly resistance is increasing or whether changes in antimicrobial exposure are lowering the prevalence of resistance. Many assumptions underlie such longitudinal studies, including unchanging breakpoints, stable patient populations, and comparable sampling from one year to the next. Consequently, the methods underlying antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the determination of breakpoints are crucial to interpreting survey data. These factors are sometimes problematic with anaerobic pathogens.</para>
      <para id="ch0096s000000p0106">Individual institutions should perform periodic surveillance of anaerobes to monitor resistance rates in their facility; ideally, this should be performed each year. A study by Hecht et al. showed that antibiograms can vary significantly between facilities, despite close geographic placement (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0155">151</link>). Therefore, the establishment of an antibiogram to outline resistance patterns observed at a given facility would be helpful with the determination of empiric therapy for a patient. The updated CLSI document M39 guideline provides details on the proper collection, analysis, and presentation of cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility test data (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0156">152</link>). The current guidelines describe gathering data from at least 30 isolates per species collected over a 1-year period to generate meaningful data. However, when clinically relevant organisms are not encountered at this level of frequency, laboratories may choose to merge data from 1 or more years to obtain the minimum number of isolates. For optimal surveillance tracking, testing of 75 to 100 isolates per species is recommended (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0156">152</link>). Inclusion of <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> and <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp. should be considered due to the frequent clinical significance of these species. If possible, <emphasis>Prevotella</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Fusobacterium</emphasis> spp., and other frequently encountered pathogens should also be considered for inclusion. The CLSI Anaerobe Working Group has added a multisite antibiogram in an appendix of document M100, which is updated every few years, as a resource for facilities which are not able to generate a local antibiogram (<link linkend="ch0096s000000li0011">7</link>).</para>

Laboratorians can refer to the antibiogram while waiting for reference laboratory susceptibility testing results. Published antibiograms provide timely data on empiric susceptibility rates of various antimicrobials; however, it is important to recognize that the data presented in the anaerobe antibiogram from the CLSI are derived from isolates obtained globally and may not be applicable to isolates in a given hospital or region.</para>

        <para id="ch0096s000000p0108">The increased use of proteomic and molecular techniques by clinical laboratories to identify anaerobic bacteria has allowed more accurate species-level identifications to be attained. Although data are only anecdotal, some believe that antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria is being requested more often by clinicians. In the past, anaerobic pathogens were often reported only with broad terms such as “Gram-positive anaerobe,” whereas they are now often reported using genus and species names. Additionally, taxonomic updates and the increased ability to identify organisms more accurately over time must be considered when interpreting antimicrobial resistance trends and patterns over different geographic regions. Thus, the need for anaerobe susceptibility testing is likely to increase as more clinical microbiology laboratories implement new technology.</para>
        <para id="ch0096s000000p0109">Empiric information regarding antimicrobial susceptibility can be particularly helpful for clinicians treating a patient with an infection due to an anaerobe. In contrast to many aerobic bacteria, anaerobes tend to be slow growing, and pathogen identification is often obtained well before antimicrobial susceptibility test results. In addition, anaerobes are often present in polymicrobial aerobic/anaerobic infections or mixed with other anaerobes. Thus, it may be difficult to obtain pure cultures for susceptibility testing. In such cases, it is helpful to know the predicted anaerobic susceptibility patterns based on information about strains circulating in the local region.</para>
        <para id="ch0096s000000p0110">Surveys and studies of anaerobe antimicrobial resistance and trends vary in their quality and breadth of organisms covered. Resistance patterns differ by geographic region, and some resistance rates have changed significantly over time. It is unclear how many of the differences among regions are due to true geographic variation, to methodologic testing variation, or to application of different breakpoints. Patterns of resistance that deserve close attention due to rising rates include the following.</para>

        <para id="ch0096s000000p0111">As with aerobic bacteria, anaerobes have developed multiple mechanisms that lead to antimicrobial resistance. These resistance factors include genes located in the bacterial chromosome or within mobile genetic elements (plasmids or transposons), leading to resistance via production of enzymes that degrade antimicrobials or alterations in antimicrobial targets. Clinical laboratories should provide susceptibility testing of anaerobes to optimize patient care. More frequent susceptibility testing of anaerobes will lead to a better understanding of the epidemiology of resistance.</para>
