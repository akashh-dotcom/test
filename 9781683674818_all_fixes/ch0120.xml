The infectious nature of HSV was demonstrated in 1919 (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0003">3</link>). The concepts of seropositivity and recurrence developed in the 1930s (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0005">5</link>). In the 1960s, antigenically distinct strains (HSV-1 and HSV-2) were identified. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are two of nine known human herpesviruses. In addition, herpes B virus (<emphasis>Herpesvirus simiae</emphasis>), a herpesvirus infecting macaques, is a rare but important zoonotic pathogen in humans.</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0002p0002">The linear, double-stranded genome is 152 kbp for HSV-1 and 155 kbp for HSV-2. HSV-1 and HSV-2 share 83% nucleotide identity within their protein-coding regions. The genome is organized into a unique long and a unique short region, each of which is flanked by inverted-repeat regions. Although significant stretches of sequence are conserved between unrelated clinical isolates, identification of isolates can be achieved by sequencing, PCR, or restriction endonuclease digestion.</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0002p0003">The HSV virion is 120 to 300 nm in diameter, with a central electron-dense core containing the DNA, an icosahedral capsid consisting of 162 capsomeres surrounding the core, and a tegument layer surrounded by a spiked envelope containing viral glycoproteins that aid in attachment, penetration, and immune evasion. The envelope is a trilaminar, lipid-rich layer derived largely from the nuclear membrane of the infected cell. Because the viral envelope is lipid rich, the virus is readily inactivated. Lipid solvents such as 70% ethanol and isopropanol (but not alcohol at &gt;95%), Lysol, bleach, exposure to a pH of &lt;5 or &gt;11, and temperatures of &gt;56°C for 30 min will all eliminate infectivity (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0007">7</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0002p0004">Viral replication begins with attachment to the target cell via cell type-dependent host receptors (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0009">9</link>). After attachment, the viral envelope and cell membrane fuse, releasing the capsid into the cell. The capsid is translocated to the nuclear pores (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0011">11</link>), and DNA is released into the nucleus. The tegument protein VP16 induces expression of the immediate early, or alpha, proteins, which in turn transactivate the expression of the early, or beta, genes. The early genes are maximally expressed 5 to 7 h after infection and are involved in the synthesis of progeny viral DNA. DNA replication is required for optimal synthesis of the late, or gamma, genes, which are mainly structural proteins. Progeny DNA is processed and assembled into preformed capsids within the cell nucleus. The DNA-containing capsids attach to patches of the nuclear membrane that contain viral tegument proteins and viral glycoproteins. In sensory ganglia neurons, the virus establishes latency, and episomal HSV DNA is maintained for the lifetime of the infected individual. Upon reactivation, nucleocapsids are transported anterograde to the axon terminus, where the final assembly of enveloped virus occurs (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0012">12</link>), typically with infection of surrounding epithelial cells. The replication cycle is complete within about 20 h in epithelial cells.</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0002p0005">Innate immune mechanisms, such as activation of macrophages, NK cells, and interferon production, play a predominant role in the control of primary infection, while both innate and adaptive immunity are important in the control of recurrences. Although both cellular and humoral immunity are thought to be important, people with defective cellular immunity often show severe HSV infections, while those with agammaglobulinemia do not (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0013">13</link>). CD4<superscript>+</superscript> T cells infiltrate mucocutaneous lesions early in lesion development (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0014">14</link>), followed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0015">15</link>). HSV-specific T cells can be detected early in lesion development and persist at the lesion site after healing (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0017">17</link>). T cells also play an important role in controlling viral reactivation from the dorsal root ganglia, via noncytotoxic mechanisms that do not result in neuronal death (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0018">18</link>).</para>

IgG, IgM, and IgA responses to individual viral proteins arise within the first weeks after infection (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0013">13</link>). IgM wanes after 2 to 3 months, appearing sporadically thereafter, and in about a third of patients after recurrent genital herpes episodes. Antibody titer may or may not rise after recurrences (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0020">20</link>). However, IgG titers are maintained for years after primary infection.</para>

As a result, it is difficult to distinguish antibodies to HSV-1 from those to HSV-2 (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0021">21</link>). In particular, in HSV-1-seropositive patients, seroconversion to HSV-2 is accompanied by brisk anamnestic responses to HSV-1, resulting in the predominant antibody response being directed toward HSV-1 rather than to HSV-2 for prolonged periods (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0021">21</link>). While type-specific epitopes have been demonstrated on the major viral proteins, only glycoprotein G (gG) elicits predominantly type-specific responses.</para>

        <para id="ch0120s0002s0003p0001">HSV infections occur worldwide with no seasonal distribution. The virus is spread by direct contact with virus in secretions. Incubation periods range from 1 to 26 days. The prevalence of HSV-1 infection increases gradually from childhood, reaching 80% or more in later years (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0022">22</link>). In contrast, the seroprevalence of HSV-2 remains low until adolescence and the onset of sexual activity. The incidence of antibodies to HSV-2 in the United States reached 21% in the period of 1988 to 1994; however, seropositivity rates declined to 16% for the period of 2005 to 2008 (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0023">23</link>) and 12% for 2015 to 2016 (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0024">24</link>). The rate of seropositivity varies widely, reaching more than 50% in some demographic groups (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0026">26</link>). In general, the seroprevalence of HSV-2 is higher in the United States than in other developed countries (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0028">28</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0003p0002">A large percentage of individuals who are seropositive for HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 are unaware of the infection (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0029">29</link>). Such people make up an important reservoir of infection. The risk of genital HSV transmission has been reported to be reduced by 30 to 50% through the use of condoms (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0031">31</link>), and a case-crossover analysis of previous study data suggests that the reduction of transmission may be substantially more than previously estimated (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0032">32</link>). Transmission is also reduced approximately 50% by disclosure of HSV infection status to sexual partners (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0033">33</link>) and by approximately 50% with suppressive antiviral therapy in the source partner (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0034">34</link>). It is likely that combining these approaches further reduces risk.</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0003p0003">Future studies of epidemiology and transmission of HSV-1 and HSV-2 will be informed by the growing availability of genomic sequence data for these viruses. As of mid-2017, approximately 150 genomes are available in NCBI for each of HSV-1 and HSV-2—an increase of more than 10-fold over the previous 4 years. Genomic sequencing of HSV-1 and HSV-2 is difficult owing to the extraordinarily high GC content (70%), the presence of many repeats, and the need to enrich from human DNA. Early studies of HSV genomic evolution and diversity highlighted the overall limited diversity among the sequenced viruses as well as the role played by both intertypic (HSV-1 × HSV-2) and intratypic (HSV-1 × HSV-1) recombination and the high burden of homopolymeric frameshift mutations (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0036">36</link>). Indeed, the majority of HSV-2 sequences deposited to date contain HSV-1 sequences (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0038">38</link>). Hybridization capture methods allow direct sequencing from clinical specimens rather than cultured isolates, as was required previously (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0038">38</link>). Many unanswered questions remain concerning the evolution of HSV-1 and HSV-2 genomes in transmission chains and global diversity, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.</para>

Young children may present with classic primary HSV-1 infection characterized by gingivostomatitis, fever, and marked submandibular lymphadenopathy. Oral lesions progress to ulceration and heal without scarring over 2 to 3 weeks. Adolescents may present with pharyngitis and mononucleosis.</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0005p0002">Primary infection with HSV-2 classically presents as herpes genitalis with extensive, bilateral vesicles, fever, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and dysuria.

This trend is thought to result from changing sexual practices, including increased oral-genital exposure (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0042">42</link>). The clinical presentation of primary genital HSV-1 cannot be distinguished from that of HSV-2.

        <para id="ch0120s0002s0006p0001">Primary infection with HSV-1 or HSV-2 is followed by the establishment of latency in sensory ganglia, typically the trigeminal ganglia for orolabial disease and the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia for genital disease. Periodically, the virus reactivates and travels via the nerve axon to oral or genital sites, resulting in release of infectious virus and, in some cases, lesion formation. Recurrent disease has milder symptoms and a shorter time to lesion healing than primary episodes (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0046">46</link>). The frequency of HSV-2 genital recurrences varies widely among individuals, ranging from none to 12 or more per year (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0047">47</link>), with a mean rate of 0.33 recurrences/month. Orolabial HSV-1 recurrence rates are lower, with a mean of 0.12 episodes/month, while genital HSV-1 infection recurs even less frequently (mean, 0.02 episodes/month) (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0048">48</link>). While HSV-2 may be isolated from the pharynx during primary genital herpes episodes, orolabial HSV-2 recurrences are extremely infrequent (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0048">48</link>).</para>

The risk of recurrence is similar between patients presenting with true primary and first recognized recurrent episodes (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0020">20</link>).

The risk of maternal-to-infant transmission is 10-fold higher in mothers experiencing unrecognized primary infection during the time of labor than in those shedding HSV as a result of recurrent, subclinical reactivation. This conclusion was drawn in part from the finding that the neonatal infection rate is 54 per 100,000 among HSV-seronegative mothers, 26 per 100,000 among mothers with only HSV-1 antibody, and 22 per 100,000 among all mothers with HSV-2 antibody (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0055">55</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0056">56</link>).

After the acquisition of BioHelix by Quidel (San Diego, CA), the isothermal helicase-dependent amplification technology was incorporated into the FDA-cleared Quidel AmpliVue HSV 1+2 assay, which provides differentiation of HSV-1 from HSV-2. Quidel also offers the FDA-cleared Lyra Direct HSV 1+2/VZV assay, which is a multiplex PCR assay that detects and differentiates HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV, and the Solana HSV 1+2/VZV assay, a multiplex helicase-dependent amplification-based test for the detection and differentiation of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV.</para>

        <para id="ch0120s0002s0016p0008">Other rapid sample-to-answer FDA-cleared tests include the BioFire FilmArray meningitis/encephalitis (ME) panel and the Focus Simplexa HSV-1 and HSV-2. Of these, only the Simplexa is cleared for both CSF and swabs. The FilmArray ME panel detects 14 pathogens directly from CSF, in addition to HSV1/2, and had a sensitivity of 100% on 16 HSV1/2-positive specimens across 1,560 prospectively collected CSF specimens (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0120">120</link>). Notably, three false-positive HSV1/2 results were found during the study; these and similar false-positive HSV results have been ascribed to preanalytical contamination (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0123">123</link>). False-negative results have also been reported for the FilmArray ME panel compared to other real-time PCR testing (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0124">124</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0125">125</link>). A meta-analysis found an overall FilmArray ME panel sensitivity of 84.3% for HSV-1 and suggested repeat sampling and testing in cases where HSV-1 encephalitis is suspected (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0126">126</link>). The Simplexa assay also showed 96.2% (50/52) sensitivity and 97.9% (47/48) specificity on 100 CSF specimens, and further testing of discrepant samples suggested that sensitivity could be 100% (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0111">111</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0120s0002s0017s0001p0001">Although molecular testing is almost universally preferred, virus detection methods including culture and modified culture can be used to diagnose mucocutaneous, genital, and ocular lesions and are required for antiviral phenotypic testing (<anchor id="ch0120s0002s0017s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0120s0002s0017s0003a0003">Table 2</link>). Conventional culture uses cells that are permissive for HSV-1 and HSV-2 as well as other viruses that may be of diagnostic importance, though this may be problematic with concomitant circulation of monkeypox virus. Inoculated cells are examined frequently for CPE (see below). In our laboratory, 95% of HSV isolates produce CPE by day 5; only 5% require 5 to 14 days. Mink lung cells, rhabdomyosarcoma cells, human diploid fibroblasts such as MRC-5 and WI-38 cells, and human epidermoid carcinoma lines such as HEp-2 and A549 are commercially available. Direct comparisons suggest that test sensitivity can be markedly affected by the cells used, particularly with a low-titer HSV inoculum (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0127">127</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0120s0002s0017s0001p0002">Infected cells develop cytoplasmic granulation and then become large, round, and refractile. Clusters, or foci, of infected cells appear early after inoculation in diploid fibroblast and epidermoid carcinoma lines (<anchor id="ch0120s0002s0017s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0120s0002s0017s0003a0005">Fig. 1</link>). CPE in A549 cells is characterized by syncytium formation, particularly with HSV-2 (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0128">128</link>). Cells then lyse and detach from the substrate with eventual destruction of the monolayer. Other readouts from cell culture such as the shell vial culture with indirect fluorescent antigen or engineered beta-galactosidase reporters with DFA (ELVIS system) allow for more sensitive and rapid culture-based typing of HSV, with turnaround times as short as 1 day (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0129">129</link>). Culture remains helpful when testing for acyclovir resistance is required, and it can be less expensive than molecular methods, but the increased sensitivity and limited hands-on time of PCR relative to culture limit its overall utility.</para>

Confirmation of putative HSV CPE is accomplished using commercially available polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against type-common or type-specific epitopes. The most widely used reagents are fluorescein conjugated for use in fluorescent antibody tests. Spin amplification methods reduce the time required to detect HSV in culture by detecting viral proteins before CPE develops (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0127">127</link>). The most widely used technique involves centrifuging the sample onto monolayers of cells on coverslips that are placed in the bottom of small vials (shell vials) or in the wells of flat-bottomed plates. After 16 to 48 h of incubation, the coverslips or plates are subjected to antigen detection tests for HSV (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0101">101</link>). Increasingly, typing and identification are performed by molecular methods. All of the direct-from-sample tests described above (Luminex Aries, BioFire meningitis/encephalitis, and Focus Simplexa) differentiate between HSV-1 and HSV-2 during the initial PCR and do not require additional tests for identification.</para>

Tests based on crude antigen mixtures are still marketed but have unacceptably low sensitivity and specificity, especially for detecting new HSV-2 infections in those with prior HSV-1 (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0130">130</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0132">132</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0133">133</link>). FDA-approved IgM tests decrease the time to detecting seroconversion in new infections but cannot accurately distinguish new from established infections (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0134">134</link>).

As noted above, gG-based assays are preferred over those based on crude antigen mixtures, due to their ability to distinguish antibodies to HSV-1 versus HSV-2. Microplate format enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) include the HerpeSelect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Focus Diagnostics (Cypress, CA), the Captia HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG type-specific ELISA test kits (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland), the anti-HSV-1 and anti-HSV-2 ELISA IgG kits from Euroimmun (Lubeck, Germany), the HSV-1 IgG ELISA test from Gold Standard Diagnostics (Davis, CA), the SeraQuest HSV-1- and HSV-2-specific IgG assays (Miami, FL), and the Zeus ELISA HSV-1 and -2 test systems (Raritan, NJ). The Roche Elecsys HSV-1 IgG and HSV-2 IgG assays are FDA cleared for use on several automated immunoassay instruments. Some newer assays utilize microparticle-based detection technology, which provides the possibility of multiplexing and offers potential advantages in assay throughput and reproducibility. The Plexus HerpeSelect 1 and 2 IgG test kit (Focus, Cypress, CA), the BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 and -2 kit (Bio-Rad), and the AtheNA Multi-lyte HSV1&amp;2 test (Zeus Scientific, Raritan, NJ) utilize Luminex detection technology (Luminex, Austin, TX). The Liaison HSV-1 and HSV-2 type-specific IgG tests are bead-based chemiluminescent immunoassays requiring the use of the Liaison analyzer (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy). Finally, simple gG-based lateral flow assays are available that are designed for point-of-care testing. These include the HerpeSelect Express IgG (Focus Diagnostics), which distinguishes antibodies to HSV-1 and HSV-2, and the BiokitHSV-2 rapid test (Biokit, Barcelona, Spain).</para>

          <para id="ch0120s0002s0019s0001p0001">Acyclovir-resistant strains of HSV typically result from mutation of the gene encoding the viral thymidine kinase and more rarely from mutations in the HSV polymerase, while foscarnet resistance arises due to mutations in the HSV polymerase only. Resistance to pritelivir is associated with mutations in the HSV helicase and primase genes but has not been seen<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0142">142</link>). Prolonged use of antivirals can lead to selection of resistant strains, especially in immunocompromised individuals and neonates (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0143">143</link>). Strains with detectable <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> resistance can also be isolated from patients who have never received acyclovir (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0144">144</link>). Such isolates are rarely of clinical significance in immunocompetent individuals, and infections in these individuals generally respond well to acyclovir (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0145">145</link>). However, resistance can occasionally be observed in immune-privileged sites even in immunocompetent individuals (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0146">146</link>). Acyclovir-resistant HSV can lead to treatment failure (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0145">145</link>), and thus, laboratory confirmation of resistance can inform patient management decisions. Some patients with suspected acyclovir-resistant virus respond to increased dosage of drug. For most patients, second-line therapy requires the use of less desirable drugs, such as foscarnet or cidofovir. However, since some mutations in the HSV polymerase cause acyclovir resistance but do not affect sensitivity to penciclovir, testing for susceptibility to individual antivirals may be warranted in certain circumstances (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0143">143</link>), because it may allow the use of a less toxic drug.</para>

          <para id="ch0120s0002s0019s0001p0002">Clinical susceptibility testing can be performed by phenotypic assays, and UL23 sequencing is available for thymidine kinase-targeting antivirals where a culture isolate is not available. Among the phenotypic assays, plaque reduction is considered the gold standard (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0143">143</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0144">144</link>). Alternative phenotypic assays include antigen reduction by EIA and genome reduction by DNA hybridization (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0143">143</link>). In general, a 50% inhibitory concentration of &lt;2 μg/ml is used as the threshold for susceptibility and correlates relatively well with clinical response (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0147">147</link>). However, false determinations of resistance are common in the various phenotypic assays, and interlaboratory variability is significant (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0143">143</link>). Thus, clinical correlation of testing results is essential. Given the long turnaround time of phenotypic testing for antiviral resistance and improvements in sequencing, there is likely a future role for genotypic antiviral susceptibility testing. For UL23 sequencing, complete sequencing of the gene for definitive results and any frameshift or nonsense mutations are annotated as causing resistance (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0143">143</link>). UL30 sequencing is currently not cost-effective given the large size of the gene and so is not currently available clinically. Continued work is needed to make complete databases of mutations associated with antiviral resistance.</para>

        <para id="ch0120s0002s0020p0001">Interpretation of positive test results depends on the specificity of the test. Specificity of culture is extremely high if confirmatory tests are performed. With its excellent sensitivity and specificity, PCR is the test of choice in most situations. PCR is most reliable when closed-system methods are used and lab practices are strictly followed to avoid contamination of specimens with exogenous HSV DNA. Even when a closed system is used, preanalytical contamination of HSV PCR assays may occur, either at the ordering site or in the laboratory. Despite these caveats, in practice, positive culture or PCR results are highly diagnostic in patients with lesions due to gingivostomatitis, genital herpes, or ocular infections. Positive fluorescent-antibody tests from lesions or ocular swabs are considered reliable. HSV found in the CNS, in tissues, in blood, or in the eye by culture or PCR is diagnostic. Positive cultures or positive PCR tests in symptomatic infants at 1 to 3 weeks of life are highly diagnostic (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0148">148</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0020p0002">For other patients, interpretation of a positive viral detection test requires caution. One potential confounding issue is the simultaneous presence of multiple potential pathogens. For example, respiratory secretions from immunocompromised patients may contain HSV in addition to the presumably causative agent such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, or adenovirus (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0149">149</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0150">150</link>). HSV may also be shed concurrently with other pathogens from oral or anogenital sites or may not be the cause of the episodic syndrome that triggered testing. Syphilis and chancroid are the most likely alternative causes of genital ulcers in the United States. In a series of patients with genital ulcers other than those typical of herpes (vesiculopustular lesions), 65% had only herpes detected, while 20% had both syphilis and herpes detected (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0151">151</link>). HSV results from such patients need to be interpreted in the context of laboratory testing for other pathogens in the differential diagnosis, including monkeypox virus. Symptoms of HSV gingivostomatitis or genital infection can be mimicked by noninfectious causes, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or by other infectious agents. Because of the sporadic nature of asymptomatic HSV shedding (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0152">152</link>), swabs of oral or anogenital sites can also yield positive HSV culture, PCR, or antigen tests when the underlying cause of disease is not herpes. Even in meningitis, an HSV-positive result may not mean that clinicians should not consider additional causes; clinical correlation is always required (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0123">123</link>). The increasing availability of syndromic multiplex testing will likely help increase our understanding of the role of multiple pathogens in infection.</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0020p0003">Positive cultures or PCR results from skin, conjunctival, mouth, or nasal swabs from neonates less than 24 h old may reflect maternal virus rather than neonatal infection. Neonates born to mothers shedding HSV from the genital tract at labor and delivery may be tested 24 to 72 h after birth, the likely time frame for receiving maternal culture or PCR results. Most babies developing neonatal herpes present between 9 and 14 days of life (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0153">153</link>), well beyond the time frame where maternal viral contamination would be a problem. However, early initiation of therapy is strongly associated with a favorable outcome (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0154">154</link>), and thus, current opinion favors aggressive monitoring and treatment (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0061">61</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0020p0004">PCR has adequate sensitivity to detect shedding of HSV in individuals with asymptomatic infection or negative cultures (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0155">155</link>–<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0157">157</link>) and also to detect HSV in CSF, a specimen with a low yield of HSV by culture. The sensitivity of HSV PCR for HSV encephalitis has been reported to be about 96%, and the specificity 99% (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0111">111</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0120">120</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0158">158</link>). Since the viral load in CSF can be quite low in HSV encephalitis, it is critical that PCR assays be optimized to provide the best possible limit of detection. PCR has much greater sensitivity than culture for detection of genital HSV-2 both from lesions and during periods of subclinical shedding (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0052">52</link>). PCR can detect virus early in lesion development before culture positivity and can remain positive for several days after HSV lesions become negative by culture (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0155">155</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0159">159</link>). PCR positivity in such cases probably represents infectious virus below the limit of detection by culture, and PCR positivity is quickly lost in the absence of active shedding (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0156">156</link>). False negatives can occur in PCR, due to reaction failure or the presence of inhibitors in clinical specimens. It is therefore critical that only negative reactions accompanied by positive internal controls be accepted as true negatives (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0160">160</link>). In addition, PCR false negatives can occur due to sequence variation in the primer- or probe-binding regions (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0105">105</link>). Importantly, a negative PCR result for HSV does not rule out HSV disease, since specimens taken very early or late in the course of disease may not have viral DNA (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0161">161</link>). This is especially true in pediatric populations; for example, in one series, nearly 25% of infants with CNS HSV infections had negative CSF PCR results (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0148">148</link>). The specificity of PCR for detection of HSV encephalitis has been reported to be greater than 98% (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0162">162</link>); thus, all HSV-positive PCR results demand immediate attention. In patients with CNS HSV infections, HSV PCR may become negative after about 7 days of antiviral therapy (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0158">158</link>). The persistence or reemergence of virus after antiviral therapy has been associated with a poor clinical outcome (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0163">163</link>).</para>

Successful therapy is associated with a decline in viral load in the CSF (115, 165–167), and a long duration of viral detectability is associated with poor outcome (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0168">168</link>).

        <para id="ch0120s0002s0021p0001">Type-specific serology is useful when culture or other virus detection methods are not available, when specimen collection or transport is inadequate, or for evaluation of serostatus in the absence of clinical disease. Serology based on gG-1 and gG-2 is vital for diagnosing subclinical and unrecognized HSV infections. Many experts believe that better recognition of genital HSV-2 infections by increased use of accurate gG-based serologic tests could help slow the spread of genital herpes (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0171">171</link>–<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0173">173</link>). However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, after review of potential benefit and harm, recommended against serologic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic people (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0174">174</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0021p0002">As with other herpes laboratory tests, serology tests based on gG must be ordered and interpreted with care. First, due to the low specificity of non-gG-based commercial tests, it is important to ensure that a gG-based test is used. If so, a positive test for HSV-2 antibodies in a patient with genital lesions is highly likely to be a true positive. A positive HSV-2 antibody test in a patient without a history compatible with genital herpes may be a false positive and should be confirmed by testing with a different type-specific test (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0175">175</link>). Negative HSV-2 test results in a patient with symptomatic genital disease may indicate genital HSV-1; no test can distinguish between antibodies elicited by oral versus genital HSV-1, and definitive diagnosis in such cases rests on direct detection of virus. False-negative tests may also occur during seroconversion; sera drawn 4 to 6 weeks later should also be tested. While index values in HSV-2 EIAs have been shown to rise during seroconversion, index values alone are not reliable indicators of early versus established infection (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0176">176</link>). IgM tests based on gG-1 and gG-2 are not available commercially. The available IgM tests cannot distinguish new from established symptomatic episodes with sufficient accuracy and are not recommended (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0134">134</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0120s0002s0021p0003">As noted above, type-specific serology is critical for identifying pregnant women with new HSV infections, who are at high risk for transmitting virus to their neonates (<link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0061">61</link>, <link linkend="ch0120s0002s0025s0001li0171">171</link>).

If a herpes culture from the anogenital region is positive at labor or delivery, a negative maternal type-specific serology indicates high risk (30 to 50%) for neonatal herpes. A positive maternal serology by Western blotting or an equivalent test indicates a lower risk of transmission (1 to 3%).</para>

Primary infection in the macaque is often asymptomatic, but the virus establishes latency and can reactivate. Reactivation can be triggered by stress, such as the transition of animals from freedom to captivity, or crowded conditions. Recurrent disease in macaques is typically characterized by vesicular lesions of the tongue and buccal mucosa, progressing to ulceration. Encephalitis is rare but can occur. Asymptomatic shedding of virus can occur.</para>
