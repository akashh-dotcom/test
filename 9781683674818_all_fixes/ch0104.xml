        <para id="ch0104s0001s0002p0001">The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiologic agent of AIDS. The clinical manifestations of AIDS were first recognized in 1981 (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0001">1</link>). The search for the cause of this severe cellular immune dysfunction led to isolation of lymphadenopathy-associated virus in 1983 (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0002">2</link>). The following year, other researchers isolated cytopathic retroviruses from people with AIDS, which they termed human T-lymphotropic virus type III (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0004">4</link>). These viruses were soon confirmed to be identical, and in 1986 the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses designated HIV as the name for the virus that causes AIDS (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0005">5</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0104s0001s0002p0002">HIV exists as two major viral species. Both are members of the genus<emphasis>Lentivirus</emphasis> within the family <emphasis>Retroviridae.</emphasis> HIV type 1 (HIV-1), identified first, is the more virulent of the two and is responsible for the majority of AIDS cases worldwide. HIV-2, first isolated in 1986, has biological and morphologic properties similar to those of HIV-1 but differs in some of its antigenic components (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0006">6</link>). HIV-2 is less pathogenic and has a more limited geographic distribution than HIV-1. Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are related to simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), which are found in 26 species of African primates but do not cause disease in their native hosts (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0007">7</link>). Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HIV-1 arose as a consequence of at least three separate zoonotic transmissions of SIV from chimpanzees to humans; four interspecies SIV transmissions from sooty mangabeys are the source of HIV-2 (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0008">8</link>). Genetic sequences of HIV have been identified retrospectively in human plasma specimens from as early as 1959 (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0009">9</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0003p0001">HIV viruses are classified based on phylogenetic relatedness of nucleotide sequences. The current classification is hierarchical and consists of types, groups, subtypes, sub-subtypes, and recombinant forms (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0010">10</link>). Subtypes are often referred to as clades. The most distantly related HIVs are categorized as types: HIV type 1 and HIV type 2. HIV-1 is further characterized into groups: the major (M) group; the more divergent outlier (O) group; the non-M, non-O (N) group; and group P, a new lineage closely related to a gorilla SIV (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0010">10</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0012">12</link>). Most HIV infections occur with HIV-1 group M, which is differentiated into 10 subtypes (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, and L) (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0011">11</link>). Subtypes A and F are further classified into sub-subtypes A1, A2, A3, F1, and F2. The sequences within any one subtype are more similar to each other than to sequences from other subtypes throughout their genomes and represent different lineages of HIV. At least nine HIV-2 groups (A through I) have been documented, of which groups A and D are presently circulating (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0012">12</link>). When viruses from two or more HIV-1 lineages infect one individual and exchange their genetic material, they are termed recombinant viruses (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0013">13</link>). If transmission of the recombinant virus to three or more people has been documented by whole-genome sequences, it is referred to as a circulating recombinant form (CRF), and the CRF is given a numeric designation (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0013">13</link>). As of January 2021, CRF01 to CRF108 are recognized (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0015">15</link>). Recombinant viruses that have been identified but not documented to have been further transmitted are referred to as unique recombinant forms. The variation in nucleotide sequences can have implications for the biology and transmission of the virus and for patient survival and can also help identify the geographic distribution and epidemiology of HIV infection. From the diagnostic perspective, sequence variation can have significant implications for the reactivity and cross-reactivity of diagnostic tests designed to detect specific viral proteins or peptides.</para>

The lipid envelope is acquired as the virus buds from infected cells. The HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120/41 forms spikes protruding from this envelope. The glycoprotein, a product of the <emphasis>env</emphasis> gene, is synthesized as a precursor, gp160, which is cleaved into the heavily glycosylated gp120, forming the majority of the external portion, and the transmembrane gp41 portion, which contains the membrane-spanning domain.

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0005p0001">The replication cycle of HIV-1 is accomplished<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> in approximately 24 hours (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0016">16</link>). Replication begins with the attachment of virus to the target cell via the interaction of gp120 and the cellular receptor CD4. This binding results in gp120 conformational changes which allow the virus to interact with other cellular coreceptor sites, CXCR4 or CCR5. The interaction with CXCR4 occurs primarily with T-cell-tropic, syncytium-inducing viruses (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0017">17</link>). In contrast, the β-chemokine receptor CCR5 is involved in macrophage-tropic non-syncytium-inducing HIVs (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0018">18</link>). After fusion with the host cells, HIV enters the cell and RNA is released. HIV particles contain RT, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the replication process. RT possesses three distinct functions: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, which serves to synthesize cDNA; RNase H, which degrades RNA from the cDNA-RNA complex; and a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, which duplicates the cDNA strand. The reverse-transcribed genome is associated with several viral proteins and is transported into the nucleus. The DNA copy becomes integrated into the genome of the infected cell by the virally encoded integrase; this integrated retroviral DNA genome is called the provirus. The cDNA then serves as a template for viral RNA. Activation of HIV transcription and gene expression is modulated by cellular transcription factors and by viral regulatory proteins, including Tat, Rev, Nef, and Vrp. The regulatory genes <emphasis>tat</emphasis> and <emphasis>rev</emphasis> greatly influence the rate of viral replication. The Tat protein increases transcription from the long terminal repeat. The Rev protein facilitates export of unspliced or partially spliced RNAs encoding the viral structural proteins. At the end of the replication cycle, the virion assembles and buds through the plasma membrane.</para>

HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and CRF02-AG are the most prevalent in Africa, whereas subtype B predominates in Europe, Australia, and North and South America, and CRF01-AE dominates in Asia. There has been an increase in the prevalence of recombinant viruses, particularly in geographical areas where multiple subtypes are cocirculating. HIV-2 is found predominantly in West African nations, where an estimated 1 to 2 million people are infected with HIV-2.

Statistics are periodically updated and can be found at the UNAIDS website,<ulink url="https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/">https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/</ulink>. The CDC reported that an estimated 1.2 million people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) in the United States aged 13 and older were living with HIV at the end of 2019. About 13% of persons living with HIV in the U.S. do not know their HIV status and need testing. According to the 2019 estimates from the CDC, ~34,800 new HIV infections occurred in the U.S. that year. Annual infections in the U.S. have been reduced by more than two-thirds since the height of the epidemic in the mid-1980s. The demographic characteristics of HIV infection continue to evolve; CDC estimates show that new infections declined 8% between 2015 and 2019, after a period of general stability (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0022">22</link>).

The risk of HIV-1 infection from occupational percutaneous exposure to HIV-1-infected blood in the absence of post-exposure prophylaxis has been estimated to be 0.3% (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0024">24</link>).</para>

HIV transmission can occur <emphasis>in utero</emphasis>, during labor and delivery, and during breast-feeding. In the absence of therapeutic intervention, the risk of mother-to-child transmission can range from 15 to 30% and is further increased with breast- feeding. However, the risk can be reduced to less than 2% if antiretroviral therapy is administered to women during pregnancy and labor (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0026">26</link>). Antiretroviral treatment of the infant immediately after birth can also significantly decrease the risk of HIV-1 infection in the newborn.</para>

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0008p0001">The natural history of HIV-1 infection can be divided into three phases: a transient acute retroviral syndrome associated with primary infection; an asymptomatic period during which active viral replication continues and disease progresses; and finally, advanced disease, resulting in severe immune dysfunction and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Each of these stages is associated with specific changes in virologic and immunologic parameters. After HIV-1 infection, HIV-1-specific markers appear in the blood in the following chronological order: HIV-1 RNA, p24 antigen, HIV-1 IgM antibody, and HIV-1 IgG antibody (<anchor id="ch0104s0001s0008a0003"/><link linkend="ch0104s0001s0008a0006">Fig. 2</link>). The exact time at which each of these markers can be detected depends on a number of characteristics of the infecting virus, the type of test used, and individual host immune responses. Immediately after exposure and transmission, HIV-1 replicates in the mucosa, submucosa, and lymphoreticular tissues and the virus cannot be detected in plasma. This period is called the eclipse phase and has been estimated to last 5 to 33 days, with an estimated median time of around 11 days (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0027">27</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0029">29</link>). Once HIV-1 RNA reaches a concentration of 10 to 12 copies/ml, it can be detected by sensitive FDA-approved qualitative methods of nucleic acid amplification; at concentrations of 20 copies/ml, it can be detected by most quantitative assays used clinically to monitor viral load. HIV-1 p24 antigen is the next analyte that can be detected in the blood (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0030">30</link>). However, p24 antigen detection is transient because, as antibodies begin to develop, they bind to the p24 antigen and form immune complexes that interfere with p24 assay detection unless the assay includes steps to disrupt the antigen-antibody complexes. Following the rise of p24 in the blood, IgM-class antibodies are produced. Finally, IgG-class antibodies emerge and persist throughout the course of HIV infection. The time after infection when HIV antibody is not detectable is referred to as the window period. In most antiretroviral therapy-naive infected people, HIV antibody becomes detectable within 1 to 2 months after infection (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0030">30</link>). <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0008a0006">Figure 2</link> is a graphic representation of the appearance of viral markers and shows the estimated days postexposure (median, 25th, 75th, and 99th percentiles) at which different tests become reactive when using plasma as the sample type.</para>

Acute HIV-1 infection is a transient symptomatic illness that usually lasts 7 to 14 days and is associated with high levels of HIV-1 replication and a developing virus-specific immune response. Acute HIV-1 infection has been described as a mononucleosis-like syndrome. Clinical symptoms include fever, maculopapular rash, oral ulcers, lymphadenopathy, malaise, weight loss, arthralgia, pharyngitis, and night sweats (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0031">31</link>). During acute HIV-1 infection, plasma viremia rises, reaching levels of up to 100 million copies of HIV-1 RNA per ml of plasma. Destruction of HIV-1-specific CD4<superscript>+</superscript> T lymphocytes and widespread dissemination of the virus, with seeding of lymphoid organs and other tissue reservoirs, occur. During resolution of primary infection, CD4<superscript>+</superscript> T-cell counts rebound and viremia declines before reaching a steady level (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0033">33</link>).

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0010p0001">In most patients, primary infection with or without the acute syndrome is followed by a prolonged period of clinical latency or smoldering low disease activity. In untreated patients, the length of time from initial infection to the development of clinical immunodeficiency disease varies greatly; the median interval is 10 years. HIV disease with active virus replication is ongoing and progressive during this asymptomatic period. The number of CD4<superscript>+</superscript> lymphocytes declines slowly and the virus continues to replicate. During this asymptomatic period, high titers of virus can be found in lymphoid and other tissue compartments (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0037">37</link>). In rapid progressors, AIDS can develop within 1 to 2 years. In contrast, 5 to 10% of HIV-1-infected individuals are long-term nonprogressors and remain symptom free for longer than 20 years (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0038">38</link>). Approximately 0.5% of people with HIV infection, termed elite controllers, are able to spontaneously maintain undetectable levels of virus without antiretroviral therapy.</para>

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0011p0001">In the absence of therapy, the continuous replication of HIV-1 in productively infected cells, together with the elimination of host cells and chronic immune activation, results in deterioration of the immune system. Studies of HIV-1 replication dynamics have shown that, in productively infected lymphocytes, the interval between infection, virus production, and cell death is very short. The half-life of HIV-1 in plasma is thought to be 6 hours, the length of the replication cycle in CD4<superscript>+</superscript> lymphocytes has been estimated at 2.6 days, and 35 million CD4<superscript>+</superscript> cells are thought to be lost daily (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0039">39</link>). As the ability of the host to eliminate productively infected cells declines, CD4<superscript>+</superscript> lymphocytes with integrated provirus accumulate. These resting memory CD4<superscript>+</superscript> lymphocytes serve as a long-lived reservoir for HIV-1. This reservoir decays slowly (mean half-life of 44 months) even in treated patients who have had no detectable viremia for as long as 7 years. Clinical manifestations of HIV disease can affect nearly every organ system. Destruction of the immune system is clinically manifested by the occurrence of opportunistic infections and tumors. Central nervous system involvement also occurs, most commonly HIV-associated dementia (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0040">40</link>). A decline of the CD4<superscript>+</superscript> lymphocyte count below 200 cells/μl marks the onset of immunologic AIDS and predisposition to opportunistic infections caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa; neoplastic disease; HIV encephalopathy; wasting syndrome; and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which are often the cause of death.</para>

Stage 0, indicative of early infection, is defined by a negative or indeterminate HIV test result obtained within 180 days of a positive HIV test result. Stage 0 can be established either by testing history (a positive test result obtained after a previous negative or indeterminate test result) or by a laboratory testing algorithm that demonstrates the presence of HIV-specific viral markers, such as p24 antigen or nucleic acid (RNA or DNA), in conjunction with a negative or indeterminate antibody test result.

          <para id="ch0104s0001s0012s0001p0002">Serum and plasma are the most common specimen types used for routine HIV antibody and antigen determinations in the laboratory. The most common tubes for plasma collection are potassium EDTA, sodium citrate, sodium and lithium heparin, and plasma preparation tubes (PPTs). Prompt separation of serum and plasma from the clot/cellular elements is important to decrease hemolysis and maintain the most viable specimen for testing. Serum or plasma specimens can be transported either at room temperature, refrigerated, or frozen (after removal from cellular components) in screw-cap plastic vials. For most antibody immunoassays, serum or plasma specimens may be shipped refrigerated (2 to 8°C) or at room temperature (≤30°C) for up to 7 days depending on the assay. For HIV antigen/antibody combination assays, the time that specimens can remain at room temperature is more restrictive. It is necessary to minimize room temperature storage for optimum preservation of p24 antigen. Specimens used for the antigen/antibody combination assays available in the United States as of November 2021 can be stored at room temperature (the length of time will depend on the assay) or refrigerated at 2 to 8°C for up 7 days. It is important to include specimen transport times as part of the maximum allowable storage times at any given temperature. For long-term storage, serum or plasma specimens should be frozen at ≤−20°C.</para>

          <para id="ch0104s0001s0012s0001p0003">Some HIV antibody assays are approved for use with dried blood spots and oral fluid, and some rapid point-of-care HIV assays can be performed with finger-stick whole blood, venipuncture whole blood, or oral fluids.</para>
          <para id="ch0104s0001s0012s0001p0004">Quantitative HIV-1 RNA viral load assays are commonly performed on plasma specimens. Plasma for viral load determination is generally collected in potassium EDTA or acid citrate dextrose (ACD) tubes. Heparin anticoagulants inhibit PCR and should not be used for any nucleic acid assay that involves PCR amplification. To ensure accurate HIV-1 RNA quantification in plasma, proper collection, processing, storage, and transport of plasma specimens are essential. For all assays, plasma must be separated from blood cells in a timely manner to prevent RNA degradation. Whole blood can be maintained at room temperature for 6 to 24 hours or stored at 2 to 8°C for up to 24 hours before centrifugation, depending on the specific assay. HIV-1 RNA is generally stable in cell-free plasma refrigerated at 2 to 8°C for 5 to 7 days. For long-term storage, plasma samples should be frozen at −20 to −70°C. HIV-1 RNA generally remains stable for at least three freeze-thaw cycles, as demonstrated by manufacturer data submitted to FDA.</para>
          <para id="ch0104s0001s0012s0001p0005">To simplify the process of collecting and transporting plasma, PPTs (BD Vacutainer PPT, Becton Dickinson), which contain dried EDTA and a gel separator that, after centrifugation, forms a barrier between the plasma and cellular elements, are available and are approved for use with some viral load assays. PPTs provide a closed collection system for the preparation and transport of plasma specimens. Plasma samples do not need to be poured off from PPTs after centrifugation, eliminating plasma transfer and relabeling steps. This improves convenience, decreases risks of error, and improves safety. Initial manufacturer recommendations allowed for either refrigerated or frozen transport of centrifuged PPTs. However, discrepancies in viral loads have been reported to occur in plasma specimens with some assays and with certain handling conditions such as freezing after centrifugation, inadequate storage, and improper centrifugation (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0042">42</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0048">48</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0051">51</link>). The differences were noted only for samples with viral loads close to the assay limit of detection; a large proportion of samples with undetectable viral load in a standard EDTA aliquot were found to have detectable HIV-1 RNA in the corresponding PPT. As a result, the tube manufacturer has recommended that plasma in PPTs be stored without freezing; plasma from PPTs should be transferred to a secondary tube if plasma specimens need to be stored frozen. The FDA-approved viral load kits have specific volume, collection tube, and specimen storage requirements, so package inserts should be used to determine optimal collection and handling of specimens.</para>
          <para id="ch0104s0001s0012s0001p0006">The same collection system and procedures should be used to follow up patients over time because different systems may produce discrepant values. For example, specimens collected in ACD tubes have been shown to yield results that are approximately 15% lower than results obtained with EDTA plasma (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0052">52</link>). If a change in collection system or technology is planned, new baseline HIV-1 viral load values should be determined.</para>
          <para id="ch0104s0001s0012s0001p0007">Laboratories that test specimens from pediatric patients should investigate flexibility of specimen volume because it may be difficult to obtain the 1 ml of plasma needed for several of the assays. Further, not all FDA-approved tests have an intended use for pediatric samples and thus may require in-house validation as a laboratory-developed test. Viral load assays have also been used to measure HIV-1 RNA in specimens other than plasma, including serum, dried blood spots, cerebrospinal fluid, cervical secretions, and seminal plasma. For some assays, the RNA quantity in serum has been found to be lower than that in paired plasma samples, and applications with specimens other than plasma must be validated because they are not included as approved specimen types for the current FDA-approved viral load assays.</para>
          <para id="ch0104s0001s0012s0001p0008">Qualitative HIV RNA assays can be conducted with serum and plasma. The Aptima HIV-1 RNA Quant Dx (Hologic Incorporated, Marlborough, MA) is the first FDA-approved assay for detection and quantification of HIV-1 RNA (dual claim). For qualitative diagnostics, the blood specimen can be collected in tubes containing EDTA or ACD, PPT, serum tubes, or SSTs (serum separator tubes). For quantitative measures, only blood collected in tubes containing EDTA or ACD or PPTs can be used. Whole blood can be stored at 2 to 30°C and must be centrifuged within 24 hours of specimen collection. Separate plasma or serum, if not tested immediately, may be frozen at –20°C (serum or plasma) or –70°C (plasma) for up to 90 days, or may be stored at 2 to 8°C for up to 5 days (serum or plasma). The cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qualitative Assay (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) is the first FDA-approved assay for the qualitative detection and differentiation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNA. Blood can be collected in STTs, PTTs, or EDTA tubes and may be stored and/or transported for up to 24 hours at 2 to 25°C prior to plasma or serum preparation. Upon separation, EDTA plasma or serum samples may be stored in secondary tubes for up to 24 hours at 30°C followed by up to 5 days at 2 to 8°C or up to 6 weeks at ≤–20°C. For long-term storage, temperatures at ≤–60°C are recommended.</para>
          <para id="ch0104s0001s0012s0001p0009">For HIV-1 resistance assays (genotypic and phenotypic), plasma collected from EDTA, ACD, or EDTA PPTs can be used. Plasma must be separated from the cellular elements within 6 hours of collection and frozen to prevent degradation of RNA. Higher-integrity samples are achieved by minimizing the time before centrifugation and freezing of processed samples. Plasma specimens should be transported frozen and stored at −70°C for optimal results. For HIV-1 DNA and viral culture assays, whole blood is commonly used. Blood should be collected in either EDTA, ACD, or cell preparation tubes. For preparation of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells required for HIV DNA amplification, the blood specimen should not be refrigerated or frozen but instead kept at ambient temperature for no longer than 4 days.</para>

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0013p0001">In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, p24 antigen testing played an important role as a tool for the diagnosis, prognosis, and evaluation of antiretroviral activity and for monitoring of HIV-1-infected cultures. In 1996, the FDA approved the Coulter HIV-1 p24 Ag assay (Coulter Co., Miami, FL) for screening blood products. This test was used for screening blood and plasma donors in the United States for a few years until it was replaced with more sensitive nucleic acid tests (NATs) in 1999 (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0053">53</link>). At present, there are no FDA-approved stand-alone p24 antigen assays in the United States. However, the presence of HIV p24 antigen can be detected in plasma or serum by antigen capture enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA). It is usually not detectable during the first 2 weeks after infection, but during acute infection, it becomes detectable before HIV-1 antibody (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0008a0006">Fig. 2</link>). However, detection of p24 antigen is transient because, as HIV-1 antibodies begin to develop, they bind to the p24 antigen and form immune complexes that interfere with p24 assay detection, unless the assay includes steps to disrupt the antigen-antibody complexes (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0054">54</link>). Current FDA-approved assays combine p24 antigen detection with HIV antibody detection to allow for earlier detection of infection. Some of these assays do not allow differentiation between p24 antigen and antibody reactivity, and some allow detection of p24 antigen and HIV antibody independently in an automated or a simplified lateral flow format.</para>

          <para id="ch0104s0001s0013s0001p0001">As of the end of 2021, there are two automated HIV RNA qualitative assays approved by FDA that have clinical utility for identification of acute HIV-1 infection: as previously mentioned, the Hologic Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx Assay, for use on the Panther system, and the Roche cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qualitative Assay for use on the cobas 6800/8800 systems. The Hologic Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx Assay targets both the long terminal repeat (LTR) and the<emphasis>pol</emphasis> gene of the HIV-1 genome, which allows detection of all HIV-1 group M, N, and O viruses. There are three general steps to the assay: target-specific capture of HIV-1 RNA from the clinical specimen, transcription-mediated amplification, and detection using a hybridization protection assay. Through Probit analysis, the 95% predicted detection limit is 12 copies/ml in plasma and 8.9 copies/ml in serum. The Roche cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qualitative Assay is a PCR-based assay that targets the HIV-1 LTR and <emphasis>gag</emphasis> and HIV-2 LTR. It uses two probes to detect HIV-1, but not to discriminate HIV-1 groups M, O, or N, and a third probe to detect HIV-2. Through Probit analysis in plasma and serum, the 99% predicted detection limit for HIV-1 group M is 20 copies/ml, the 98% predicted detection limit for HIV-1 group O is 20 copies/ml, and the 98% predicted detection limit for HIV-2 is 40 copies/ml.</para>
          <para id="ch0104s0001s0013s0001p0002">Detection of HIV-1 DNA can be used for HIV diagnosis in special situations such as during the acute phase of infection prior to appearance of antibody, in newborns of infected mothers, or in individuals with suppressed viral replication due to immunologic control or antiretroviral therapy. HIV-1 DNA qualitative assays make use of PCR to amplify conserved regions of the HIV-1 genome to detect proviral HIV-1 DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. There are currently no commercially available FDA-approved proviral DNA tests. However, various laboratory-developed tests based on nested as well as real-time PCR procedures are also used, and some large commercial laboratories have these available as laboratory-developed tests. The limit of detection and ability to detect non-B subtypes vary among these assays. The sensitivity and specificity of previously described HIV-1 DNA PCR assays for the diagnosis of neonatal HIV-1 infection have been reported to be 96% and 99%, respectively, at 1 month of age for HIV-1 subtype B (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0055">55</link>). The potential utility of qualitative DNA PCR assays in the diagnosis of vertical HIV-1 transmission has been greatly increased with the development of simple and sensitive procedures for dried blood spots.</para>

The RealTi<emphasis>m</emphasis>e HIV-1 assay uses the automated <emphasis>m</emphasis>2000 system, which has two components: the <emphasis>m</emphasis>2000sp, for nucleic acid extraction and loading of sample and master mix into the 96-well optical reaction plate, and the <emphasis>m</emphasis>2000rt, for amplification and detection. The assay contains an internal control, which is an unrelated RNA sequence that is added to the sample lysis buffer prior to extraction. RNA is captured by magnetic particles, washed to remove unbound material, and eluted. Once the master mix and sample are combined into the reaction plate, the reaction plate is covered and loaded into the <emphasis>m</emphasis>2000rt; these are the only manual steps of the assay. The amplification and detection utilize TaqMan technology. The HIV-1 oligonucleotide probe is a partially double-stranded complex; the long strand is complementary to the HIV-1 target (integrase) and is labeled at the 5′ end with a fluorophore. The shorter strand is complementary to the 5′ end of the long strand and is labeled with a quencher moiety at its 3′ end. When HIV-1 target is present, the HIV-1-specific strand preferentially hybridizes to the target, allowing emission of fluorescence (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0061">61</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0062">62</link>). For calculations of viral load values, two assay calibrators are run in replicates of three to generate a calibration curve; the slope and intercept of the curve are stored on the instrument and used to calculate viral load values. The lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) of the assay is 40 copies/ml for a 1.0-ml sample volume, 75 copies/ml for a 0.5-ml sample volume, and 150 copies/ml for a 0.2-ml sample volume.

The LLoQ of the assay is 20 copies/ml for undiluted specimens (1 ml), whereas the LLoQ for diluted specimens is 50 copies/ml for the 1:2.5 dilution and 1,000 copies/ml for the 1:50 dilution procedures. The Alinity m HIV-1 has the ability to detect HIV-1 group M (subtypes A, BF, C, D, CRF01-AE, F, CRF02-AG, G, and H), group O, and group N at and above claimed limit of detection (LOD) of 20 copies/ml with a detection rate of 95.0% or greater.</para>

The extracted sample and the reaction mix are added to amplification tubes on the AmpliPrep instrument, and the amplification and detection are completed on either the cobas TaqMan analyzer or the cobas TaqMan 48 analyzer. Docking the cobas TaqMan analyzer to the AmpliPrep instrument creates a fully automated system. Alternatively, the amplification tubes can be manually loaded into the cobas TaqMan 48 analyzer. For calculation of viral load values, the fluorescent readings for the QS and target are checked by the instrument software to ensure that they are valid, crossing threshold values are determined, and the viral load value is calculated from lot-specific calibration constants provided by the manufacturer. The amount of QS added to each sample is constant, so if the critical threshold for the QS has been affected, the HIV-1 target concentration is adjusted accordingly. The cobas AmpliPrep/cobas TaqMan HIV-1 test has been designed to quantify all group M viruses including CRFs and can also detect group O and N viruses (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0063">63</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0068">68</link>).</para>

These systems also allow for mixed batching, making it possible to perform up to three tests in the same run with no presorting of specimens, so specimens can be tested for comorbid pathogens in addition to HIV. As of 2017, the platform allows for various EDTA plasma volumes including both a 0.5-ml (0.65 ml required) and 0.2-ml (0.35 ml required) test volume. This platform, like the AmpliPrep/cobas TaqMan HIV-1, uses a dual target design and has a reported linear range of 20 to 10<superscript>7</superscript> copies/ml and a reported LOD of 13.2 copies/ml when using 0.5 ml and 50 to 10<superscript>7</superscript> copies/ml and a LOD of 35.5 copies/ml when using 0.2 ml of EDTA plasma.</para>

It is intended for quantitation of HIV-1 RNA in human plasma from HIV-1-infected individuals on the fully automated Panther system. The Aptima assay quantitates HIV-1 RNA groups M, N, and O over the range of 30 to 10<superscript>7</superscript> copies/ml from a 0.7-ml reaction volume of plasma. The assay utilizes transcription-mediated amplification and includes dual-target amplification and detection systems, targeting two regions of the HIV-1 genome, LTR and <emphasis>pol</emphasis>, independently. An independent signal is generated from amplification of each region to minimize the impact of a mutation in either region. In November 2020, FDA approved the same assay for the detection of HIV-1 RNA in plasma and serum specimens in addition to quantification of HIV-1 RNA on the fully automated Panther system. Evaluation and comparison studies conducted with the CE-approved version of the Aptima Quant Dx found overall excellent performance and high concordance of the Aptima assay with the Abbott Real-Time and Roche cobas AmpliPrep/cobas TaqMan assays (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0069">69</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0072">72</link>).

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0014p0001">One of the most versatile gene transfer methods involves the use of recombinant lentiviral vectors since they can transduce both dividing and nondividing cells, are considered to be safe, and provide long-term transgene expression since the integrated viral genome, the provirus, is passed on to daughter cells. These characteristics are highly desirable when a modified cell must continue to express the transgene even after multiple cell divisions. Lentivirus-mediated gene transfer has been successfully used for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells for the treatment of B-cell leukemias, lymphoma, and myeloma, for example. In addition to the target gene, lentiviral vectors contain components of the retroviral genome, specifically, the LTR regions which are essential for the integration into the cellular genome. Sequences in the LTR are common targets for some of the HIV molecular assays listed here that are used for diagnosis and monitoring of HIV-1 infections. Since FDA approval of CART therapies, their use has expanded. Reports of false reactivity using selected HIV-1 NAT methods following CART therapy have been published (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0073">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0074">74</link>). In most of the cases, the single-target Abbott <emphasis>m</emphasis>2000 was used to rule out infection. With the development and approval of dual-target technology to improve sensitivity of molecular assays, addressing false reactivity in these circumstances will be challenging. It further underscores the need for education of clinicians and laboratory staff on the limitations of routine HIV-1 molecular testing and the implementation of appropriate assays to ensure accurate HIV-1 testing and diagnosis for this patient population.</para>

          <para id="ch0104s0001s0014s0001p0001">Because HIV can be isolated from the blood of the majority of HIV-infected individuals, HIV culture was frequently utilized in the early years of the epidemic as a diagnostic or prognostic marker or for assessing the efficacy of antiviral therapy. The procedure for HIV culture is elaborate and time-consuming (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0066">66</link>). Although a positive culture provides direct evidence of HIV infection, HIV culture is now utilized primarily in research laboratories and not for routine diagnosis. To isolate HIV, the patient specimen is first cultured by mixing patient cells with cells from healthy donors, stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2; fresh stimulated donor cells must be added weekly because HIV-1 produces cell death. In the second step, the presence of RT or p24 antigen released in the culture supernatants is assayed periodically, generally every 3 to 7 days, for approximately 1 month of culture.</para>

However, phenotypic resistance assays based on recombinant DNA technology and amplification of plasma viral RNA have obviated the need for viral isolates (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0068">68</link>). A commercially available fitness assay, also referred to as a viral replication capacity (RC) assay, has been developed by Monogram BioSciences (South San Francisco, CA). It measures the ability of HIV-1 from a patient undergoing antiretroviral treatment to replicate <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> compared to a wild-type reference virus. The patient RC value is expressed as a percentage of the RC of the wild-type reference standard. The assay uses a retroviral vector constructed from an infectious clone of HIV-1. The vector contains a luciferase expression cassette inserted within a deleted region of the envelope gene (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0075">75</link>). HIV-1 protease and RT sequences are amplified from the patient plasma samples and inserted into the vector. The amount of luciferase produced by patient-derived viruses is then compared to the amount of luciferase produced by well-characterized wild-type reference virus. RC has been suggested as an additional parameter for making decisions regarding antiretroviral therapy. Patients who do not experience increases in viral loads despite the accumulation of multiple resistance mutations have been shown to harbor virus with decreased RC (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0076">76</link>). In addition, certain drug resistance mutations have been shown to reduce RC (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0076">76</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0078">78</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0104s0001s0014s0002p0001">Diagnosis of HIV infection has usually been accomplished via detection of HIV antibody using a sensitive initial immunoassay validated by a subsequent supplemental test. Because HIV infection persists for life and the initial infection may be minimally symptomatic, most patients who are identified by antibody detection are in the clinically latent or late phases of the illness. Immunoassays for HIV antibody are rapid and economical, but they suffer an important limitation because of the window period, i.e., the time between initial infection and the expression of detectable antibody. During the window period, active viral replication and high levels of viremia occur. Different types of antibody immunoassays have different window periods, but all tests based on detection of antibody miss patients during early infection. Recognition that the risk of transmission from people with acute infection is much higher than that from people with established infection, and indications of the clinical benefits of antiretroviral treatment during acute HIV infection, have served as the impetus to adopt techniques that detect HIV earlier after initial infection (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0080">80</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0081">81</link>).

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0015p0001">Considerable progress in the development of HIV immunoassays has been made since the discovery of the virus in 1983. Current methods are summarized in<anchor id="ch0104s0001s0015a0003"/><link linkend="ch0104s0001s0015a0005">Table 4</link>. HIV immunoassays based on different design principles were generally grouped into generations. Because the generation terminology is becoming somewhat difficult to delineate, in this chapter assays will be described based on the analytes detected. The earliest immunoassays were indirect enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) that use coated (or immobilized) viral lysate antigens derived from cell culture on a solid phase for antibody capture and an indirect format that detects antibody using an anti-human IgG conjugate. These assays are referred to as IgG-sensitive assays. To increase specificity, significant specimen dilution is required to overcome cross-reactivity with cellular protein contaminants. The next immunoassays were developed to use synthetic peptide or recombinant protein antigens alone or combined with viral lysates to bind HIV antibodies, with an indirect immunoassay format that employs labeled anti-human IgG or protein A, which binds to IgG with high affinity (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0084">84</link>). Design of the specific antigenic epitopes in these assays improves sensitivity for HIV-1 group M, HIV-1 group O, and HIV-2, allowing earlier detection of IgG antibodies (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0085">85</link>). Eliminating cellular antigens that contaminate viral lysates improves specificity by eliminating cross-reactivity with cellular proteins. To improve detection earlier in the course of infection, immunoassays were designed to incorporate synthetic peptide or recombinant antigens to bind HIV antibodies, but in an immunometric antigen sandwich format: HIV antibodies in the specimen bind to HIV antigens on the assay substrate and to antigens conjugated to indicator molecules. This allows detection of both IgM and IgG antibodies. These assays are now being referred to as IgM-sensitive assays. Lower sample dilutions and the ability to detect IgM antibodies (which are expressed before IgG antibodies) further reduce the window period during early seroconversion (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0087">87</link>). To further increase detection closer to the time of infection, immunoassays use synthetic peptide or recombinant protein antigens in the same antigen sandwich format to detect IgM and IgG antibodies, and also include monoclonal antibodies to detect p24 antigen. Inclusion of p24 antigen capture allows detection of HIV-1 infection before seroconversion (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0088">88</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0092">92</link>). Most antigen/antibody immunoassays (termed “combo” assays) do not distinguish antibody reactivity from antigen reactivity. However, a laboratory antigen/antibody combo assay approved by FDA in July 2015, the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 HIV Ag-Ab, is intended for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of the individual analytes related to HIV-1 infection and HIV-2 infection, including HIV-1 p24 antigen, anti-HIV-1 (groups M and O) envelope antibodies, and anti-HIV-2 envelope antibodies.</para>

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0016p0001">Conventional immunoassays for laboratory use consist of EIA and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CIA) methods. Most of the commonly used assays incorporate specific antigens for the detection of HIV-1 groups M and O and HIV-2. HIV antigens (and in antibody-antigen assays, anti-p24 antibodies) are adsorbed to a solid phase, usually plates, beads, or tubes, which bind HIV antibodies (or p24 antigen) in the specimens. Antibodies (and, with antigen/antibody combo assays, p24 antigen) are conjugated to enzymes (alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase) or to acridinium esters. The indirect EIA format uses an enzyme-labeled antiglobulin conjugate; the antigen-sandwich EIA and CIA formats use a conjugate with enzyme-labeled HIV antigens (or anti-p24 monoclonal antibodies). With an EIA, the end result is a color change, measured as optical density by a spectrophotometer, proportional to the amount of antibody (or antigen) in the specimen. CIA results are expressed in relative light units, also proportional to the amount of antibody (or antigen) in the specimen. Results are compared to those of a calibrator; a result with a signal-to-cutoff ratio of ≥1.0 is considered to be reactive. Both EIAs and CIAs are suitable for automation. CIAs, characterized by a shorter processing time and wider dynamic range than EIAs, have been developed for random-access immunochemistry platforms with the potential to make laboratory-based HIV testing simpler and faster. As mentioned above, a recent addition to the HIV test market (BioPlex 2200 HIV Ag-Ab) is an assay that is intended for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of the individual analytes related to HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection and includes the ability to differentiate between antigen and antibody detection. This assay has the potential to improve detection of acute HIV infection. The CDC currently maintains a website that highlights the advantages and disadvantages of currently available FDA-approved HIV diagnostic tests.

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0017p0001">The logistics of conventional laboratory HIV immunoassays require phlebotomy and, typically, a follow-up visit for test results after the specimen has been processed. This complicates HIV testing for many hard-to-reach populations for which phlebotomy is impractical; many people may also fail to return for their test results. In addition, an immediate HIV test result is medically desirable in certain circumstances when antiretroviral prophylaxis should be initiated promptly, for example, in assessment of the source patient after an occupational blood or body fluid exposure and for pregnant women in labor whose HIV status is unknown (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0093">93</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0096">96</link>). To meet these needs, rapid HIV tests have been developed that are suitable for use at the point of care as well as in clinical laboratories. Rapid HIV immunoassays are single-use devices that use either immunoconcentration (flow-through) or immunochromatographic (lateral-flow) principles. Flow-through assays require the sequential addition of specimen, conjugate reagent, and a clarifying buffer through a membrane. Lateral-flow assays contain all the necessary reagents and are extremely simple to perform because they require the addition of only specimen or specimen and buffer. Rapid tests differ in their required specimen volumes (range, 3 to 50 μl for whole blood, serum, or plasma), and time from addition of sample to final result ranges from 1 to 20 minutes. Rapid tests that can use direct, unprocessed specimens (whole blood or oral fluid) have been waived under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and are especially well suited for testing outside traditional laboratory settings. Ten rapid HIV antibody tests were FDA approved in the United States as of December 2021 (<anchor id="ch0104s0001s0017a0003"/><link linkend="ch0104s0001s0018a0004">Table 5</link>). The disadvantages of rapid assays include their subjective interpretation, possible errors if the reader has vision problems such as color blindness, and potential for procedural errors when performed by less-skilled personnel. Furthermore, accurate specimen volumes must be dispensed and tests must be read within specified time limits, control lines must be observed, and instructions should be followed carefully (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0095">95</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0096">96</link>). Rapid tests are useful primarily for small-volume testing. Accurate timing of steps can be adversely affected when multiple specimens are tested simultaneously. Nevertheless, rapid HIV tests have become valuable tools for situations in which rapid results are essential and for outreach settings (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0097">97</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0098">98</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0017p0002">Published studies suggest that rapid HIV antibody immunoassays perform similarly to laboratory-based conventional immunoassays in established HIV infection. However, most use colloidal gold bound to protein A for detection of antibodies; sensitivity with plasma seroconversion panels is similar to that of IgG-sensitive conventional immunoassays (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0091">91</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0092">92</link>). Comparative studies of rapid tests performed on oral fluid, whole blood, and serum demonstrate that rapid tests identified fewer HIV infections than conventional laboratory immunoassays, and sensitivity with oral fluid specimens is lower than that with whole blood or serum in people from populations with increased prevalence of early HIV infection (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0099">99</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0100">100</link>). One rapid HIV test that detects and distinguishes HIV antibodies and p24 antigen, the Determine HIV Combo, has received FDA approval (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0018a0004">Table 5</link>). Its overall seroconversion sensitivity is similar to that of the IgM-sensitive assays; sensitivity of the antigen component is lower than that of laboratory-based antigen-antibody assays (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0099">99</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0101">101</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0102">102</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0018p0001">Alternative specimens to blood, serum, or plasma for HIV antibody and antigen testing include oral fluid, urine, and dried blood spots. These may be useful in testing of patients who are reluctant to undergo phlebotomy or who have poor vascular access, in mass-screening settings, in locations in which phlebotomy is impossible, in infants, and for seroprevalence studies. It is essential to employ only specimen collection systems and testing methods designed and validated for the specific specimen type. Oral fluid is a complex mixture of secretions from several different sets of glands, as well as transudated plasma from the capillaries of the gum and mucosa. Glandular secretions of saliva primarily contain secretory IgA, which is not a reliable target for diagnostic testing. Most IgG in the oral cavity derives from the crevicular space between the gums and the teeth, and not from salivary glands, or can be obtained by inducing an oral mucosal transudate.The OraSure specimen collection device is designed to collect oral mucosal transudate for conventional testing with an FDA-approved oral fluid-based HIV-1 EIA (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0103">103</link>). Two rapid tests are FDA approved for use with oral fluid as well as whole blood and plasma specimens (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0104">104</link>). However, false-negative and false-positive immunoassay results occur more frequently with oral fluid than with serum specimens (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0100">100</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0101">101</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0105">105</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0106">106</link>). Oral fluids may have lower antibody titers than serum specimens, especially during early stages of infection (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0107">107</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0108">108</link>). Dried blood spots, after appropriate elution, can be tested for HIV antibody, p24 antigen, and HIV RNA and produce results comparable to those from matched serum or plasma specimens (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0072">72</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0109">109</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0115">115</link>). In urine, IgG is found in small quantities relative to serum. Currently there are no commercial FDA-approved assays for detection of HIV antibodies in urine.</para>

Specimens that are nonreactive on the initial immunoassay are generally considered HIV negative. If the initial immunoassay result is reactive, it must be followed by one or more supplemental tests. Four methods are available and approved by FDA as supplemental tests: HIV-1 Western blot, qualitative HIV-1 RNA assay, qualitative HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA differentiation assay, and an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay. The Western blot is highly specific, but because it uses viral lysate antigens and anti-human IgG conjugates, it detects HIV-1 later during seroconversion than most currently available conventional initial immunoassays and thus may produce false-negative or indeterminate results (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0117">117</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0118">118</link>). In addition, because of cross-reactivity, the HIV-1 Western blot has been interpreted as positive for HIV-1 in 46 to 85% of specimens from people infected with HIV-2 (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0119">119</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0122">122</link>). The HIV-1 Western blot assay is not the preferred supplemental antibody test in the current recommended diagnostic algorithm, but it can be used as an alternative second step in the algorithm to confirm presence of HIV-1 antibodies or prior HIV-1 nucleic acid testing. An HIV-1 qualitative RNA assay can be used for the diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection in serum or plasma from patients without antibodies to HIV-1, and as a supplemental test, when it is reactive, for HIV-1 with specimens repeatedly reactive for HIV antibodies. Therefore, a specimen with a nonreactive HIV-1 RNA qualitative assay result after repeatedly reactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody immunoassay results should undergo supplemental antibody testing to confirm whether HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies are present (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0092">92</link>). The Geenius HIV 1/2 Confirmatory Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Redmond, WA) was FDA approved in 2014 and detects and differentiates between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies (IgG). Most recently, FDA approved the VioOne HIV Profile Supplemental Assay (Avioq, Inc., Durham, NC), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for confirmation and differentiation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies in human serum or plasma. Both assays are considered a viable substitute for differentiating antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2.</para>
        <para id="ch0104s0001s0020p0002">Historically, the HIV-1 Western blot was the “gold standard” for HIV diagnosis. The Western blot owes its specificity to separation and concentration of viral components (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0123">123</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0124">124</link>). However, in 2014, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) and CDC revised their laboratory HIV testing guidelines for the United States and replaced Western blots with an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0082">82</link>). Western blots that include HIV-2 antigens (e.g., gp36 or gp105) are available outside the United States, but none is FDA approved. Line immunoassays employ a principle similar to that of the Western blot, but recombinant or synthetic antigens are placed on the strip instead of viral lysate antigens from an electrophoretic gel. This approach has the advantage of using only viral antigens in the reaction, eliminating the background from cross-reactivity with nonspecific cellular proteins. The manufacturer also has control over the quantity and type of antigens represented and can include HIV-2 and group O antigens to confirm these infections with a single assay (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0125">125</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0126">126</link>). The Inno-LIA HIV I/II Score test (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) is a line immunoassay that is widely available outside the United States. The Aptima HIV-1 qualitative assay was the first FDA-approved qualitative diagnostic assay for the detection of HIV-1. The production of this assay was discontinued in September 2021. The approval of the Hologic Aptima HIV-1 RNA Quant Dx assay on the Panther system is a viable replacement in addition to the qualitative HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA differentiation assay from Roche. HIV-2 RNA and DNA nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are also available as laboratory-developed tests in some commercial laboratories but are not FDA approved for HIV diagnosis.</para>
        <para id="ch0104s0001s0020p0003">The Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Redmond, WA) was a flow- through rapid EIA that differentiated HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies in a single-use cartridge first approved by FDA as an HIV-1/HIV-2 supplemental antibody test. Testing with Multispot has ended because the manufacturer has ceased production of the test. However, the manufacturer of Multispot, Bio-Rad Laboratories, introduced a new supplemental test to the market, the Geenius HIV 1/2 supplemental assay. According to clinical trials, the new supplemental assay, an immunochromatographic test, has similar performance characteristics to those described for Multispot. The Geenius HIV 1/2 supplemental assay cassette contains antibody-binding protein A, which is conjugated to colloidal gold dye particles, and HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens (gp36 HIV-2 envelope peptide, gp140 HIV-2 envelope peptides, p31 HIV-1 polymerase peptide, gp160 HIV-1 envelope recombinant protein, gp41 group M and O HIV-1 envelope peptides, and p24 HIV-1 core recombinant protein) which are bound to the membrane solid phase. The sample is applied to the sample plus buffer well. After the sample and buffer have migrated onto the test strip, additional buffer is added to the buffer well. The buffer causes the specimens and reagents to flow laterally and facilitates the binding of antibodies to the antigens. In a reactive sample, the antibodies are captured by the antigens immobilized in the test area. The protein A-colloidal gold binds to the captured antibodies, causing development of pink/purple lines. When there are no HIV antibodies, there are no pink/purple lines in the test area. The sample continues to migrate through the membrane, and a pink/purple line develops in the control (C) area, which contains protein A. In the FDA-approved version, the results are read with a reader that incorporates a standardized algorithm to make a final determination of HIV-1 or HIV-2 reactivity. Several studies have assessed the performance of the Geenius test in the currently recommended laboratory algorithm, and the data indicate comparable performance for detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection compared to the Multispot assay (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0121">121</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0122">122</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0127">127</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0130">130</link>). The VioOne HIV Profile Supplemental Assay is also intended as an aid in the diagnosis of infection with HIV-1 and/or HIV-2. This test uses HIV-1 <emphasis>env, pol</emphasis>, and <emphasis>gag</emphasis> gene products as recombinant antigens and an HIV-2-specific transmembrane peptide (gp36). These antigens are individually coated onto the wells of microwell plate strips (solid phase). Upon addition of a diluted test specimen, antibodies to HIV-1 or HIV- 2, if present, form immune complexes through the interaction between anti-HIV-1 or anti-HIV-2 antibodies in the specimen and HIV-1/HIV-2 antigens coated on microwells. The sample diluent contains biotinylated HIV-1 p24 antigen. If present, HIV-1 p24 antibody captured by solid-phase HIV-1 p24 antigen also binds the biotinylated HIV-1 p24 antigen. Following incubation, the specimen/sample diluent mix containing biotinylated HIV-1 p24 antigen is aspirated and microwells are washed with buffer. Subsequently, conjugate containing horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled NeutrAvidin and HRP-labeled HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens is added to all microwells. Peroxidase-labeled NeutrAvidin binds to any biotinylated <emphasis>gag</emphasis> antigen/antibody complexes while HRP-labeled HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens bind to any HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies captured on the solid phase. Following an aspiration and wash to remove excess conjugate and incubation with TMB (tetramethylbenzidine) substrate, a blue color is produced. The enzyme reaction is stopped by the addition of a sulfuric acid solution, which changes the color to yellow. The concentration of HIV-specific antibodies in specimens is proportional to color intensity.</para>

It is important for the selection of initial regimens because of the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in therapy-naive patients and for the selection of the antiretroviral treatment in patients who are failing their current regimen due to the development of antiviral resistance (<ulink url="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/drug-resistance">https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/drug-resistance</ulink>).</para>

Patients whose antiretroviral treatment was based on the results of resistance testing had greater decreases in viral load than patients in whom the antiretroviral regimen was based on prior antiretroviral usage, and the use of resistance testing to guide treatment is cost-effective (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0136">136</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0139">139</link>). Two types of methods are available to assay for HIV resistance. Genotyping tests examine the population of viral genomes in the patient sample for the presence of mutations known to confer decreased sensibility to antiretroviral drugs. Phenotypic assays measure viral replication of the patient’s virus in the presence of antiretroviral drugs. In addition, HIV tropism assays have become important to evaluate susceptibility to HIV entry inhibitors that target viruses that use CCR5 for cell entry. <anchor id="ch0104s0001s0021s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0104s0001s0022a0004">Table 6</link> provides a list of the commonly available commercial HIV-1 resistance and tropism assays.</para>

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0022p0001">The initial steps of genotypic assays include extraction of viral RNA from plasma and RT-PCR to amplify viral RNA sequences which code for portions of the viral genome that are targeted by antiretroviral drugs. These sequences include genes in the<emphasis>pol</emphasis> region of the virus for RT, protease, and integrase as well as envelope regions related to the entry inhibitors. The nucleotide sequence is determined and examined for the presence of known resistance mutations. This can be accomplished most commonly using automated sequencing technology. The nucleotide sequence of the gene of interest is obtained and compared to the sequence of wild-type virus to identify resistance mutations. The process requires alignment and editing of the sequence, comparison to the wild-type sequence, and final interpretation to identify mutations associated with resistance to specific antiretroviral drugs. FDA-cleared kits containing sequencing reagents and the software programs required for sequence alignment and interpretation are commercially available. The Trugene HIV-1 genotyping kit (which has been discontinued), the OpenGene DNA sequencing system (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics), and the ViroSeq HIV-1 genotyping system (Abbott Molecular) have been found to perform in an equivalent manner (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0128">128</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0140">140</link>). These tests detect mutations in the RT and protease genes but do not detect mutations associated with resistance to the integrase or CCR5 inhibitors. Laboratory-developed tests are available from referral laboratories that detect mutations associated with other classes of drugs such as integrases and entry inhibitors. The databases used for interpretation of resistance mutations require regular updating because the number of new antiretroviral drugs continues to expand.</para>

This test is used as an aid in monitoring and treating HIV-1 group M infection with viral loads of at least 1,000 RNA copies/ml.

These phenotypic assays are automated but remain labor-intensive and technically complex. They have not been developed in a kit format and are primarily performed by two commercial laboratories: Quest and Monogram Biosciences (South San Francisco, CA). The first step involves extraction of HIV-1 RNA from plasma, followed by reverse transcription and PCR amplification of the viral genes. The amplified genes from the patient’s specimen are then inserted into vectors that contain a backbone of characterized HIV, or are used to make pseudoviruses containing the patient’s viral sequences. Replication of these viruses at different drug concentrations is monitored by expression of a reporter gene and compared with replication of a reference HIV strain, and recombinants are used in culture to examine resistance.

The drug is not active against CXCR4-tropic virus or dual/mixed tropic virus. The tropism assay must be performed prior to initiating maraviroc or any other CCR5 inhibitor to determine whether the virus is CCR5 tropic. Like other drug resistance assays, there are two general approaches in use, and two tropism assays are commercially available.

The algorithm published in 2014 maximizes the ability to detect acute HIV-1 infections and to correctly classify HIV-2 infections. Testing begins with an initial antigen/antibody combo immunoassay. If reactive, this is followed by an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay. Reactive results on the initial immunoassay and the antibody differentiation assay confirm the presence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies; no further testing is necessary. Specimens that are nonreactive or indeterminate on the antibody differentiation assay undergo testing with HIV-1 NAT. A reactive antigen/antibody combo immunoassay result, negative antibody differentiation assay result, and reactive HIV-1 NAT result are consistent with the presence of acute HIV-1 infection; a nonreactive NAT indicates false-positive results from the initial immunoassay in settings where HIV-1 infections are prevalent. Depending on the patient’s history, follow-up testing for HIV-2 infection may be indicated if there is a documented recent exposure to an individual known or suspected to have HIV-2. The same sequence of supplemental tests should be performed if an IgM/IgG antibody assay is used as the initial test. Reports of HIV test results should specify all assays that were used, the results of each assay, and an interpretation of the test results.

Nucleic acid tests are needed for infant diagnosis because serologic tests are not useful for the detection of HIV infection in infants; maternal antibodies can persist in uninfected, HIV-exposed infants until 18 months of age. Both HIV-1 RNA and DNA tests can be used for the diagnosis of neonatal HIV-1 infection. DNA has often been the preferred method for determining an exposed infant’s HIV-1 infection status, but recent studies suggest that HIV-1 RNA is more sensitive at birth and at 4 weeks of age (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0154">154</link>).

Current recommendations are to test HIV-exposed infants within 14 days of life and at 1 to 2 months and 4 to 6 months after birth, with some experts also recommending testing at birth, on the basis of improved treatment outcomes and the very recent data related to a functional cure in an infant (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0149">149</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0156">156</link>–<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0161">161</link>). HIV-1 infection in neonates is diagnosed by two positive RNA or DNA tests performed on separate blood samples regardless of age. Qualitative test characteristics vary, and the population tested may influence the optimal test to be used. HIV qualitative tests may be more sensitive than some HIV-1 DNA tests for the detection of non-B subtypes, CRFs, and group O virus. However, an advantage of proviral DNA tests is that they generally remain positive even in individuals receiving effective antiretroviral therapy and individuals who naturally suppress virus replication.

Viral load assays are used widely to monitor changes in plasma viremia during antiretroviral therapy because they are useful for predicting time to progression to AIDS and for monitoring responses to therapy. The magnitude of the decrease in viral load is dependent on the effectiveness of the antiretroviral therapy. The goal of optimum therapy is to suppress viral loads below the detection limit of the assay. Baseline testing of HIV-1 RNA viral load should be obtained before initiating therapy, and determinations should be repeated before changing antiretroviral therapy regimens. After initiation of therapy, patients should be tested within 2 to 8 weeks to assess drug efficacy and then every 3 to 4 months to assess durability of response. Updated guidelines on using viral load to guide antiretroviral treatment are maintained at<ulink url="https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-adult-and-adolescent-arv/whats-new-guidelines">https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-adult-and-adolescent-arv/whats-new-guidelines</ulink>.</para>

The clinical implications of HIV RNA levels in the range of &gt;20 to &lt;200 copies/ml in a patient on antiretroviral therapy are controversial.

In general, resistance testing is recommended for patients entering care even if therapy is not immediately initiated, when initiating antiretroviral therapy, for patients failing therapy, for pregnant women, and for patients with acute infection. Genotypic assays are generally more widely available, technically easier to perform, faster, and less expensive than phenotypic assays. In some cases, a resistance mutation may be detectable before a change in the phenotype has occurred, and therefore, genotypic and phenotypic results are not always correlated. One limitation of genotyping assays originates from the complexity of data they generate. In the face of the rapid development of new drugs and new information on HIV-1 resistance, it remains challenging to keep databases updated on which mutations are associated with specific drug combinations.

The presence of DRMs is the leading cause of treatment failure, and therefore their detection can help to guide appropriate treatment regimens that are highly active in viral suppression for persons with HIV-1. The ability of NGS to identify mutant variants within an individual at very low frequencies that may not be clinically significant requires establishing a frequency level for making a base call (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0169">169</link>). Furthermore, the clinical relevance of a low-frequency mutation may differ by ARV drug class and the presence of other DRMs. However, recent data suggest there is overall good concordance between traditional Sanger sequencing and NGS for clinical decisions when appropriate cutoffs are established for the NGS (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0170">170</link>).</para>

Most systems use a rule-based approach: a group of experts establish interpretation algorithms based on the types of mutations or combination of mutations that are associated with resistance to specific drugs. Depending on the mutations detected, the report indicates, for each drug in each of the antiviral categories, whether HIV in the patient sample shows no evidence of resistance, resistance, or possible resistance, or if evidence is insufficient to categorize the virus in one of the three other categories. These rule-based systems provide easy-to-interpret information to clinicians, but the databases require regular updating. The manufacturer’s database update may lag behind the published literature, so clinicians may find it necessary to refer to one of the online databases for the most up-to-date information. For this reason, it is very helpful for laboratories to report both the specific mutations and the interpretation to clinicians so they can easily use online databases.</para>

        <para id="ch0104s0001s0028p0006">Most genotypic and phenotypic assays generally only yield results if the plasma used for testing contains the minimum required viral load, generally 500 to 1,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. Depending on the extraction method used, it may be possible to obtain results on specimens with a lower viral load, but reporting should adhere to the package insert. Due to the labor and expense involved with genotyping assays, laboratories should establish the lower viral load limit for obtaining reliable sequencing results. In addition, for both types of assays, the resistant viral mutant must constitute at least 20 to 30% of the viral quasispecies to be detected. Cross-contamination can occur with both genotypic and phenotypic resistance assays because both procedures rely on an RT-PCR step to amplify HIV-1 gene sequences. Both methods have clinical utility in managing patients and are widely used in clinical practice. However, given the wider availability, faster turnaround time, and lower cost, most clinicians use genotyping for the initial evaluation of resistance. Phenotyping assays, on the other hand, can help in defining the significance of newly recognized resistance mutations and in elucidating the effects of complex mutation interactions and may be very helpful in determining salvage regimens. The continued improvements in antiretroviral therapy also necessitate continued improvement in drug resistance testing technology. Next-generation sequencing technology continues to evolve, and there is considerable progress toward using this technology for HIV drug resistance monitoring (<link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0170">170</link>, <link linkend="ch0104s0001s0028s0001li0171">171</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0104s0001s0028p0007">As new testing technologies become available and increasing numbers of products for the prevention and treatment of HIV come into use, it will be important to understand the impact these changes have on the practice of HIV health care.</para>
