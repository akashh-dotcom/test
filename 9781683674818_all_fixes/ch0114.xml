The data suggest that HCV is most closely related to the nonpathogenic human virus GB virus type C. The next closest relatives appear to be the pestiviruses, viruses that infect non-human hosts (bovine viral diarrhea virus and hog cholera virus). HCV is more distantly related to arthropod-borne viruses in the <emphasis>Flavivirus</emphasis> genus that infect humans (yellow fever virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus).</para>

        <para id="ch0114s000000p0003">HCV has an ~9.6-kb positive-sense RNA genome composed of a long open reading frame flanked by terminal 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) (<anchor id="ch0114s000000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0114s000000a0008">Fig. 1</link>). The 5′ UTR is highly conserved, and the 3′ UTR has a short variable sequence, a poly(U) tract, and a highly conserved element. Structural protein genes include those encoding core (nucleocapsid), p7 (transmembrane protein), and the two glycoproteins, E1 and E2, which are present in the virion envelope. HCV virions exist as lipoviral particles, resulting from the binding of serum lipoproteins (cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins, and phosphoproteins) to viral glycoproteins (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0015">2</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0114s000000p0004">HCV replication in hepatocytes initiates via a multistep entry process (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0016">3</link>). Virion-bound lipoproteins engage with the cellular receptor of lipoproteins, SR-B1 (scavenger receptor class B type 1), exposing E2, which then binds the cellular tetraspanin protein CD81, triggering binding of tight junction proteins and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Within the endosome, E1 and E2 mediate pH-dependent fusion of the virion envelope with the endosomal membrane. In the cytosol, the HCV genome open reading frame is translated into a single polyprotein (approximately 3,000 amino acids) that is subsequently cleaved by host and viral proteases encoded by NS2, NS3, and NS4A genes. The NS3 gene also encodes a helicase. The p7 region encodes a protein that is essential for replication of infectious virus (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0017">4</link>); however, its specific function is unknown. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B; <link linkend="ch0114s000000a0008">Fig. 1</link>) lacks efficient proofreading activity, resulting in extensive genome mutation during replication and quasispecies generation within an infected individual. NS5A is a multifunctional nonstructural phosphoprotein (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0018">5</link>). It is a key component of the replication complex and binds other constituents of the complex including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA, and cyclophilin A, a host protein required for HCV RNA replication. It also appears to play a role in virion assembly. The principal gene targets of current direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are NS3/4 protease, NS5A, and NS5B polymerase (<anchor id="ch0114s000000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0114s000000a0009">Table 1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0114s000000p0005">Currently, there are eight known HCV genotypes (Gts), but genotypes 1 through 6 are prevalent globally, whereas genotypes 7 and 8 have limited geographic distribution. There are more than 50 known subtypes based on genomic sequence heterogeneity (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0019">6</link>). Genotypes differ by 30 to 35% of nucleotides, and subtypes by 20 to 25% of nucleotides. Gt1 through Gt3 have a worldwide distribution and account for most HCV infections in Europe and North America. In the United States, the majority of HCV infections in all age groups are Gt1 (75%), followed by Gt2 (13.5%) and Gt3 (5.5%). In the United States and Asia, Gt1a is more prevalent than Gt1b. Of Gt1 infections in the United States, 75% are Gt1a and 25% are Gt1b; in Asia, 95% are Gt1a and 5% are Gt1b (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0020">7</link>). In Europe, the prevalence of Gt1a and 1b is comparable (~50% each) (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0020">7</link>). Gt4 is most prevalent in the Middle East and North and Central Africa; Gt5 is found primarily in South Africa; Gt6 occurs throughout Asia; and Gt7 has been detected in an immigrant from the Congo, and its region of endemicity is unclear (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0021">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0022">9</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0114s000000p0006">Genetic recombination is an additional source of HCV genetic heterogeneity that was initially thought to be rare but is now increasingly recognized. It likely occurs during coinfection with different HCV strains. Recombination breakpoints occur most commonly in the NS2 to NS3 region, as demonstrated by sequencing (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0023">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0024">11</link>). Most circulating variants have 5′ sequences derived from genotype 2, with 3′ sequences from other genotypes (Gt2/Gt1, Gt2/Gt5, Gt2/Gt6) (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0024">11</link>). The predominance of Gt2 recombinants could have some biological basis (e.g., increased fitness). Alternatively, these variants may be understudied on a global level, and others may be identified as treatment and associated genotypic testing expand worldwide. Gt2/Gt1 variant strains appear to be most prevalent; of these, the 2k/1b strain is most common (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0025">12</link>). This virus was first noted in St. Petersburg and appears to have emerged in the former Soviet Union between 1923 and 1956 (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0024">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0026">13</link>). It is highly prevalent in former Soviet Republic countries such as Georgia, where prevalence is ~20% among all chronic HCV infections (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0027">14</link>). It has also been found in countries with populations that have emigrated from former Soviet bloc countries, such as France, Germany, and Israel. In these countries, 2k/1b has been identified in individuals who were likely infected prior to immigration and in nonimmigrants with high-risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use, suggesting that the variant is now circulating more broadly, along with other endemic strains (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0024">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0025">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0028">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0029">16</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0114s000000p0020">Chronic HCV infections with Gt2/1 variants are clinically important because they are not routinely identified. HCV genotyping assays that query sequences upstream of the recombination breakpoint (5′ UTR, core, E1) will often identify these variants as Gt2 infections, whereas the DAA target genes (NS3/4, NS5A, NS5B) downstream of the breakpoint are Gt1 sequences. These inaccurately genotyped individuals experience high rates of virologic relapse when treated with Gt2-specific regimens, but they can be cured effectively with Gt1-specific or pan-genotypic regimens (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0025">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0030">17</link>).</para>

In the United States, it is the most common blood-borne infection, causing an estimated 3 million chronic infections (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0031">18</link>). Acute hepatitis C occurs in the United States at a rate of approximately 0.3 per 100,000, with estimates of 19,000 new infections per year after adjusting for underreporting and asymptomatic infection (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0032">19</link>). In the blood-screening era, most transmission occurs after exposure to a low viral inoculum through intravenous drug use, sexual transmission, or occupational exposure to blood such as needlestick (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0033">20</link>). Sexual transmission was once thought to be uncommon but is now increasingly recognized, particularly among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM). In HIV-infected MSM, a meta-analysis of studies from 1984 to 2012 demonstrated increasing incidence among individuals who were not injecting drugs; seroconversion was associated with traumatic sex (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0034">21</link>). In HIV-uninfected MSM, higher than expected prevalence has been observed in a cohort that was initiating preexposure prophylaxis for HIV; HCV sequencing demonstrated similar strains in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals in the region, suggesting that shared sexual networks play a key role in HCV transmission (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0035">22</link>). Injection drug use in the wake of the opioid epidemic is fueling an upsurge in HCV infection in the United States. HCV incidence rates climbed from 2006 to 2012; the greatest increases occurred in young (&lt;30 years of age), nonurban whites (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0036">23</link>).

Most individuals are thought to be asymptomatic. Spontaneous clearance is observed in approximately 25% of acute infections; the remaining individuals become chronically infected. Signs of hepatitis during acute infection are actually positive indicators, as they represent early, vigorous antiviral T-cell responses associated with spontaneous virus clearance. These responses are minimal or absent in individuals who progress to chronicity (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0038">25</link>).

To investigate the mechanisms governing clearance, genome-wide association studies have been used to identify genetic determinants that predominate in individuals with spontaneous clearance versus progression to chronicity. This approach has identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the<emphasis>DQA1-DQB2 HLA</emphasis> class II region (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0039">26</link>), found on reference SNP (rs)4273729, and multiple SNPs upstream from the <emphasis>IL28B</emphasis> gene (27, 28; reviewed in reference <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0042">29</link>), of which the most strongly associated are variants on rs12979860 (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0039">26</link>) that are independently associated with clearance and additively effective. The homozygous G allele on <emphasis>HLA</emphasis> class II rs4273729 and homozygous C allele on <emphasis>IL28B</emphasis> rs12979860 are associated with clearance. The homozygous C allele on <emphasis>HLA</emphasis> class II rs4273729 and the homozygous T allele on rs12979860 are associated with chronic infection. Heterozygotes tend more toward chronic infection than clearance. <emphasis>IL28B</emphasis> encodes interferon λ3, an interferon that stimulates a signaling cascade similar to interferon α and interferon β, but through a distinct receptor. The worldwide geographic distribution of <emphasis>IL28B</emphasis> genotypes appears to explain in part the observed racial differences in acute infection outcome (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0041">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0043">30</link>).

        <para id="ch0114s000000p0024">Disease progression occurs in a relatively small proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. Over decades, progressive liver damage produces cirrhosis in 10 to 20% of chronic infections and liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma in approximately 5% of chronic infections (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0044">31</link>). However, the overall disease burden is significant due to the number of infected individuals. In fact, liver failure due to chronic hepatitis C infection is the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0045">32</link>). Risk factors for disease progression include diseases or behaviors that induce additional hepatic injury (such as concomitant hepatitis B virus infection and alcohol consumption) or impair antiviral immunity (such as HIV infection). Epidemiologic descriptors such as male gender and older age at infection are also associated with higher risk and faster rate of disease progression.</para>

Cure rates for Gt1, Gt2, and Gt3 are approximately 90% or greater (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0050">37</link>–<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0053">40</link>). Universal treatment of all adults with acute or chronic HCV (except for those who have a short life expectancy) and even children is now the standard of care in the United States, in large part due to the availability of highly efficacious drugs and the simplified treatment algorithms that have been developed. The two simplified algorithms rely on coformulated, pangenotypic, short-duration treatment regimens, but are only suitable for treatment-naive patients. The two algorithms are: (i) simplified HCV treatment algorithm for treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis and (ii) simplified HCV treatment algorithm for treatment-naive adults with compensated cirrhosis. Both algorithms use the two pangenotypic drug regimens: (i) glecaprevir in combination with pibrentasvir or (ii) sofosbuvir in combination with velpatasvir. Although both treatments are considered pangenotypic and recommended for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis, for those who are treatment naive with compensated cirrhosis there are some caveats (<anchor id="ch0114s000000a0016"/><link linkend="ch0114s000000a0017">Table 2</link>). In addition to simplifying the treatment, laboratory testing has also been streamlined. Laboratory tests include CBC count, quantitative RNA (baseline viral load), pregnancy test, hepatic function, and a general evaluation for cirrhosis, coinfection with HBV or HIV, pregnancy, end-stage renal and liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These populations, along with those with a history of liver transplant, prior treatment, or decompensated cirrhosis, are ineligible for the two simplified treatment algorithms. Together, these two algorithms provide clear and concise guidance on pretreatment and treatment response assessments and appropriate simplified patient management. For the populations that do not qualify for the two simplified treatment algorithms, genotype-specific regimens may be indicated and referral to a specialist may be needed. However, most patients will fall into the two simplified treatment algorithms. The emergence of these two treatment algorithms allows for most HCV infected persons to be treated in the primary-care setting, making care more accessible.</para>

Response rates to first-line regimens in HIV/HCV coinfection are equivalent to those in HCV-monoinfected individuals; side effect profiles are manageable, and patients on antiretroviral therapy can be safely treated if compatible DAAs are used, greatly simplifying HCV treatment of coinfected individuals (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0054">41</link>).

Generally, whole blood specimens can be transported at 25°C prior to processing. Dried blood spots (DBSs) have been adapted for use in HCV serology and NAATs with the aim of expanding diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepatitis C into resource-limited settings. With DBSs, accurate results have been obtained with HCV antibody and qualitative HCV RNA assays, but not quantitative HCV RNA tests (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0058">45</link>–<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0060">47</link>), suggesting that DBSs may have utility in identifying individuals with chronic hepatitis C, but they are not suitable for use with tests that are currently recommended for therapeutic monitoring. In HCV core antigen detection tests, DBS sensitivity was inferior to serum (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0061">48</link>). DBSs may have limited use for the identification of chronically infected HCV-seropositive individuals with these assays. No HCV diagnostic assays have received regulatory approval for the use of DBSs. Liver tissue is not typically tested, except for histologic assessment of fibrosis in Gt1-infected individuals. Performing reflexive testing on a single collection, meaning testing by an immunoassay for screening followed by NAAT on the same specimen to confirm active HCV infection, is now recommended by CDC.

      <para id="ch0114s000000p0038">HCV core antigen detection/quantification tests have been developed as alternatives to HCV RNA assays. The assay that is most widely available and reported in the literature is ARCHITECT HCV Ag (Abbott Diagnostics, Chicago, IL), a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay that is marked for use in Europe (Conformité Européenne) but has not received regulatory approval in the United States. This test is potentially useful in resource-limited settings due to target stability (eliminating the need for sample storage at ultra-low temperatures), simplified instrumentation, and easier technical protocols that reduce labor/training pressures. The analytical sensitivity ranges from 3 to 13 fmol/liter depending upon genotype, corresponding to approximately 1,000 IU/ml of HCV RNA measured by NAAT. The ARCHITECT HCV Ag assay is linear between 3 and 10,000 fmol/liter, and good quantitative correlation with HCV RNA quantification tests has been observed (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0062">49</link>–<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0064">51</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0114s000000p0039">The utility of these tests in the diagnosis of HCV infections and therapeutic monitoring during DAA treatment has been investigated. Meta-analyses of published data on core antigen assay performance in individuals with known chronic HCV demonstrate sensitivity for the diagnosis of chronic HCV that ranges from 92 to 97% and specificity of ~99% compared to NAAT (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0065">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0066">53</link>). These data suggest that core antigen assays may be useful as surrogates for NAAT for the diagnosis of chronic HCV in HCV-seropositive individuals, particularly in resource-limited settings where HCV screening is currently limited. In countries that are not resource restricted, where the emphasis is on the identification and treatment of all chronically infected patients, these assays would have limited benefit, due to false-negative rates which are low but significant compared to NAAT. Additionally, studies investigating the utility of core antigen tests for the diagnosis of acute HCV in the seroconversion window (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0066">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0067">54</link>) and for the documentation of end-of-treatment response after DAA therapy (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0068">55</link>) have shown inferior performance compared to NAAT, suggesting they are not optimal in these settings.</para>
      <para id="ch0114s000000p0040">Clinical guidelines have taken different approaches regarding core antigen testing. European HCV guidelines recommend the use of these tests in diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring as alternatives if NAATs are not readily available, thereby balancing practical considerations with concerns regarding suboptimal performance compared to NAATs. In contrast, U.S. HCV management guidelines recommend only HCV NAATs with detection limits of ≤25 IU/ml for all clinical uses.</para>

          <para id="ch0114s000000p0051">Given the asymptomatic nature of most acute HCV infections, most patients will be identified in the chronic phase of infection. Chronically infected patients are either asymptomatic and are identified through HCV screening/linkage-to-care efforts, or are symptomatic due to disease progression. The diagnosis of chronic HCV begins with antibody screening tests to document exposure, followed by HCV RNA NAAT to demonstrate viral replication and confirm active infection (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0034">Table 4</link>). In immunocompromised individuals who have impaired antibody responses and false-negative serologic test results, documenting the presence of HCV RNA with NAATs is the primary modality for diagnosing chronic HCV infection. Reliance on NAAT as the primary test for HCV infection screening is most important in the setting of HIV. False-negative HCV serology results with second- and third-generation serologic assays have been observed in ~5% of HIV-1-infected individuals. Low CD4 cell counts (&lt;200 cells/μl) have been found to be a risk factor (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0073">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0074">61</link>). Therefore, NAAT should be performed regardless of serology results to accurately diagnose chronic infection in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients whose humoral responses may be impaired.</para>
          <para id="ch0114s000000p0052">NAATs are also used for diagnosing HCV infection in children born to HCV-infected mothers. Antibody tests should not be used until the child is at least 18 months old, because a positive antibody test prior to this age may be due to maternal antibodies. In children who have a positive anti-HCV test at 18 months or later, NAAT is recommended at 3 years of age or older to determine spontaneous clearance versus chronic infection. NAAT can be performed as early as 2 months of age, but repeated testing is not recommended until the age of 3 or thereafter (<ulink url="http://www.hcvguidelines.org">http://www.hcvguidelines.org</ulink>).</para>

          <para id="ch0114s000000p0053">In the DAA era, the use of NAATs continues to be important but is vastly simplified compared to the era of interferon alfa-based regimens or even the early days of the DAA era. Their roles in diagnosis and management are summarized in<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0023">Table 3</link> and further explained in <anchor id="ch0114s000000a0047"/><link linkend="ch0114s000000a0050">Fig. 3</link>. Prior to treatment initiation, RNA levels should be determined in all patients. Testing by sensitive qualitative or quantitative NAAT (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0034">Table 4</link>) is recommended (&lt;15 IU/ml in European guidelines [<ulink url="http://www.easl.eu/_clinical-practice-guideline">http://www.easl.eu/_clinical-practice-guideline</ulink>]; ≤25 IU/ml in U.S. guidelines [<ulink url="http://www.hcvguidelines.org">http://www.hcvguidelines.org</ulink>]). A virological cure is defined as continuous absence of detectable HCV RNA (or sustained virologic response [SVR]), which is ascertained by HCV RNA quantification 12 weeks after treatment cessation (SVR12). In the era of interferon alfa-based regimens, SVR was conventionally determined 24 weeks after end of treatment. The followup period has been shortened to 12 weeks in the DAA era, after an analysis of amassed clinical trial data demonstrated that followup periods of 12 and 24 weeks were comparably predictive of SVR (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0075">62</link>). Most patients who achieve SVR12 are considered cured. Relapse later than 12 weeks after treatment cessation is rare. One study of clinical trial data demonstrated that it occurred in 0.2% of treated patients (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0076">63</link>). Recurrence after SVR12 is more commonly due to reinfection in individuals with high-risk behaviors than true relapse (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0077">64</link>). HCV RNA measurement is no longer recommended for routinely monitoring therapy and is primarily used for baseline assessment and confirmation of SVR.</para>

In the pegylated interferon alfa/ribavirin era, genotype was also useful in predicting response to therapy; however, response rates to DAAs are generally uniformly high across genotypes. Although genotype-specific regimens are still available, the vast majority of HCV-infected persons will qualify for the simplified treatment algorithms that rely on pangenotypic regimens. Pretreatment testing for the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) prior to DAA initiation in the era of pangenotypic regimens is also more limited.

Qualitative NAATs are indicated to diagnose chronic hepatitis C in HCV-seropositive individuals. One test (Aptima HCV RNA Qualitative Assay) is currently commercially available; it employs transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) chemistry (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0034">Table 4</link>; see <ulink url="ch0023#ch0023s0001">chapter 8</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> for description). Quantitative NAATs that employ real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and TMA are available (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0034">Table 4</link>). Some quantitative NAATs have received regulatory approval in the United States for chronic hepatitis C diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring indications; others have approval for therapeutic monitoring only (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0034">Table 4</link>). All assays amplify and detect highly conserved 5′ UTR sequences. A variety of test platforms for quantitative HCV NAAT have been introduced recently that incorporate new workflows with the aim of improving laboratory efficiency, decreasing labor requirements, and shortening time to result. For example, some instruments (Panther, which performs Aptima HCV Quant Dx, and cobas 6800/8800, which performs cobas HCV) offer features such as random-access testing and complete automation, with testing directly from primary tubes. Others perform testing in individual cartridges (GeneXpert, which performs Xpert HCV Viral Load) that allow for on-demand, random-access testing.</para>
          <para id="ch0114s000000p0056">A World Health Organization international calibration standard has been available since 1997; HCV RNA is therefore quantified in international units per milliliter (IU/ml). The Fifth International Standard is currently in use. It consists of plasma from a single Gt1a-infected individual who donated blood prior to seroconversion. This material was then further diluted in HCV seronegative/HCV RNA-negative pooled human plasma. The Fifth International Standard is a biological standard whose concentration was derived by testing at multiple sites (17 laboratories in 11 countries, using five different commercial tests); it has been assigned a value of 5.0 log<subscript>10</subscript> IU/ml. To permit longitudinal consistency in quantification, the standard was calibrated in parallel with the Second and Fourth International Standards. Whether the current international standard produces harmonization of quantitative results across all available HCV RNA quantitative tests and for all genotypes has not been investigated.</para>

HCV genotyping and subtyping of Gt1 (determination of Gt1a versus Gt1b) are still important for genotype-specific treatment regimens. This information is used in clinical management to determine DAA treatment regimen and to guide the need for RAS detection, depending upon the genotype that is present and regimens that are under consideration.</para>

        <para id="ch0114s000000p0065">HCV genotypes and subtypes can be determined by commercial (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0055">Table 5</link>) and laboratory-developed NAATs (<anchor id="ch0114s000000a0069"/><link linkend="ch0114s000000a0072">Table 6</link>) based on a variety of biochemical methods (advantages and disadvantages are summarized in <anchor id="ch0114s000000a0070"/><link linkend="ch0114s000000a0073">Table 7</link>). Most commercial assays utilize sequence-dependent chemistries that rely on the specificity of test reagents to accurately determine HCV genotype and subtype. For example, real-time RT-PCR utilizes the specificity of primer/probe binding to target HCV RNA in order to determine HCV genotype and subtype, while reverse hybridization is based on hybridization of specimen-derived HCV amplicon sequences to complementary sequences bound onto nylon membranes to determine HCV genotypes and subtypes. Among sequence-dependent tests, assays based on 5′ UTR sequences are generally acceptable for genotype determination, but are not suitable for Gt1 subtyping due to the degree of sequence conservation in this region. Analysis of other gene targets such as NS5B, core, and/or core-E1 improves genotype and subtype accuracy. Even with these alternative targets, there are limitations to the accuracy of sequence-directed genotyping methods. With the expansion in HCV diagnosis worldwide, sequence variants are increasing and producing aberrancies in genotype test results. These sequence variants include once-rare genotypes (Gt4, Gt5, and Gt6) and other variants in more common genotypes (Gt1, Gt2, and Gt3). Miscalls of Gt6 as Gt1 or Gt3 by LiPA 2.0 compared to direct sequencing of NS5B or core are particularly problematic, as they can lead to inappropriate genotype-specific therapy and therapeutic failure (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0020">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0082">69</link>). A real-time PCR assay designed to detect only Gt1 and Gt6 in a single reaction and to improve discrimination between these genotypes (Abbott HCV Genotype II PLUS RUO; Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) has reduced but not eliminated Gt6 miscalls (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0083">70</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0084">71</link>). Indeterminate results, demonstrated to be Gt6, Gt2, and Gt3 by Sanger sequencing, have also been observed and must be resolved by an alternative test (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0082">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0085">72</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0086">73</link>). Considering the tremendous sequence diversity of HCV genomes, tests that rely on sequence binding to make genotype calls may never reach the same level of accuracy as tests based on chemistries that are more sequence agnostic, such as sequencing. A variety of these HCV sequencing methods for genotype determination have been published (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0072">Table 6</link>). Advantages and disadvantages of different genotyping methods are listed in <link linkend="ch0114s000000a0073">Table 7</link>. Of note, recombinant HCV strains can be identified with methods that characterize 5′ regions (5′ UTR, core, E1) and 3′ regions (NS5A and NS5B) such as multitarget sequencing or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) methods; current commercially available tests will not detect these variants (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0073">Table 7</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0114s000000p0070">For tests that have received regulatory approval, laboratories must verify accuracy of test performance in-house. More extensive assay validation is required for laboratory-developed tests. From the perspective of accuracy, genotype determination of the more common viruses (Gt1 to Gt3) is fairly straightforward, as these samples are readily accessible. Gt4, Gt5, and Gt6 are more problematic, as they are found less commonly. Samples containing HCV are available commercially (Gt1 through 3, ProMedDx, Norton, MA; Gt1 through 5, Exact Diagnostics, Fort Worth, TX; Gt1 through 6, BocaBiolistics, Coconut Creek, FL, and SeraCare, Milford, MA) for use in preimplementation accuracy studies. One strategy for samples found to putatively contain these less-common genotypes is to refer them to a reference laboratory for genotype confirmation.</para>

      <para id="ch0114s000000p0071">The diagnosis of chronic HCV infection typically begins by screening with a serology assay (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0050">Fig. 3</link>) followed by confirmation of active infection with NAAT (this testing algorithm can be completed on a single draw). The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommend a one-time, routine HCV screening test for all adults and all pregnant women (at least once per pregnancy and with each new pregnancy), with follow-up periodic testing for those with increased risk behaviors, conditions, and exposures (<anchor id="ch0114s000000a0077"/><link linkend="ch0114s000000a0082">Table 8</link>). Annual testing is recommended for all persons who inject drugs and for men who are coinfected with HIV and have unprotected sex. The CDC has also come out in support of universal screening with some modifications from the AASLD/IDSA recommendations. In the era of highly effective DAA therapy, studies have shown that universal screening can be cost-effective, thereby prompting the shift away from targeted screening (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0087">74</link>). Universal screening also aligns with the overall goal of the World Health Organization and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) of eliminating HCV as a public health threat by 2030, worldwide and in the U.S., respectively (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0088">75</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0114s000000p0072">Serologic testing for HCV has undergone considerable evolution. The first serologic assay comprised a single NS4 peptide (c-100-3) and was introduced in 1990 shortly after HCV was identified as a major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis. This assay represented a significant advance, particularly in identifying contaminated blood products and preventing transfusion-transmitted hepatitis C; however, its flaws of low sensitivity and specificity were soon apparent (sensitivity, ~70%; positive predictive values in low- and high-prevalence populations, 30 to 50% and 70 to 85%, respectively) (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0089">76</link>). Increased sensitivity and specificity were achieved in second-generation serologic assays. These tests (one of which is still marketed) were better able to detect acute infections due to the incorporation of NS3 and core antigens (<anchor id="ch0114s000000a0079"/><link linkend="ch0114s000000a0085">Table 9</link> and <anchor id="ch0114s000000a0080"/><link linkend="ch0114s000000a0097">Fig. 4</link>), two targets of early antibody responses. The reasons for improved performance of third-generation serologic assays that incorporate NS5 and contain reconfigured NS3 antigen (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0097">Fig. 4</link>) are unclear. Improved antigenicity of the alternate NS3 antigen leading to increased detection during early seroconversion has been argued (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0090">77</link>). However, the finding of HCV RNA-positive donors who were consistently reactive by third-generation tests but remained unreactive by second-generation versions for over 6 months suggests that more complex immunologic factors may be responsible (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0091">78</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0114s000000p0079">With seroconversion panels in which infection has been documented by serology only, the seroconversion window has been documented to decrease from approximately 16 to 10 to 8 weeks with the introduction of first-, second-, and third-generation serology tests, respectively. It is important to note that when infection is documented with NAAT, the seroconversion window with second- and third-generation serology tests is much longer (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0014">Fig. 2</link>) (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0072">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0092">79</link>). <link linkend="ch0114s000000a0085">Table 9</link> contains information on HCV serology tests available in the United States; numerous other assays are also available globally (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0093">80</link>). A rapid (20- to 40-minute time to result), point-of-care, direct-from-sample cartridge-based immunochromatographic test (CLIA-waived) has been approved by the FDA for use with fingerstick and venipuncture whole blood (OraQuick HCV, Orasure Technologies, Bethlehem, PA). Compared to third-generation serologic tests, reported sensitivity is 94 to 99% and specificity is &gt;99% (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0094">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0095">82</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0114s000000p0080">Despite improvements in performance characteristics, spurious serology results can still be observed. Second-generation assays are still available (Abbott HCV EIA 2.0;<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0085">Table 9</link>) and can yield false-negative results due to low sensitivity compared to third-generation assays. Therefore, in the appropriate clinical setting (for example, an individual with sudden-onset hepatitis or an occupational exposure such as needlestick from an HCV-infected individual), alternative testing (third-generation serology test or NAAT) should be considered in a patient with a negative second-generation test result. Alternative testing should also be considered for any negative serology test result if acute hepatitis C is suspected (see “Evaluation, Interpretation, and Reporting of Results” below for additional discussion). False-negative results have also been observed in immunocompromised patients (HIV with CD4 &lt;100, chemotherapy-treated oncology patients); therefore, NAAT should be performed to definitively exclude infection in these patients (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0074">61</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0096">83</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0114s000000p0081">For most antibody screening assays, a positive result is considered initially reactive, and repeat testing in duplicate is required. Results are reported as reactive if two or more replicates are positive. One advantage of certain chemiluminescent and microparticle immunoassays (AxSYM Anti-HCV, Abbott; ARCHITECT Anti-HCV, Abbott; VITROS Anti-HCV, Ortho; ADVIA Centaur HCV, Siemens) is that initial positive results can be reported as reactive; repeat testing is not required, due to the high sensitivities and specificities of these tests.</para>
      <para id="ch0114s000000p0082">HCV serologic tests were originally developed as screening assays, with an emphasis on sensitivity and consequent potential for false-positive results. Early recommendations (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0097">84</link>) therefore advised confirming all positive results by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) before proceeding to NAAT, to avoid erroneous diagnoses. Confirmation of all reactive screening test results was never widely adopted by clinicians or laboratorians outside the blood-screening arena, largely due to the availability of more definitive NAATs and the conviction that RIBA did not represent an adequate confirmatory test as it employed the same antigens as antibody screening tests. Subsequent recommendations included a complex algorithm advising the confirmation of screening results with low signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratios by RIBA, since false positives were most likely to occur in these samples (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0098">85</link>). RIBA is no longer being manufactured, and current screening recommendations for chronic HCV (outlined in <link linkend="ch0114s000000a0050">Fig. 3</link>) have largely jettisoned the concept of confirmatory testing unless a spurious positive result is suspected in an individual with no risk factors. In these instances, S/CO ratios are still useful to guide additional testing, although they are not formally mentioned (see <link linkend="ch0114s000000a0085">Table 9</link> for assays available in the United States and Europe; S/CO ratios for other assays are described in reference <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0099">86</link>); low S/CO ratios typically indicate false-positive serology results. If documentation of a false-positive screening result is required, U.S. guidelines recommend additional testing with an alternative, FDA-approved HCV antibody screening test (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0100">87</link>). In other countries, commercial HCV immunoblots are available (INNO-LIA HCV Score, Fujirebio; CE-marked).</para>

        <para id="ch0114s000000p0083">With the emergence of the simplified pangenotypic treatment algorithms for the treatment naive, the clinical utility of baseline testing for the presence of RASs that are associated with DAA therapy failures has been greatly reduced. For the two pangenotypic simplified treatment algorithms (treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis and treatment-naive adults with compensated cirrhosis), only individuals who fall under the latter (treatment-naive with compensated cirrhosis), are infected with genotype 3, and are being considered for the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment need to be evaluated for the NS5A Y93H RAS prior to treatment initiation. And only those without this RAS are eligible for the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir regimen (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0017">Table 2</link>). HCV exists as a quasispecies in infected individuals, as is true of viruses with RNA genomes that rely on error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for replication. RASs occur commonly within the quasispecies of untreated individuals.</para>
        <para id="ch0114s000000p0084">Unlike other virus infections (HIV), the presence of RAS at baseline is not uniformly predictive of treatment failure. Rather, certain baseline RASs are associated with treatment failure in the context of specific combinations of HCV genotype and DAA regimens. Additionally, prior treatment failure (with interferon alfa-containing regimens) and the presence of underlying cirrhosis can further predispose to treatment failure in the setting of baseline RAS. Therefore, a variety of factors including treatment regimen, HCV genotype, underlying cirrhosis, and treatment experience are used to determine the necessity for baseline RAS testing and adjustments to treatment if significant RASs are identified (<ulink url="http://www.hcvguidelines.org">http://www.hcvguidelines.org</ulink>) (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0101">88</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0114s000000p0085">Baseline RAS detection is currently limited to the NS5A gene. The replicative fitness of HCVs with NS5A RAS is high in the absence of DAAs. These variants have been detected at baseline and for prolonged periods after cessation of DAA treatment (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0102">89</link>). In contrast, variant viruses with RASs in NS3/4A and NS5B genes are relatively unfit in the absence of drug selection compared to wild-type HCV. Clinically significant RASs by genotype and drug regimen are shown in <link linkend="ch0114s000000a0100">Table 10</link>. There is no clinical utility for RAS detection after treatment failure; therefore, testing in this setting is not recommended.</para>
        <para id="ch0114s000000p0086">Most RASs alter the conformation of DAA binding sites and therefore cause an increase in the concentration required for 50% of maximal efficacy (EC<subscript>50</subscript>) when tested in HCV replicon systems (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0101">88</link>); RASs that are currently clinically actionable cause high-level resistance (≥25-fold increase in EC<subscript>50</subscript> in replicon systems) (<ulink url="http://www.hcvguidelines.org">http://www.hcvguidelines.org</ulink>). Interestingly, not all substitutions at RAS positions are equally important. Some are merely polymorphisms while others cause clinically significant resistance. Multiple baseline RASs in a single gene may negatively affect therapeutic response. Preliminary data suggest that three or more RASs in NS5A are associated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir failure in Gt1b-infected patients with no prior exposure to NS5A inhibitors (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0103">90</link>). Additional data are required to better understand the clinical significance of this phenomenon.</para>

RASs have been found to be associated with treatment failure only when present at ≥15% of the HCV quasispecies found in plasma; minor variants present at lower frequency do not appear to affect treatment outcome (<ulink url="http://www.hcvguidelines.org">http://www.hcvguidelines.org</ulink>, <ulink url="https://easl.eu/publication-category/clinical-practice-guidelines/">https://easl.eu/publication-category/clinical-practice-guidelines/</ulink>). Consequently, Sanger sequencing chemistry is appropriate for baseline RAS determination because it can identify genetic variants when they are present as at least 10 to 20% of the quasispecies. Massively parallel sequencing (also known as deep sequencing or next-generation sequencing [NGS]) can also be used for RAS detection. Treatment guidelines recommend that substitutions should only be reported and considered clinically significant when present in ≥15% of sequence reads (<ulink url="http://www.hcvguidelines.org">http://www.hcvguidelines.org</ulink>, <ulink url="https://easl.eu/publication-category/clinical-practice-guidelines/">https://easl.eu/publication-category/clinical-practice-guidelines/</ulink>). Commercially available assays that are massively parallel sequencing assays include <emphasis>Sentosa</emphasis> SQ HCV Genotyping Assay (Vela Diagnostics), which targets regions in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B for RAS identification and genotyping. Several studies have been published that assess deep sequencing assays, including Sentosa (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0104">91</link>–<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0106">93</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0114s000000p0099">Many different noncommercial sequencing methods for RAS detection have been reported in the literature. Caution should be taken when implementing target-specific reagents from published Sanger or massively parallel sequencing methods, as many primer sets are genotype specific. Efficacy of RAS identification in intended, clinically relevant genotypes should be established during test validation. In theory, WGS would avoid genotype-inclusivity issues of targeted techniques. This approach is impractical, as RAS detection is currently a low-volume test in routine clinical laboratories and WGS is cost-effective only in high-volume/high-throughput configurations. A recent meta-analysis that used criteria such as sensitivity (ability to identify RAS in specimens with HCV levels of ≥1,000 IU/ml) and genotype inclusivity of published sequencing methods is a useful resource for potential sequencing reagents (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0107">94</link>). The HCV GenoSure Drug Resistance Assay NS3/4A (Monogram Sciences) is another NGS assay for identification of NS3/4A RAS associated with protease inhibitors.</para>

      <para id="ch0114s000000p0101">Establishing the diagnosis of acute hepatitis C can be challenging. Most cases of acute hepatitis C are asymptomatic; therefore, serum aminotransferase elevations can be helpful if present but should not be relied upon as the sole indicator of infection. Additionally, seroconversion can be delayed, and HCV RNA detection in plasma can be sporadic during the acute phase of infection. Serology and RNA assessment should therefore both be performed to optimally detect infection. Diagnostic accuracy also requires testing at multiple time points. Single HCV NAAT results do not reliably predict exposure outcome. Transient HCV RNA negativity has been documented early postinfection in individuals who become chronically infected and later at the time of seroconversion (<link linkend="ch0114s000000a0014">Fig. 2</link>) (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0108">95</link>). Transient positive results have been found in those who spontaneously clear virus (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0072">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0114s000000li0109">96</link>). Testing for infection is recommended for 6 months after a known exposure since the majority of individuals seroconvert within this timeframe (<ulink url="http://www.hcvguidelines.org">http://www.hcvguidelines.org</ulink>). Initial baseline testing should be performed as soon as possible, preferably within the first 48 hours after exposure, to determine HCV infection status at the time of exposure. Individuals should be tested monthly for 6 months with HCV NAAT and serologic assays to document seroconversion if they have no prior evidence of HCV infection. HCV NAAT-only testing is required if there is evidence of prior resolved HCV infection (HCV seropositive, HCV RNA not detected). Acute HCV infection should be treated with the pangenotypic DAA regimens that are also recommended for chronic HCV infection.</para>

      <para id="ch0114s000000p0102">In the United States, CDC has emphasized the need for laboratories to offer reflexive serology testing, meaning that any HCV serology test that is reactive will automatically reflex to HCV NAAT testing. Originally, the recommendation was met with concern by laboratorians that testing a specimen on a chemistry analyzer and then performing sensitive NAAT testing might result in a false-positive NAAT result due to cross-contamination. However, studies have demonstrated that this not the case (<link linkend="ch0114s000000li0110">97</link>). This reflexive testing approach allows for determining active infection by using a single blood draw, which is likely to reduce the number of infected persons who are lost to followup in an era when highly efficacious therapy is available. Quantitative NAATs in therapeutic management of chronic hepatitis C, during the interferon/ribavirin combination therapy era, rendered them critical for appropriate decision making with regard to therapeutic duration and determination of response after treatment. Therefore, a full understanding of test performance characteristics (genotype bias, precision, and limit of detection) was required so that results were interpreted accurately and patients were managed appropriately. In the all-oral DAA era, and more recently with the emergence of pangenotypic, simplified treatment regimens, viral load assays play a much more limited role in therapeutic management because regimens are so highly potent and efficacious. Essentially, patients will respond to treatment if they are placed on the correct regimen and are compliant. In this setting, test interpretation issues are subtle or minor. NAAT testing is now primarily utilized prior to treatment initiation and to verify viral clearance or SVR for chronic HCV infection. NAAT testing remains critical for establishing acute, neonatal, and chronic infection in immunocompromised individuals. Furthermore, initiating DAA therapy is now recommended for both acute and pediatric HCV infections. Genotype testing is no longer universally required due to the pangenotypic therapies (except for HCV genotype 3, if considering the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir regimen) but is still important for HCV genotype-specific DAA regimens, which are now primarily reserved for those who have experienced treatment failure or have severe, complicated disease, such as decompensated cirrhosis. HCV genotype is the only way to distinguish between possible reinfection versus relapse, as a different strain from the original determination indicates reinfection. If the same genotype (or genotype/subtype) is identified in the posttreatment sample, resolution requires sequence determination (typically Sanger sequencing) with comparison of pretreatment and posttreatment HCV sequences. The clinical consequences of sporadic cases of treatment failure or reinfection are minimal, other than health care cost. Given the plethora of DAA regimen options, retreatment is readily undertaken, and cure remains a high probability.</para>
