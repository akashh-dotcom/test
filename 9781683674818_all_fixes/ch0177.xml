      <para id="ch0177s0001p0002">A number of effective antiparasitic drugs are currently available. These agents are important both for therapy of infected individual patients and for control of parasitic infections at the community level. Large-scale chemotherapy is reducing transmission, morbidity, and mortality of certain parasitic infections. However, the lack of financial incentives to develop new agents, the absence of effective antiparasitic vaccines, emerging parasite resistance, and the enormous burden of disease worldwide continue to limit effective management of parasitic infections globally.</para>
      <para id="ch0177s0001p0003">This chapter focuses on the mechanisms of action, pharmacology, clinical utility, and adverse effects of common first-line antiparasitic therapies and newer drug alternatives. Major anthelmintic drugs, namely, albendazole, mebendazole, praziquantel, ivermectin, and di-ethylcarbamazine (DEC), are reviewed in detail, as is the newly approved moxidectin. Nitazoxanide, an agent with both anthelmintic and antiprotozoal activity, is also discussed. Major antiprotozoal drugs, including those used for malaria, infections with gastrointestinal protozoa, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis, are also reviewed, but an exhaustive list of all antiparasitic drugs is not included. Specifically, we exclude discussion of agents without a first-line indication, those that are recommended only in special situations (e.g., furazolidone in children), and those that are not yet approved outside a single country (e.g., tribendimidine). Antibacterial and antifungal agents with antiprotozoal activity, such as the 5-nitroimidazoles, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, and amphotericin, are not discussed in detail here, but their general indications for parasitic infections are shown in<anchor id="ch0177s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0177s0002a0006">Tables 1</link> and <anchor id="ch0177s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0177s0002a0017">2</link>. Resistance to antiparasitic agents and drug susceptibility testing are dealt with in separate chapters.</para>
      <para id="ch0177s0001p0004">Throughout this chapter, we indicate which antiparasitic drugs are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For those based in other countries, a table of national and regional drug regulatory authorities is provided in the appendix.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0177s0002a0002"/>
      <para id="ch0177s0002p0001">The benzimidazoles are antiparasitic agents with a broad spectrum of activity against many helminthic and certain protozoal infections. All members of the benzimidazole class have in common a bicyclic ring system into which benzene has been inserted. Mebendazole and albendazole, both of which are synthetic agents, are the most widely used drugs of this class. Mebendazole is 5-benzoyl-2-benzimidazole carbamic acid, and albendazole is methyl 5-(propylthio)-2-benzimidazole carbamate. The low cost, high efficacy, and ease of administration of these two agents have led to their widespread use for many human parasitic infections. Major indications for their use are shown in<anchor id="ch0177s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0177s0002a0023">Tables 3</link> and <anchor id="ch0177s0002a0004"/><link linkend="ch0177s0002a0030">4</link>. Mebendazole has been approved for treatment of multiple nematode infections by the FDA, but albendazole is used preferentially as first-line treatment for many parasite infections. However, albendazole is nevertheless considered investigational and given as a “nonapproved indication” in all cases except when used as treatment for hydatid infections and neurocysticercosis (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0001">1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0177s0002p0002">Other members of this drug class include flubendazole, thiabendazole, and triclabendazole. Flubendazole, a parafluoro analogue of mebendazole, has the same mechanism of action as mebendazole and albendazole. It is licensed in Europe for the treatment of intestinal nematodes but is not licensed in the United States. It has shown good activity against adult filarial parasites in animal models if given parenterally (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0002">2</link>). It also exhibits activity against protoscoleces of <emphasis>Echinococcus granulosus</emphasis>, but currently there are no data on its efficacy for treatment of hydatid disease in humans (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0003">3</link>). Thiabendazole, 2-(4-thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole, has mechanisms of action similar to those of the other benzimidazoles, but it is frequently associated with side effects. It has now been replaced by other anthelmintic agents (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0004">4</link>) but is sometimes still used topically for treatment of cutaneous larva migrans. Triclabendazole is an imidazole derivative that has been used as a veterinary agent for many years. It is thought to act on microtubules, causing decreased parasite motility. It is the drug of choice for fascioliasis and acts on both adult and immature worms (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0005">5</link>), although resistance is emerging in animals, and this may lead to increasing treatment failures in human patients (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0006">6</link>–<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0010">10</link>). It is also an option for therapy of paragonimiasis (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0011">11</link>). Triclabendazole is well tolerated, and few significant adverse effects have been described, but it is not recommended for use during pregnancy because of insufficient safety data. It was approved by the FDA in 2019 for treatment of fascioliasis. These three agents are not discussed further.</para>

      <para id="ch0177s0002p0003"><emphasis role="strong">Mechanism of action.</emphasis> The antiparasitic activity of albendazole and mebendazole results mainly from their ability to bind to a cytoskeletal protein of parasites called β-tubulin, thereby inhibiting the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0012">12</link>). The disruption of microtubule synthesis within parasitic intestinal cells results in decreased absorptive function. In addition, mebendazole and albendazole directly inhibit glucose absorption by parasites, leading to a depletion of parasite glycogen stores, insufficient energy sources for formation of ATP, and an inability to reproduce or survive (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0013">13</link>). Although tubulin is also present in mammalian hosts, the benzimidazoles bind to parasite tubulin with an affinity that is hundreds of times greater than that with which they bind to mammalian tubulin, thereby causing minimal mammalian toxicity (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0004">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0177s0002p0004"><emphasis role="strong">Pharmacokinetics.</emphasis> Benzimidazoles are poorly soluble in water and therefore are not well absorbed following oral administration. Although this limits their activity against tissue-dwelling parasites, it contributes to their minimal toxicity and to their efficacy in the treatment of many intestinal helminthic infections (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0014">14</link>). Less than 20% of mebendazole is absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations seen at 2 to 4 h. It is metabolized in the liver to inactive compounds, eliminated in the bile, and excreted predominantly in the feces. It is 95% protein bound in plasma, and its serum half-life is 2.5 to 5.5 h. Serum levels are markedly variable between individuals, but tissue and echinococcal cyst concentrations tend to be low (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0015">15</link>).</para>
      <para role="TXT ParaOverride-2">The oral bioavailability of albendazole is also poor, with less than 10% absorption following an oral dose (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0016">16</link>). Administration of albendazole with a fatty meal markedly improves bioavailability, up to 5-fold. It is rapidly meta-bolized in the liver, and concentrations of the parent drug in plasma are negligible. However, its primary metabolite, albendazole sulfoxide, also has anthelmintic activity (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0017">17</link>). This results in a higher efficacy of albendazole than mebendazole for most indications. Albendazole sulfoxide is 70% protein bound and is widely distributed throughout the body. Peak plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide are seen after 2 to 5 h but show great intersubject variability, ranging from 0.45 to 2.96 mg/liter following a single dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0018">18</link>). Albendazole induces enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system responsible for its metabolism. Cimetidine and dexamethasone both raise drug levels and increase the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0019">19</link>), and coadministration with praziquantel also increases the levels of albendazole (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0020">20</link>–<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0022">22</link>). Albendazole sulfoxide has been detected in urine, bile, liver, cyst fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Levels in plasma have been reported to be 3- to 10-fold and 2- to 4-fold higher than in cyst fluid and CSF, respectively (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0024">24</link>), although the relationship between plasma levels and levels in other fluids shows individual variability. Albendazole sulfoxide has a half-life of ~9 h. It is oxidized further to inactive compounds such as albendazole sulfone and is excreted mainly in the urine.</para>

Albendazole and mebendazole have similar and broad ranges of activity (<link linkend="ch0177s0002a0023">Tables 3</link> and <link linkend="ch0177s0002a0030">4</link>). Both drugs have good efficacy against many common intestinal nematode infections, including ascariasis, enterobiasis, and hookworm infections. Three-day regimens of mebendazole and 1 to 3 days of albendazole are generally recommended for therapy of individual patients (with the longer duration being particularly preferable for trichuriasis therapy) (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0026">26</link>). A single dose of either drug is often used for mass or targeted community treatment of intestinal nematodes in areas where the parasites are endemic. Albendazole is preferred in most instances, but the efficacy of albendazole against very heavy infections with <emphasis>Trichuris trichiura</emphasis> is suboptimal, and mebendazole may be preferable in this circumstance. The reported curative efficacy of both drugs in different parasitic infections varies according to the baseline intensity of infection in the patient, geographical location, diagnostic tests employed, and duration of follow-up posttreatment (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0026">26</link>).</para>

Transient abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea may develop. Headache, dizziness, insomnia, and allergic phenomena are also reported. With prolonged high-dose therapy, such as for echinococcosis, transient and reversible elevations of serum transaminases occur in 1 to 5% of recipients. Occasionally, alopecia (&lt;1%) and reversible leukopenia (&lt;1%) are seen. Discontinuation of therapy is infrequently needed, but a death related to albendazole-induced pancytopenia has been described (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0031">31</link>).

However, studies of benzimidazole drugs in animals suggest a possible teratogenic and embryotoxic effect. Since there are no good prospective safety data on either of these agents in humans, it is recommended that neither albendazole nor mebendazole be administered during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, unless the potential benefits justify the possible risk to the fetus. Albendazole and mebendazole are excreted in low concentrations in breast milk, and although they are unlikely to be harmful to the infant, these drugs should be used with caution in lactating women (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0035">35</link>).</para>

It has been approved for use by the FDA (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0001">1</link>). It has the unique characteristic of being active against almost all trematodes and cestodes, but it is not useful for treatment of nematode infections (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0004">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0177s0003p0002"><emphasis role="strong">Mechanism of action.</emphasis> Praziquantel induces ultrastructural changes in the teguments of parasites, resulting in increased permeability to calcium ions.

No parenteral formulation exists. The drug is biotransformed in the liver, and metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine. The cytochrome P450 hepatic metabolism of praziquantel is induced by corticosteroids, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. Serum levels of praziquantel are therefore lowered when any of these drugs are coadministered. Cimetidine, which inhibits P450-mediated metabolism, can be given concurrently to increase plasma praziquantel levels. Plasma levels peak after 1.5 to 2 h, and after a single 40-mg/kg dose, peak levels have been reported to be 1.007 to 1.625 mg/liter (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0043">43</link>), with an area under the curve from 2,100 to 5,400 ng ∙ h/ml (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0044">44</link>).

However, it is not generally used as first-line treatment for these indications due to the widespread availability and excellent efficacy of albendazole.

      <para id="ch0177s0004p0008"><emphasis role="strong">Adverse effects.</emphasis> Ivermectin is generally well tolerated, with most adverse effects that occur following its administration being a result of the host’s immune response to destruction of parasites rather than to toxic effects of the drug per se. Adverse effects include fever, rash, dizziness, pruritus, myalgia, arthralgia, and tender lymphadenopathy; the severity of these symptoms relates to the pretreatment intensity of infection rather than to ivermectin serum concentrations (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0088">88</link>). Transaminitis is occasionally reported. Severe reactions occasionally occur, including the Mazzotti reaction, a hypersensitivity response to rapid microfilarial death that is primarily seen in individuals with high microfilarial loads. This anaphylactoid response is characterized by allergic manifestations, including pruritus, edema, fever, and systemic hypotension. In patients infected with <emphasis>L. loa</emphasis> who have elevated levels of microfilaremia, ivermectin has been associated with the development of fatal encephalopathy (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0089">89</link>) and so should be avoided.</para>
      <para id="ch0177s0004p0009">Ivermectin (pregnancy category C) has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and rabbits when given in repeated doses of 0.2, 8.1, and 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively. Teratogenicity was characterized in the three species tested by cleft palate; clubbed forepaws were additionally observed in rabbits. These developmental effects were found only at or near doses that were maternotoxic to the pregnant female (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0062">62</link>).

      <para id="ch0177s0005p0001">Moxidectin, like ivermectin, is a semisynthetic macrocyclic lactone, but whereas ivermectin is an avermectin, moxidectin belongs to the milbemycin family (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0096">96</link>). It is an old drug, originally developed and used in veterinary medicine, and was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of onchocerciasis (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0097">97</link>) in patients at least 12 years of age. It is a potent microfilaricide, and its potential advantages over ivermectin are that a single dose has a more prolonged microfilaricidal and embryostatic effect and results in greater reduction in skin microfilaria (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0096">96</link>, <link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0098">98</link>, <link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0099">99</link>).

It is rapidly absorbed, with a time to peak concentration of 4 h. It is very lipophilic, which causes it to have a long half-life and high volume of distribution (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0101">101</link>, <link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0102">102</link>). After a single oral dose of 8 mg, the usual recommended dose, moxidectin has a half-life of 20 to 43 days.

Unlike ivermectin, moxidectin is a poor substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters and is excreted predominantly via a P-gp-independent pathway. Renal excretion is minimal, but it is excreted in breast milk of lactating women.

In onchocerciasis, moxidectin exerts both stronger and longer microfilaricidal suppression than ivermectin (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0099">99</link>), leading to nearly complete clearance of skin microfilariae at around 1 month after treatment and sustained reduction for at least 6 months, and potentially up to 12 months (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0096">96</link>). Moxidectin also shows promising activity for control of scabies, strongyloidiasis, and other gastrointestinal nematode infections (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0104">104</link>, <link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0105">105</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0177s0005p0005"><emphasis role="strong">Adverse effects.</emphasis> Moxidectin shows an excellent tolerability and safety profile (even at doses up to 36 mg), although rapid microfilarial death in individuals with high microfilarial loads can result in the Mazzotti reaction. Its safety in treating onchocerciasis in areas where loiasis is coendemic has not been determined. There are also insufficient data on its safety in pregnant or lactating women and in children less than 12 years of age.</para>

In blood, nitazoxanide is rapidly hydrolyzed to form an active metabolite, tizoxanide. The maximum concentration of tizoxanide in plasma following an oral dose of 500 mg of nitazoxanide is 2 mg/liter (6.5 μM), and its half-life in plasma is 1 to 2 h (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0121">121</link>).

        <para id="ch0177s0008s0001p0001">The 4-aminoquinolines include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and amodiaquine. Chloroquine is the most widely used of these agents. It is an inexpensive, safe drug that has been used extensively for treatment and prophylaxis of all<emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species that infect humans, although resistance to chloroquine in <emphasis>Plasmodium falciparum</emphasis> is prevalent globally in most malarious regions. Hydroxychloroquine is a related synthetic compound with an identical clinical spectrum, similar pharmacokinetics, and similar adverse effects. Amodiaquine is another related agent with the same mechanism of action and spectrum of activity. It is reported to be more effective than chloroquine for parasite clearance, but its use has been restricted due to uncommon serious side effects, as noted below. It is not approved by the FDA (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0001">1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0177s0008s0001p0002"><emphasis role="strong">Mechanism of action.</emphasis> The main mechanism of action of the 4-aminoquinolines is thought to be via nonenzymatic inhibition of heme polymerization. Asexual intraerythrocytic malaria parasites actively concentrate quinoline ring compounds within hemoglobin-containing vesicles. In the absence of drug, plasmodia degrade host erythrocyte hemoglobin to provide amino acid nutrients essential for parasite growth. The degradation of hemoglobin produces free heme, which is stored as ferriprotoporphyrin IX within the red blood cell. Ferriprotoporphyrin IX is toxic to the parasite and is usually polymerized into nontoxic malaria pigment (hemozoin). In the presence of drug, there is inhibition of the conversion of heme to hemozoin, leading to the accumulation of products toxic to the parasite and resulting in parasite death (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0129">129</link>). These agents also inhibit protein synthesis by inhibiting incorporation of phosphate into DNA and RNA and by inhibiting DNA and RNA polymerases (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0013">13</link>). Chloroquine also raises the pH of the vesicle (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0130">130</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0177s0008s0001p0003"><emphasis role="strong">Pharmacokinetics.</emphasis> The 4-aminoquinolines are extensively distributed in tissues and are characterized by a long elimination half-life. Despite similarities in their chemical structures, these drugs show differences in their biotransformation and routes of elimination (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0131">131</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0177s0008s0001p0004">Chloroquine is available in oral and parenteral forms. Many different formulations are manufactured worldwide. Oral administration is preferred, as excessively rapid administration via the parenteral route results in toxic peak plasma concentrations and a danger of fatal cardiovascular collapse (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0132">132</link>). Chloroquine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and has oral bioavailability exceeding 75%. Food has variable effects on absorption. The drug is extensively distributed in body tissues and reaches high levels within the brain (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0133">133</link>). Chloroquine binds to melanin-containing cells in the skin and eye and so can also reach high levels in these sites. There is marked variability in peak plasma concentrations between individuals, but within 3 h of initiating standard oral treatment doses (10 mg chloroquine base/kg at 0 and 24 h, followed by 5 mg/kg at 48 h) (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0134">134</link>), blood concentrations rise above 1 mmol/liter and remain at this level for at least 4 days (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0135">135</link>). Young children may require higher doses to achieve similar plasma concentrations (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0136">136</link>, <link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0137">137</link>). It is ~60% protein bound and has a half-life of 3 to 6 days. Approximately 30 to 50% of the drug is metabolized in the liver to inactive compounds, and the remainder is excreted in the urine. Treatment reduction (usually 50% of the normal dose) is required in patients with severe renal or hepatic failure. It is not dialyzable.</para>
        <para id="ch0177s0008s0001p0005">In contrast, amodiaquine is a prodrug and is almost entirely metabolized to a biologically active metabolite, desethylamodiaquine, following oral administration. Otherwise, it has pharmacokinetic properties similar to those of chloroquine but has a smaller volume of distribution.</para>
        <para id="ch0177s0008s0001p0006"><emphasis role="strong">Spectrum of activity.</emphasis> The 4-aminoquinolines are efficient and rapidly acting blood schizonticides. They can be used in both the treatment and prophylaxis of susceptible strains of all malaria species. They have no effect on tissue schizonts or exoerythrocytic stages. They are gametocytocidal for <emphasis>Plasmodium vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>Plasmodium malariae</emphasis> but have minimal effect on <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> gametocytes. Following infections with <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> or <emphasis>Plasmodium ovale</emphasis>, primaquine is also needed to eradicate liver hypnozoites and prevent relapses of infection.</para>
        <para id="ch0177s0008s0001p0007">Chloroquine is still a first-line option for therapy for some<emphasis>P. vivax, Plasmodium knowlesi, P. malariae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> infections, but increasing resistance among <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> isolates globally, and especially among <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> infections acquired in Indonesia, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, is emerging. Chloroquine also remains the treatment of choice for susceptible <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> strains, although <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> strains from almost all areas of the world have developed resistance to it, so it is now rarely used for <emphasis>P. falciparum.</emphasis> It is also effective against <emphasis>P. knowlesi</emphasis> infections (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0138">138</link>). Because of its potential toxicity, amodiaquine is not recommended for prophylaxis of malaria and is generally not used as first-line treatment. However, it results in faster parasite clearance and more rapid resolution of symptoms than chloroquine, and it may be effective in some cases of chloroquine-resistant malaria, so it is used as an alternative treatment regimen in some areas.</para>
        <para id="ch0177s0008s0001p0008">Chloroquine is also active against<emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> trophozoites but is rarely used for this indication, as the nitro-5-imidazoles are the drugs of choice.</para>
        <para id="ch0177s0008s0001p0009"><emphasis role="strong">Adverse effects.</emphasis> Chloroquine has a bitter taste. It is generally well tolerated at the doses required for malaria prevention or treatment, even when taken for prolonged periods. However, it can lead to nausea, abdominal discomfort, dizziness, retinal pigmentation, blurred vision, electrocardiographic changes, muscular weakness, and rarely transient psychiatric symptoms. It can also cause severe pruritus, particularly in African Black individuals. Irreversible neuroretinitis can result if it is taken at high doses for prolonged periods. If an overdose is taken, it can cause shock, arrhythmia, and death.</para>
        <para id="ch0177s0008s0001p0010">At the doses used for malaria treatment or prophylaxis, chloroquine has rarely been reported to cause adverse congenital effects (pregnancy category C) (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0139">139</link>). However, affinity for melanin-containing tissues such as the retina, iris, and choroid of the eye has been reported, and definitive delineation of fetal risk remains undefined. It is commonly used for treatment and prophylaxis of malaria in pregnant women without evidence of teratogenicity, and it is generally agreed that the benefits of preventing and treating malaria in pregnant women outweigh the potential fetal risks. Chloroquine is excreted in breast milk in small amounts.</para>

It is &gt;95% protein bound and has a half-life of 2 to 4 weeks. Because of its long half-life, mefloquine is frequently used for prophylaxis of malaria as a once-weekly dose. However, when mefloquine is administered weekly, it requires about 8 weeks before steady-state drug levels are reached, so a loading dose is often recommended. Peak plasma concentrations occur at 6 to 24 h, and following a single dose of 500 mg or 1,000 mg orally, they are 430 and 800 μg/liter, respectively. In healthy volunteers, a dose of 250 mg once weekly produces maximum steady-state plasma concentrations of 1,000 to 2,000 μg/liter, which are reached after 7 to 10 weeks. It is highly lipophilic and widely distributed throughout the body, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier. Mefloquine is metabolized in the liver and excreted through the bile and feces.

      <para id="ch0177s0016p0002"><emphasis role="strong">Mechanism of action.</emphasis> Pentamidine is chemically related to guanidine. Its mechanism of action has not been clearly defined and may not be uniform against different organisms. It is possible that it inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and interferes with aerobic glycolysis in protozoa. It may also interfere with amino acid transport, precipitate nucleotides and nucleotide-containing coenzymes, and inhibit DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0213">213</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0177s0016p0003"><emphasis role="strong">Pharmacokinetics.</emphasis> Pentamidine is currently available as an isethionate salt. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. When used for protozoal infections, it is administered intramuscularly or intravenously, but it can be given via inhalation for prevention of <emphasis>Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis> pneumonia and via intralesional injection for cutaneous leishmaniasis (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0214">214</link>). Following intravenous administration of a 4-mg/kg dose, plasma concentrations of 0.3 to 1.4 mg/liter have been reported (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0215">215</link>). The highest concentrations of the drug are found in the kidney, liver, and spleen, and pentamidine penetrates poorly into the central nervous system. It has a short serum half-life of 6.5 to 9 h because it is rapidly and extensively taken up by tissues. Its extensive tissue binding results in prolonged excretion over a period of 6 to 8 weeks, and it is eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. Pentamidine should be used cautiously in the presence of renal or hepatic failure, but no dosage adjustment is recommended.</para>
      <para id="ch0177s0016p0004"><emphasis role="strong">Spectrum of activity.</emphasis> The antiparasitic indications for pentamidine include leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis, but its main use is as an antifungal agent for treatment and prophylaxis of <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> pneumonia. Despite leishmanicidal activity, pentamidine’s toxicity means that it is used predominantly in individuals intolerant of antimonial compounds, in disease that is refractory to other treatment, or in combination therapy. Pentamidine is also active against African trypanosomes, and it is first-line treatment in early disease, but its utility is restricted to trypanosomiasis without central nervous system involvement. Since central nervous system involvement occurs early with <emphasis>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</emphasis>, it is used more frequently for <emphasis>T. b. gam-biense</emphasis> infections. Pentamidine is also sometimes used in combination therapy for granulomatous amebic encephalitis caused by <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> and <emphasis>Neobalamuthia</emphasis> species.</para>
      <para id="ch0177s0016p0005"><emphasis role="strong">Adverse effects.</emphasis> Over half of parenteral pentamidine recipients experience some adverse effect from therapy. Administration is associated with a variety of reactions that appear to be unrelated to drug concentrations in plasma (<link linkend="ch0177s0022s0002li0213">213</link>). Immediate reactions include nausea, anorexia, dizziness, pruritus, and hypotension. Pentamidine can also produce local effects, including pain and necrosis at the site of injection. In addition, pentamidine administration is associated with hematologic effects, particularly leukopenia (up to 10% of recipients) and thrombocytopenia (~5% of recipients), as well as with electrolyte abnormalities, including hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia. Other severe adverse effects include ventricular arrhythmias, pancreatitis, hypo- or hyperglycemia, hepatotoxicity, and acute renal failure. Pentamidine has also been associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Finally, occasional seizures and hallucinations have been reported. There are minimal available safety data regarding the use of pentamidine in pregnancy or lactation, and it is therefore not recommended.</para>
