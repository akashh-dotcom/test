        <para id="ch0100s0001s0001p0002">This chapter was initiated after the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the late summer of 2020 and was written several years after another similar ASM publication (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0001">1</link>). The direction of this chapter was influenced after talking to people who were directly impacted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but seemed to describe that virus as a stealthy creature that planned its next move based on our reactions in science and medicine. Some key questions that general society has struggled with since late 2019 are, “What are viruses?”, “Where do viruses emerge from?”, and “How much havoc can viruses create in our health care systems and general societies?”. The answer is that although viruses are a diverse and complex group of living entities, their primary focus is to deliver genetic information into human hosts, where that genetic information can be replicated. Even in a modern society with vaccines, antivirals, and advanced medical systems, viruses are often misunderstood. This chapter focuses on the characterization, classification, and taxonomy of viruses that infect humans, both pathogens that infect humans alone and those that infect humans but may also infect other mammalian or nonmammalian genera and species.</para>

          <para id="ch0100s0001s0001s0001p0001">Taxonomy is defined as an approach to arranging viruses into related clusters, defining relatedness within and between clusters, and naming clusters or taxa (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0002">2</link>). Classification is defined as the process of determining characters, features, or variables that allow a virus to be placed into a taxonomic system. Characterization is defined as a more granular series of processes where specific characters (e.g., factors, features, or variables, as described below) are identified, further allowing a virus to be assigned within a structured taxonomy. Instead of considering exercises to establish taxonomy, characterization, and classification as a dry, remote academic exercise, these are activities that allow scientists to respond to newly emergent viruses with new diagnostics and therapies or preventive approaches (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0003">3</link>). Taxonomy prevents real-world confusion as it creates a common language and allows us to describe viral agents to each other. Very early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, taxonomy allowed scientists to describe a newly emerging virus as a betacoronavirus related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) as well as some seasonal beta coronaviruses.</para>

          <para id="ch0100s0001s0001s0002p0001">Due to their simple diversity, scientists often struggle with how to classify viruses and occasionally may even question if they belong in the tree of life as living organisms (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0004">4</link>). However, viruses exhibit some common attributes shared by other living organisms, including (i) maintenance of a structural organization, (ii) the ability of genomes and gene products to produce progeny genomes, (iii) the possession of self-regulation, and (iv) the ability to adapt and respond to changing environments (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0005">5</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0100s0001s0001s0002p0002">Of the two main theories on the origins of viruses, the first suggests that viruses may be remnants of cellular organisms that emerged from cellular hosts and evolved novel replication processes. The second theory suggests that viruses are older than cellular organisms, appearing some time before the emergence of the last universal cellular ancestor (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0006">6</link>). Regardless of how viruses originally emerged in this world, it is clear that once viruses emerge or re-emerge in a human population, they coevolve with us and other hosts and vectors (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0007">7</link>). As this chapter progresses and the taxonomic diversity of viruses is described, we should remember that all viruses interact with humans through a reductionist commonality: they are all relatively simple genetic information delivery systems for introduction into and replication within our cells (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0008">8</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0100s0001s0001s0003p0001">Viruses are classified or assigned taxa using variables, descriptors, and/or characters (e.g., isolation details, morphology, and physical properties). Molecular characteristics such as nucleic and/or protein sequence homology, genome organization, and replication strategies play an important role in this characterization. For example, the family<emphasis>Polyomaviridae</emphasis> can be characterized as nonenveloped small viruses that have circular double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA genomes) (<anchor id="ch0100s0001s0001s0003a0003"/><link linkend="ch0100s0001s0001s0003a0004">Table 1</link>). <emphasis>Polyomaviridae</emphasis> nucleic acid replication is bidirectional from a unique origin, while protein translation involves early and late transcripts, alternative splicing, and alternative open reading frames (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0009">9</link>). On a more reductionist level, molecular phylogenetics investigates evolutionary relationships by comparing molecular (e.g., nucleic acid or protein) sequences and allows comparison of molecular sequences and inferences of relatedness even in the absence of an animal infection model, a virus culture system, or substantial clinical information (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0010">10</link>). These approaches are more thoroughly discussed in other chapters but may involve different approaches that may or may not rely on direct sequence alignment (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0011">11</link>–<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0013">13</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0100s0001s0001s0003p0002">The genetic information encoded by viruses is stored, packaged, and delivered through a variety of approaches. This diversity of approaches may provide support for the theory that viruses are polyphyletic (i.e., they have originated from multiple emergence events) and continue to develop along multiple evolutionary pathways. This diversity in how viruses encode their genetic information is described in greater detail in<anchor id="ch0100s0001s0001s0003a0005"/><link linkend="ch0100s0001s0001s0003a0013">Fig. 1</link> and <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0001s0003a0004">Tables 1</link> to <anchor id="ch0100s0001s0001s0003a0006"/><link linkend="ch0100s0001s0001s0006a0006">7</link>.

          <para id="ch0100s0001s0001s0003p0003">While other forms of life encode genetic information within double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), viruses encode their genetic information within genomes that may be composed of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), dsRNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA. Virus genomes can also exist in a variety of different topologies, including linear, circular, single segment, or multiple segments, with each architectural form of the viral genome having its own evolutionary benefits and drawbacks (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0015">15</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0100s0001s0001s0003p0004">The composition of these genomes impacts the substitution and mutation rates associated with viral evolution. For example, ssRNA viruses generally have the highest mutation rates, followed by retrotranscribing viruses, ssDNA viruses, and dsDNA viruses. These trends in mutation rates cannot be overgeneralized; when substitution rates are expressed as substitutions/site/year, there may be considerable rate variation among RNA viruses (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0016">16</link>) as well as an overlap in substitution rates between ssRNA and ssDNA viruses (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0017">17</link>). In the natural world, variables that can affect virus genome substitution and or mutation include genomic architecture, replication speed, viral enzymes, host enzymes, and environmental effects such as generation time, transmission, and selection (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0017">17</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0100s0001s0001s0003p0005">We can understand the variety of factors impacting a virus genome by using the example of the hepatitis B virus DNA genome. This genome has a relatively low level of mutations compared to other reverse-transcribing viruses while having a mutation rate higher than that of other DNA viruses. Factors proposed to impact the mutation rate of the hepatitis B virus DNA genome include a reverse transcription step, multiple open reading frames (ORFs) that overlap, a reverse transcription (RT) step, and a stable covalently closed circular DNA reservoir. Hepatitis B virus genotype as well as transmission bottlenecks and the length of the infectious process (i.e., chronic versus acute) can all impact the mutation rates of hepatitis B virus (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0018">18</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0100s0001s0001s0004p0001">Molecular classification may be impacted by the molecular target chosen to define taxa, whether it be amino acids sequenced, genes sequenced, core genome, or hypervariable regions of a genome. For example, classification by nucleotide sequences may be biased with saturated substitutions; however, these may be controlled for by using Bayesian methods or maximum-likelihood methods or by analyzing aligned amino acid sequences (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0019">19</link>). Use of amino acid analysis alone does not consider noncoding regions, which may be useful in identifying genetic heterogeneity (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0020">20</link>). A shift away from the use of partial sequences to classify viruses is expected as barriers to full genome sequencing and managing bioinformatics are reduced (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0021">21</link>).

Whole-genome sequencing can be used to identify recombination events within a species (e.g., herpes simplex virus 1 [HSV-1] [<emphasis>Human alphaherpesvirus 1</emphasis>]) as well as recombination events between species (HSV-1 to HSV-2 [<emphasis>Human alphaherpesvirus 1</emphasis> to <emphasis>Human alphaherpesvirus 2</emphasis>]) (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0028">28</link>). Next-generation sequencing approaches are expected to play an increasing role in the taxonomic classification of viruses as access to the technology improves (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0029">29</link>) and bioinformatics bottlenecks are eliminated (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0030">30</link>–<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0032">32</link>). In 2016, an International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) workshop titled “Metagenomic Sequencing and Its Impact on Virus Classification” was held. The workshop led to the creation of a consensus document, “Virus Taxonomy in the Age of Metagenomics” (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0034">34</link>), which proposed that metagenomic approaches could be used to infer biological properties, which could then be combined with sequence relatedness data and any other biological information. Potential barriers to this approach include mixed virus populations in specimens, mapping of sequences from multipartite/segmented genomes, and virus-derived sequences already integrated into host genomes (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0033">33</link>). However, solutions to barriers are developing quickly and may include deep learning approaches to identify viral sequences (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0035">35</link>), and new classification approaches to manage metagenomic data and support taxonomic characterization (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0036">36</link>).</para>

The Baltimore classification, a nonhierarchical approach, categorizes viruses into seven groups and is based on the genome present in virions and type of replication (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0038">38</link>). The groupings are as follows: group I, double-stranded DNA viruses; group II, single-stranded DNA viruses; group III, double-stranded RNA viruses; group IV, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; group V, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; group VI, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses replicating through a DNA intermediate; and group VII, double-stranded DNA viruses replicating through a single-stranded RNA intermediate (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0039">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0040">40</link>).

As climate change occurs and viral vector (e.g., arthropod) distribution also shifts, we may learn lessons from other systems such as the Holmes classification, an early hierarchical classification approach from the 1940s for insect viruses. That method classified viruses on the basis of the host insect population, the nature of inclusions (or lack thereof) within insect cells, morphology, and disease processes (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0043">43</link>). The Lwoff, Horne, and Tournier (LHT) system, which describes viral physical characteristics (e.g., presence or absence of a membrane envelope) (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0044">44</link>), can provide a basic practical framework for planning to disinfect a health care setting surface or considering how to pathogen-reduce a blood product.</para>

          <para id="ch0100s0001s0001s0006p0001">The ICTV was created for four main purposes: (i) the development of agreed-upon taxonomy for viruses, (ii) the development of agreed-upon names for virus taxa, (iii) communication of taxonomic decisions to the international virology community, and (iv) maintenance of an index of agreed-upon names for virus taxa (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0045">45</link>). Since 1971, nine reports have been released by the ICTV as printed books. Historically, this group decided to use species to classify viruses along with genus and family and set about to create working groups to develop plans to demark these species within a hierarchy. The ninth report identified six orders, 87 families, 19 subfamilies, 349 genera, and 2,284 virus and viroid species. However, the tenth report (an online report) created 15 hierarchical ranks with the intent of creating a system that “that closely aligns with the Linnaean taxonomic system” (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0046">46</link>). The ranks, from higher to lower, were as follows: realm &gt; subrealm &gt; kingdom &gt; phylum &gt; subphylum &gt; class &gt; subclass &gt; order &gt; suborder &gt; family &gt; subspecies &gt; genus &gt; subgenus &gt; species (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0046">46</link>). As with the ninth report, there was no formal classification of viruses below the species rank, although discussion about classification below the species level does occur (e.g., hepatitis E virus, described later in the chapter) (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0048">48</link>). The updated species master list is available at the ICTV website (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0049">49</link>), and within that master list, the ICTV suggested that there are 4 realms, 9 kingdoms, 16 phyla, 2 subphyla, 36 classes, 55 orders, 8 suborders, 168 families, 103 subfamilies, 1,421 genera, 68 subgenera, and 6,590 species (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0049">49</link>, <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0050">50</link>).

This classification excludes herpes simplex hepatitis (1F00) and does not include “viral hepatitis complicating pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium” (JB63.4) or “Congenital viral hepatitis” (KA62.9).

Currently, the assignment of a new genetic sequence to a genotype is based on comparisons of ORF-1 and ORF-2 amino acid sequences (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0093">93</link>, <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0094">94</link>). The assignment of new HEV sequences to a genotype can be hampered by a lack of agreement on subtype reference sequences and a lack of consistent criteria for determining intra- and intersubtype distances. To allow the comparison of results between epidemiologic and clinical case studies and to reduce the risk of HEV misclassification, the ICTV has proposed a standard reference set of complete genome sequences (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0048">48</link>).</para>

Traditionally, antigenic properties have been used to divide the mammarenaviruses into either New World mammarenaviruses (e.g., Tacaribe serocomplex [Americas]) or Old World mammarenaviruses (e.g., the Lassa-lymphocytic choriomeningitis serocomplex [Africa]). Further division of the New World mammarenaviruses uses nucleoprotein (NP) sequences to create clades A, B, and C (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0097">97</link>–<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0099">99</link>). More recently, genus demarcation was based on pairwise sequence comparisons (PASC) of coding-complete genomes including sequences within S segments and large (L) segments, or when a complete genomic sequence for the S segment is available with a cultured isolate and phenotypic information (architecture and antigenicity) is available (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0100">100</link>, <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0101">101</link>).

Prior to 2010, serotyping was used to distinguish five serotypes of human astroviruses, with further work identifying eight human astrovirus serotypes (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0103">103</link>). By 2010, an approved proposal from the ICTV <emphasis>Astroviridae</emphasis> Study Group classified mamastroviruses based on the complete amino acid sequence of the ORF2 genome region encoding the viral capsid (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0104">104</link>). As shown in <link linkend="ch0100s0001s0001s0004a0004">Table 4</link>, the classic eight serotypes of human astroviruses are situated within the species <emphasis>Mamastrovirus 1.</emphasis> A novel group of astroviruses (MLB 1 to 3) were classified within <emphasis>Mamastrovirus 6.</emphasis> Yet another group of novel astroviruses (HMO [<emphasis role="underline">h</emphasis>uman, <emphasis role="underline">m</emphasis>ink, and <emphasis role="underline">o</emphasis>vine-like astroviruses]) were classified into <emphasis>Mamastrovirus 8</emphasis> and <emphasis>Mamastrovirus 9</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0100s0001s0005s0002li0103">103</link>).

          <para id="ch0100s0001s0005s0001p0001">Viruses are a complex group of organisms that have diverse origin stories and face multiple unique evolutionary pressures. Their interaction with humans during the infection process leads to various host and pathogen outcomes, which also impact how viruses evolve over time. Our use of constructs such as characterization, classification, and viral taxonomy allow us to assess the risks that viruses pose to humans, enable us to respond quickly to emerging pathogens, and ensure that we have a common language for the sharing and integration of newly acquired knowledge. As a result, not only can new and emergent viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 find a place in the “tree of life” relatively quickly, but also, researchers may be able to move quickly to use preexisting knowledge generated from work on other viral relatives to assess risks of human-to-human transmission, understand potential patient outcomes, and create new diagnostic assays or vaccines. Since 2019, there have been significant changes in the field of viral taxonomy with the creation of new taxonomic classifications (e.g., realms), changes in names of genera, and the reassignment of commonly named viruses into new formal species. Although these changes can be confusing, they represent the rapid pace of change in medical virology brought on by new genetic sequencing approaches, approaches to bioinformatics, new phylogenetic approaches, and insights by the researchers working on these agents. Over time, we can expect taxonomic resources to change and become more complex as they move online and are edited in a more real-time manner. We should expect to see more vibrant discussion on the taxonomy of viruses as our knowledge of these agents grows exponentially over the next decade.</para>
