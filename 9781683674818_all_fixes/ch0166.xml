Only one species of <emphasis>Naegleria</emphasis> (<emphasis>Naegleria fowleri</emphasis>), several species of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> (e.g., <emphasis>Acanthamoeba castellanii, A. culbertsoni, A. hatchetti, A. healyi, A. polyphaga, A. rhysodes, A. astronyxis, A. lenticulata</emphasis>, and <emphasis>A. divionensis</emphasis>), and the only known species of <emphasis>Balamuthia, Balamuthia mandrillaris</emphasis>, are known to cause central nervous system (CNS) disease (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0166s000000li0002">2</link>). <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> spp. also cause infection of the human cornea, <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> keratitis (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0003">3</link>). Further, both <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>B. mandrillaris</emphasis> have been identified as agents of cutaneous infections in humans (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0004">4</link>). There have also been single case reports of human disease caused by <emphasis>Sappinia pedata</emphasis> and <emphasis>Paravahlkampfia francinae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0005">5</link>–<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0007">7</link>).</para>
      <para role="CHAP-TXT-F ParaOverride-1">The concept that these free-living amebae may occur as human pathogens was proposed by Culbertson and colleagues, who isolated<emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> sp. strain A-1 (now designated <emphasis>A. culbertsoni</emphasis>) from tissue culture medium thought to contain an unknown virus (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0008">8</link>). They also demonstrated the presence of amebae in brain lesions of mice and monkeys that died within a week after intracerebral inoculation with <emphasis>A. culbertsoni.</emphasis> Culbertson et al. hypothesized that similar infections might exist in nature in humans. In 1965, Fowler and Carter were the first to describe a fatal infection due to free-living amebae (<emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis>) in the brain of an Australian patient (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0009">9</link>). In 1990, Visvesvara et al. described a fatal brain infection in a mandrill caused by a free-living ameba (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0010">10</link>). It was eventually named <emphasis>Balamuthia mandrillaris</emphasis> since it was first detected in a mandrill (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0011">11</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0166s000000p0003">Previously, classical taxonomic classification was based largely on morphologic, ecologic, and physiologic criteria. According to this system,<emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> and <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis>, along with a heterogeneous group of amebae that include both free-living (e.g., <emphasis>Hartmannella, Vahlkampfia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Vannella</emphasis>) and parasitic (e.g., <emphasis>Entamoeba</emphasis>) amebae, were classified in the phylum Protozoa, subphylum Sarcodina, superclass Rhizopodea, class Lobosea, and order Amoebida. <emphasis>Naegleria</emphasis> was classified in the class Heterolobosea, order Schizopyrenida, and family Vahlkampfiidae. <emphasis>Sappinia</emphasis> was classified in the class Amoebozoa: Lobosea, order Euamoebida, and family Thecamoebidae. Recent information based on modern morphological approaches, biochemical pathways, and molecular phylogenetics has led to the abandonment of the older hierarchical systems consisting of the traditional taxa “kingdom,” “phylum,” “class,” “subclass,” “superorder,” and “order” and replacement with a new classification system. According to this new schema, these eukaryotes have been classified into six clusters or “supergroups,” namely, Amoebozoa, Opisthokonta, Rhizaria, Archaeplastida, Chromalveolata, and Excavata. <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> and <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> are included in the supergroup Amoebozoa: Acanthamoebidae; <emphasis>Sappinia</emphasis> is included in the supergroup Amoebozoa: Flabellinea: Thecamoebidae; and <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> is included in the supergroup Excavata: Heterolobosea: Vahlkampfiidae (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0012">12</link>). The classification of amebae presented here is supported by the International Society of Protistologists. However, other classification schemes may also be used.

The trophozoite measures 15 to 45 μm in length and produces from the surface of its body fine, tapering, hyaline projections called acanthopodia (see <anchor id="ch0166s000000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0166s000000a0008">Fig. 5</link>).

It feeds on <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis> or other Gram-negative bacteria and divides by binary fission. During cell division, the nucleus divides by conventional mitosis, in which the nucleolus and the nuclear membrane disappear. It has no flagellate stage, but produces a double-walled cyst (10 to 25 μm) (see <anchor id="ch0166s000000a0006"/><link linkend="ch0166s000000a0009">Fig. 6</link>) with a wrinkled outer wall (the ectocyst) and a stellate, polygonal, or even round inner wall (the endocyst) (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0013">13</link>).

      <para id="ch0166s000000p0005">Historically, the genus<emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> was divided into three groups based on size and morphology. Because such morphological characteristics can change with environmental pressures and culture conditions, sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA gene is now used for the classification and diagnosis of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> infection, since it is present in multiple copies and is evolutionarily stable. In the case of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis>, a substantial sequence variation was seen not only between the species but also within the same species, identified based on morphological features. <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> is classified into up to 22 genotypes known as T1 to T22 (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0015">15</link>–<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0019">19</link>). The main advantage of this genotyping system is that, unlike species identification, it does not rely on the intact morphology of the <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> strain. Therefore, this genotyping can be applied in cases where ameba morphology could not be preserved and the species cannot be ascertained.</para>

      <para id="ch0166s000000p0006"><emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> has three stages in its natural life cycle: a trophozoite, a flagellate, and a cyst. The trophozoite is a small ameba with an elongated shape measuring 10 to 25 μm long that exhibits an eruptive locomotion by producing smooth hemispherical bulges. The posterior end, termed the uroid, appears to be sticky and often has several trailing filaments. It is uninucleate and is characterized by a centrally located, large, dense nucleolus. It feeds on <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> or other Gram-negative bacteria and divides by binary fission. During cell division, the nucleus divides by promitosis (which is a primitive intranuclear mitosis, i.e., mitosis that occurs within the nuclear membrane). In this process, the nucleolus elongates and divides into two polar bodies, but the nuclear membrane persists. Eventually, the nuclear membrane splits to encompass the two separate polar bodies. During its life cycle, this ameba produces a transient pear-shaped biflagellate stage (resulting from altered environmental conditions) and smooth-walled cysts (<anchor id="ch0166s000000a0012"/><link linkend="ch0166s000000a0007">Fig. 1</link> to 4). Cysts are usually spherical and measure 7 to 15 μm, and the cyst wall may have one or more pores plugged with a mucoid material (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0001">1</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0166s000000p0007"><emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> has two stages in its natural life cycle: a cyst and a trophozoite. <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> trophozoites are in general irregular in shape; a few, however, may be elongated. They are uninucleate, but binucleate forms may occasionally be seen. The nucleus has a large, centrally located nucleolus. Nuclear division in <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> occurs when the nuclear membrane breaks down and the nucleolus disintegrates and eventually disappears. Occasionally, the nucleus of <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis>, especially in tissue sections, may have more than one nucleolus. Unlike <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. fowleri, Balamuthia</emphasis> is not known to feed on bacteria. In the laboratory, it feeds on mammalian tissue culture cells, such as monkey kidney cells, human lung fibroblasts, and human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Actively feeding amebae may be 12 to 60 μm long, with a mean length of 30 μm (<link linkend="ch0166s000000a0009">Fig. 7</link>). The trophic forms, either in axenic condition (i.e., in the absence of other living organisms) or while feeding on tissue culture cells, produce broad pseudopodia without any clearly discernible movement. However, when tissue culture cells are destroyed, the trophozoites resort to a spider-like walking movement by producing finger-like determinate pseudopodia which extend to a defined length, then retract without flowing the entire content of the ameboid cell (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0011">11</link>). Like <emphasis>Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia</emphasis> does not have a flagellate stage. Cysts are generally uninucleate and spherical and measure 6 to 30 μm in diameter (<link linkend="ch0166s000000a0009">Fig. 8</link>). Under a light microscope, each cyst appears to have an irregular and slightly wavy outer wall and a round inner wall. A layer of refractile granules immediately below the inner cyst wall is often seen in mature cysts; however, this feature should not be used to definitively distinguish <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> from <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> spp. Under an electron microscope, the cyst wall can be seen to consist of three walls: a thin, irregular outer ectocyst; a thick, electron-dense inner endocyst; and a middle amorphous layer, the mesocyst (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0166s000000li0011">11</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0166s000000p0008">Infection with<emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> was first described in 1965 in Australia and has now been identified in most parts of the world. In the United States, primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) cases have been retrospectively identified as far back as 1931. From 1962 to 2020, 151 cases of PAM were reported in the United States, with a range of 0 to 8 cases annually (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0020">20</link>). Generally, PAM mainly affects young males who swim, dive, or jump in warm freshwater (e.g., lakes and rivers) in the summer, when the water temperature is elevated, especially in the southern tier of the United States. The risk for infection might be reduced if appropriate measures to reduce the amount of water going up the nose are taken, such as holding the nose shut or using nose clips or avoiding water sports in freshwater lakes and other bodies of water (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0021">21</link>). Recent occurrences of PAM in more northern states, such as Minnesota (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0022">22</link>), Kansas, Indiana, and Maryland, indicate that the geographic range of <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> infections is changing. It has been postulated that higher ambient water temperatures due to climate change might be responsible for the increasing geographic range of <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> infections (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0023">23</link>). PAM cases have also been associated with the use of tap water for nasal and sinus irrigation (for both ritual and medical purposes) and recreation (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0024">24</link>–<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0027">27</link>). <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> prevention measures for nasal rinsing include using boiled, sterile, or filtered water.</para>

According to one report, Hispanic Americans have a higher incidence of <emphasis>B. mandrillaris</emphasis> infection than other race/ethnicity groups.

Several species of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> have also been isolated from brackish water and seawater and from ear discharges, pulmonary secretions, nasopharyngeal mucosa samples, maxillary sinus samples, mandibular autografts, and stool samples. These amebae normally feed on bacteria and multiply in their environmental niche as free-living organisms. <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> spp. have also been known to harbor <emphasis>Legionella</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Mycobacterium avium</emphasis>, and other bacterial pathogens, such as <emphasis>Listeria monocytogenes, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Vibrio cholerae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> serotype O157, which signifies a potential expansion of the public health importance of these organisms (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0166s000000li0038">38</link>).

      <para id="ch0166s000000p0013">In 1966, Butt (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0048">48</link>) described the first case of CNS infection caused by <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> in the United States and coined the term “primary amebic meningoencephalitis.” PAM is an acute fulminating disease with an abrupt onset that occurs generally in previously healthy children and young adults who had nasal exposure to freshwater a median of 5 days (range, 1 to 9 days) before the onset of symptoms (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0049">49</link>). It is characterized by signs and symptoms of meningitis such as headache, fever, stiff neck, and photophobia, with rapid progression to encephalitis and coma, leading to death within an average of 5.3 days (range, 1 to 18 days) after the onset of symptoms (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0049">49</link>). The portal of entry of <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> amebae is the nasal passages. When water containing <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> enters the nose, the amebae make their way into the olfactory lobes via the cribriform plate and cause acute hemorrhagic necrosis, leading to destruction of the olfactory bulbs and the cerebral cortex. Only a few patients have survived. To date, there have been four well-documented survivors in the United States, with three of the four making a full neurologic recovery (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0050">50</link>). On autopsy, large numbers of amebic trophozoites, many with ingested erythrocytes and brain tissue, are usually seen interspersed with brain tissue (<anchor id="ch0166s000000a0019"/><link linkend="ch0166s000000a0025">Fig. 9</link>). It is believed that <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> directly ingests brain tissue by producing food cups, or amebostomes, as well as by exerting contact-dependent cytolysis, possibly mediated by a multicomponent system consisting of a heat-stable hemolytic protein, a heat-labile cytolysin, and/or phospholipase enzymes (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0051">51</link>). Cysts of <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> are not usually seen in brain tissue. It was thought that <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> infects only humans until 1997, when a report of the first case of PAM causing death in a South American tapir was published, indicating that PAM can occur in animals other than humans (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0052">52</link>).

      <para id="ch0166s000000p0014">Several species of<emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> have been known to cause granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE). This is characterized by headache, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, seizures, and sometimes hemiparesis. Cerebral hemispheres are usually the most heavily affected CNS tissue. They are often edematous, with extensive hemorrhagic necrosis involving the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Amebic trophozoites and cysts are usually scattered throughout the tissue. Many blood vessels are thrombotic and exhibit fibrinoid necrosis; they are also surrounded by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, amebic trophozoites, and cysts (<anchor id="ch0166s000000a0032"/><link linkend="ch0166s000000a0026">Fig. 10</link>). Despite the name, granulomas are often not seen in the typical immunocompromised patient with <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> encephalitis. Multinucleated giant cells forming granulomas may be seen in immunocompetent patients. Some patients develop ulcerative skin lesions, abscesses, or erythematous nodules (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0055">55</link>). Other manifestations of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> infection include rhinosinusitis, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0166s000000li0055">55</link>, <link linkend="ch0166s000000li0056">56</link>). It is believed that the route of invasion of and penetration into the CNS is hematogenous, probably from a primary focus in the lower respiratory tract or the skin (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0001">1</link>). <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> spp. also cause infections of the CNS of animals other than humans.

Hence, it is difficult to differentiate <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> from <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> spp. in tissue sections under a light microscope. In some cases, <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> trophozoites in tissue sections appear to have more than one nucleolus in the nucleus (<link linkend="ch0166s000000a0027">Fig. 11</link>). In such cases, it may be possible to distinguish <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> amebae from <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> organisms on the basis of nuclear morphology, since <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> trophozoites have only one nucleolus. In most cases, immunohistochemical techniques, molecular testing, or both are necessary to identify <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> organisms. <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> amebae are antigenically distinct from <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> organisms; they can easily be distinguished by immunofluorescence or other immunochemical assays (<anchor id="ch0166s000000a0035"/><link linkend="ch0166s000000a0028">Fig. 12</link>) (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0166s000000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0166s000000li0057">57</link>).

      <para id="ch0166s000000p0017">The first case of<emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> keratitis in the United States was reported in 1973 in a south Texas rancher with a history of trauma to his right eye (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0063">63</link>). Both the trophozoite and cyst stages of <emphasis>A. polyphaga</emphasis> were demonstrated to be present in corneal sections and were repeatedly cultured from corneal scrapings and biopsy specimens. Between 1973 and July 1986, 208 cases were diagnosed and reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0064">64</link>). The number of cases increased gradually between 1973 and 1984, and a dramatic increase began in 1985. A case-control study conducted in 1985–1986 (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0064">64</link>) revealed that a major risk factor was the use of contact lenses, predominantly daily-wear or extended-wear soft lenses, and that patients with <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> keratitis were significantly more likely than controls to use homemade saline solution instead of commercially prepared saline (78 and 30%, respectively), to disinfect their lenses less frequently than recommended by the lens manufacturers (72 and 32%), and to wear their lenses while swimming (63 and 30%). Based on a case-control study conducted by the CDC to investigate an increase in <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> keratitis cases during 2004 to 2007, it was revealed that a national increase in the number of such cases was associated with the use of a specific multipurpose contact lens solution (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0065">65</link>). Further, another study revealed that most contact lens solutions marketed in the United States do not have sufficient disinfection activity against <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0066">66</link>). More recent case-control studies of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> keratitis have shown that poor contact lens hygiene habits, such as “topping off” disinfecting solution in the case, sleeping in contact lenses, and storing lenses in water, are associated with infection (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0067">67</link>, <link linkend="ch0166s000000li0068">68</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0166s000000p0019">Since no distinctive clinical features differentiate PAM from pyogenic or bacterial meningitis, direct examination of the sample as a wet mount preparation is often useful in the preliminary diagnosis of PAM. In PAM, the CSF is usually pleocytotic, with a preponderance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no bacteria. The CSF pressure may be elevated. The CSF glucose level may be normal or slightly reduced, but the CSF protein level is increased. Microscopic detection of amebic organisms in the CSF is the quickest means of making a preliminary diagnosis of PAM. CSF should be examined microscopically by an expert pathologist or microbiologist for the presence of<emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> amebae with directional movement. Microscopic detection of <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> amebae should be confirmed by a species-specific molecular assay such as PCR. Since the amebae tend to attach to the surface of the container, the container should be shaken gently; then, a small drop of fluid should be placed on a clean microscope slide and covered with a number 1 coverslip. The CSF may have to be centrifuged at 500 × <emphasis>g</emphasis> for 5 min to concentrate the amebae. After the specimen has been centrifuged, most of the supernatant is carefully aspirated and the sediment is gently suspended in the remaining fluid. A drop of this suspension is prepared as described above for microscopic observation. Giemsa or trichrome staining should be performed on CSF smears to visualize the nuclear morphology of the amebae in order to eliminate false-positive results due to any sluggish movement seen with host macrophages. The slide preparation should be examined under a compound microscope with 10× and 40× lens objectives. Phase-contrast optics is preferable. If regular bright-field illumination is used, the slide should be examined under diminished light. The slide may be warmed to 35°C (to promote amebic movement), and amebae, especially <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis>, if present, can be detected by their active directional movements. Rarely, flagellates with two flagella may be seen.</para>

This will allow any amebae to attach to the surface of the slide. Several drops of warm (37°C) Schaudinn’s fixative are dropped directly onto the sample, then allowed to stand for 1 min. The slide is then transferred for 1 h to a Coplin jar containing the fixative. It may be stained with Wheatley’s trichrome or Heidenhain’s iron hematoxylin stain. Corneal scrapings smeared onto microscope slides may be fixed with methanol and stained with Hemacolor stain (Harleco, EM Industries, Inc.) (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0166s000000li0070">70</link>). CSF can also be processed via cytospinning whenever possible and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain. If amebae are suspected or seen, CSF should be promptly tested by a molecular assay such as real-time PCR for confirmation, and the result should be reported to the clinician immediately so that the patient can be treated appropriately. This is especially important in the case of PAM caused by <emphasis>N. fowleri.</emphasis> Gram staining is not useful in the detection of amebae, as it will also stain host cells. For example, a false-positive Gram stain may lead to inaccurate diagnosis and hence to inappropriate therapy. A recent report suggests the possibility of extra-CNS dissemination of <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis>, and therefore, the organism might pose a risk of transmission of PAM via organ transplantation (<link linkend="ch0166s000000li0071">71</link>).

Identify your regional, national, or designated laboratory for such testing. An agar plate inoculated with patient CSF should be microscopically examined every day for the presence of amebae. If amebae are seen, an area with amebae should be scraped and inoculated into ~1 ml of distilled water and incubated at 37°C and examined every 10 min for 1 h. If flagellates are seen, the clinician should be informed that the CSF is positive for <emphasis>Naegleria</emphasis> (possibly <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis>) amebae. If no flagellates are seen, even after 2 h, then the amebae should be examined under high magnification (×400) for the presence of fine thorn-like processes (acanthopodia). The clinician should then be informed of the presence of amebae, probably <emphasis>Acanthamoeba.</emphasis> Wet-mount preparations should always be confirmed with permanently stained smears (trichrome, hematoxylin, or Giemsa-Wright). If other techniques, such as real-time PCR, are available, then the identity of the amebae should be confirmed. Since many clinical laboratories do not have the necessary expertise and/or equipment, they usually send the specimens to an outside laboratory like the CDC for identification and interpretation. Rapid, simple, and species-specific point-of-care diagnostic tools are needed that can be implemented in hospital or resource-limited settings. The CDC also offers web-based rapid evaluation of digital images of specimens for expedited review and consultation through a telediagnostic service known as Laboratory Identification of Parasitic Diseases of Public Health Concern (DPDx), which is available for both domestic and international inquiries. DPDx is a rapid means of obtaining a probable diagnosis from tissue sections or wet mounts of CSF and tissue. A molecular diagnosis is often needed with CSF or tissue specimens when the species-specific morphological features cannot be extracted from the digital images. Also, antimicrobial testing is currently not available in clinical laboratories and is only occasionally performed at CDC for research purposes. Antimicrobial testing is not routinely recommended for clinical isolates. Further, it is well known, at least for these free-living amebae, that what works <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> may not always work <emphasis>in vivo.</emphasis> For example, fluconazole has no activity <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> against <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> but is one of the drugs of choice for treatment. Several patients have survived after receiving fluconazole given along with other drugs; this approach may represent synergistic activities.</para>
