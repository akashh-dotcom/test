      <para id="ch0102s0001p0002">In 1913, vaccinia virus was first propagated in cell culture for the purpose of vaccine production (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0001">1</link>). However, the potential role of cell culture for clinical diagnostics was not highlighted until 1949, when Enders et al. (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0002">2</link>) first described the use of cultivated mammalian cells and the observation of cytopathic effect (CPE) for the detection of polioviruses. Today, living cells are used to support the growth of a number of cell-dependent organisms, including viruses and certain intracellular bacteria such as <emphasis>Chlamydia</emphasis> spp. In addition, cultured cells can be used to demonstrate the effects of bacterial toxins excreted from pathogens such as <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp., toxigenic <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>, including O157:H7, and toxigenic <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Clostridium difficile</emphasis>), among others. Traditional tube cell culture and rapid cell culture methods (e.g., shell vial) are dependent on the interactions of viruses with a variety of animal, human, and/or insect cells and are utilized in the laboratory setting as substrates for growth, identification, and enumeration of pathogenic viruses (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0004">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0102s0001p0003">In the era of molecular detection and quantification of viral pathogens, the applicability of viral isolation has been questioned. For many viruses, it is well documented that molecular detection methods are preferred due to their (i) increased sensitivity, (ii) reduced turnaround time (i.e., hours versus days to weeks), (iii) capabilities for quantification, and (iv) reduced safety risk to laboratory personnel compared to viral culture in the event of a highly pathogenic virus (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], Ebola virus, or avian influenza virus) being present. However, cell culture methods have useful applications (i) when the potential viral agent is not known, (ii) when the cost of other methods of testing is significantly greater than that of cell culture, (iii) for documentation of active infection, (iv) to perform antiviral susceptibility testing, (v) for serologic strain typing, and (vi) for vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials. For these reasons, cell cultures are still an important research and clinical laboratory tool, particularly when combined with the use of highly specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the detection of common viruses and<emphasis>Chlamydia</emphasis> spp. or when cell lines are engineered to produce virus-induced enzymes (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0005">5</link>), such as β-galactosidase for the detection of herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0006">6</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0102s0001p0004">This chapter describes the cell lines, reagents, stains, and media used in association with traditional tube and rapid viral culture techniques. Included are examples of both well-characterized and emerging viruses that may be encountered in working with viral culture.

      <para id="ch0102s0008p0001">Several different combinations of antibiotics and amphotericin B are added to transport media, particularly for pretreatment of specimens (e.g., stool) prior to culture inoculation, or are used in refeed medium to reduce both bacterial and fungal contamination. Commercial media containing the appropriate strength of antibiotics and amphotericin B can be purchased. Alternatively, a 10× gentamicin-amphotericin B solution can be added by the laboratory at a ratio of 1:10 (0.1 ml of 10× gentamicin-amphotericin B to every 1.0 ml of specimen). Notably, the effectiveness of antibiotics intended to limit bacterial or fungal contamination of viral culture media may be impacted by the level of antimicrobial resistance patterns within a given community. Laboratories may observe an increase in viral culture contamination, as bacteria and yeast present in patient specimens become resistant. Nonetheless, good quality control (QC) measures necessitate the addition of antimicrobials in transport media. Following receipt by the laboratory of the transport medium containing a specimen, centrifugation may be helpful to reduce cellular artifact overlays or bacterial or fungal contaminants; however, this is not always required. The specimen supernatant is inoculated onto the appropriate cell line(s).</para>

Results are available within 15 to 60 min. Additionally, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) testing is used for confirmation of viruses isolated in cell culture and for blind staining in centrifugation-enhanced virus isolation methods (discussed below).

Culture cells are provided in several ready-to-use formats, including traditional 16-by-125-mm glass round-bottom screw-cap tubes, 1-dram vials (shell vials), flasks, or cluster trays. Ready-to-use cell cultures have a shelf life that is defined by the manufacturer in days or weeks, depending on the cell line or intended pathogen to be recovered. Some cells are also supplied frozen in shell vials and may be stored for months or years at ≤–70°C, ready to use with a simple thaw step and change of medium. Other frozen cells are supplied in cryovials and other containers at a stated density and require the laboratory to subculture them to obtain monolayers in a flask, multiwell plate, shell vial, or tube, depending on the end application (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0009">9</link>).

<anchor id="ch0102s0010s0002a0012"/>For laboratories that require special cells not readily available from commercial sources, specific cell types can sometimes be obtained from research laboratories or the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and then propagated within the user laboratory. Once the cells are received, the laboratory must confirm sterility, the absence of mycoplasmas and other contaminants, and the appropriate passage or cell duplication number necessary to ensure sensitivity for viral or chlamydial isolation. Cell cultures must be maintained in an environment that allows appropriate cellular replication and proper utility for the tests desired (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0010">10</link>). Several references offer detailed procedures for growing cells from frozen or fresh flasks (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0008">8</link>); such procedures are not addressed in this chapter.

      <para id="ch0102s0011p0001">The common culturable human viral pathogens causing significant infections are readily detected by using a variety of cell types, including the established cell lines listed in<anchor id="ch0102s0011a0003"/><link linkend="ch0102s0012a0005">Table 2</link>. Cell lines may be primary (e.g., rhesus monkey kidney and rabbit kidney), used for one or two passages; diploid (e.g., human embryonic lung), used for 20 to 50 passages; or heteroploid (e.g., human epidermoid lung carcinoma), which can be passaged indefinitely. The laboratory must maintain sufficient cell types and incubate cell cultures for an optimal length of time and under the appropriate conditions that permit the recovery of the potential range of detectable viruses for all specimen types processed by the laboratory (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0012">12</link>). Cell culture systems can be variable and are susceptible to conditions that can adversely affect results, including cell culture source and lineage, age, and condition of the monolayer, number of passages, shipping conditions, and the presence of contaminating agents. For example, in 2012, cultures of rhesus monkey kidney cells distributed to clinical laboratories throughout the United States were found to be contaminated with <emphasis>Coccidioides immitis</emphasis> that was endogenous to the harvested monkey kidney (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0014">14</link>). As a result of rapid communication of this information and adherence to laboratory safety procedures, there were no adverse effects in terms of personnel infection with this highly infectious fungus (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0013">13</link>). Therefore, QC procedures and specific testing guidelines must be followed (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0015">15</link>). Shipments of cell culture material should be observed microscopically to confirm that the confluency of the monolayer is appropriate (75 to 90%), that the cells are attached to the substratum, that cell appearance is typical, and that no evidence of contaminating viruses, bacteria, or fungi is present, usually signified by cytopathic appearance of the cells before use or turbidity of the cell medium. Cell culture media that will be added to newly shipped cells should also be free of contamination (clear) and near a neutral pH (salmon pink). If the laboratory introduces additives (e.g., <phrase role="small">L</phrase>-glutamine or antibiotics) to commercial media, the final solution must be checked for sterility, pH, growth promotion, and the absence of toxicity to cells. The lot number and date of use for all media, buffers, reagents, and additives should also be recorded.</para>

      <para id="ch0102s0011p0002">Tubes of cell cultures should be stored in a slanted position with the cell monolayer covered by the medium. Tissue culture cells should ideally be inoculated within 7 days of receipt (8 to 10 days of seeding) for optimal propagation of cell-dependent organisms or demonstration of cytotoxicity. The laboratory should retain all documentation provided by the manufacturer, including cell culture records with cell types, source, passage number, and age of cells. Uninoculated lot-matched tubes, cluster plates, or shell vials that are incubated, maintained, and observed in the same manner as inoculated tissue cells serve as negative controls for CPE, toxicity, exogenous contamination, and procedures such as DFA testing, hemadsorption (HAD), and hemagglutination. Daily inoculation of positive controls to monitor traditional tube culture performance is not routinely performed. However, commonly isolated viruses may be used to perform QC on cell lines when new shipments are received in the laboratory, and they are a source of positive-control material for detection and confirmation methods such as HAD and DFA testing.</para>
      <para id="ch0102s0011p0003">With the exception of a few slower-growing viruses such as CMV, or when viruses are present at very low titers, the time to detection by traditional tube culture methods is generally between 1 and 7 days of inoculation (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0004">4</link>). The standard approach for detecting viral proliferation is the microscopic examination of the unstained cell culture monolayer for the presence of CPE. The presence of a virus is indicated by degenerative changes in monolayer cells, including shrinking, swelling, rounding of cells, clustering, and the formation of syncytia, or by complete destruction of the monolayer. Identification of the virus is then based on the CPE characteristics, the cell line involved, the time to detection, specimen type, and confirmation, generally by staining with virus-specific mAbs. Alternatively, for the identification of viruses for which mAbs may not be available, molecular methods or ancillary traditional testing (e.g., acid resistance for rhinoviruses) must be performed. In addition, for certain viruses (i.e., influenza, parainfluenza, and mumps viruses) that do not always demonstrate CPE, HAD testing may be done (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0016">16</link>).</para>

      <anchor id="ch0102s0012a0002"/>
      <para id="ch0102s0012p0001">HAD refers to the attachment of red blood cells to infected cell culture monolayers. Influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4, and mumps viruses possess a surface hemagglutinin protein that is expressed on the surface of infected cells (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0016">16</link>). The hemagglutinin protein binds red blood cells and adsorbs them to the infected-cell membrane. HAD may be performed when there is no visual CPE in culture or as a rapid screen for the presence of an orthomyxovirus or a paramyxovirus in cell culture with a suspicious CPE. HAD testing is usually performed at 3 to 7 days of incubation or at the end of the incubation period (generally 10 to 14 days). A typical HAD procedure involves incubation of guinea pig erythrocytes with viral culture monolayers at 4°C. Microscopic examination of the culture after 30 min allows the operator to evaluate for the presence of HAD on the monolayer or hemagglutination in the supernatant. HAD-positive cultures can be further analyzed using mAbs to determine the identity of the infecting virus. HAD-negative cultures can be reincubated after removal of the erythrocytes and the addition of fresh culture medium. QC using positive and negative control tubes is essential, as variations in HAD testing may occur from laboratory to laboratory and may also occur based on the circulating predominant influenza virus strain (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0017">17</link>). Direct mAb staining of the cell monolayer for infectious agents such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses has largely replaced HAD procedures in most clinical laboratories, because staining tends to be more specific and provides more rapid results, which can be critical to patient care.</para>

Identification of the viral pathogen when centrifugation-enhanced rapid cell culture is used is not dependent on the visualization of CPE, allowing technologists who are not skilled in CPE recognition to perform viral testing. Instead, the virus is detected either by “blind staining” or staining “pre-CPE” with phycoerythrin-, peroxidase-, or FITC-labeled virus-specific mAbs or a combination of phycoerythrin- and FITC-labeled antibodies, or by virus-specific induction of enzymes that are detected by the ELVIS HSV system using substrates such as β-galactosidase (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0025">25</link>). A significant benefit of using cocultivated cells such as R-Mix, R-Mix Too, H&amp;V-Mix, and Super E-Mix is that they allow the identification of multiple viruses from a single shell vial or cluster tray well, rather than having to use multiple shell vials to cover the range of viruses that the laboratory may wish to detect in a particular sample type. One shell vial can be substituted for up to four different tube cell cultures that require much longer incubation times (10 to 14 days) to identify fewer subspecies of the group.</para>

QC in the diagnostic virology laboratory is one component of such a program and refers to the measures included in each assay to verify that the test is working properly and to ensure that a laboratory consistently produces accurate results. Essential to the QC process are the use of internal and external control material and the verification that these controls are performed in accordance with manufacturer criteria for acceptability, adherence to appropriate incubation time and temperatures for the assay, and ensuring that test kits are used prior to expiration. Internal controls demonstrate that each run worked properly, while external controls help to monitor consistent performance of the assay and lot-to-lot variation between kits.</para>
        <para id="ch0102s0025s0001p0002">Over the past 2 decades, molecular assays have become routine for the diagnosis of viral infections, often replacing traditional culture-based methods. Control material for qualitative molecular assays is often available from both test manufacturers as well as companies specializing in the production of controls and standards (i.e., AcroMetrix/ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA; Zeptometrix, Buffalo, NY). Due to the increasing number of immunocompromised hosts, molecular assays providing quantitation of viral nucleic acid have become common. In order to promote standardization and enhance the comparability of viral load results between laboratories, there has been a significant amount of effort focused on the development of international standards (ISs). These standards provide a reference point, or source of “universal truth,” against which the results of patient samples can be compared and quantitated.</para>
        <para id="ch0102s0025s0001p0003">The World Health Organization (WHO) first developed ISs for hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and HIV. Subsequently, WHO ISs have been developed for other transplant-associated viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), CMV, and BK virus. The use of ISs allows for quantitative viral load assays to be reported in a standardized unit, International Units (IU). The WHO ISs also serve as resource for the development of secondary standards, which are calibrated directly against the WHO IS and are often incorporated as manufacturer-provided calibrators or assay controls (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0031">31</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0102s0025s0001p0004">Best practice is to establish a QC program for each assay performed by the diagnostic virology laboratory (<link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0102s0026s0001li0033">33</link>). Laboratories must follow the regulations set forth by the College of American Pathologists, CLIA, or other accrediting agency, but at a minimum, controls should be used at the frequency recommended by the assay manufacturer. Several commercial sources provide reliable QC material for purchase, including specific strains, purified nucleic acid, antigens, antibodies, and other biological reagents. Many companies also offer subscription programs for laboratories to participate in external quality assessment and proficiency testing programs. The appendix below lists several manufacturers and suppliers of QC material.</para>
