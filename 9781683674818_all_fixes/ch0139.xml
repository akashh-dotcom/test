        <para id="ch0139s0001s0001p0001">As in bacteriology, the goals of a good mycology laboratory are to accurately isolate and identify fungi suspected of causing infection. It is the laboratory’s responsibility to ensure that specimens are appropriate for the requested test and to provide submitters with the guidelines for proper specimen selection, collection, and transport to the laboratory. This section provides general information related to fungal culture from various specimens and is based on historical practice that has been successful. Ultimately, however, each laboratory should establish the acceptable length of time between specimen collection and specimen testing, as well as the conditions under which specimens should be transported to the laboratory.</para>
        <para id="ch0139s0001s0001p0002"><anchor id="ch0139s0001s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0139s0001s0002a0003">Table 1</link> is a listing of the types of specimens most commonly submitted for fungal culture (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0003">3</link>) (<anchor id="ch0139s0001s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0139s0001s0002a0007">Fig. 1</link>). Once collected properly, all specimens should be transported in leakproof sterile containers and processed as soon as possible. Anaerobic transport media and anaerobic containers should never be used for fungi. Fungi are quite resilient, but because some fungi can be affected by temperatures above 37°C and below 10°C, transport at room temperature is recommended. Dermatophytes are particularly sensitive to cold temperatures. With the exception of skin, hair, and nails, specimens that contain normal bacterial biota should be transported as rapidly as possible, because bacterial overgrowth can inhibit slower-growing fungi as well as reducing fungal viability. If such specimens cannot be transported to the laboratory within 2 h, they should be stored at 4°C.</para>
        <para id="ch0139s0001s0001p0003">As with other infectious diseases, the best specimen for determining the causative agent comes from the site of active infection (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] for meningitis). For a number of fungal diseases, however, peripheral specimens as well as specimens from the active site may also be useful.<anchor id="ch0139s0001s0001a0005"/><link linkend="ch0139s0002a0004">Table 2</link> is a listing of the clinical sites associated with recovery of different pathogenic fungi. Laboratories should not hesitate to suggest that peripheral specimens be taken when specific fungal diseases are suspected. Prostate fluid, for example, is an excellent high-yield specimen when endemic mycoses are suspected, but it is a specimen not often submitted to clinical laboratories (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0004">4</link>–<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0008">8</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0139s0001s0001p0004">Fortunately, many of the specimen collection and transport guidelines for mycology are similar to those used in bacteriology. In instances where they differ, it is critical to convey that information to physicians and nurses. One such difference is in specimen volume. The volume of material required for fungal cultures usually exceeds that used in bacteriology, because several types of specimens (body fluids, respiratory secretions, etc.) need to be concentrated or pretreated prior to plating to maximize recovery of fungi. In general, except for a few specific sites noted in<link linkend="ch0139s0001s0002a0003">Table 1</link>, specimens submitted on swabs are not optimal for recovering fungi, and this practice should be discouraged.</para>
        <para id="ch0139s0001s0001p0005">Mycology laboratories should be encouraged to offer physicians different types of fungal cultures. The choice of medium used for primary isolation as well as the length and temperature of incubation can vary with the culture request. For example, fungal culture choices can include a dermatophyte culture for hair, skin, and nail specimens; a rule-out<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> culture for vaginal, urine, skin, and throat specimens; and fungal blood culture (lysis-centrifugation culture). By choosing the culture type, physicians can signal the laboratory when they suspect a specific pathogen, which can often reduce the time that cultures need to be kept in the laboratory.</para>

        <para id="ch0139s0001s0002p0001">If specimens that are unacceptable for any reason are received in the laboratory, they should be rejected and the appropriate physicians should be notified. Poor-quality specimens can result in incorrect information, including false-negative results. As required by the Joint Commission (an independent organization which accredits and certifies health care programs in the United States, formerly called JCAHO), a requisition must accompany each specimen and must include the following: patient name, age, sex, and location or address, physician name, specific culture site, date and time of specimen collection, name of the person who collected the specimen, clinical diagnosis, and any special culture request. In addition, each specimen must have a firmly attached label indicating the patient name, location, physician, and date and time of collection (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0009">9</link>).</para>

Pretreatment procedures are listed in <anchor id="ch0139s0001s0002a0008"/><link linkend="ch0139s0002a0009">Table 3</link> and include centrifugation of urine and sterile body fluids, mincing of nail and tissue specimens, lysis and centrifugation of blood or bone marrow received in Isolator tubes (Wampole Laboratories, Alere, Inc., Orlando, FL), and lysis by mucolytic agents, followed by centrifugation, for respiratory secretions. Such procedures release fungi enclosed within cells, concentrate fungal material in the specimen, and help to reduce or eliminate bacteria present in contaminated specimens because of the action of mucolytic agents, such as <emphasis>N</emphasis>-acetyl-<emphasis role="smallcaps">L</emphasis>-cysteine, 5% oxalic acid, and dithiothreitol (Sputolysin; Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA).</para>

Biosafety level 2 procedures are recommended for personnel working with clinical specimens that may contain dimorphic fungi as well as other potential pathogenic fungi.

Additional caution should be exercised when working with<emphasis>Candida auris</emphasis>, which can persist in the environment and requires a higher level of disinfection than other fungi (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0010">10</link>).

Abscess, pus, or drainage material should be examined for grains or granules by use of a dissecting microscope. The presence of grains or granules is indicative of a mycetoma, which is discussed at greater length in<ulink url="ch0150#ch0150s0001">chapter 129</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis> If none are present, the material can be inoculated directly onto medium. If the specimen is thick, it should be pretreated similarly to a sputum specimen. If present, grains and granules should be teased out of the specimen and washed in sterile distilled water, sterile saline, or either solution plus antibiotics. The color of the granules should be noted and recorded. A portion should be crushed between two glass slides and examined microscopically for the presence of hyphae. Both true fungal hyphae and bacteria (branching Gram-positive rods) can be observed with grains. If branching Gram-positive rods are seen, a modified acid-fast stain should be performed to look for <emphasis>Nocardia.</emphasis> Another portion of the grains and granules should be crushed by using a sterile technique (with a sterile glass rod or mortar and pestle) and then inoculated directly onto medium (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0011">11</link>).</para>

Early detection of organisms in the bloodstream is incredibly important because it is an indicator of disseminated disease. As in bacteriology, the volume of blood, the blood-to-broth ratio, and the number of blood samples are all critical factors, with the volume of blood being the most important variable. For adults, 20 to 30 ml per culture, divided between two bottles, is recommended for the highest recovery rate and the shortest time to detection (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0015">15</link>–<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0018">18</link>).

      <para id="ch0139s0003p0002">There are presently a wide variety of manual, biphasic, automated, and continuously monitoring systems for blood cultures, but no single commercial system or culture medium can detect all potential blood pathogens. If manual blood cultures are used, a biphasic system is best for fungi (Septi-Chek; Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), and the agar slant should be rewashed with the broth-blood mixture each time the bottles are examined. Many automated and continuously monitoring systems are available, and several have medium modifications to enhance fungal growth. These include the Bactec (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD), BacT/ALERT 3D (bioMérieux, Durham, NC), and VersaTREK (Thermo Scientific, Oakwood Village, OH) blood culture systems. Use of these mycosis bottles ensures the highest sensitivity for detecting fungemia (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0024">24</link>). Studies evaluating all of these systems have shown that they can recover all pathogenic yeast species except non-<emphasis>pachydermatis Malassezia</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0025">25</link>).

      <para id="ch0139s0003p0003">Lysis-centrifugation performed either manually or by using the commercially available Isolator collection system is a more sensitive method for recovery of molds and dimorphic fungi such as<emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0034">34</link>). Several studies, however, have argued against the routine use of lysis-centrifugation for all fungal blood cultures because of high contamination rates, high false-positivity rates, and times to detection of yeasts equivalent to or shorter than those of automated systems (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0035">35</link>). If molds are suspected, either a special fungal medium for an automated system, such as Bactec MYCO/F lytic medium or BacT/ALERT MB, or a lysis-centrifugation system should be considered (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0036">36</link>). Blood placed in either adult or pediatric Isolator tubes should be kept at room temperature until it is processed, ideally within 16 h of collection.

      <para id="ch0139s0004p0001">Bone marrow is most useful for the diagnosis of disseminated candidiasis, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis. Approximately 0.5 ml (pediatrics) to 3 ml (adults) should be collected aseptically in a heparinized syringe or pediatric Isolator tube. Because lysis-centrifugation enhances the recovery of<emphasis>H. capsulatum</emphasis> and other molds, the use of Isolator tubes is the method of choice for these organisms. Clotted bone marrow is an unacceptable specimen. With the exception of <emphasis>H. capsulatum</emphasis>, fungi are rarely seen in bone marrow aspirates from immunocompetent hosts. For immunocompromised patients, however, bone marrow is an excellent specimen, and <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>H. capsulatum,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Talaromyces marneffei</emphasis> can all be observed (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0039">39</link>). While it is quite clear that microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained bone marrow can be diagnostic, recent data show that compared with other, less-invasive methods, such as blood cultures, bone marrow aspirate cultures are of limited value and should be performed only selectively (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0040">40</link>). Bone marrow should not be placed in blood culture bottles, because with many continuously monitoring systems, the specimen will quickly register a false-positive result due to CO<subscript>2</subscript> from massive numbers of white blood cells.</para>

Specimens should be placed in a sterile container and transported and stored at room temperature (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0041">41</link>). The semiquantitative method of Maki et al. is the most common method used in clinical laboratories, where the catheter tip is rolled across the surface of an agar plate four times and cultures yielding ≥15 CFU are considered positive, although quantitative culture techniques (sonication) may also be used (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0042">42</link>). The semiquantitative method distinguishes infection (≥15 colonies) from contamination and is considered a more specific method to diagnose catheter-related septicemia than culturing the catheter tip in broth.</para>

If a toothbrush is used to collect skin and/or hair specimens, the brush should be pressed gently onto the surface of the agar in four or five places on the plate, leaving an imprint.

More common nondermatophyte causes of nail infection, such as <emphasis>Scopulariopsis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species, are also sensitive to cycloheximide, so all nail samples should be cultured on both inhibitory and noninhibitory media. For patients suspected of having pityriasis versicolor, caused by <emphasis>Malassezia furfur</emphasis>, direct microscopy is normally diagnostic, but a noninhibitory medium such as Sabouraud dextrose agar can be inoculated, and then olive oil or a paper disk saturated with olive oil should be placed on the first quadrant of the plate. <emphasis>M. furfur</emphasis> grows best at ≥35°C but can grow at 30°C.

      <para id="ch0139s0007p0001">Several types of eye infections require that corneal scrapings and/or vitreous humor be obtained by an ophthalmologist. These include mycotic or fungal keratitis, fungal endophthalmitis, and extension oculomycosis. Mycotic or fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea. The most common causes are<emphasis>Acremonium</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Curvularia</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0044">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0045">45</link>). Fungal endophthalmitis is usually a late-stage result of hematogenous dissemination of a systemic fungal infection. It can involve many areas of the eye and surrounding tissues. The most common causes are <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Blastomyces dermatitidis, Candida</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Cryptococcus neoformans, Coccidioides</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>H. capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Sporothrix schenckii</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0044">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0045">45</link>). Extension oculomycosis is a result of rhinocerebral mucormycosis, and like fungal endophthalmitis, it may involve many areas of the eye and surrounding tissues. The diagnosis of these infections requires attempting to demonstrate the organism on a microscopic examination plus positive culture. Corneal scrapings are taken by physicians, and media are inoculated directly by use of a heat-sterilized platinum spatula (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0046">46</link>). Very little material is usually obtained because of the risks of corneal thinning or perforation. Physicians should be instructed to first inoculate the specimen directly onto a noninhibitory medium, such as Sabouraud dextrose agar, and then to place some material on a sterile glass slide (in the center) for staining. The scraping should be placed in two or three places on the plate, using an X- or C-shaped motion (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0003">3</link>). The inoculated plate should be kept at room temperature and transported immediately to the laboratory. Vitreous, or vitreous humor, is the clear, gelatinous material that fills the space between the lens of the eye and the retina. When taken by physicians, vitreous is often diluted with irrigation fluid. For this reason, it should be concentrated by centrifugation, and the sediment should be used to inoculate media and to make smears. Specimens should be placed onto Sabouraud dextrose agar, inhibitory mold agar, and/or brain heart infusion (BHI) agar with 10% sheep blood and incubated at 30°C. Media containing cycloheximide should be avoided (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0044">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0047">47</link>).</para>

After the bladder is emptied, the prostate gland is massaged to yield pure prostatic fluid. The prostate is frequently seeded when organisms are present in the bloodstream. A key clinical sign in males with endemic mycoses is the complaint of a history of chronic urinary tract infections but negative urine cultures. Prostatic fluid from such patients is frequently positive when cultured for fungi. The secretions should also be examined microscopically. After the prostate fluid is obtained, the next urine specimen should also be obtained and submitted for culture, because this urine has a high yield (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0004">4</link>–<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0008">8</link>).</para>

Sodium hydroxide, which is used to concentrate specimens for detection of mycobacteria, should not be used because it inhibits the growth of many fungi (e.g., <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp.). Unfortunately, centrifugation also increases the number of bacteria in the sediment, and for this reason, media containing antimicrobial agents, with and without cycloheximide, should be used.

For the mucoraceous molds, in particular, mincing is critical for the recovery of organisms. Tissues should be minced by use of a scalpel, and the pieces of tissue should be pressed into the agar so that they are partially embedded (<link linkend="ch0139s0017s0001li0057">57</link>) (<anchor id="ch0139s0014a0003"/><link linkend="ch0139s0014a0004">Fig. 2</link>). Two to four pieces should be placed onto each culture plate being inoculated. Further streaking of the plate with sterile loops should not be done. When the medium is inoculated this way, fungi grow out directly from the piece of tissue. Laboratories often question if growth on agar plates represents contamination. When growth comes directly from the tissue piece, it is unquestionably significant growth. A portion of the specimen can be ground for microscopic examination and/or smears.</para>
      <para id="ch0139s0014p0002">When<emphasis>H. capsulatum</emphasis> is suspected, the tissue should be ground or homogenized. Because this pathogen is intracellular, organisms need to be released from the cells to be available to grow on media. If needed, a small amount of sterile broth or distilled water can be added to smooth the process of grinding. Subcutaneous tissue should be examined for the presence of granules (as described above, for abscesses). Homogenate or tissue pieces should be inoculated onto enriched media containing antibacterial agents, and for systemic mycoses, enriched media containing both blood and antibacterial agents are best.</para>
