        <para id="ch0063s0000p0001">Many of the bacteria discussed in this chapter formerly belonged to the genus<emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis>; others were described and named after the taxonomic dissection of this genus to conform to a modern phylogeny-based taxonomy. In this reclassification process, the name <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> was confined to rRNA homology group I organisms because they included the type species, <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis> (see <ulink url="ch0062#ch0062s0001">chapter 45</ulink>). rRNA group II pseudomonads belong to the class <emphasis>Betaproteobacteria</emphasis> and were reclassified into the genera <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0002">2</link>). They form a remarkable group of primary and opportunistic human, animal, and plant pathogens, as well as environmental species with a considerable potential for biological control, remediation, and plant growth promotion. During the past 2 decades, the interest in several peculiar characteristics of these organisms led to the discovery and description of numerous novel species. The genus <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> now contains more than 100 validly named species, many of which have been isolated from soil and water samples. Despite their tremendous metabolic and biotechnological potential, <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> species are notorious opportunistic pathogens (see below) and the use of <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> in agricultural applications is controversial. Recently, the phylogenetic diversity within this genus as revealed through comparative 16S rRNA and phylogenomic studies was used to subdivide this genus into <emphasis>Burkholderia sensu stricto</emphasis> (which comprises the majority of human pathogens) and several novel genera, which mainly include species of environmental origin, i.e., <emphasis>Caballeronia, Mycetohabitans, Paraburkholderia, Robbsia, Pararobbsia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Trinickia</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0004">4</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0063s0000p0002">Some other<emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis>-like species were found to represent a distinct phylogenetic lineage with a position intermediate between those of the genera <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> and were classified in the novel genus <emphasis>Pandoraea</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0006">6</link>). Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, further supported by phenotypic differences, indicated that two distinct sublineages existed within the genus <emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0007">7</link>). It was proposed that species of the <emphasis>Ralstonia eutropha</emphasis> lineage be classified in a novel genus named <emphasis>Wautersia</emphasis>, whereas the name <emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> was preserved for the lineage comprising <emphasis>Ralstonia pickettii</emphasis>, the type species. Shortly thereafter, it became known (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0008">8</link>) that <emphasis>Wautersia eutropha</emphasis>, the type species of the genus <emphasis>Wautersia</emphasis>, was a junior synonym of <emphasis>Cupriavidus necator</emphasis>, the type (and only) species of the genus <emphasis>Cupriavidus</emphasis>, an environmental organism which was validly named in 1987, i.e., long before 16S rRNA gene sequence studies were performed routinely (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0009">9</link>). To conform to the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0010">10</link>), the name <emphasis>Wautersia</emphasis> had to be replaced by <emphasis>Cupriavidus</emphasis> and all species of the genus <emphasis>Wautersia</emphasis> became species of the genus <emphasis>Cupriavidus</emphasis>.</para>
        <para id="ch0063s0000p0003">Several<emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> species have been isolated from human clinical samples, but only <emphasis>Burkholderia cepacia</emphasis> complex, <emphasis>Burkholderia gladioli, Burkholderia mallei</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Burkholderia pseudomallei</emphasis> are generally recognized as human or animal pathogens. Polyphasic taxonomic studies revealed that <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis>-like bacteria belong to at least 20 distinct genomic species, referred to collectively as the <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0011">11</link>), but ongoing surveys of the diversity of <emphasis>B. cepacia-</emphasis>like bacteria recovered from specimens from persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) and other specimens revealed the presence of several additional novel species in the <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0012">12</link>). Within the <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex, however, <emphasis>Burkholderia multivorans</emphasis> and <emphasis>Burkholderia cenocepacia</emphasis> are the most common opportunistic pathogens in CF patients (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0013">13</link>).</para>

They are 1 to 5 μm in length and 0.5 to 1.0 μm in width. <emphasis>Stenotrophomonas</emphasis> species are straight rods and tend to be slightly smaller than members of the other genera (0.7 to 1.8 μm in length and 0.4 to 0.7 μm in width). Except for <emphasis>B. mallei</emphasis>, these organisms are motile due to the presence of one or more polar flagella. These bacteria are catalase positive, and most are either weakly or strongly oxidase positive. All grow on MacConkey agar, except for certain strains of <emphasis>B. vesicularis</emphasis>, and appear to be nonfermenters. Most species degrade glucose oxidatively, and most degrade nitrate to either nitrite or nitrogen gas. Certain species have distinctive colony morphologies or pigmentation. They are nutritionally quite versatile, with different species being able to utilize a variety of simple and complex carbohydrates, alcohols, and amino acids as carbon sources. Certain species can multiply at 4°C, but most are mesophilic, with optimal growth temperatures of between 30°C and 37°C. For some genera, growth at higher temperatures (i.e., 42°C) can be useful for species identification.</para>

Most have a worldwide distribution. Certain members of these genera are recognized as phytopathogens, and many species were first described in that context. Because of their ability to survive in aqueous environments, some of these species have become particularly problematic as opportunistic nosocomial pathogens in hospitals and health care settings.</para>
        <para id="ch0063s0000p0012">The natural distribution of<emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species has been intensively studied owing to their biotechnological properties and their pathogenicity in persons with CF (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0013">13</link>). <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex bacteria may have antifungal, antinematodal, or plant growth-promoting properties, which makes them attractive as biological pesticides and fertilizers (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0031">31</link>). Because of their nutritional versatility, <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex bacteria also have applications for bioremediation of contaminated soils. While some species within the complex, especially <emphasis>Burkholderia ambifaria, Burkholderia anthina</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Burkholderia pyrrocinia</emphasis>, can be readily recovered from certain soil samples (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0032">32</link>), other species, including <emphasis>B. multivorans</emphasis>, which is among the most common <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species recovered from CF patients, are more difficult to recover from environmental sources (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0033">33</link>). <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex bacteria have been found in a variety of foodstuffs, bottled water, and unpasteurized dairy products (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0034">34</link>). Due to their intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0035">35</link>), <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex bacteria are also notorious contaminants of pharmaceutical preparations (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0036">36</link>).

        <para id="ch0063s0000p0013">Genotypic and conventional epidemiologic investigation provide compelling evidence for interpatient transmission of shared or so-called “epidemic”<emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex strains among persons with CF (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0013">13</link>). One such strain, referred to as the ET12 (for electrophoretic type 12) lineage, was common among CF patients in Eastern Canada and the United Kingdom in the 1990s and early 2000s (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0038">38</link>). This <emphasis>B. cenocepacia</emphasis> strain is associated with poor clinical outcomes and is characterized by a distinctive cable-like pilus and an associated adhesin that mediates adherence to respiratory epithelium. <emphasis>B. cenocepacia</emphasis> strain PHDC dominated among infected CF patients in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States during the same period and has been identified in agricultural soil as well as in CF patients in several European countries (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0039">39</link>–<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0041">41</link>).

        <para id="ch0063s0000p0014"><emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> and <emphasis>B. thailandensis</emphasis> are found in soil and surface water primarily in tropical and subtropical areas. Both species have been isolated in the rice-growing regions of northeast Thailand, western Cambodia, Laos, and southern and central Vietnam. In northern Australia, associations have been made between <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> and native grasses in undisturbed land, and the presence of livestock animals, lower soil pH, and different combinations of soil texture and color in environmentally disturbed sites (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0043">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0044">44</link>). <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> can occasionally persist in temperate environments after introduction via animals infected with melioidosis (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0045">45</link>). <emphasis>Burkholderia humptydooensis</emphasis>, a species related to <emphasis>B. thailandensis</emphasis>, has been identified in water wells in northern Australia (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0046">46</link>). Two other species, <emphasis>Burkholderia stagnalis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Burkholderia territorii</emphasis>, which are members of the <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex, have been described from environmental studies in northern Australia (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0047">47</link>). <emphasis>B. stagnalis</emphasis> was found to have been previously isolated from sputum in an Australian patient with CF and from a tracheal aspirate from a patient in the United States. More recently described are <emphasis>Burkholderia mayonis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Burkholderia savannae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0048">48</link>).

        <para id="ch0063s0000p0015">The known endemic distribution of<emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> is being expanded beyond the traditional regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia, where melioidosis is endemic, with increasing case reports of melioidosis from the Americas, Madagascar, several countries in Africa, Mauritius, India and elsewhere in south Asia, China, and Taiwan. Sporadic cases have been reported among residents of or travelers to Aruba, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, and many other countries in the Americas, as well as Puerto Rico. In northeastern Brazil, clusters of melioidosis have been reported (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0049">49</link>). The extent to which this reflects true expansion of endemicity rather than unmasking of the long-standing presence of the bacterium remains unclear. Modelling of the global burden of melioidosis estimates that it is severely underreported in the 45 countries in which it is known to be endemic and that it is probably endemic in a further 34 countries that have never reported the disease (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0050">50</link>). A case report suggesting that <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> may be endemic in the environment of the southern United States (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0051">51</link>) was supported by the recent identification of this species in soil and water in the Gulf Coast region of southern Mississippi during an investigation of two additional cases of human melioidosis (<ulink url="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2022/han00470.asp">https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2022/han00470.asp</ulink>).</para>

      <para id="ch0063s0000p0018">The species<emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> has been long recognized as an occasional opportunistic human pathogen, capable of causing a variety of infections, including bacteremia, urinary tract infection, septic arthritis, peritonitis, and pneumonia, in persons with underlying illness (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0013">13</link>). Persons with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and CF are particularly susceptible to infection. <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> also has a history as a nosocomial pathogen, causing infections associated with contaminated hospital equipment, medications, and disinfectants, including povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, and benzalkonium chloride (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0013">13</link>). Nosocomial outbreaks of respiratory tract infections in patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care units have been attributed to contamination of nebulizers or nebulized medications such as albuterol. Contamination of blood culture systems or disinfectants resulting in pseudobacteremia has been described. Early reports of infection in CF described patients with acute pulmonary deterioration and sepsis (referred to as cepacia syndrome) (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0053">53</link>), and clinical outcome studies consistently identified <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> infection as a significant independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in CF (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0054">54</link>).</para>

Many strains exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial resistance (see below), and pulmonary infection is generally refractory to therapy. Furthermore, due to the poor postoperative prognosis associated with <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex, most CF treatment centers consider infection to be a contraindication for lung transplantation, which at present offers the only therapeutic option for successful intermediate-term survival of persons with end-stage pulmonary disease.

Thus, although it is almost certainly true that <emphasis>B. cenocepacia</emphasis> is the species most frequently associated with cepacia syndrome, it remains to be shown whether this species, in general, is disproportionately associated with poor outcome; case reports document fatal infection associated with other <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species, including <emphasis>B. multivorans, B. stabilis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>B. dolosa</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0062">62</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0063">63</link>). Although a positive correlation between species frequency and poor clinical outcome seems likely, firm conclusions regarding the relative virulence of <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species must await more definitive study.

In locations where the disease is endemic, infection is seasonal, with up to 85% of cases occurring during the monsoon wet season. Severe weather events and environmental disturbances have been associated with melioidosis clusters in Australia (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0071">71</link>), and the Asian tsunami of 2004 resulted in cases across the affected region (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0072">72</link>). As travel to Southeast Asia and northern Australia has become more frequent, reports of melioidosis in travelers returning to Europe and the United States are becoming more common (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0045">45</link>). Melioidosis is an especially important potential travel-related illness for those with CF and persistent colonization of airways with <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> can occur in CF despite prolonged therapy, with repeated disease flares and deteriorating lung function (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0073">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0074">74</link>).

The role of ingestion from unchlorinated water supplies is being increasingly recognized in regions of endemicity (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0076">76</link>). Zoonotic disease is described but is exceedingly uncommon, as are person-to-person transmission and laboratory-acquired infection (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0069">69</link>). The association of severe weather events with respiratory infection and high mortality rates has been attributed to a shift from percutaneous inoculation to inhalation (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0077">77</link>).

Latent infection with subsequent reactivation even decades after exposure is well recognized but accounts for less than 5% of all cases (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0079">79</link>). Such cases often achieve notoriety but are rare, and the vast majority of cases of melioidosis are from recent infection, with an incubation period of 1 to 21 days (median, 4 days) (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0080">80</link>). Risk factors for clinical disease following infection with <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> include diabetes, hazardous alcohol use, chronic renal disease, chronic lung disease, malignancy, and immunosuppressive therapy (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0079">79</link>–<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0081">81</link>). Twenty to 36% of cases have no identified risk factor, and mortality in this group is usually low. Disease in children is also uncommon, although parotid abscesses are well recognized as an important manifestation of melioidosis in children in Thailand and Cambodia (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0082">82</link>). Overall rates of mortality from melioidosis vary from 10 to 15% in centers where state-of-the-art intensive care therapy is available to over 50% in locations with poor resources (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0070">70</link>). Fifty percent of cases present with pneumonia, which can be part of a fatal sepsis or a less severe unilateral infection indistinguishable from other community-acquired pneumonias or a chronic illness mimicking tuberculosis (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0083">83</link>). Chronic melioidosis, defined as illness present for over 2 months, occurs in only 10% of cases. Overall, 50% of cases are bacteremic; blood culture showing growth in the first 24 h of incubation is a marker for high mortality (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0084">84</link>). At the mild end of the clinical spectrum of melioidosis is presentation with a skin ulcer or abscess without systemic illness (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0085">85</link>). Other common presentations with or without bacteremia are genitourinary infections, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0070">70</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0079">79</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0080">80</link>). Prostatic abscesses are especially common (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0086">86</link>). Abscesses can also occur in spleen, liver, kidneys, and adrenal glands. Parotitis, lymphadenitis, sinusitis, orchitis, myositis (especially psoas abscess), mycotic aneurysms, and pericardial and mediastinal collections have all been described. Lesions can be frankly purulent and may include microabscesses or granulomas or a combination of these features. Clinical meningitis is rare, but melioidosis encephalomyelitis syndrome (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0079">79</link>) and brain abscesses have also been reported.</para>
      <para id="ch0063s0000p0027"><emphasis>B. mallei</emphasis> is the etiologic agent of glanders, a highly communicable disease of livestock, particularly horses, mules, and donkeys. Transmission to humans is possible (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0087">87</link>) and <emphasis>B. mallei</emphasis> is identified as a potential agent of bioterrorism. Unlike <emphasis>B. pseudomallei, B. mallei</emphasis> is a host-adapted pathogen that does not persist in the environment outside its host. Glanders has been eradicated from most countries, but enzootic foci persist in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and South and Central America. The only human case of glanders in the past 50 years in the United States was a laboratory-acquired case in a biodefense scientist (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0088">88</link>). Like melioidosis, human glanders can be acute or chronic, with the clinical presentation and course depending on the mode of infection, the inoculation dose, and host risk factors. Respiratory inoculation can result in pneumonia with potential for dissemination to internal organs and severe sepsis. Cutaneous inoculation can result in skin nodules and regional lymphadenitis, also with potential for disseminated disease. Involvement of nodes, both mediastinal and peripheral, is much more common in glanders than in melioidosis, often with suppurative abscesses in untreated cases.</para>

      <para id="ch0063s0000p0045">Accurate identification of species in the<emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex can present a challenge. Historically, many commercial bacterial identification systems have not been able to reliably distinguish among these species and often failed to differentiate these species from other closely related species, such as <emphasis>B. gladioli</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ralstonia, Cupriavidus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Pandoraea</emphasis> species (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0068">68</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0097">97</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0136">136</link>). This has presented a significant problem for CF patients and their caregivers, as detailed in “Clinical Significance,” above. The identification of <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species from CF sputum culture has a dramatic impact on patient management, prognosis, and lung transplantation eligibility and is a cause of considerable anxiety for people with CF. Consequently, when <emphasis>Burkholderia, Ralstonia, Cupriavidus</emphasis>, or <emphasis>Pandoraea</emphasis> species are identified in a specimen from a CF patient by using a commercial phenotypic test system, the identity of the isolate should be confirmed by more reliable methods. To aid clinical microbiologists in the United States, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has established a <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> reference laboratory, which uses genotypic methods (described below) to confirm the identity of <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex isolates and other nonfermenting species recovered from CF respiratory cultures. Further information concerning this and other reference laboratories with special expertise in <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> can be found on the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation website (<ulink url="http://www.cff.org">http://www.cff.org</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0063s0000p0046"><emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species may require 3 days of incubation before colonies are seen on selective media.

On MacConkey agar, colonies of the <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex frequently become dark pink to red due to oxidation of lactose after extended incubation (4 to 7 days). Most clinical isolates are nonpigmented, but on iron-containing media such as a triple sugar iron slant, many strains produce a bright yellow pigment. <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species have a characteristic dirt-like odor.</para>

DNA sequence differences in rRNA genes have been used to develop species-specific PCR assays for the identification of several <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0137">137</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0139">139</link>–<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0142">142</link>), as well as <emphasis>B. gladioli</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0143">143</link>).

This scheme was subsequently modified to allow typing of all species within the genus <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0147">147</link>). Other genomic approaches, including amplified fragment length polymorphism typing, ribotyping, and whole-cell protein profiling, have been proposed for the differentiation of <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0148">148</link>–<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0150">150</link>). However, these methods are time-consuming and expensive and require an extensive validated database before isolates can be reliably identified. These limitations render them impractical for use in a routine diagnostic laboratory. Cellular fatty acid methyl ester analysis is useful for identification of <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> strains at the genus level but is not reliable for identification of individual <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species and does not differentiate <emphasis>B. gladioli</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0017">17</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0063s0000p0051">The reliability and discriminatory power of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the identification of<emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex spp. vary depending on the species being tested and the database being used (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0151">151</link>–<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0153">153</link>). In general, studies assessing the performance of MALDI-TOF MS for identifying <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex spp. have examined relatively small numbers of isolates, and most studies have not included all 24 species. Plongla et al. (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0154">154</link>) found that MALDI-TOF MS correctly identified all of the <emphasis>B. multivorans</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 10), <emphasis>B. vietnamiensis</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 8), <emphasis>B. contaminans</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 12), and <emphasis>B. gladioli</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 10) strains tested. The accuracy in identifying other, less commonly encountered <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex spp. ranged from 64% to 95%. More recently, Wong et al. (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0155">155</link>), in a study of 100 isolates that included representatives from 22 <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex spp. and <emphasis>B. gladioli</emphasis>, found that although MALDI-TOF correctly identified 100% of isolates to the genus level, only 26% were correctly identified to the species level. The seemingly ever-expanding number of novel <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> species identified among “<emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis>-like” isolates recovered from human and environmental specimens (e.g., the relatively recent descriptions of <emphasis>B. aenigmatica</emphasis> and <emphasis>B. puraquae</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0011">11</link>) will continue to challenge phenotype-based analyses. Finally, although MALDI-TOF MS offers decreased turnaround time (relative to DNA sequence analysis or referral to a reference laboratory), it is worth noting that insofar as acquisition of new opportunistic respiratory pathogens by persons with CF is most often asymptomatic and does not necessarily warrant an immediate change in clinical management (antimicrobial therapy or infection control measures), rapid identification of species recovered in culture is much less important than is accurate species identification.</para>

      <para id="ch0063s0000p0054">The accuracy of the API 20NE system for the identification of<emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> is reported to range from 37% to 99% (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0157">157</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0160">160</link>–<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0164">164</link>). This level of interstudy variability is likely due to <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> phenotypic diversity in different geographical areas and/or between clinical isolates and those from the environment. A study using a large isolate collection (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 800) of <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> obtained from clinical cases, the environment, and animals from seven Asian countries and northern Australia reported that the API 20NE system correctly identified 99% of <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> isolates (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0160">160</link>). However, the API 20NE system does not reliably identify <emphasis>B. mallei</emphasis> or <emphasis>B. thailandensis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0160">160</link>). The automated Vitek 1 system also provides accurate identification of <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0164">164</link>). Two evaluations of the Vitek 2 colorimetric GN card system have reported an accuracy of around 80% for <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis>, the most common incorrect identification being the <emphasis>Burkholderia cepacia</emphasis> group (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0161">161</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0165">165</link>). The accuracy of Vitek 2 has been reported to be affected by the medium on which <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> is grown prior to testing, with culture on Columbia horse blood agar being associated with the highest rate of accuracy (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0165">165</link>). A study has also shown geographical variation in the accuracy of Vitek 2 (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0166">166</link>). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) has been shown to provide accurate identification of <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> and distinguish this species from <emphasis>B. mallei</emphasis> with the use of a reference spectrum library (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0167">167</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0168">168</link>). Nevertheless, reports still occur from clinical laboratories where use of MALDI-TOF MS has given an erroneous identification of <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> as <emphasis>B. thailandensis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0075">75</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0169">169</link>). Thus, referral to a reference laboratory is advised when isolation of <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> or <emphasis>B. mallei</emphasis> is suspected or confirmed (see <ulink url="ch0031#ch0031s0001">chapter 16</ulink>).</para>

      <para id="ch0063s0000p0055">Although<emphasis>R. pickettii</emphasis> was considered the <emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> species most frequently isolated from clinical specimens, the recognition that several other <emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cupriavidus</emphasis> species can be identified from among <emphasis>R. pickettii</emphasis>-like isolates limits previous observations. As is the case with <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex species, <emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cupriavidus</emphasis> species are phenotypically similar, requiring rather extensive biochemical testing to reliably differentiate them; species-level identification with standard biochemical testing is difficult (<anchor id="ch0063s0000a0038"/><link linkend="ch0063s0000a0040">Table 2</link>). These species may grow slowly on primary isolation media, requiring ≥48 h of incubation before colonies are visible. They are lysine decarboxylase negative and generally catalase positive, although catalase-negative <emphasis>R. pickettii</emphasis> strains have been described (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0018">18</link>). Most species show a fast and strong oxidase reaction; however, the intensity of the oxidase reaction varies for <emphasis>R. mannitolilytica, R. pickettii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. gilardii</emphasis>, with some strains showing a weakly positive reaction ((<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0018">18</link>); LiPuma, unpublished). <emphasis>R. pickettii, R. mannitolilytica</emphasis> and <emphasis>R. insidiosa</emphasis> grow on BCSA; most <emphasis>Cupriavidus</emphasis> strains do not, but growth is strain dependent. These species do not produce acid from sucrose. Most <emphasis>R. mannitolilytica</emphasis> strains acidify lactose, whereas most strains from other species do not. <emphasis>R. insidiosa, C. respiraculi, C. gilardii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. pauculus</emphasis> are differentiated from <emphasis>R. pickettii</emphasis> and <emphasis>R. mannitolilytica</emphasis> in failing to acidify glucose.</para>
      <para id="ch0063s0000p0056">Molecular genetic tests have proved reliable in differentiating these species. A 16S rRNA-directed PCR assay reliably identifies all<emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cupriavidus</emphasis> species (as a group), allowing their differentiation from the phenotypically similar species in the genera <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Pandoraea</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0098">98</link>). Species-specific 16S rRNA-based PCR assays have also been developed; these enable the accurate identification of <emphasis>R. pickettii, R. mannitolilytica, R. insidiosa</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Cupriavidus respiraculi</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0098">98</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0170">170</link>).

The lack of saccharolytic activity is indicative of <emphasis>Pandoraea</emphasis> but is also seen with some <emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> species. Definitive identification of putative <emphasis>Pandoraea</emphasis> isolates requires molecular confirmation. <emphasis>Pandoraea</emphasis> strains can be differentiated from <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> strains by their specific 16S rRNA gene restriction profile (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0097">97</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0173">173</link>) and can be identified at the species level through restriction analysis of the <emphasis>gyrB</emphasis> gene (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0174">174</link>). MALDI-TOF MS has been reported to have variable accuracy in identifying <emphasis>Pandoraea</emphasis> species (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0153">153</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0154">154</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0171">171</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0063s0000p0058">Key features for identifying<emphasis>S. maltophilia</emphasis> include oxidation of glucose and maltose with a more intense reaction with the latter, positive reactions for DNase and lysine decarboxylase, and a tuft of polar flagella (<anchor id="ch0063s0000a0051"/><link linkend="ch0063s0000a0054">Table 3</link>) (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0175">175</link>). Although most strains were previously believed to be oxidase negative, testing of large numbers of isolates recovered from human specimens and referred to a reference laboratory indicates that as many as 20% may be oxidase positive (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0176">176</link>). This proportion may be higher than expected, since strains with an “atypical” phenotype may be preferentially referred for analysis. Detection of extracellular DNase activity by <emphasis>S. maltophilia</emphasis> is a key to differentiating this species from most other glucose-oxidizing, Gram-negative bacilli. It can be detected on tube-based or plated DNase medium with a methyl green indicator. Care must be taken when interpreting the DNase reaction, since one report documented the misidentification of <emphasis>S. maltophilia</emphasis> as <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> partially based on false-negative DNase reactions that were finalized with 48 h of incubation rather than 72 h (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0177">177</link>). Selected isolates of <emphasis>Flavobacterium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shewanella</emphasis> species may also be DNase positive (see <ulink url="ch0064#ch0064s0001">chapter 47</ulink>). On sheep blood agar, colonies appear rough and lavender-green and have an ammonia-like odor. A species-specific PCR assay targeting the 23S rRNA gene was reported to have a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0178">178</link>). This PCR test was used as a standard to evaluate the identification of <emphasis>S. maltophilia</emphasis> using the API 20NE strip and the VITEK 2 ID-GNB card (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0179">179</link>). Both systems showed good reliability compared to PCR. MALDI-TOF MS initially performed variably in identifying <emphasis>S. maltophilia</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0171">171</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0180">180</link>), but it is now approved for this use in the United States. As is the case with several of the nonfermenting opportunistic species discussed in this chapter, an incomplete understanding of <emphasis>Stenotrophomonas</emphasis> taxonomy challenges accurate identification of clinical and environmental isolates.</para>

Most strains of <emphasis>B. diminuta</emphasis> grow on MacConkey agar, while only approximately 25% of <emphasis>Brevundimonas vesicularis</emphasis> strains do so. On primary isolation media, <emphasis>B. diminuta</emphasis> colonies are chalk white whereas many strains of <emphasis>B. vesicularis</emphasis> are characterized by an orange intracellular pigment. These organisms are oxidase positive, have a single polar flagellum, and weakly oxidize glucose (<emphasis>B. vesicularis</emphasis> more so than <emphasis>B. diminuta</emphasis>), and the vast majority fail to reduce nitrate to nitrite. The most reliable method for differentiating these two species is the test for esculin hydrolysis. Almost all strains of <emphasis>B. vesicularis</emphasis> (88%) are reported to hydrolyze this substrate, while <emphasis>B. diminuta</emphasis> strains rarely do (5%) (Table 3) (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0175">175</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0063s0000p0062"><emphasis>Comamonas</emphasis> species are straight or slightly curved Gram-negative bacilli which occur singly or in pairs. The organisms are catalase and oxidase positive and have a single tuft of polar flagella. All human clinical <emphasis>Comamonas</emphasis> species reduce nitrate to nitrite.

        <para id="ch0063s0000p0064">Several molecular genetic methods are available to assess the relatedness of isolates of these genera during nosocomial or community outbreak investigations. These methods are preferred over phenotypically based systems, which are less discriminatory and reproducible. Analysis of whole-genome macrorestriction profiles with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has proved useful in numerous studies of<emphasis>Burkholderia, Ralstonia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>S. maltophilia</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0181">181</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0182">182</link>). The endonucleases XbaI and SpeI are most frequently used and typically yield a dozen or more DNA fragments for analysis. Care must be taken in interpreting PFGE profiles of <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> species, however. These species have unusually large and dynamic multichromosome genomes that are prone to large-scale alterations in content and arrangement (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0183">183</link>). Consequently, epidemiologically irrelevant genomic polymorphisms may arise in the short term and confound outbreak investigations (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0182">182</link>). Ribotyping, which relies on polymorphisms in and around rRNA operons, has been used to investigate the epidemiology of <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex and <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0184">184</link>–<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0186">186</link>). Both PFGE and ribotyping are relatively time-consuming and expensive to perform and are therefore not particularly well suited for routine analysis by clinical microbiology laboratories. A variety of PCR-based methods, including randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) typing and repetitive-sequence PCR (rep-PCR) typing, offer attractive alternatives for genotyping <emphasis>S. maltophilia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Burkholderia, Ralstonia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Pandoraea</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0039">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0108">108</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0173">173</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0187">187</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0188">188</link>). These methods are inexpensive and can provide rapid, reliable results. Multilocus sequence typing, which assesses DNA sequence variation at several chromosomal loci, has been developed for numerous species, including the <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex, <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis>, and <emphasis>B. mallei</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0146">146</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0189">189</link>–<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0191">191</link>). A modification of the scheme developed for the <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> complex enables MLST analysis of all species within the genus (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0147">147</link>). This genotyping strategy provides robust, reproducible, and portable results and is suitable for investigating bacterial epidemiology, evolution, and population structure. Both rep-PCR using a BOX A1R primer (BOX-PCR) and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) have been developed for <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> to exclude a clonal outbreak (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0192">192</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0193">193</link>). Whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis has become increasingly accessible and is quickly becoming a preferred method for strain genotyping (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0194">194</link>).

It is performed by using a prepared antigen from strains of <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> sensitized to sheep cells and includes unsensitized cells as a control. This assay can be adapted to a microtiter plate test system. Several alternative serological assays for melioidosis have been described (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0195">195</link>–<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0197">197</link>). The serologic tests currently in use have limited value for the diagnosis of melioidosis in persons who have lived in regions where melioidosis is endemic because the healthy indigenous population is often seropositive (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0078">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0198">198</link>, <link linkend="ch0063s0000li0199">199</link>).

The interpretation of the IHA or other serologic assays is complicated by the lack of validated guidelines; different cutoff points have been used to define seroconversion following exposure and acute infection. Testing should be performed, wherever possible, on paired samples. Seroconversion with the development of detectable antibodies to <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> in the second sample is supportive of exposure. A fourfold rise in titer is commonly used to diagnose a range of infectious diseases, but this has not been validated for melioidosis, and any reproducible rise between two samples should be viewed as possible evidence of exposure. A single high titer in persons from a region where the organism is not endemic and with a relevant travel history who present late after a putative exposure event and for whom paired sera may be less relevant is also suggestive of exposure. Some individuals with culture-proven melioidosis do not have detectable antibodies (<link linkend="ch0063s0000li0201">201</link>), and so a negative serologic test does not rule out exposure or melioidosis. Given the complexity of this situation, experts in the field should be consulted when serology is used to diagnose melioidosis.</para>
