      <para id="ch0016s0000p0001">As recent global pandemics have demonstrated, the role of the clinical microbiologist is more relevant now than ever; this thirteenth edition of the<emphasis>Manual of Clinical Microbiology</emphasis> (MCM13) reflects contributions by microbiologists to pathogen discovery and containment. To accommodate the addition of new chapters and the expansion of current existing chapters, MCM will now be published as a four volume set. Karen Carroll returns as editor in chief (EIC) of volumes 1 and 2 (general topics and bacteriology), and Michael Pfaller returns as the EIC of volumes 3 and 4 (virology, mycology, and parasitology).</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0002">This edition includes updated content on all aspects of microbiology, authored by world experts on each subject and edited by a highly committed team of volume and section editors working within the usual 4-year publication cycle. This edition includes two new volume editors (James Karlowsky and Bobbi Pritt) and seven new section editors (Esther Babady, Matthew Binnicker, Marc Couturier, Nathan Ledeboer, Benjamin Pinsky, Patricia Simner, and Christine Turenne). Three volume editors, Marie Landry, Alexander McAdam, and Robin Patel, have returned for another edition. We are also grateful to the returning section editors, Jean Patel, J Stephen Dumler, Elisabeth Nagy, Johann Pitout, Yi-Wei Tang, Elizabeth Johnson, and Gary Procop.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0003">One-third of all authors who contributed content to this edition represent countries outside the United States and ensure that the<emphasis>Manual</emphasis>’s impact is global. There were 108 authors who contributed content to the <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> for the first time.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0004">This edition of the<emphasis>Manual</emphasis> contains 155 chapters comprising over 3,000 pages. The overall organization of the <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> and the chapter formats are quite similar to those of the twelfth edition. Authors of each chapter have updated content on taxonomy, the microbiome, rapid diagnostics, and antimicrobial resistance and its detection where appropriate. The application of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for organism identification, first discussed in the 11th edition, has been adopted by many laboratories, and discussions on the utility of this technology have been expanded. More content on molecular techniques, such as multiplex syndromic panel testing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) applications, can be found not only in the specific introductory chapters in <ulink url="ch0015#ch0015s0100">section I</ulink> but also in most of the organism-specific chapters. Highlights of new content in all four volumes are summarized in the following paragraphs.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0005">In<ulink url="ch0015#ch0015s0100">section I</ulink> (Diagnostic Strategies and General Topics), a new chapter on diagnostic stewardship was added, presenting practical information for daily improvements in test utilization and ways to collaborate with antimicrobial stewardship teams. Although they are not new chapters, the chapters on the microbiome and molecular techniques were completely rewritten and updated by new authors.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0006">In<ulink url="ch0033#ch0033s0100">section II</ulink> (Bacteriology), taxonomic changes among the <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> were accommodated by reorganizing some of the existing chapters and creating a new separate chapter on <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> species. In addition, for the chapters on anaerobes, readers will note many new family, genus, and species names in this edition, as a consequence of microbiome research and applications of newer molecular methods, such as whole-genome sequencing. Many of these new taxa have been added to updated databases of MALDI-TOF MS instruments, and this may serve to draw attention to their importance in human health and disease. Although the authors and editors of the relevant chapters on <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ochrobactrum</emphasis> acknowledge the reclassification of <emphasis>Ochrobactrum</emphasis> species into the genus <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis>, a decision was made not to adopt these nomenclature changes in this edition of the <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> out of concern for the potential negative impact such changes may have on patient care.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0007">Antimicrobial resistance, particularly among Gram-negative organisms, continues to challenge microbiology laboratories and clinicians. New phenotypic methods for detection of carbapenemases, as well as platforms for detection of the genes that encode resistance, are becoming requisite assays for clinical microbiology laboratories. All the chapters in<ulink url="ch0088#ch0088s0100">section III</ulink> (Antibacterial Agents and Susceptibility Test Methods) present this information in a comprehensive and practical manner, along with the latest CLSI and EUCAST recommendations for testing and reporting. In addition, the chapter describing susceptibility testing of the aerobic <emphasis>Actinomycetes</emphasis> (<ulink url="ch0097#ch0097s0001">chapter 79</ulink>) was extensively revised.</para>
      <anchor id="ch0016s0000a0002"/>
      <beginpage pagenum="4"/>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0008">Some newly designated organisms may not be recognized by conventional phenotypic testing and may not be found in the databases of FDA-cleared identification devices. These species may require gene sequencing, use of microarrays, or perhaps mass spectrometry for accurate identifications. A notable example in mycology is the recognition of<emphasis>Candida auris</emphasis> as an antifungal-resistant and highly transmissible agent that can presently be identified only by molecular or proteomic methods. This will pressure clinical microbiology laboratories to either adopt newer technologies or place greater reliance on reference laboratories when it is important to know the contemporary identities of significant organisms. This approach offers an opportunity for dialogue between clinical microbiologists and the clinicians whom they serve regarding the situations in which intensive identification efforts are justified.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0009">The structure of volume 3 (virology) and volume 4 (mycology and parasitology) is largely the same as that found in the twelfth edition. In<ulink url="ch0099#ch0099s0100">section IV</ulink> (Virology), the industry transition from culture to molecular methods for identification continues to be emphasized. While all virology chapters were updated to include the latest advances, the most transformative changes have been due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Significant updates to <ulink url="ch0112#ch0112s0001">chapter 93</ulink> (“Coronaviruses”) have been made to reflect the significant impact of the COVID-19 (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) pandemic on laboratory diagnostics. These include the availability and role of antigen, serology, and nucleic acid amplification tests in the detection of SARS-CoV-2, as well as guidance regarding use and interpretation of these tests. In addition, NGS, which proved critical to our ability to understand and respond to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, is discussed in detail in the chapter on coronaviruses and in the chapter on viral resistance testing (<ulink url="ch0136#ch0136s0001">chapter 116</ulink>), particularly in reference to HIV. The chapter on parvoviruses (<ulink url="ch0129#ch0129s0001">chapter 110</ulink>) was expanded to include greater discussion of the more recently discovered parvoviruses, and the chapter on poxviruses (<ulink url="ch0130#ch0130s0001">chapter 111</ulink>) includes significant updates specific to poxvirus content in light of the international outbreak of monkeypox that began in May 2022.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0010">As with the bacteriology chapters, the chapters in volumes 3 and 4 reflect the tremendous advances in molecular taxonomy resulting in the reclassification of many different organisms, the recognition of several so-called cryptic species, and the discovery of several “new” pathogens, as molecular and proteomic tools make their way from the research setting to the clinical laboratory. The mycology and parasitology chapters have been substantially updated to reflect increased understanding of eukaryote evolution based on multilocus phylogenetic analysis. This resulted in significant revisions to relevant chapters and will continue to require ongoing revisions relevant to the classification and naming of many different fungal organisms, as well as the recognition of genetically distinct cryptic species within many medically important fungi. The rules of fungal nomenclature have also evolved in parallel with new taxonomic approaches, resulting in the “one fungus, one name” system. An updated overview chapter on taxonomy, classification, and nomenclature of fungi (<ulink url="ch0138#ch0138s10001">chapter 117</ulink>) seeks to demystify some of the complexity and sets the scene for the more in-depth discussions on different medically important fungal groups in the subsequent chapters. The dermatophyte chapter (<ulink url="ch0148#ch0148s0001">chapter 127</ulink>) has been expanded by including newly reclassified genera/species (<emphasis>Arthroderma, Nannizzia, Paraphyton</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Lophophyton</emphasis>). In <ulink url="ch0152#ch0152s0001">chapter 131</ulink>, <emphasis>Lacazia loboi</emphasis> is now considered an uncultivated <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> species, and <emphasis>Paralagenidium</emphasis> is included as a new pathogenic oomycete. A major revision for microsporidia has been made in <ulink url="ch0153#ch0153s0001">chapter 132</ulink>. Minor changes have occurred in the realm of medical parasitology, with the recognition of new species and genera. For example, several cestodes in the genus <emphasis>Diphyllobothrium</emphasis> now fall within the genera <emphasis>Dibothriocephalus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Adenocephalus</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0011">The discussion of antifungal susceptibility testing methods illustrated in<ulink url="ch0157#ch0157s0001">chapter 135</ulink> covers tests for new fungi showing emergent resistance, newer antifungal agents, and new clinical and epidemiological cutoff values provided by both CLSI and EUCAST. Exciting developments of new antifungal agents are discussed in more detail in <ulink url="ch0155#ch0155s0001">chapter 133</ulink>, and updated knowledge on resistance mechanisms is covered in <ulink url="ch0156#ch0156s0001">chapter 134</ulink>. There have been some intriguing developments in the detection and identification of fungal pathogens, as discussed in individual fungal group chapters as well as an overview in <ulink url="ch0141#ch0141s0001">chapter 120</ulink>.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0012">Lastly, it is important to note the significant negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the neglected tropical diseases, including the diversion of limited health resources and temporary cessation of global vaccination programs. The impacts from the ongoing pandemic are likely many and may be noted for many years to come.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0013">Now in its sixth decade, the<emphasis>Manual</emphasis> strives to continue to be the leading, most authoritative reference for the “real-world” practice of clinical microbiology. In order to create and assemble each edition, this publication builds on the content of past editions, a process requiring 3 years of careful planning, design, writing, and review of chapters before the final phases of copyediting, composition, printing, and binding. In the intervening 1 to 2 years from the time of chapter acceptances until printing, new diagnostic trends, technologies, pathogens, and patterns of infectious diseases may emerge or change in ways that affect the timeliness and relevance of this comprehensive reference. To address this limitation, essential chapter updates will be available between print editions for the first time ever on <ulink url="http://ClinMicroNow.org">ClinMicroNow.org</ulink>, a service from the American Society for Microbiology in partnership with Wiley. This will allow MCM to keep pace with emerging pathogens, rapid changes in taxonomy, and developments in diagnostic modalities.</para>
      <para id="ch0016s0000p0014">In the era of mass collaboration and rapid communication, our team at the<emphasis>Manual</emphasis> trusts that each of you, our readership, will contribute to the future of this field by identifying issues and trends that will strengthen the <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> and its next edition. The work never stops, and the knowledge base keeps growing. The EICs are grateful to our authors for assisting us with adding substantially to our knowledge. So let us all continue to enhance the practice and contribute to the evolution of our cherished profession of clinical microbiology.</para>
