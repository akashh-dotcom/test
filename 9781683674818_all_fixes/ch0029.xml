      <para id="ch0029s000000p0001">Much has changed since the 1880s, when Robert Koch worked with<emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> on the open bench. Today’s advanced laboratory design, equipment, and practices provide laboratorians with a much safer working environment. This significant evolutionary process began in the 1940s with work performed by biological defense programs handling highly infectious agents. Concerns regarding laboratory-acquired infections grew, and in 1961, G. Briggs Phillips wrote “Technical Study 35: Microbiological Safety in U.S. and Foreign Laboratories” (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0005">1</link>). He studied 102 laboratories in 18 countries and noted great variation and limited success in the methods used to control laboratory-acquired infections. He concluded that prevention of laboratory-acquired infections required a broad, systematic approach that should not be limited to the implementation of technical controls. He recognized that laboratory management has the responsibility to direct and support the laboratory safety program. He further recognized the impact of laboratory design on safety.</para>
      <para id="ch0029s000000p0002">However, laboratory exposures to infectious agents and laboratory-acquired infections have continued to plague us despite the evolution of biosafety practices and equipment through the decades. Exposures occur through needlestick and sharps injuries, inhalation of aerosols, ingestion, ocular splash, mucosal splash, contact with contaminated surfaces, and unknown routes (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0006">2</link>). Among these routes of transmission, aerosols constitute the majority of attributable causes for laboratory-acquired infections (35 to 65%), followed by percutaneous injuries (25%) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0007">3</link>). Additionally, when aerosols are implicated, persons working in adjacent workspace are sometimes affected. When researchers reviewed the distribution of injury (without mention of infection) types among public health laboratories and Minnesota hospital laboratories in 1986 (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0008">4</link>), they found that 63% of hospital laboratory injuries were needlesticks, 21% resulted in cuts or scrapes, and inhalation, ingestion, and skin injury accounted for only 1% of laboratory-associated injuries. Later, Sewell looked at the agents most frequently reported in laboratory-acquired infections in the United States and Great Britain (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0006">2</link>). Topping the list was typhoid fever, followed by Q fever, brucellosis, and tuberculosis. In a regularly repeated informal survey of laboratorians, “recent” tuberculin skin test (TST) conversions among staff were recalled in 8 to 30% of those surveyed, and in a review of 15 incidents involving mycobacterial cultures (e.g., poorly functioning biosafety cabinets, broken bottles, or faulty autoclaves), 31.5% of exposed laboratory staff had TST conversions (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0009">5</link>). Working with cultures of <emphasis>Neisseria meningitidis</emphasis> poses significant risk for laboratorians. It is estimated that clinical laboratories in the United States detect 3,000 isolates of invasive <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> per year (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0010">6</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029s000000p0003">The true incidence of laboratory exposures and laboratory-acquired infections remains unknown, since there are no laws mandating reporting in most jurisdictions of the United States. Where reporting is not mandatory, the incidence of laboratory-acquired infections is probably significantly higher than the number of cases reported in the literature. In Canada, where mandatory reporting has been in place since 2016, 44 to 89 exposures per year occurred (4.9 to 9.5 exposures per 100 licensed laboratories). Of the exposures, 4 to 6 presumed or confirmed laboratory-acquired infections occurred per year (0.5 to 0.7% of exposures) for a total of 21 suspected or confirmed infections. Laboratory-acquired infections were primarily attributed to enteric pathogens (<emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> spp., enterohemorrhagic <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>) and other bacterial pathogens (e.g., <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>). <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> infections were reported as well (1 case each) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0011">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0014">10</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0004">Simply stated, biosafety is protection of the laboratorian from acquiring illness due to pathogens handled in the laboratory. In contrast, biosecurity is protecting the pathogens from acquisition by those who would use them for harmful purposes. There have been several instances in recent history of using pathogens to cause harm. The most recent well-publicized event was the use of the U.S. postal system to send letters containing anthrax spores to selected media outlets and government personnel in 2001 (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0015">11</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0005">To classify pathogens, the United States and many other countries have categorized the pathogens into risk groups. The risk group classification applies only to laboratory work. Most countries rely on the World Organization for Animal Health, which categorizes animal pathogens into four groups according to their risk to animal and human health. The risk group determines the containment level required to work with the microorganism. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies microorganisms into four risk groups based on the potential severity of the disease they cause in humans or animals, their ease of transmission, and the availability of treatment. According to this classification system, WHO risk group 1 contains nonpathogenic microorganisms. Risk group 2 contains pathogenic microorganisms that can cause disease and have limited geographical importance. For risk group 2 pathogens, the risk of transmission is either nonexistent or weak, and treatment of infections with these organisms is successful. Risk group 3 contains microorganisms that can cause serious disease or epidemics; however, there are often effective vaccination and treatment options for these pathogens. Risk group 4 organisms cause extremely serious pandemics with high mortality rates, and typically there are no or limited prophylaxis or treatment options available. In the United States, the risk group classifications for biological agents can be found in the document<emphasis>Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0016">12</link>). In Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada publishes this information in its laboratory biosafety guidelines (available online at <ulink url="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/migration/cbsg-nldcb/cbs-ncb/assets/pdf/cbsg-nldcb-eng.pdf">https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/migration/cbsg-nldcb/cbs-ncb/assets/pdf/cbsg-nldcb-eng.pdf</ulink> and in print) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0017">13</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029s000000p0006">The designation of the biosafety level of laboratories is in accordance with their design features (e.g., safety equipment), construction (e.g., primary and secondary safety barriers), containment facilities, and use of safe laboratory practices (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0016">12</link>). A biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) laboratory is a basic laboratory designed for microorganisms that are unlikely to cause human or animal disease. A BSL-2 laboratory is a basic laboratory designed for pathogenic microorganisms that can cause disease for which effective treatment and preventive measures are available, and there is limited potential for spread of infection. BSL-3 laboratories are containment facilities designed for pathogens that usually cause serious disease but do not ordinarily spread from one infected person to another and for which effective treatment and preventive measures are available. The design of a BSL-4 laboratory is for maximum containment, used for pathogens that usually cause life-threatening disease, that are readily transmissible, and for which effective treatment and preventive measures are not available. Most clinical laboratories are BSL-2, where there are good laboratory practices in place and effective biohazard signage. In a BSL-2 laboratory, the work is performed on the open bench and sometimes in a biosafety cabinet, which is available for potential aerosol-producing procedures. Some clinical laboratories also have a BSL-3 laboratory available. In the BSL-3 laboratory, there are the same laboratory practices as in a BSL-2 plus special clothing, controlled access, and special engineering and design features, such as a sealed ceiling, walls, and floors, a pass-through autoclave, and double-lock doors; spaces around doors and ventilation openings should be capable of being sealed to facilitate space decontamination (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0016">12</link>). In a BSL-3 laboratory, all work is performed in the biosafety cabinet.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0007">Clinical microbiology laboratorians are at higher risk of exposure to an infectious agent than other laboratory sections because the pathogen present in each specimen is unknown. Clinicians rarely inform the laboratory of suspected pathogens. Some of the methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory require amplification of the pathogen. There is always risk in working with infectious pathogens; however, counterbalancing the risk is the obligation to perform the testing to meet the needs of the patient. The foundational components of a biorisk management program are the performance of risk assessments, selection of mechanisms to mitigate risk, assessment of staff competency, training, an active biosafety committee, performance of safety audits, collaboration with the occupational health program, and continual improvement of the biosafety practices.</para>

        <para id="ch0029s000000p0008">The biosafety risk assessment is a systematic process of evaluating the potential risks in any process or procedure that involves handling specimens or infectious agents. Conducting a risk assessment requires using a standardized method to assure reproducibility. At a high level, there are two broad categories of risk: agent hazards and laboratory procedure hazards (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0016">12</link>). The risk assessment is a critical tool to prevent laboratory-acquired infections. The performance of the risk assessment formalizes the process of careful examination of the work environment to detect potential hazards for laboratorians that may cause harm to staff during the course of their work. Each laboratory must conduct a risk assessment that is specific to the activities performed in that laboratory and must determine the relative level of risk each activity poses. An experienced laboratorian and the laboratory’s biosafety official should perform the risk assessment. When performing a risk assessment, practical experience and problem-solving skills are essential. The assessor needs to have knowledge of safety principles, modes of transmission, the hazards, regulatory requirements, and the facility. Following completion, both staff and management need to review the risk assessment document.</para>
        <para id="ch0029s000000p0009">The expected outcomes from the performance of a risk assessment are 2-fold. First, it provides information regarding a particular risk, and second, it reduces the risk to an acceptable level. By definition, risk is the probability that an event that could adversely affect health will occur following an exposure to a specified amount of hazard. Based on the identified risk, a risk control strategy is developed and risk control measures are implemented (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0018">14</link>). The biosafety risk assessment is a systematic process of evaluating the potential risks that may be involved in any process or procedure handling specimens or infectious agents. The risk from microbial hazards associated with a clinical specimen starts at the moment of specimen collection. Depending on the specimen type, the individual collecting the specimen is at risk of percutaneous injury, exposure to specimen droplets and aerosol, and personal contamination with specimen. Upon receipt by the laboratory, the risk continues. Handling of the external specimen container can present a risk if the exterior is contaminated. Specimen processing often requires manual handling of the specimen material, inoculating media, and preparing slides for staining. Each specimen does not pose the same risk, and each specimen type receives separate consideration. The specimen types received in a clinical microbiology laboratory range from blood and body fluids to feces and swabs. After the incubation of cultures, the risk continues during the examination of culture plates for growth. During the plate reading process, plated culture medium poses risk of aerosols when plates are opened (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0019">15</link>). The processes and procedures used to perform identification and susceptibility testing create further risk of exposure to the microbial pathogens.</para>

        <beginpage pagenum="267"/>
        <para id="ch0029s000000p0010">There is fundamental value in the performance of the risk assessment, since it ensures compliance with regulatory agency requirements. The findings of the risk assessment could be the basis for justification of space and equipment needs. Importantly, the risk assessment is an opportunity for evaluation of emergency plans and presents the opportunity to evaluate potential procedural changes.</para>
        <para id="ch0029s000000p0011">The risk assessment is not a one-time event. In general, the risk assessment should be performed before work begins in a new laboratory; whenever there is a move or renovation; when there is a significant amount of staff turnover (such that the historical memory of biosafety practices is lowered); or whenever an infectious agent, reagent, or equipment representing a new biosafety risk is introduced into the laboratory. Repeat the risk assessment when there are changes in the manufacturer or supplier of consumable materials (e.g., personal protective equipment [PPE], containers, waste disposal materials, media, and kits). If there has been a recent exposure, accident, or laboratory-acquired infection, repeat the risk assessment.<anchor id="ch0029s000000a0010"/><link linkend="ch0029s000000a0012">Table 1</link> lists examples of when to perform a risk assessment.</para>
        <para id="ch0029s000000p0012">To begin the risk assessment process, it is useful to create a matrix for the process steps, potential hazards, initial risk level, the mitigation, and the residual risk level (<anchor id="ch0029s000000a0011"/><link linkend="ch0029s000000a0014">Fig. 1</link>). In the case of a biosafety risk assessment, the hazard is a microbial agent, that is, a bacterium, virus, fungus, or protozoan. The assessor must review the host range of these microbes, with special concern for human pathogens. Identifying the hazards entails making a list of pathogens commonly encountered in the laboratory as well as other organisms that the laboratory can reasonably expect to encounter. All organisms, both routinely and rarely encountered, should be considered. The assessor should expect the unexpected and be aware of emerging agents and those commonly encountered in that region of the country. The public health department’s list of notifiable diseases can be helpful information in preparing the list of pathogens. However, it is unwise and wasteful of resources to be overly prepared for all possible pathogens. Risk assessments should focus only on the pathogens that a laboratory can reasonably expect to encounter. If a new agent emerges, consider the likelihood of encountering the pathogen in the laboratory, and update the risk assessment to include the new agent.</para>

        <para id="ch0029s000000p0013">After assembling the list of organisms that the laboratory may potentially encounter, it is important to review which of these pathogens reportedly have caused a laboratory-acquired infection. Evaluate each pathogen for risk based on its pathogenicity, virulence, transmissibility, and infectious dose. For the purpose of the risk assessment process, define pathogenicity as the ability or capacity of an infectious agent to cause disease, while virulence is the ability of an agent to cause disease and the severity of the disease it causes. Transmissibility is the ease of spread of the pathogen between persons or species by contact with an ill individual and/or his or her body fluids and how long an infected individual is infectious. The infectious dose is the amount of pathogen required to cause an infection in the susceptible host. Also, consider the length of survival of pathogens and likelihood of survival on contaminated surfaces. Additionally, consider the availability of a vaccine or other treatment options.</para>
        <para id="ch0029s000000p0014">Humans are vulnerable to exposure to infectious agents through several portals of entry and by various routes of exposure. Intact skin is an excellent barrier against nearly all agents, but mucous membranes, the eyes, nose, and mouth, and breaks in the skin provide portals of entry. Sharps represent a significant hazard in the clinical microbiology laboratory and may be just as hazardous as aerosols. Protecting against splash and splatter will provide protection against agents that infect through mucous membranes, the gastrointestinal tract, and the skin. The skin can also convey these organisms to the eyes, nose, and mouth. The aerosol route of infection requires special consideration, as specific protection with masks or respirators may be required depending on the nature of the pathogens handled. Using the information collected during the risk assessment, the pathogens are identified as low, moderate, or high risk, and a mitigation plan is developed.</para>

        <para id="ch0029s000000p0015">The next step is to identify laboratory procedure hazards. Review the activities that occur in the laboratory. There is a wide diversity of activities in an individual laboratory, and therefore, every laboratory should perform its own risk assessment. This includes a review of the written procedures performed by the laboratory and discussion of the activities with personnel in the laboratory. The review of work processes from a risk perspective leads to identifying the hazards in the laboratory.</para>

        <beginpage pagenum="268"/>
        <para id="ch0029s000000p0016">Based on the information gained by identifying the agents and procedure hazards, the laboratory should determine the appropriate risk mitigation. There are four categories of containment for risk mitigation available to clinical laboratories: (i) standard microbiological practices, (ii) safety equipment or primary barriers, (iii) PPE, and (iv) facility design and construction or secondary barriers (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0016">12</link>). Standard microbiological practices include handwashing policies, biohazard signage, and collection of specimens in leakproof containers. These microbiological practices are important administrative controls, require strict adherence, and must be strictly enforced (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0016">12</link>). Safety equipment or primary barriers include the use of a biosafety cabinet, which provides an enclosed, ventilated laboratory workspace for safely working with hazardous agents. Other safety equipment includes unidirectional ventilation controls, sharps containers, centrifuge safety cups, splash guards, and pipette aids (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>). The third option to mitigate risk is PPE. This includes gowns, gloves, face shields, masks, goggles, and respirators. For successful protection, staff must receive training on the proper use of PPE to provide protection. Proper donning and doffing are critical so that wearers do not contaminate themselves, others in the work area, the environment, or even others in the community. Wearing PPE while working at the biosafety cabinet is an example of how PPE use builds redundancy in protection. PPE protects only the person wearing it; the hazard is still present in the environment. The final risk-containment strategy is the use of facility design and construction (secondary barriers). There are barriers that mitigate risk at the level of the building envelope. An example of facility design containment is the BSL-3 laboratory space, in which the air is directly exhausted through HEPA filters to the outside. The four tools for containment and mitigation of risk work in synergy to create a safe work environment.</para>
        <para id="ch0029s000000p0017">Using every available standard microbiological practice, safety equipment or primary barrier, PPE, and secondary barrier of facility design and construction will not bring the risk to zero. It is not possible to eliminate risk completely in the clinical microbiology laboratory. The nature of the work dictates that there will always be risks associated with working with pathogens; however, this risk can and should be reduced to a level that is acceptable. There is always the potential for human error or another factor to consider. After determining appropriate mitigation for each process step, the laboratory must determine the risk that remains and its acceptability. Ideally, the acceptable risk of infection should be low whenever possible.</para>

The competencies needed for staff to work safely in the laboratory are based on the risk assessment. In general, competency categories may include knowledge of the biological hazards in the laboratory, knowledge of control measures to be used when working with biological materials, work practices to be used for working with biological materials, and what to do in an emergency. To perform the job duties safely, the microbiology staff must be competent with engineering controls, such as using the biosafety cabinet and successfully employing PPE.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0020">Staff competency is developed through training. Required training is based on the competencies needed, which are based on the risk assessment. Incorporation of training needs into the laboratory’s safety orientation program and continuing education is necessary to ensure compliance and optimal performance of staff. One example of specific training needs for optimization of biosafety is the donning and doffing of PPE. The order and procedures for donning and doffing may vary from laboratory to laboratory due to the diversity in laboratory activities and the types of PPE used. Therefore, each laboratory should train staff on the appropriate donning and doffing procedures specific to its practice. The facility may elect to provide the training or to select an outside vendor for training. Each facility should determine the best format for training. The training should include both written materials and examinations to ensure that employees have acquired the knowledge needed. Other areas of training include decontamination of work surfaces, spill response, and waste disposal. Besides training for routine activities, staff need training and drills to respond to emergency situations, such as a medical emergency of a colleague in the laboratory or a fire in the laboratory. Another training method is a tabletop or discussion-based exercise, which can occur during regular team meetings that serve to train staff on biosafety practices. Any actual event should be followed by an after-action report that reviews the event and determines how the laboratory can improve practices to prevent events in the future.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0021">Periodic audits, both internal and external, serve to monitor the effectiveness of the biosafety program. Daily monitoring of employee compliance with biosafety practices through observations made by managers and peers is a best practice. To maintain an effective biosafety program, it is important that employees not deviate from the safety practices. It is the responsibility of management to remind staff when biosafety practices are out of compliance and to determine if further training or other action needs to be taken. Regular monitoring helps to build the culture of safety in the facility by setting expectations. Periodic audits performed by knowledgeable peers—for example, a member of the biosafety committee—can be very helpful in evaluating the implemented controls to reduce risk, to ensure good compliance with biosafety practices, and to confirm biosafety equipment is appropriately maintained.</para>

Members of the safety committee should be experienced technical individuals with good critical thinking skills. It is best to rotate the membership of the committee so that it maintains a high level of enthusiasm. The committee should have a written charter that describes their level of authority and input into safety practices.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0023">An effective laboratory biosafety program requires the support of the occupational health department. Some host factors can place staff at increased risk of infection. For example, treatments or medications may have an immunosuppressive impact. Chronic diseases such as asthma, emphysema, or severe respiratory conditions can increase the risk of infection. Pregnancy is an immunosuppressive state. Some medications prescribed for staff could reduce their manual dexterity or reaction time. The preplacement medical evaluation is an excellent opportunity to identify preexisting medical conditions that may interfere with the duties of a specific position. Once the employee is in the position, periodic medical evaluations are useful and necessary. For example, annual clearance and fit testing are required to use a respirator. Periodic medical examinations can also serve to survey for subclinical disease, such as latent tuberculosis, and provide the opportunity to review with the employee the available vaccines. Just as immunosuppression can place staff at increased risk for a laboratory-acquired infection, so also can other host factors, such as stress, fatigue, mental status changes, and excessive workload. These factors are important variables that can result in the diminishing of staff work performance, and review of these factors with employees during periodic medical examinations is a practical use of time. The occupational health program maintains records of vaccination and exposures and can advise individuals on personal health matters that may impact their professional activities.</para>

        <para id="ch0029s000000p0024">It is most effective to treat the biosafety program the same as other quality management initiatives that occur in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Looking at the biosafety program in the same terms as other quality assurance activities allows continual improvement of the program and incorporation of the work into the normal processes of the laboratory. As with any quality improvement activity, measurement and evaluation are useful for improving the biosafety program. The European Committee for Standardization (<ulink url="https://www.cen.eu">https://www.cen.eu</ulink>) system, developed through the CEN Workshop Agreement (<ulink url="https://boss.cen.eu/developingdeliverables/cwa/pages/">https://boss.cen.eu/developingdeliverables/cwa/pages/</ulink>), is the first internationally recognized management system to address biological risks and improve biosafety and biosecurity performance. The CEN Workshop Agreement uses a consensus process to develop standards for use by stakeholders. It uses a management systems approach and incorporates the Plan-Do-Check-Act principle to improve biorisk management. Improvements are made by focusing on nonconforming events and a systematic process to identify and correct deficiencies to improve performance and control risk. Of note, the CEN Workshop Agreement recognized the importance of commitment from laboratory leadership to build a successful biosafety management system. This commitment results in providing adequate resources and in prioritization and communication of the biosafety and biosecurity policy. By establishing a biosafety management system, laboratory management improves process, prevents exposures, and diffuses biosafety management throughout the laboratory. By making biosafety management a quality assurance activity, all staff in the organization recognize their role in the quality assurance process. Periodic audits and reviews of risk assessments assist the continual improvement process. Education and training of staff further enhance continual improvement. Through this process, biosafety management gains measures and goals for improvement, such that improvement can be recognized.</para>
        <para id="ch0029s000000p0025">The policy of the laboratory must be to protect staff, contractors, visitors, the community, and the environment from the biological agents handled and stored within the facility. The fundamentals of the continual improvement process call for the use of policy, objectives, audits, analysis of data, risk assessment review, corrective and preventive actions, and management review. The biosafety risk management plan must engage everyone in the facility, including the laboratory director, management, biosafety officer, supervisors, technologists, technicians, and administrative support staff.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0026">Each laboratory needs to maintain a biosafety manual that contains directions for safety practices and serves as a training resource. The biosafety manual also serves as written documentation of the safety program. It effectively communicates safety procedures so that all staff follow the same practices. The biosafety manual that is available to everyone is a best practice. Keeping the manual current with biannual revisions, or when there is a change in policy or practices, is essential. It covers the protocols or procedures used by the laboratory and the equipment used, the personnel present, and the pathogens covered in the laboratory. The responsibility for maintaining the biosafety manual should be assigned to the biosafety officer or other senior management personnel. In the biosafety manual, the international and national regulations and guidelines that impact the biosafety program are recorded. The facility-specific biosafety standard operating procedures, such as the use of PPE, are completely described in the biosafety manual. It also houses the facility forms and other templates for the biosafety program. The biosafety manual details the incident response program, the occupational health and medical surveillance program, and the respiratory protection program.<anchor id="ch0029s000000a0024"/><link linkend="ch0029s000000a0027">Table 2</link> provides examples of biosafety manual chapters, and <anchor id="ch0029s000000a0025"/><link linkend="ch0029s000000a0028">Table 3</link> shows examples of biosafety manual standard operating procedures, as compiled by one of the authors.</para>

Therefore, it is imperative that all laboratories have adequate access to sinks and soap for handwashing, ideally at all exits and entrances to the laboratory, and additional locations may be warranted in larger laboratories. Hands-free or automatically operated sinks are required for a BSL-3 laboratory and recommended for a BSL-2 laboratory. Effective handwashing procedures should be a component of the laboratory safety training program. The use of hand rubs should be seen as adjunctive and not as a replacement for soap-and-water handwashing. In some situations, the use of hand rubs has been demonstrated to be less effective in the <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> decontamination of certain key pathogens such as <emphasis>Clostridioides</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis>) <emphasis>difficile</emphasis>, where soap and water continue to be recommended for patients known to have <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> and during <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> outbreaks, and for nonenveloped viruses (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0024">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0030">26</link>). For proper hand hygiene, rings, bracelets, and watches should not be worn. Hands wearing jewelry are more likely to be colonized with pathogenic microbes than those without and are more likely to have higher numbers of commensal bacteria (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0031">27</link>).</para>

While wearing gloves for certain tasks is mandatory (e.g., when handling patient specimens, blood cultures, and potentially highly pathogenic organisms; when performing molecular diagnostic tests; when using the biosafety cabinet for any task; and when hands have open or inflamed lesions), wearing gloves can be optional for routine open bench work (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>). Gloves readily become contaminated during microbiology bench work, and their use has been shown to reduce the frequency of handwashing in health care staff (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0033">29</link>). Wearing contaminated gloves poses just as high a risk to self and others as do contaminated hands, and laboratory-acquired infections have occurred in laboratorians despite routine use of gloves (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0032">28</link>). The decision to require staff to wear gloves for routine microbiology bench work should be made through the risk assessment process. Facilities should weigh the impact of gloves on manual dexterity, the risk of glove contamination with subsequent contamination of self or surfaces, and the potential for reduced compliance with handwashing protocols against the potential benefit of reducing the risk of infection and colonization. When gloves are used, they must be changed frequently and removed and discarded when the individual leaves or changes work areas or if they become visibly contaminated, at which time handwashing is required (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>).</para>

Respirators for chemical protection are not sufficient for biohazard protection (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>). N95 masks and respirators must be fit-tested prior to being used for respiratory protection, and fit testing should be regularly (annually) documented (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>).

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0033">The selection of disinfectants for laboratory surfaces and instruments is determined in part by risk assessment-identified needs of the laboratory, the type of work performed (e.g., molecular diagnostics or mycobacterial cultures), and the type of surface that the disinfectant will come into contact with. For general use, several agents have antiviral claims for viral blood-borne pathogens as well as antibacterial claims for most routine pathogens (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>). Some also have antimycobacterial and sporicidal claims. There are several resources available to assist in the selection of disinfectants for specific uses (e.g., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provides a list of approved disinfectants at <ulink url="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants">https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants</ulink>). Alternatively, a 1:10 solution of household bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) with a final concentration of 5,000 ppm chlorine (~0.5%) can be used as a routine disinfectant if surfaces will tolerate it (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>). Regardless of the selection of surface disinfectants, the appropriate contact time must be used. Alcohol-based disinfectants should not be used alone to disinfect surfaces, as they readily evaporate, which does not allow adequate contact time (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>). For example, 70% alcohol can be used after disinfecting with a 1:10 dilution of household bleach to remove the bleach residue, which may damage a surface material. The process for decontamination of equipment should follow the manufacturer’s recommendation and the facility’s infection prevention and control plan (if applicable) and should be evaluated prior to the purchase of the equipment.</para>

These will vary somewhat depending on the type of work done by the laboratory but should minimally include screening for immunity to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and hepatitis B, with a provision of immunization when required, and provision of all routine vaccinations recommended for adults, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunization and influenza vaccination (in season) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>). Vaccination to <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> A/C/Y/W135 and multicomponent <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> serotype B or meningococcal group B factor H binding protein should be offered to all microbiology staff who potentially work with isolates of <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis>. There is a significant risk to microbiology laboratory workers of acquiring occupational invasive meningococcal disease, while there is minimal risk associated with the vaccine (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0010">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0023">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0034">30</link>–<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0038">34</link>). Vaccination for uncommon pathogens, such as <emphasis>Coxiella</emphasis> and the agents of rabies, typhoid, smallpox, anthrax, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis, and noncommercially available vaccines should be considered only for laboratory staff working directly with these pathogens or vectors infected with them. The bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis is not generally recommended for laboratory workers (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0039">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0040">36</link>). Recent guidance indicates that only staff at significant risk of exposure to tuberculosis, either by patient contact or laboratory exposure, should have a baseline assessment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0041">37</link>). Regular screening of laboratory staff is specifically addressed in a later section of this chapter. Both TST and interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) are suitable for this purpose, and a combination of the two can also be used, with the more specific IGRA being used as a follow-up to the TST or <emphasis>a priori</emphasis> in patients with a history of BCG vaccination after infancy (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0040">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0042">38</link>). Also, laboratory staff should be offered serial screening or screening based on a facility risk assessment for LTBI if their work brings them into potential contact with <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> on a continuous basis (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0040">36</link>). If an exposure has occurred, employees should be referred for potential LTBI treatment. Workers who have had tuberculosis infection (active or latent), regardless of treatment, can still acquire tuberculosis through work activities and cannot be monitored by either TST or IGRA (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0040">36</link>). These staff should be monitored by symptom evaluation and/or chest X-ray according to site policy. All records of immunization, immunity (serology), and screening tests such as the TSTs and IGRAs should be maintained by the facility in case of potential exposures (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>).</para>

Despite concerns with these pathogens, modern laboratory practices make the laboratory acquisition of these organisms an uncommon occurrence. There are nevertheless recent, well-documented instances where laboratory-acquired infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), <emphasis>Yersinia pestis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Bacillus anthracis</emphasis> have occurred (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0006">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0023">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0037">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0045">41</link>–<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0051">47</link>). However, a testament to the advances in laboratory safety is that despite widespread handling of SARS-CoV-2-containing specimens during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) 2020–2021 pandemic, there have been no reported cases of laboratory-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection attributed to handling specimens in clinical laboratories. It is estimated that the majority of laboratory-acquired infections can be attributed to <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> spp., enteric bacterial pathogens (<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Salmonella enterica</emphasis>), <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0006">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0011">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0014">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0023">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0037">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0045">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0046">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0049">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0052">48</link>). However, the relative occurrence of laboratory-acquired infections caused by common bacterial pathogens handled in the laboratory, including streptococci, staphylococci, <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>, and antibiotic-resistant organisms (e.g., methicillin-resistant <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>) is unknown and may represent a significant burden for which accurate estimates of incidence are unreliable (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0053">49</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0054">50</link>).

In Canada, where laboratory-acquired infection reporting is mandatory, 19 of 239 (7.9%) laboratory exposures between 2016 and 2019 implicated <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> spp., and 1 of 21 (4.8%) suspected or confirmed laboratory-acquired infections was brucellosis (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0011">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0014">10</link>). Attack rates after laboratory exposures in a comprehensive review of cases were 43% overall and 58% in laboratorians working directly with the cultured organism (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0055">51</link>). The most common route of laboratory-acquired infection is by inhalation of aerosols generated during handling (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0055">51</link>). Other forms of exposure include contact and ingestion (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0006">2</link>). Virtually all laboratory activities, including staining, plate handling, and biochemical and automated tests, have been reported as sources of acquisition (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0055">51</link>). There are several reports of individuals with only transient laboratory exposure acquiring brucellosis, providing a rationale for ensuring that all individuals entering clinical microbiology laboratories be recorded (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0055">51</link>). Although infections have been reported only in office staff without any obvious exposure to the laboratory (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0055">51</link>), others with transient exposure would potentially include housekeeping staff, industry representatives, students, residents, and equipment service personnel.</para>

Kubica described 15 separate incidents in which 80 of 291 (27%) exposed laboratory staff developed positive TST: eight exposures involved poor directional airflow, five were associated with biosafety cabinet failures, one was due to an autoclave failure, and one was associated with other equipment failure (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0009">5</link>).

The role of regular monitoring of serostatus for seronegative laboratory workers (by TST or IGRA) has recently come into question with the updated 2019 CDC recommendations for tuberculosis screening in health care workers. In these recommendations, the CDC states, “Health care facilities might consider using serial TB screening of certain groups who might be at increased occupational risk for TB exposure (e.g., pulmonologists or respiratory therapists) or in certain settings if transmission has occurred in the past (e.g., emergency departments)” (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0041">37</link>). The determination of increased risk should be done by an individualized risk assessment. It is the opinion of the authors that any seronegative laboratory employee who handles tuberculosis cultures would have a high occupational risk and should be offered regular screening by TST or IGRA. For laboratory staff who do not handle mycobacterial cultures, a risk assessment considering the types of specimen handled (e.g., sputa) and the prevalence of tuberculosis in the laboratory service area and among the patients tested should be made.</para>

In Northern Australia, despite the high prevalence of the organism in clinical specimens and the less stringent containment practices employed, melioidosis does not appear to be more common in laboratory workers, even after decades of exposure, than in the general population (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0087">83</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0088">84</link>).

The major route of infection in the laboratory is the accidental inhalation of infectious arthroconidia from the cultured organism, and the clinical presentation of laboratory infections is primarily pulmonary coccidioidomycosis (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0006">2</link>).

Merely opening the plates may release significant numbers of infectious arthroconidia, and dropping plates will release millions of arthroconidia. Because of the risk of airborne transmission, all cultures for filamentous fungi should remain in a dedicated laboratory space, and plates should be opened for examination within a biosafety cabinet. Because of the rapid growth of <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp., 2- to 5-day-old plates for bacterial culture of respiratory specimens with evidence of mycelial fungal growth, particularly those being reexamined after incubation at room temperature (i.e., discarded plates), should be examined only in a biosafety cabinet.

The most virulent viruses in this group include Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, Guanarito, Junín, Lassa, Machupo, and Marburg viruses and hantaviruses. Laboratory acquisition of Marburg virus, Sabia virus, and hantavirus is well documented (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0038">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0039">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0121">117</link>–<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0124">120</link>); some cases have resulted in deaths.

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0069">Specimens potentially containing agents classified as BSL-4 should be handled in a facility with BSL-4 capability if propagation of the agent could occur through testing procedures (e.g., cell culture) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0016">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>). The recent 2013–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, with several exported cases, required reconsideration of how specimens from suspected and confirmed cases should be handled, particularly specimens submitted for routine hematological, biochemical, and microbiological testing. Although details of recommended practice are beyond the scope of this chapter and will depend on local risk assessments, recommendations include providing dedicated point-of-care (POC) instruments (in appropriate containment) for most routine hematology, chemistry, and molecular diagnostic tests when possible, POC malaria testing, using limited and dedicated testing staff, and using general engineering controls and PPE. The external surfaces of specimen containers leaving the POC area should be decontaminated before the containers are sent to the main laboratory. Analyzers should use closed-tube systems (e.g., Vacutainer) and centrifugation should be minimized and utilize sealed rotors (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/laboratory-personnel/safe-specimen-management.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/laboratory-personnel/safe-specimen-management.html</ulink>). Despite use of closed-tube systems, recent evidence suggests that automated analyzers may become contaminated by viral nucleic acids of blood-borne pathogens such as HBV and HCV during routine use (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0132">128</link>). While the significance of this finding is not yet clear, an appropriate risk assessment and risk mitigation and decontamination plan should be in place if such instruments are used for processing of patient samples from individuals suspected of being infected with BSL-4 viruses. The use of blood culture instruments to incubate samples from patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola is generally considered safe, so long as bottles are decontaminated, gloves are used to handle the bottles, and subsequent subcultures are performed in a certified class 2 or 3 biosafety cabinet. However, some hospitals may opt to use manual monitoring or dedicated benchtop automated blood culture instruments after risk assessment. There is limited guidance for microbiological testing of other specimen types. These guidelines are available at <ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/laboratory-personnel/safe-specimen-management.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/laboratory-personnel/safe-specimen-management.html</ulink>.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0070">Agents that cause severe acute respiratory infections include a variety of emerging and novel viruses. Those that have garnered the most attention in terms of laboratory safety are the emerging coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) and influenza viruses (particularly avian and swine strains capable of infecting humans). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the latter part of 2019 provided an unprecedented challenge for diagnostic laboratories needing to provide diagnostic services while maintaining a safe and healthy workforce. While concerns related to laboratory-acquired infection came to light very quickly, to date no laboratory-acquired cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported. This is likely due to routine infection-prevention practices in place in most laboratories and the reliance on nucleic acid amplification methods for the diagnosis of infection, with culture capabilities being restricted to higher containment (BSL-3) laboratories. Samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing also require higher-level transport containment than exempt human specimens (UN 3373 Biological Substance, Category B), potentially encouraging a higher level of prudence in handling them. Given the apparent safety of handling these specimens in routine laboratory practice, laboratories using nucleic acid testing can be certified as BSL-2 facilities and handle SARS-CoV-2 specimens (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029s000000p0071">Once the safety of BSL-2 containment was confirmed to be adequate for most specimen handling, the more pressing concern with SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory became the in-laboratory transmission of virus acquired in the community and the associated need to maintain an adequate workforce despite illness and self-isolation requirements. Being essential workers and engaging in close contact with other workers, the laboratory workforce is at significant risk of community acquisition and in-laboratory spread of illness. Isolation during illness and isolation due to exposures may result in critical shortage (even collapse) of the laboratory workforce. To mitigate this risk, laboratory workers should closely follow recommendations for non-pharmaceutical interventions recommended by occupational and public health experts to reduce transmission in the workplace and community. When transmission is occurring at significant levels in the community, these minimally include regular hand hygiene, wearing a medical procedure mask at all times in the workplace, ensuring adequate physical distancing or physical barriers between staff, including in break and lunch areas, risk- and symptom-based screening questionnaires, and staying home when ill. Additional measures such as eye protection and mandatory or voluntary testing, and operational changes such as alternative shift strategies to reduce staff density, should be considered in consultation with occupational and public health. Some laboratory transmission models have suggested that arranging laboratory workforces into smaller teams and reducing consecutive days of work may reduce in-laboratory transmission (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0146">142</link>). Immunization is also a critically important strategy to control COVID-19 transmission in the laboratory (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html</ulink>). Priority immunization should be offered to all laboratory workers, particularly those involved in maintaining SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0072">Much has been learned in the control of emerging respiratory viruses with pandemic potential during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While other respiratory viruses (e.g., pandemic influenza) may have different characteristics, strategies to maintain a functional laboratory workforce and preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace are likely to be applicable to other viruses. Laboratories should ensure that procedures are in place to address in-laboratory transmission in future pandemics in order to ensure rapid response and maintenance of the essential workforce.</para>
      <para id="ch0029s000000p0073">Several laboratory-acquired cases of SARS-CoV-1 infection were reported from non-clinical (research) laboratories during the 2004 outbreak of SARS, confirming some risk to laboratory personnel (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0046">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0050">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0051">47</link>). Although no laboratory-acquired cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported, the same level of precaution should be considered (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0046">42</link>). Influenza presents a special situation for laboratory workers. Although there is very little occupational risk of acquiring influenza from clinical specimens containing seasonal influenza viruses (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0006">2</link>), there is the ever-present, albeit very low, risk of acquiring emerging highly pathogenic avian strains. While no cases of laboratory acquisition of avian H5 or H7 strains have been reported (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0046">42</link>), natural infections have been reported in a number of settings, including cases with high mortality (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0147">143</link>). For this reason, certain additional precautions may be recommended for handling of specimens potentially containing agents of severe acute respiratory infections. Although specific recommendations exist for specific pathogens, the recommendations for MERS-CoV generally include limiting viral culture and amplification to level 3 laboratories and handling (including nucleic acid extraction) of all potentially infectious specimens in a class 2 or 3 biosafety cabinet. Generally, molecular analyses of nucleic acids, routine bacterial and mycotic cultures, microscopy, and packaging and shipping can be done using routine precautions (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/guidelines-lab-biosafety.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/guidelines-lab-biosafety.html</ulink>).</para>

Some tissues are known to have high infectivity (brain and brain coverings, spinal cord, pituitary tissues, and eyes), while others have low infectivity (cerebrospinal fluid, kidney, lung, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow) and others have essentially no infectivity (blood, serum, urine, feces, and sputum) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0148">144</link>). Laboratory-acquired disease has never been described, but it could theoretically occur through percutaneous exposure to the infectious material or accidental ingestion of infective material (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0016">12</link>). Given the very low risk to laboratory staff and the absence of any evidence of laboratory transmission, it is generally assumed that standard BSL-2 precautions are adequate for handling clinical specimens in clinical microbiology laboratories, and the only recommendations for handling prion-containing specimens are adequate BSL-2 PPE and a decontamination procedure in case of accidental spills or contamination of instruments (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0016">12</link>).

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0075">Many clinical microbiology laboratories have adopted new technologies to assist in the identification and diagnosis of infectious diseases. Among these, the use of MALDI-TOF MS merits special mention with regard to biosafety. MALDI-TOF MS has revolutionized the identification of microorganisms and allows the rapid and definitive identification of most bacterial organisms and yeasts (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0149">145</link>). Mycobacterial and fungal identification is also possible, and the performance of fungal and mycobacterial libraries is significantly improving. MALDI-TOF MS also allows the rapid and accurate identification of highly pathogenic BSL-3 organisms, such as <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>F. tularensis, M. tuberculosis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp.; however, their identification relies on the existence of spectra representative of these organisms in the reference library and appropriate procedures for sample preparation (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0077">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0086">82</link>). Users should verify this before using MALDI-TOF MS in identification algorithms for BSL-3 organisms (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0077">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0086">82</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0150">146</link>). If libraries do not include spectra for the BSL-3 pathogens, identification will be impossible (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0086">82</link>). Furthermore, for some organisms, high-confidence misidentifications may occur with or without appropriate BSL-3 organism spectra in the library due to the spectral similarity between BSL-3 and other organisms (<anchor id="ch0029s000000a0069"/><link linkend="ch0029s000000a0071">Table 5</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029s000000p0076">It is important that microbiologists first determine if a biothreat agent is suspected before moving the isolate to a MALDI-TOF MS instrument for testing. If a biothreat agent is suspected, then laboratories should consider additional “rule-out” screening procedures in accordance with local or national guidelines. The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) publishes guidelines for laboratory protocols for suspected agents of bioterrorism, available online at<ulink url="https://asm.org/Articles/Policy/Laboratory-Response-Network-LRN-Sentinel-Level-C">https://asm.org/Articles/Policy/Laboratory-Response-Network-LRN-Sentinel-Level-C</ulink>. There is increasing evidence that MALDI-TOF MS could be used in the sentinel setting for identification of some biothreat agents with appropriate controls and sample preparation (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0077">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0086">82</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0150">146</link>–<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0152">148</link>). In addition, the rapid turnaround time for MALDI-TOF and minimal handling of cultures compared to traditional methods that often require multiple subcultures, organism suspensions, and tests may actually reduce the overall risk of laboratory-acquired infections caused by BSL-3 bacteria (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0153">149</link>). However, in the absence of further experience and suitable guidelines concerning the use of MALDI-TOF MS for this indication, it would be prudent for most laboratories to continue the screening procedures outlined above prior to using MALDI-TOF MS when a biothreat agent is suspected. The adoption of MALDI-TOF MS as a primary tool for suspected agents of bioterrorism should only occur if an appropriate risk assessment has been performed and if a decontamination procedure (e.g., inactivation or filtration) that has been adequately evaluated by the laboratory is in place. Regardless of how laboratories approach the presumptive identification of BSL-3 pathogens, all laboratories should have protocols in place for when a BSL-3 pathogen is identified by MALDI-TOF as organisms transferred directly to target plates may remain viable, albeit with reduced infectivity, despite matrix overlay and laser desorption. This could potentially result in exposures to laboratory staff handling target plates or performing instrument maintenance (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0150">146</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0151">147</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0080">Step 1 is to ascertain the nature of the exposure and infectious substance. Most laboratory exposures are percutaneous (e.g., needlestick injury or splash onto damaged skin), mucosal (e.g., eye splashes), or inhalational (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>). After the nature of the exposure has been determined, establishing the nature of the infectious substance allows an initial risk assessment (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0006">2</link>). In the clinical microbiology laboratory, infectious substances may be specimens or cultures. Samples may contain blood-borne pathogens (e.g., HIV or HBV) or high concentrations of other pathogens (e.g., <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> in sputum samples). In many cases, determining the potential for infection from a specimen may require additional (source) testing, including obtaining additional patient samples for testing for HIV, HBV, HCV, and other blood-borne pathogens. In the case of exposures to cultured organisms, the nature of the material is often known and its infectious potential is more readily ascertained. Any cultured organisms implicated in laboratory exposures should be stored until the end of the investigation in case further testing is warranted (e.g., antimicrobial susceptibility testing, typing, or sequencing to confirm laboratory acquisition). Once the nature of the exposure and pathogen is known, an initial risk assessment can be performed and may vary from essentially no risk (e.g., a culture plate containing <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> is dropped) to significant and widespread risk (e.g., a plate containing <emphasis>C. immitis</emphasis> is dropped in the main laboratory).</para>
      <para id="ch0029s000000p0081">Step 2 is to evaluate the need for environmental decontamination. Where there has been laboratory contamination, decontamination will be required. The extent of surface and air decontamination depends on the organism implicated in the exposure and type of contamination (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0006">2</link>). For airborne pathogens, such as <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp., affected areas should be evacuated until sufficient air changes have occurred for decontamination before the staff return (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0041">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0092">88</link>). Approximately six air changes are required to remove 99.9% of infectious particles from the air after an aerosolization event (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0041">37</link>). Staff must don appropriate PPE prior to reentering to decontaminate the environment. All potentially contaminated surfaces, including walls, floors, ceilings, counters, and equipment, should be decontaminated using an appropriate disinfectant, allowing adequate contact time. In cases of widespread laboratory contamination with airborne pathogens, it may be necessary to perform whole-laboratory decontamination using gaseous disinfectants (e.g., paraformaldehyde or hydrogen peroxide fumes) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0092">88</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0082">Step 3 is to ascertain the extent of the exposure. Determining the extent of the exposure and identity of those exposed is critical for the subsequent management of the exposure. The extent may be limited to a single person, as is the case for a needlestick injury, or it may consist of limited exposure, such as individuals working with or in close proximity to a culture of<emphasis>B. melitensis</emphasis>, or widespread exposure, as might be the case for a vortexed culture of <emphasis>Y. pestis</emphasis> in the main laboratory. In some cases, individuals visiting the laboratory may need to be contacted, providing justification for detailed sign-in documentation. In most cases, subsequent investigation and management will focus only on potentially exposed individuals identified at this stage of the investigation.</para>

Host susceptibility can be determined through vaccination records, pre-employment serological results, or in some cases history of the disease. If exposed personnel are known to be immune to the pathogen in question, typically no further investigation is required (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0130">126</link>). Where immune status is not known and testing is available, the serostatus of exposed persons should be determined as soon as possible after the exposure. Serology is available for many BSL-3 pathogens, and knowing pre- or peri-exposure serostatus will allow identification of subclinical infections (seroconversion), attribution of infection to the laboratory exposure, and risk stratification (previous natural infection may reduce the risk of laboratory infection in some cases) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0058">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0078">74</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0092">88</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0156">152</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0157">153</link>) (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/pdf/brucellosi-reference-guide.pdf">https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/pdf/brucellosi-reference-guide.pdf</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029s000000p0084">Step 5 is to offer prophylaxis where required. Depending on the organism and exposure type, prophylaxis may be considered for exposed persons (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0056">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0057">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0078">74</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0089">85</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0092">88</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0156">152</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0157">153</link>) (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/pdf/brucellosi-reference-guide.pdf">https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/pdf/brucellosi-reference-guide.pdf</ulink>). The decision to offer prophylaxis requires careful consideration of risks and benefits to the exposed individual and incubation period of the pathogen in question. Consideration must be given to the staff member’s immune status, the staff member’s pregnancy status, time since exposure, the organism in question, the risk of exposure (e.g., proximity to the infectious substance), possible contraindications, and the potential benefit of prophylaxis. The duration of prophylaxis should include the relevant incubation period and may be prolonged (e.g., 60 days for inhalational anthrax). Some suggested prophylaxis regimens for the more common laboratory exposures are summarized in <anchor id="ch0029s000000a0077"/><link linkend="ch0029s000000a0078">Table 6</link>.</para>
      <para id="ch0029s000000p0085">Step 6 is to provide clinical and laboratory follow-up for the development of infection. After a laboratory exposure, staff should be monitored clinically on a regular basis, with focus on the emergence of symptoms consistent with the exposure organism and febrile syndromes with or without a compatible focus of infection. The frequency and extent of clinical follow-up will vary according to the pathogen. For example, follow-up of exposures to tuberculosis should include questions on the development of fever, constitutional symptoms, and cough in addition to evaluation by TST or IGRA 3 to 6 months after the exposure (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0023">19</link>). In addition to clinical follow-up, serological follow-up is recommended for most exposures for which diagnostic serology is available. The frequency of serological investigations will vary according to the organism and presence of symptoms and may be multiple (e.g., <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> exposures) or single (once 6 weeks after <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp. exposures) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0052">48</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0056">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0057">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0092">88</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0159">155</link>).</para>

If the infection has not occurred as a result of a recognized exposure, the laboratory must investigate the potential exposures, identify and investigate additional exposed staff, and offer prophylaxis to exposed staff if indicated (staff who were potentially exposed and are still within the incubation period) (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0047">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0052">48</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0117">113</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0123">119</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0155">151</link>). If a laboratory-acquired infection is identified subsequent to a known exposure, it may be necessary to expand the investigation to include additional staff, offer prophylaxis to staff who were considered lower risk, and expand serological and clinical follow-up to include additional low-risk staff. Where possible and where permitted by law, the isolate causing disease in the staff member should be obtained and stored for potential comparative analysis to similar organisms handled in the laboratory around the time of infection, including stock organisms, control organisms, and patient strains.</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0087">Laboratory exposures and laboratory infections must have an established reporting protocol (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>) that was developed through collaboration between laboratory management and occupational health and national, state, and regional health authorities. At a minimum, notification of laboratory directors and supervisors, occupational health officers, relevant medical officers, and biosafety officers is required. Consultation with clinical experts is recommended for the exposed staff person (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>). If a work-related infection occurs, insurers and compensation boards may require notification. If the laboratory is located within a hospital complex, and particularly if the laboratory worker has patient or medical staff contact, hospital infection control officers may require notification. In the case of regionally or nationally notifiable diseases, the infection will need to be reported and investigated accordingly. Many countries are adopting legislation for monitoring laboratory-acquired infections and potential biosecurity lapses. As such, potential laboratory-acquired infections may, by law, require specific reporting at a regional or national level. In Canada, all potential laboratory-acquired infections must be reported to federal health authorities in accordance with the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act, and there is increasing pressure for centralized national databases of laboratory-acquired infections in the United States (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0053">49</link>). As a result of this reporting structure, detailed analyses of exposures, events leading to exposures, and the management of them have been published on a yearly basis, likely leading to better understanding of causes and prevention strategies (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0011">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0014">10</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0029s000000p0089">In parallel with the management of exposed or infected personnel, all laboratories where an exposure or laboratory-acquired infection took place must analyze and investigate the cause or causes of the exposure or infection, report their findings, and implement any changes in practice that are required to prevent similar events (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0020">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0155">151</link>). Part of this investigation will involve collection of information, staff interviews, review of laboratory procedures, and observation of laboratory workflow and practice. This will determine potential causal factors that led to the exposure or infection. Laboratories should then identify the root cause of the factors leading to the exposure and correct it. After correction, laboratories should ensure that the corrective actions were effective in the control of the root cause identified (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0014">10</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029s000000p0090">One of the most significant gaps in understanding laboratory accidents and biosafety failures has been the lack of adequate research and analysis of events leading to accidents. While case reports and a small number of case-control and cross-sectional studies have partially informed decision making and research in this area, there is a significant lack of systematic data collection and scholarly analysis of how human error leads to exposure events in microbiology (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0160">156</link>). Systematic data collection has begun in some countries, with yearly analysis and reports being published; however, the widespread adoption of these standards remains elusive (<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0011">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0029s000000li0014">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s000000li0053">49</link>).
