        <para id="ch0111s000000p0002">Human rhinoviruses (RVs) are members of the family<emphasis>Picornaviridae.</emphasis> Previously a separate genus, RVs have been reclassified into three separate species (A, B, C) within the <emphasis>Enterovirus</emphasis> genus (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0001">1</link>). Other <emphasis>Picornaviridae</emphasis> genera that are pathogenic for humans include <emphasis>Parechovirus</emphasis>, members of which have been associated with respiratory disease, and <emphasis>Hepatovirus.</emphasis> Recently, the <emphasis>Cardiovirus</emphasis> genus has been found to contain human pathogens as well (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0002">2</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0003">RVs derive their name from the predominant site of their replication and symptomatology, the nose. RV isolates were originally classified into 99 serotypes (RV1 through 99) based on neutralization with type-specific antisera; subsequent sequencing studies have shown that there are in fact many more types that have not been cultured and typed serologically (see below). While some cross-neutralization occurs, there is no common group antigen (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0004">4</link>). RV serotypes were further classified into two species, RV-A, containing 74 serotypes, and RV-B, containing 25 serotypes based on sequence relatedness. The original 99 RV prototype strains isolated in the 1960s and 1970s have been propagated and maintained by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). One former RV serotype, RV87, has been shown by sequence analysis to be an acid-sensitive strain of enterovirus (EV) D-68 (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0006">6</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0004">RV serotypes can be further divided into two groups based on receptor binding (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0008">8</link>): (i) a major group (63 RV-A and 25 RV-B serotypes) that binds intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family that is expressed on the surface of many different cells (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0009">9</link>); and (ii) a minor group (11 RV-A serotypes) that binds to members of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0008">8</link>). Two different drug-reactivity groups of RVs have also been identified based on composite sensitivities across a panel of antiviral compounds (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0010">10</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0005">The wider use of molecular methods in viral diagnostics has led to the discovery of a novel group of RVs identified in patients with lower respiratory tract disease (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0011">11</link>). Classified as a new species, “C,” these viruses are not new or recently emerging viruses (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0012">12</link>), but have been circulating unnoticed due to their lack of growth in standard cell culture systems used for RV isolation. Subsequently, RV-C viruses were grown in human sinus epithelium organ cultures (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0013">13</link>) and air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of differentiated airway epithelial cells (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0015">15</link>). RV-C was recently discovered to utilize cadherin-related family member 3 receptor (CDHR3) for host cell entry (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0016">16</link>). CDHR3 is a transmembrane protein that has been found in human lung, bronchial epithelium, and cultured airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, a coding single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6967330, C529Y) in CDHR3 showed enhanced binding efficiency for RV-C and increased virus production, suggesting that the Tyr529 variant could be a risk factor for RV-C associated childhood wheezing and asthma hospitalization (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0017">17</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0006">Sequencing of the complete genome of the 99 RV-A and -B serotypes and available RV-C strains confirmed clustering of all strains into three distinct phylogenetic groups (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0018">18</link>). Because serotyping RV-C was not possible due to their limited growth in cell culture, a genetically based classification system was developed for assigning RV genotypes while retaining the serotype numbering system (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0019">19</link>). To date, 57 RV-C genotypes have been assigned using a threshold of ≥13% nucleotide differences in the VP1 coding region from all RV prototype strains or ≥10% nucleotide difference in the VP4/VP2 region if the VP1 sequence is unavailable; thresholds of ≥13% and 12% nucleotide differences in VP1 for RV-A and RV-B type assignments, respectively, were also proposed (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0020">20</link>). Using the above thresholds, types A44, A95, and A98 have been abolished and combined into types A29, A8, and A54, respectively (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0020">20</link>). Designation of an additional nine RV-A and six RV-B genotypes brings the total number of currently recognized RV types to 168.</para>

        <para id="ch0111s000000p0007">The RV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA, approximately 7,200 nucleotides in length. The genome comprises a 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) coupled with a small viral protein (VPg) that serves as a primer for genome replication (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0021">21</link>), followed by a single open reading frame that terminates in a 3′ poly(A) tail (<anchor id="ch0111s000000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0111s000000a0007">Fig. 1</link>). Secondary structures within the 5′ UTR, a cloverleaf domain and an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), are necessary for protein translation. The single polypeptide product of the open reading frame is subsequently proteolytically cleaved into 11 viral proteins: 4 structural proteins that form the viral capsid (1A-1D or VP4-VP1) and 7 nonstructural proteins that are involved with virus replication or polyprotein processing (2A-2C and 3A-3D). The 3C protease participates in polypeptide cleavage and is a target for antiviral drugs.</para>

        <para id="ch0111s000000p0008">The RV virion is a small (20 to 27 nm in diameter), nonenveloped icosahedron composed of 60 protomeric units each consisting of the four structural protein subunits (VP1 through VP4). VP1, VP2, and VP3 reside on the exterior of the virion and make up its protein coat. VP1 is the largest, most external and immunodominant protein of the virus capsid (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0022">22</link>). A number of major neutralization sites reside in the VP1 proteins. Located within VP1 is a hydrophobic pocket into which antiviral compounds such as pleconaril bind (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0023">23</link>). VP4 resides inside the protein shell. X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy studies have identified large depressions or “canyons” on each of the 60 protomeric units, which appear to be sites for cell receptor binding and also play a critical role in conformational changes that follow attachment (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0024">24</link>). Conformational changes in the canyon floor can also be induced by certain antiviral agents, thus inhibiting virus attachment to cells or virus uncoating (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0023">23</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0009">RVs replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells, producing infectious virions that sediment at a buoyant density of 1.40 g/liter in cesium chloride. Empty capsids and defective particles lacking one or more structural polypeptides are also produced.</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0010">Mutation and recombination are two mechanisms that drive the extensive genetic diversity of RVs and serve as the basis for RV evolution. The 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which facilitates synthesis of new viral genomes has no proofreading capacity and frequently generates mutations. Evidence of recombination between RV-A and RV-C within the 5′ UTR has also been shown: the 5′ UTR sequences of some RV-C genotypes cluster within the RV-A clade on phylogenetic analysis (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0026">26</link>). Although RV-B and RV-C show little evidence of recombination within the genome coding region, recent studies have shown that RV-A sequences have undergone extensive intraspecies recombination during the early stage of diversification into types, and several contemporary RV-A strains have been formed by recombination (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0028">28</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0011">As they have no lipid envelope, RVs are fairly resistant to inactivation by organic solvents such as ether, chloroform, ethanol, and 5% phenol. Although RVs are relatively thermostable, heating at 50 to 56°C progressively reduces infectivity. RVs are traditionally differentiated from EVs by their loss of infectivity upon exposure to pH 3 for 3 h at room temperature, though this may not be the case with all serotypes and strains.</para>

        <para id="ch0111s000000p0012">RV infections are widespread and occur year-round. In temperate zones, transmission typically peaks in autumn and late spring (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0029">29</link>). Some recent studies using molecular methods have also found substantial infections in summer and winter (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0029">29</link>–<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0031">31</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0013">Seasonal fluctuations have been attributed to improved survival of RV in conditions of high relative indoor humidity and herding together of children when school opens in the fall (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0032">32</link>). RV-A and RV-C may cocirculate in equal proportions or may alternate as the predominant species (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0033">33</link>–<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0035">35</link>); RV-B is consistently less frequently detected (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0035">35</link>). As the disease burden and diversity of RV infections have become evident, the interest in RV genotyping, molecular epidemiology, and virulence has intensified (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0012">12</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0014">Studies in volunteers have shown that inoculation of virus into the nose or conjunctiva is the most efficient way to initiate infection, although virus can also be transmitted by aerosol inhalation (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0037">37</link>). RV is present in highest titers in the nose of infected persons and commonly contaminates their hands and surrounding surfaces. Consequently, investigators have found that RV can be transmitted via hand-to-hand contact (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0038">38</link>) or by contaminated fomites, followed by self-inoculation of virus into the nose or conjunctiva (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0039">39</link>). Furthermore, transmission can be interrupted by using tissues impregnated with virucidal agents for nose blowing, by treating surfaces with disinfectant, or by applying iodine to the fingers (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0041">41</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0015">RVs replicate primarily in airway epithelium, but also in the middle ear and sinuses, with an incubation period of 1 to 4 days (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0042">42</link>). Peak of virus shedding coincides with the acute rhinitis. Symptoms last 7 days on average, but can persist for 12 to 14 days or more (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0043">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0044">44</link>), and typically include profuse watery discharge, nasal congestion, sneezing, headache, mild sore throat, cough, and little or no fever. The virus may no longer be recovered in cell culture after 4 to 5 days of symptoms; however, in other cases, the virus may be recovered at low titers for up to 3 weeks (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0045">45</link>). Asymptomatic RV infections are also common, occurring in 20 to 30% of infected persons (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0046">46</link>–<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0048">48</link>). Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RV RNA has been detected by some investigators for 4 to 5 weeks after the onset of symptoms and, surprisingly, for 2 to 3 weeks prior to onset of symptoms (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0049">49</link>). However, genotyping has revealed that such prolonged shedding often represents a series of sequential RV infections with different RV types, some asymptomatic (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0050">50</link>). As many as 74 distinct RV types have been found to be cocirculating, including multiple types in the same household (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0051">51</link>).

        <para id="ch0111s000000p0017">RVs cause approximately two-thirds of cases of the upper respiratory syndrome known as the common cold, and thus are responsible for more episodes of human illness than any other infectious agent (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0040">40</link>). Although considered a trivial illness, the common cold is acutely disabling, and its cost, in days lost from work, cold remedies, and analgesics, is estimated at $40 billion annually in the United States (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0058">58</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0018">With the use of molecular methods, more severe consequences of RV infections have been increasingly recognized. RVs can cause sinusitis and otitis media as well as facilitate secondary bacterial infections (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0059">59</link>–<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0061">61</link>). RVs have been implicated as the major viral cause of exacerbations of asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0062">62</link>–<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0065">65</link>). Indeed, RV wheezing illness in infancy has been linked to childhood-onset asthma in genetically susceptible children (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0066">66</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0067">67</link>). The impact of disease in the elderly is also substantial. In a Canadian study, 59% of outbreaks of respiratory disease in long-term-care facilities were found to be due to RVs, with some cases being severe (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0068">68</link>).</para>

RVs are commonly found either singly or in combination with other viruses. RVs have been shown to impair the innate immune response (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0085">85</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0086">86</link>) and may predispose to invasive pneumococcal disease in children and bacterial superinfections in persons with COPD (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0061">61</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0086">86</link>–<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0088">88</link>). Interestingly, recent studies have also shown that RV infection induces an interferon-mediated innate immune response that inhibits both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A virus replication within human airway epithelial cells (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0089">89</link>–<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0091">91</link>).</para>

The receptor for RV-C, CDHR3, has been identified as a susceptibility locus for asthma exacerbations (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0017">17</link>).

        <para id="ch0111s000000p0024">In natural infections, RV can generally be isolated in culture from 1 day before to 6 days after onset of cold symptoms, but is shed in highest concentration on day 1 or 2 of illness. In upper airway disease, RV is excreted in highest titers from the nose, and thus nasal rather than throat specimens should be obtained for diagnosis.</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0025">Early comparisons of nasal wash, nose swab, throat gargle, and throat swab specimens for the isolation of RV from clinical specimens revealed nasal wash to be the best (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0106">106</link>). Nasal wash specimens are obtained as follows: Tilt the patient’s head backwards and instill 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into one of the nostrils. Then ask the patient to lean forward and allow the washing to drip into a sterile petri dish or other collection container. Repeat with the other nostril until each nostril has been washed with 5 ml of PBS. The washings are then transferred into a sterile container. However, nasal wash samples are cumbersome to obtain in most clinical settings and may be suboptimal for other respiratory pathogens.</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0026">For many years, nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirates have been the standard for infants and young children, but the most convenient and commonly collected sample at present is an NP swab placed in viral transport medium (VTM). Well-collected NP swabs can provide detection rates comparable to those of aspirates and are simpler to obtain (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0107">107</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0108">108</link>). A recent study found that while nasal wash detected more RV positives than NP swabs, the difference was not statistically significant when flocked swabs were used (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0109">109</link>). Flocked swabs have been shown in some but not all studies to provide superior samples to cotton and some other swab types. Mid-turbinate flocked swabs have provided a yield similar to NP swab results, in one report, and are amenable to both self-collection and collection of samples from young children by parents (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0110">110</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0111">111</link>).

Sputum, including induced sputum in children, has been recently found to be useful for diagnosing viral lower respiratory tract disease (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0108">108</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0113">113</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0028">All specimens should be transported promptly to the laboratory. For isolation, best results are obtained with prompt inoculation of cell cultures; however, specimens can be held up to 24 h at 4°C in VTM with neutral pH. If longer delays are necessary, specimens should be frozen at –70°C and thawed just prior to inoculation. Freezing does not appear to be detrimental to RV recovery (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0106">106</link>). Similar sample handling is recommended for molecular analysis; however, the compatibility of various VTM with different extraction reagents must be confirmed in each laboratory, and manufacturers’ instructions should be followed for all commercial kits.</para>

RT-PCR assays have proven more sensitive than culture methods, doubling or even tripling the number of RV infections detected (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0114">114</link>–<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0117">117</link>), and are clearly superior for detection of noncultivable RV strains like RV-C. Nevertheless, culture can occasionally recover some RVs missed by RT-PCR due to variability in techniques and primer or probe mismatches (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0115">115</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0117">117</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0118">118</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0031">The first RT-PCR diagnostic assay for RVs was reported by Gama et al. in 1988 (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0119">119</link>). Since then, numerous molecular assays have been described. These assays typically target the 5′ UTR of the viral genome, which contains highly conserved sequences suitable for molecular assay development. However, most of these assays also detected EVs because the primer sets used were not able to effectively distinguish between these two virus groups. Earlier strategies to distinguish between RVs and EVs included differential amplicon sizing (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0120">120</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0121">121</link>), restriction enzyme digestion of a common-sized amplicon (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0122">122</link>), internal probe hybridization (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0118">118</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0123">123</link>), and nested PCR using RV-specific primers (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0097">97</link>) or annealing and extension times optimized for RV detection (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0116">116</link>). Most of these reported methods failed to detect or accurately differentiate all viruses tested, and none evaluated all RV and EV types. RT-PCR and sequencing of amplicons to differentiate RVs from EVs and for identifying virus types (see below) are now commonly used by specialized reference laboratories, but are still not easily implemented for routine clinical diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0124">124</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0032">At present, molecular methods are not standardized, and those published have differed in types of samples tested, methods of RNA extraction used, primer selection, amplification, and detection conditions.

Real-time amplification methods have the advantages of simplicity, reduced risk of amplicon contamination, ability to estimate viral load, and a shortened time to result, since detection occurs concurrent with amplification. Though less expensive than probe-based methods, results obtained using SYBR Green and melt-curve analysis can be difficult to interpret (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0044">44</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0111s000000p0040">Among the 12 FDA-cleared multiplex tests, only the eSensor RVP (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0147">147</link>) and the Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV assay claim to be specific for RV only (AdV/hMPV/RV Assay [Panther Fusion System] package insert: <ulink url="https://www.hologic.com/sites/default/files/2018-07/AW-16164-001_003_01_0.pdf">https://www.hologic.com/sites/default/files/2018-07/AW-16164-001_003_01_0.pdf</ulink>). All the others do not distinguish between RV and EV. Most commercial molecular assays require purchase of a dedicated instrument. In contrast, the FTD respiratory pathogens (FTDRP) multiplex assay (Siemens Healthineers, Germany) uses standard real-time hydrolysis probe chemistries and common real-time PCR instrumentation for detection of 21 respiratory pathogens, allowing easy integration into the workflow of laboratories already using standard real-time PCR platforms (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0148">148</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0041">At present, few clinical laboratories are either interested in or able to establish and validate a laboratory-developed test for RV, and even if available commercially, these assays may not be used unless they are part of a more comprehensive panel of respiratory pathogens.</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0042">These comprehensive multiplex assays have confirmed the frequent detection of RVs in culture-negative clinical samples and have revealed many mixed-pathogen infections. However, most are not quantitative, and all are costly to implement and maintain. Each commercially available system has its unique advantages and disadvantages, and users should determine which system is appropriate for their specific diagnostic needs.</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0043">Although much effort has been devoted to distinguishing RVs from EVs, in the clinical setting a single assay that detects both virus groups could ultimately prove to be advantageous since some antivirals may be effective against both virus groups (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0043">43</link>). Moreover, some EVs (e.g., EV-D68 and coxsackievirus A21 [CV-A21]) can also cause respiratory diseases (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0149">149</link>–<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0153">153</link>). Thus, some multiplexed assays have not attempted to separate the two genera, but instead target both (<link linkend="ch0111s000000a0022">Table 1</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0111s000000p0044">RV species A and B grow only in cells of human or monkey origin. RV species C has not yet been grown in conventional cell culture. Although the original isolation of RVs was in primary monkey kidney cells, these cells have not been consistent in yielding a broad range of isolates. The most commonly used cells in clinical laboratories have been the human embryonic lung fibroblast (HELF) strains WI-38 and MRC-5 (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0154">154</link>). WI-38 cells are significantly more sensitive than MRC-5 (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0106">106</link>), but MRC-5 cells are more commonly available. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) can also support RV replication. Unfortunately, different lots of normally sensitive cell lines have been found to vary over 100-fold in sensitivity to RV (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0154">154</link>); the reasons for this variation are not known. Therefore, for optimal results, simultaneous use of at least two sensitive systems is recommended.</para>
      <para id="ch0111s000000p0045">In the research setting, several HeLa cell clones, such as HeLa M or HeLa Ohio cells, HeLa H, HeLa R-19, and HeLa I cells, have been shown to support the replication of RVs to high titers (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0106">106</link>). HeLa I cells were found to be more sensitive than WI-38, MRC-5, fetal tonsil, HeLa H, or HeLa M cells for recovery of RV from clinical specimens (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0155">155</link>). A transduced HeLa-E8 cell line that stably expresses the RV-C CDHR3 receptor has recently been shown to support RV-C propagation (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0016">16</link>). These specialized cell lines can be obtained only from research laboratories.</para>
      <para id="ch0111s000000p0046">After inoculation, cultures are incubated in standard cell culture medium such as Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM) with 2% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at a neutral pH. To mimic conditions of the nose, cultures should be incubated at 33 to 35°C with continuous rotation in a roller drum to provide aeration of the monolayer. RV cytopathic effects (CPE) can be observed as early as 24 to 48 h after inoculation and are often detected by day 4. Passage of infected HeLa cell cultures may be necessary for some isolates before CPE are apparent. In fibroblasts, cellular changes are easier to read and are often detected earlier than in epithelial cell lines. Both large and small rounded, refractile cells with pyknotic nuclei are observed in foci that also contain cellular debris (<anchor id="ch0111s000000a0029"/><link linkend="ch0111s000000a0034">Fig. 2</link>). RV CPE are similar to EV CPE, but may sometimes be confused with nonspecific changes. The CPE progress over a 2- to 3-day period, with the degree of cellular change depending on the serotype and the inoculum dose. It should be noted that RV CPE can regress or virus may inactivate if left too long. Therefore, cultures should be promptly passaged. Passage is also necessary to increase viral titers prior to the performance of identification tests.</para>
      <para id="ch0111s000000p0047">HELF cell cultures should be observed for 14 days, with refeeding at 7 days to increase recovery of virus. HeLa cell cultures can be observed for only up to 7 to 8 days, when passage becomes necessary due to nonspecific cell degeneration and rounding.</para>
      <para id="ch0111s000000p0048">Rapid centrifugation cultures using the HuH7 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line have been reported to detect respiratory viruses including RV. After 4 days of incubation, RV can be detected in the amplified culture by RT-PCR. While results were faster, HuH7 cells were not as sensitive as MRC-5 conventional cultures incubated for 14 days (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0114">114</link>).</para>

Virus neutralization testing with type-specific antisera is time-consuming, costly, and not routinely available. In addition, the recently recognized RV-C strains do not grow in culture, and no neutralizing sera are available.</para>

Thus, a reduction in virus titer of 2 to 3 log<subscript>10</subscript> TCID<subscript>50</subscript> can be expected upon exposure of RV to low pH. To perform the test, first passage the isolate to obtain a minimum titer of 10<superscript>3</superscript> TCID<subscript>50</subscript>/ml. Then, prepare two solutions of a buffer such as HEPES, one at pH 3.0 and one at pH 7.0. Add 0.2 ml of unknown virus suspension to 1.8 ml of HEPES pH 3.0 and 0.2 ml of virus to 1.8 ml of HEPES pH 7.0. Keep the mixtures at room temperature for 3 h, adjust the pH to 7.0, make serial dilutions of the mixtures, and inoculate into cell culture. If the unknown virus is an RV, a minimum 2 log<subscript>10</subscript> reduction in viral titer should be evident in the acid-treated sample.

      <para id="ch0111s000000p0056">Molecular typing based on RT-PCR and amplicon sequencing has essentially replaced serotyping for type-specific identification of RVs. Because the RV VP1 capsid protein contains a number of neutralization domains that correlate with serotype, genotypic identification of RVs based on complete VP1 sequencing has been proposed using type assignment nucleotide difference thresholds of 13%, 12%, and 13% for RV-A, -B, and -C, respectively (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0028">28</link>). This change has led to only minor revisions of existing serotyping designation (such as reclassification of serotype pairs A8/A95, A29/A44, and A54/A98 as single serotypes). However, because of the high degree of sequence variation in the VP1 gene and surrounding regions, it has been difficult to design universal primers that will successfully amplify all RV strains, often requiring new primer designs and assay optimization when new RVs are recognized (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0160">160</link>). In contrast, genotyping based on sequencing the capsid VP4/VP2 protein genes has been widely used for RV genotyping in large epidemiological studies (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0071">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0097">97</link>) due to the availability of conserved regions for primer design that bracket the VP4/VP2 region.

        <para id="ch0111s000000p0062">In the clinical laboratory, screening for RV is rarely specifically requested. Historically, RVs were isolated in conventional culture when the suspected virus was influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Following the 2009 influenza pandemic, demand for user-friendly, FDA-approved respiratory virus molecular assays greatly increased, and many of the commercial highly multiplexed respiratory viral panels and respiratory pathogen panels target RV. In clinical laboratories that utilize one of these multiplex tests, RV is one of the most commonly identified viruses. The frequency of detection can even lead to the impression that RVs are “normal flora” and can be ignored.</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0063">Thus, the interpretation of a positive RV PCR result can be problematic. RVs are extremely common, occur in asymptomatic persons, are prone to cause serial infections, can be shed for weeks after symptoms resolve, and can occur as coinfections with other viruses or bacteria. Interpretation of a positive RV result in the individual case often relies on risk factors and recovery of other pathogens. While viral load quantification by rRT-PCR may help determine its role in the acute illness, quantitative standards and guidelines are not available and may not correlate in the individual case (<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0101">101</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0133">133</link>–<link linkend="ch0111s000000li0136">136</link>, <link linkend="ch0111s000000li0169">169</link>). Furthermore, the RVPs and RPPs that include RV detection do not generally provide quantitative results.</para>

Although therapy may not differ, more information is needed to determine whether differences in transmission, infection control measures, virus dissemination within the host, samples for diagnostic testing, and presence of extrarespiratory disease merit distinguishing RV from EV.</para>
        <para id="ch0111s000000p0065">For laboratories still performing culture methods, isolation of RV-A and B, though insensitive, can be accomplished using commonly available conventional cell systems, such as WI-38, MRC-5, or HEK. Incubation at 33 to 35°C and rotation of cultures provide optimal conditions for virus replication. Differentiation of RVs from EV, with which their CPE can be confused, is based on acid stability testing of isolates or more commonly by confirmation by RT-PCR.</para>
