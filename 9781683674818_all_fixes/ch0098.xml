      <para id="ch0098s0000p0001">The detection of antibiotic resistance is one of the most important responsibilities of the clinical microbiology laboratory. This is traditionally achieved by phenotypic testing (see<ulink url="ch0092#ch0092s0001">chapters 74</ulink> to <ulink url="ch0094#ch0094s0001">76</ulink>). However, a limitation of the phenotypic approach is its time requirement that may result in delays in appropriate therapy and may affect clinical outcomes (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0004">4</link>). As most clinically important antibiotic resistance has a genetic basis, molecular methods to directly detect resistance are theoretically attractive because they are rapid and automated and do not require bacterial growth. However, the molecular detection of resistance determinants also poses significant challenges, perhaps foremost of which is the genetic complexity of antibiotic resistance. Resistance can arise due to the acquisition of resistance determinants (e.g., β-lactamase genes) but can also reflect changes in gene expression (e.g., efflux pumps and porins) or the acquisition of mutations (e.g., fluoroquinolone target mutations). The detection of a resistance gene may not necessarily imply phenotypic resistance if the gene is expressed at low levels or is nonfunctional. On the other hand, methods based on genotype may actually be superior to those based on phenotype in some instances, such as when heteroresistance is present or if a resistance phenotype is only weakly expressed under <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> testing conditions (e.g., some methicillin-resistant <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> [MRSA] isolates, <emphasis>Klebsiella pneumoniae</emphasis> carbapenemases [KPCs], and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase [NDM-1]). An ever-expanding diversity of resistance determinants is likely to result in continuing problems with sensitivity of molecular assays. The presence of PCR inhibitors, inefficient extraction of nucleic acids, and other technical issues may also interfere with detection, so it is essential for assays to include internal controls. Another limiting factor for most clinical laboratories potentially interested in using molecular assays to detect antibiotic resistance is the considerable cost. Therefore, at the present time, molecular methods to detect antibiotic resistance among clinical isolates in the clinical microbiology laboratory are limited to a few common and well-defined resistance mechanisms. A number of investigational approaches appear promising, and the application of molecular diagnostic tools to detect antibiotic resistance is likely to become more widespread in the future. This chapter provides an overview of current FDA-cleared molecular assays for the detection of antibiotic resistance. In addition, some commercial assays in development are briefly discussed. Analyte-specific reagents and “home-brew” assays continue to play an important research role but are impractical for the typical clinical laboratory; the interested reader is referred to other sources (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0006">6</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0098s0000p0002">Although the use of molecular assays in the clinical microbiology laboratory is not new, recent technological advances have made it possible for laboratories to implement user-friendly instrumentation that requires little or no training in advanced molecular techniques. Testing can be performed directly on clinical specimens or on cultured isolates (e.g., positive blood cultures). Reference strains for assay validation may be readily obtained from sources such as the American Type Culture Collection and the CDC and FDA Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Isolate Bank (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0008">8</link>). Current FDA-cleared molecular technologies for the detection of resistance determinants are based on two methods: PCR and solid-phase microarrays. When these methods of molecular resistance detection are compared, a key distinction should be recognized. Nucleic acid amplification in real-time PCR may allow an assay to be performed directly from a specimen but limits the number of fluorophores that can be used for simultaneous target detection. One solution is to perform independent target amplification and detection steps. In the FilmArray (BioFire) system, the initial targeted multiplex PCR is followed by distribution of the products into individual wells for a second round of PCR and detection. In contrast to PCR-based technologies, solid-phase or liquid arrays can simultaneously detect hundreds of targets, but they require a high target copy number, limiting their ability to be used for the direct analysis of clinical specimens in which organisms are present in low numbers. Unlike PCR, there are only a few instances in which direct-from-specimen microarray technologies have been applied to detect antimicrobial resistance in the clinical laboratory (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0008">8</link>). However, combined amplification and array technologies are routinely found in research settings and are likely to be increasingly employed in clinical settings. One example is the FDA-cleared Verigene Respiratory Virus Plus assay (Luminex), which incorporates an amplification step prior to array-based detection. Luminex Verigene is a moderate-complexity slide array assay that encompasses extraction, hybridization of target DNA to gold nanoparticle probes, and detection within a closed system. In a panel marketed outside the United States, this assay also detects oseltamivir resistance resulting from the H275Y mutation. It is likely that such combinations will find future clinical applications. Another new technology that has recently been FDA cleared is from GenMark Diagnostics for rapid identification of select organisms and resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broth. GenMark offers blood culture identification panels for Gram-negative bacteria that detect 6 resistance determinants and a panel for Gram-positive organisms that detects 4 resistance determinants. Their unique technology allows rapid PCR amplification using electrowetting technology, followed by DNA hybridization and electrochemical detection.</para>

        <para id="ch0098s0000p0003">To our knowledge, several manufacturers (some with multiple assays) have obtained FDA clearance for the molecular detection of antimicrobial resistance markers, as of July 2021. bioMérieux NucliSENS EasyQ, ELITech ELITe MGB, ARIES MRSA, Cobas MRSA/SA, Cobas vivoDx MRSA, and Roche LightCycler are PCR-based platforms with the CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) designation “high complexity.” BioFire FilmArray, Unyvero, GenMark, and Cepheid GeneXpert are self-contained, PCR-based systems with the designation “moderate complexity.” The Cobas vivoDx MRSA test utilizes a new Smarticles technology where the target gene is detected only from viable MRSA cells.</para>
        <para id="ch0098s0000p0004">Broad-range PCR with detection by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has been used in a commercial system that combines organism identification with the detection of resistance determinants (PLEX-ID or IRIDICA; Abbott) (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0010">10</link>), but the substantial cost of this system limited its usefulness in most clinical settings, and the manufacturer recently elected not to pursue FDA approval (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0011">11</link>). Matrix-associated laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has permitted rapid identification of microbial isolates in the clinical laboratory but lacks sufficient sensitivity to detect most proteins responsible for drug resistance (e.g., β-lactamases). However, MALDI-TOF MS has been demonstrated to accurately distinguish between methicillin-susceptible <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> (MSSA) and MRSA, and indirect methods that use MALDI-TOF MS to detect the products of antibiotic hydrolysis by carbapenemases have been developed (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0012">12</link>–<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0014">14</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0098s0000p0005">In theory, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) should be the most comprehensive molecular method to detect antimicrobial resistance, because it allows the simultaneous detection of resistance to numerous antibiotic classes (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0015">15</link>). WGS is particularly attractive for its potential to identify novel or variant resistance determinants that might not be detected by targeted PCR assays and its utility as an epidemiologic tool to assess transmission dynamics of pathogenic multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) during an outbreak. However, WGS is expensive compared to a targeted approach, requires bioinformatics expertise, and is predicated on a detailed understanding of the relationship between genotype and resistance phenotype that is presently incomplete. Resistance mechanisms relating to the presence or absence of specific genes (e.g., β-lactamases, target-modifying enzymes, and alternative penicillin-binding proteins) or well-characterized target site mutations (e.g., DNA gyrase) will be more straightforward to interpret than those relating to alterations in gene expression (e.g., porins and efflux pumps). The error rates of various next-generation sequencing platforms will also have to be taken into account. Currently, WGS technology for the detection of antimicrobial resistance is primarily limited to the research setting. The technology has been implemented in U.S. antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs, such as the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, which tracks the resistance of certain enteric bacteria, such as <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis>.</para>
        <para id="ch0098s0000p0006">Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is rapidly evolving and has the potential for detection of microbial genomes directly in clinical samples, particularly in context of culture-negative samples. There are currently no such FDA-cleared assays for detection of bacterial pathogens and resistance genes/determinants; however, this field is expected to advance quickly, given the rapid advances in technology and the clinical need. Other technologies with possible future applicability to antimicrobial resistance detection include denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0017">17</link>) and various deep-sequencing modalities (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0019">19</link>).

      <para id="ch0098s0000p0007"><emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> is presently the most common cause of bacterial infections in industrialized countries (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0020">20</link>). Particular effort has focused on the development of assays for the rapid detection of MRSA, which carries an increased risk of symptomatic infection and has fewer effective treatment options (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0022">22</link>). However, MSSA also continues to be an important community-acquired pathogen and appears to be playing an increasingly important role in hospital infections as well (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0023">23</link>). The rapid detection of MRSA is important for guiding infection control measures and antimicrobial treatment. MSSA detection is also clinically important, because different antimicrobial agents are required for optimal MSSA treatment (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0024">24</link>–<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0026">26</link>). The rapid identification of MSSA and MRSA in blood cultures has been shown to result in decreased length of hospital stay and health care costs (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0027">27</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0098s0000p0008">At present, most traditional commercially available molecular assays detect MRSA strains that carry the<emphasis>mecA</emphasis> resistance determinant; however, some that have recently been FDA cleared detect both <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> and <emphasis>mecC</emphasis> resistance determinants. These traditional assays recognize MRSA on the basis of the junction between the SCC<emphasis>mec</emphasis> cassette (which carries the <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> resistance determinant along with additional genes) and the flanking <emphasis>orfX</emphasis> gene (<anchor id="ch0098s0000a0006"/><link linkend="ch0098s0000a0008">Fig. 1</link>). It is important to note that methicillin resistance due to non-<emphasis>mecA</emphasis>-mediated mechanisms will result in false-negative results in most currently available commercial molecular systems, with exceptions (e.g., Cepheid Xpert NxG, Aries MRSA, BioFire FilmArray BCID2, GenMark BCID-GP, and Unyvero LRT BAL). Of particular challenge are MRSA strains that carry SCC<emphasis>mec</emphasis> variants, such as SCC<emphasis>mec</emphasis> XI, which has been recently described in MRSA strains from bovine and human sources in Europe (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0028">28</link>–<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0031">31</link>). This unusual SCC<emphasis>mec</emphasis> variant carries the <emphasis>mecC</emphasis> gene, which is only 70% identical to <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> and poses the most recent challenge to molecular diagnosis of MRSA (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0028">28</link>). It is advisable to validate a molecular MRSA assay using strains of local origin, as the prevalence of variant strains not detected by a molecular assay may be quite high at some geographic locations (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0033">33</link>). Another potential pitfall of single-target MRSA assays is the existence of MSSA strains that carry SCC<emphasis>mec</emphasis> remnants lacking an intact <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> gene, sometimes referred to as “empty cassettes” (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0034">34</link>–<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0038">38</link>). Such strains are phenotypically methicillin susceptible but can be responsible for false-positive results when single-target MRSA assays are employed. A less common cause of a false-positive molecular MRSA assay is a strain carrying a mutant <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> allele that is no longer functional (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0039">39</link>). Reversion of oxacillin-susceptible, <emphasis>mecA</emphasis>-positive <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> strains to a resistant phenotype has been reported (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0040">40</link>), suggesting that it may be most prudent to treat all isolates carrying <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> as MRSA, regardless of their <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> susceptibility.</para>

      <para id="ch0098s0000p0009">An alternative approach to the molecular detection of MRSA combines the<emphasis>mecA</emphasis> target and a second locus specific for <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>, such as <emphasis>sa442, nuc, femA, femB, spa</emphasis>, or <emphasis>ldh1</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0041">41</link>–<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0046">46</link>) (<link linkend="ch0098s0000a0008">Fig. 1</link>). This approach can be used to detect both MSSA and MRSA. However, mixed specimens may provide ambiguous results. In particular, the concomitant presence of MSSA and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) may be falsely interpreted as MRSA. In one study, cocolonization with methicillin-resistant CoNS and MSSA was found in 3.4% of anterior nares specimens (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0047">47</link>). Rare <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> strains lacking <emphasis>nuc</emphasis> or <emphasis>spa</emphasis> have been reported (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0048">48</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0049">49</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0098s0000p0010">In clinical practice, molecular assays for the detection of methicillin resistance in<emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> are available both for surveillance testing to detect colonization and to assist in the diagnosis of infection (<anchor id="ch0098s0000a0009"/><link linkend="ch0098s0000a0011">Table 1</link>). Assays approved for MRSA surveillance from nasal swabs include the BD MAX MRSA assay (Becton Dickinson), Xpert MRSA NxG and SA Nasal Complete (Cepheid), LightCycler MRSA advanced test and Cobas MRSA/SA (Roche), and NucliSENS EasyQ MRSA (bioMérieux) (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0051">51</link>). Each of these tests is a PCR-based assay to detect the SCC<emphasis>mec-orfX</emphasis> junction. The MRSA/SA ELITe MGB assay (ELITech) is designed for nasal swab specimens; discrimination between MRSA and a mixture of MSSA and methicillin-resistant CoNS is achieved by quantitative comparison of <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> target abundance.</para>
      <para id="ch0098s0000p0011">Assays for the combined detection of MRSA and MSSA to assist in the diagnosis of infection include the Xpert MRSA/SA BC and Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI (Cepheid), the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture test (Luminex), and<emphasis>mecA</emphasis> XpressFISH (OpGen). The Xpert MRSA/SA BC, and Verigene Gram-positive blood culture tests are used to rapidly identify MRSA and MSSA once Gram-positive cocci are identified in blood cultures (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0053">53</link>). In addition, the Verigene assay also detects other Gram-positive pathogens (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0054">54</link>) and has targets to differentiate <emphasis>S. aureus, S. epidermidis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>S. lugdunensis</emphasis> from other <emphasis>Staphylococcus</emphasis> species. For methicillin resistance to be reported, the assay must detect the presence of a particular staphylococcal species. In polymicrobial cultures, methicillin susceptibility cannot be inferred, as detection of <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> may be difficult to interpret (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0055">55</link>). The Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI assay is performed on swabs obtained from infected skin or soft tissue lesions (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0053">53</link>). Although any molecular assay may detect DNA from nonviable organisms, this feature may be particularly problematic for the MRSA/SA SSTI assay. Patients with severe soft tissue infections have frequently received antibiotics prior to obtaining diagnostic specimens. The false-positive rates (relative to culture) for patients receiving antibiotics within 3 weeks of testing are reported to be 13.8% and 9.5% for MSSA and MRSA, respectively (package insert). In addition, the MRSA/SA SSTI assay may yield false results in the presence of mixed staphylococcal infections.</para>

The SepsiTest assay is intriguing because it is able to detect pathogens in whole blood without requiring culture, but initial studies have shown poor concordance with conventional culture results (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0058">58</link>).

      <para id="ch0098s0000p0014">In the United States, approximately 30% of enterococcal isolates are resistant to vancomycin (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0061">61</link>). High-level vancomycin resistance most commonly occurs in enterococci via acquisition of mobile transposable genetic elements carrying the <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> or <emphasis>vanB</emphasis> resistance determinant; however, the recent emergence and spread of novel variants, such as <emphasis>vanM</emphasis>, are cause for concern (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0064">64</link>). Enterococcal species (<emphasis>Enterococcus gallinarum</emphasis> and <emphasis>Enterococcus casseliflavus</emphasis>) with low-level intrinsic vancomycin resistance due to the <emphasis>vanC</emphasis> determinant (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0065">65</link>) will not be detected by molecular assays for <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> and <emphasis>vanB.</emphasis> In the United States, <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis> is more frequently vancomycin resistant than <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis>, with <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> being more commonly encountered than <emphasis>vanB.</emphasis> For this reason, many currently marketed molecular assays identify VRE by the presence of <emphasis>vanA.</emphasis> Although the detection of <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> has been shown to be highly specific (aside from rare reports of <emphasis>vanA-</emphasis>carrying <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> and streptococcal species) (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0066">66</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0067">67</link>), the concomitant use of culture-based methods is required to definitively link the detection of the <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> gene to VRE carriage, to perform susceptibility testing, and to perform strain typing in an outbreak setting. Additionally, the regional prevalence of <emphasis>vanB</emphasis>-carrying VRE is an important consideration when a molecular assay is chosen, as not all commercial assays detect these strains. Vancomycin-variable <emphasis>E. faecium (VVE)</emphasis> isolates have recently been reported from Canada and Norway. VVE strains carry a silent copy of the <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> gene and are phenotypically vancomycin susceptible, but they have the potential to revert to a resistant phenotype during vancomycin treatment (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0068">68</link>–<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0071">71</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0098s0000p0015">The rapid detection of VRE colonization can help to prevent health care-associated infections, specifically in settings where critically ill patients (e.g., ICU, oncology, and transplant patients) are at high risk of VRE colonization and infection. Currently, two FDA-cleared assays are marketed in the United States for the detection of VRE from perianal and rectal swabs (<link linkend="ch0098s0000a0011">Table 1</link>). Both of these assays, GeneOhm VanR (BD) and Xpert VanA (Cepheid), target the <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> gene, the most prevalent vancomycin resistance determinant in enterococci in North America (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0072">72</link>). In addition, the VanR assay also detects <emphasis>vanB.</emphasis> However, a number of studies have demonstrated the presence of this gene in fecal or rectal specimens without culturable enterococci, reducing the positive predictive value of this target. The <emphasis>vanB</emphasis> gene has been found in commensal nonenterococcal bacteria (e.g., <emphasis>Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Eggerthella lenta, Clostridium</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Ruminococcus lactaris</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0073">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0074">74</link>), necessitating culture confirmation of a <emphasis>vanB</emphasis>-positive result from a molecular assay.</para>
      <para id="ch0098s0000p0016">The FilmArray (BioFire) and the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture test (Luminex) are FDA cleared for use on positive blood cultures to identify enterococci as well as the presence of<emphasis>vanA</emphasis> and <emphasis>vanB</emphasis> resistance determinants (<link linkend="ch0098s0000a0011">Table 1</link>). Because the Gram-positive and Gram-negative targets reside on separate panels, the Verigene assay first requires a Gram stain to confirm the presence of Gram-positive organisms. The Verigene test targets <emphasis>hsp60</emphasis> for detection of <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis> but not other <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> species. This allows the accurate identification of most VRE responsible for bloodstream infections that carry either <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> or <emphasis>vanB</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0075">75</link>). Alternatively, the FilmArray assay provides a genus-level identification of <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> by targeting <emphasis>rpoB</emphasis> along with detection of <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> or <emphasis>vanB</emphasis> for reporting of VRE.</para>

      <para id="ch0098s0000p0017">One of the greatest threats to the antimicrobial armamentarium has been the emergence of β-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria with the capability of hydrolyzing broad-spectrum penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. These enzymes include the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpCs, and carbapenemases (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0076">76</link>–<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0080">80</link>). The accurate detection of broad-spectrum β-lactamases is important for both infection control and treatment, and detection on the basis of MIC or other phenotypic testing is imperfect (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0079">79</link>, <link linkend="ch0098s0000li0081">81</link>). A rapid and affordable molecular assay able to detect broad-spectrum β-lactamases would be clinically useful, but at the present time, this represents an unmet need. The greatest challenge to molecular detection is the enormous diversity of β-lactamases, with more than 200 described ESBLs and numerous classes of carbapenemases, including the KPC, NDM-1, VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase), IMP (imipenem metallo-β-lactamase), and OXA (oxacillinase) carbapenemases. An additional caveat is that the detection of β-lactamase genes does not provide information about copy number and expression, which are important determinants of phenotypic β-lactam resistance.</para>
      <para id="ch0098s0000p0018">A number of commercial assays for the molecular detection of broad-spectrum β-lactamases have been developed (<anchor id="ch0098s0000a0029"/><link linkend="ch0098s0000a0032">Table 2</link>). Check-Points (Wageningen, The Netherlands) offers Check-MDR assays in both real-time PCR and microarray formats for the detection of ESBLs (TEM, SHV, and CTX-M), AmpCs (CMY, ACC, DHA, and ACT/MIR), and carbapenemases (KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP, and OXA-48), in various configurations (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0082">82</link>–<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0084">84</link>). The BD MAX platform (Becton Dickinson) offers a CRE (carbapenem-resistant <emphasis>Enterobacteriaceae</emphasis>) assay for research use only that detects KPC, NDM, and OXA-48 genes. The Hyplex (Amplex Diagnostics GmbH) system for detection of ESBLs (TEM, SHV, and CTX-M) or carbapenemases (VIM, IMP, KPC, OXA-48, and NDM) detects products from a multiplexed PCR using the principles of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0085">85</link>). The NucliSENS EasyQ platform (bioMérieux) offers a KPC assay (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0086">86</link>). At present, FDA-cleared assays focus primarily on the detection of specific carbapenemase genes of epidemiological concern. The Cepheid Xpert Carba-R assay targets KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP, and OXA-48. FilmArray (BioFire) and Verigene (Luminex) blood culture assays are designed to identify common Gram-negative pathogens directly from positive blood cultures as well as to detect resistance markers.</para>
      <para id="ch0098s0000p0019">Reporting and clinical interpretation of β-lactam resistance in Gram-negative organisms can be challenging when molecular methods are utilized. Specifically, susceptibility of an organism cannot necessarily be inferred just because no resistance target is detected. No molecular panel is comprehensive, and individual bacterial strains may produce multiple β-lactamases or possess non-β-lactamase resistance mechanisms, such as efflux pumps or reduced outer membrane permeability. Therefore, phenotypic resistance should always be reported when detected. Conversely, genetic resistance may be detected even though an isolate remains phenotypically susceptible to an agent for which resistance might have been predicted. Notable examples include the detection of a carbapenemase (e.g., OXA-48 or KPC) in enteric bacterial isolates that are phenotypically susceptible to specific carbapenems (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0087">87</link>). The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) currently recommend reporting phenotypic susceptibility even if a carbapenemase gene is detected, as long as current breakpoints are used (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0088">88</link>). However, this recommendation is controversial (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0081">81</link>), and observations made with animal models suggest that carbapenems may be ineffective for the treatment of bacteria harboring carbapenemase genes even when the carbapenem MIC is in the susceptible range (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0089">89</link>). A CLSI task force recently published tables to provide guidance to laboratories with regard to the interpretation of discrepant phenotypic and molecular susceptibility results (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0090">90</link>).</para>

However, this resistance problem has posed a difficult challenge for molecular diagnosis. β-Lactam resistance results from mosaic variants of low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins (PBP1a, PBP2b, and PBP2x), which vary in their individual contributions to penicillin and cephalosporin resistance. PCR-based assays have been developed to detect some of the most common variants associated with resistance (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0099">99</link>–<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0101">101</link>). One confounding factor concerning development of a rapid resistance assay for penicillin versus <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> is that different breakpoints exist depending upon antibiotic administration route and site of infection (meningeal and nonmeningeal). The utility of such an assay would be limited in the setting of respiratory infections, as β-lactam antibiotics can still be used to treat nonmeningeal infections with <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> strains exhibiting intermediate levels of resistance (<link linkend="ch0098s0000li0102">102</link>).</para>

The availability of a molecular assay to detect daptomycin resistance is appealing but remains challenging due to multiple possible pathways of resistance and the generation of resistance by alterations in gene expression rather than by the acquisition of novel resistance determinants.

Although resistance is infrequent, mutations that affect the linezolid-binding site have been described.

A confounding issue in the development of an assay detecting the G2576T mutation is that the phenotypic level of resistance correlates with the number of rRNA operons carrying a mutation; strains that are phenotypically linezolid susceptible despite the presence of the G2576T mutation have been described. A number of additional mutations in 23S rRNA or the ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 have been described in linezolid-resistant strains, and the relationship between resistance and these mutations is currently under investigation. Linezolid resistance following acquisition of the <emphasis>cfr</emphasis> gene, encoding a 23S rRNA methyltransferase, has also been reported.

        <para id="ch0098s0000p0033">At the present time, FDA-cleared molecular assays for the detection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens are limited to those for MRSA, VRE, and selected β-lactamases (including some carbapenemases) in Gram-negative bacteria. These PCR and solid-phase-array assays must be employed with careful attention to the specific targets used for detection, as false-positive or false-negative results may be obtained. Selection of a specific assay must take such factors as specimen type, test volume, hands-on and turnaround time, on-demand capability, and cost into consideration. Although genetic diversity and cost pose significant challenges, new assays for the detection of broad-spectrum β-lactamases of Gram-negative bacteria appear promising. With a continuing urgent clinical need for the rapid detection of antimicrobial resistance, and with many novel technologies in development, the molecular diagnosis of antibacterial drug resistance is likely to see expanded application in coming years.</para>
