      <para id="ch0141s000000p0002">The frequency with which invasive fungal infections (IFIs) occur has markedly increased over the past decade. The ability to rapidly detect and identify the causative fungal agents is essential for the successful management of IFIs (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0001">1</link>). While fungal culture remains the reference standard for determining the etiology of IFIs, non-culture-based methods, including molecular and serologic testing, may provide more timely results and other advantages, including performance on easy-to-collect specimen types. The culture agnostic methods that will be reviewed here include direct microscopic examination, antifungal antibody assays, fungal antigen detection, and fungal nucleic acid-based assays. Although these methods are routinely used and often beneficial to clinicians, they have not supplanted culture-based methods and should be used in conjunction with routine fungal culture (reviewed in chapters <ulink url="ch0139#ch0139s0001">118</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0140#ch0140s0001">119</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). Although cultures from patients with an IFI may result in no growth, when a fungal agent is isolated by culture it allows for susceptibility testing and epidemiological comparisons, which are not as routinely achievable via non-culture-based methods.</para>

        <title>DIRECT MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION</title>
        <anchor id="ch0141s000001a0002"/>
        <anchor id="ch0141s000000a0003"/>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0003">The ability to detect fungi in clinical material depends on several factors, including the quality of the specimen that is received into the laboratory. If very small samples are received, few fungi may be present, making detection less reliable, and generally, culture should take precedence over direct microscopy in such cases. The exceptions to this would be dermatological samples, for which microscopy is often diagnostic, or if mucoraceous molds are suspected, in which case microscopy may be positive in the absence of isolation by culture. Culture sensitivity is also limited if material is not taken from a representative part of the lesion where fungi may be present. If the sample is large enough, then both direct microscopy and culture should be performed, as microscopy can help with differentiation of colonization from tissue invasion, while culture allows for fungal isolation and subsequently identification and susceptibility testing. Conversely, only nonviable organisms may be present in specimens obtained from patients on antifungal therapy, and microscopy and molecular methods may be the only method for identifying the etiologic agent. Specimen quantity and quality may be compromised when multiple clinical laboratories process portions of the specimens. Therefore, effective communication between microbiology, other pathology services, and the clinician can greatly enhance diagnostic accuracy.</para>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0004">Consideration of the patient’s travel history and residence is also important when attempting to detect and identify fungal causes of disease, due to the endemicity of certain fungi. Lifelong travel history is important in patients who do not normally reside in areas of known fungal endemicity, as certain infections, including paracoccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0002">2</link>), may reactivate decades later. Although mycetoma is reported worldwide, most cases come from tropical and subtropical regions around the Tropic of Cancer (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0003">3</link>), and hence specific travel or residence details may improve diagnostic accuracy.</para>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0005">Examination of clinical material before any processing takes place may be very informative and should always be performed. Areas of caseous necrosis, microabscesses, grains, granules, and nodules should all be noted. Grains and granules may indicate mycetoma; granulomas and caseous necrosis may indicate histoplasmosis; and microabscesses can be seen with chronic disseminated or renal candidiasis. Grains and granules should be examined for color, shape, size, and consistency, as these may be indicative of the etiological agent. For example,<emphasis>Scedosporium</emphasis> species, a common cause of eumycetoma, produces yellowish-white soft grains 1 to 2 mm in diameter, whereas <emphasis>Trematosphaeria grisea</emphasis> produces globose or lobed black grains 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0003">3</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0006">Microscopic examination of specimens can be carried out with either unfixed specimens or fixed, stained specimens. The use of unfixed specimens has the advantages of being quick and relatively simple to carry out; the use of fixed, stained specimens may highlight features specific to certain fungi and also the host response in tissue, but they take longer to process and hence may delay reporting. Generally, if fixed, stained specimens are being examined, a general stain such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) will be used for screening. If fungi are suspected after examination of the H&amp;E slide, stains specific for fungal structures, such as Gomori methenamine silver (GMS), and/or more specialized stains such as mucicarmine or Fontana-Masson, can be used to demonstrate characteristic structures in fungi of interest. A range of stains and procedures commonly used to detect fungi are shown in<anchor id="ch0141s000000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0141s000000a0017">Table 1</link>, and the role of histopathological diagnosis has recently been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0004">4</link>). Staining methodology is also reviewed in <ulink url="ch0140#ch0140s0001">chapter 119</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>.</para>

        <beginpage pagenum="2308"/>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0007">The Gram stain may be useful in diagnosis, primarily because it is commonly used in most laboratories; hence, laboratory staff are familiar with it, and it may enable differentiation of yeast from molds in the initial sample. Although Gram reactions can vary, yeast cells and pseudohyphae generally stain Gram positive and hyphae (septate and aseptate) stain Gram negative. The size and shape of budding yeast-like cells can indicate a presumptive genus identification.<emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> yeast cells are generally very round and display an amorphous orange-staining material, presumably the capsule.</para>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0008">Familiarity with the appearance of certain fungi in tissue may be helpful when performing direct examination (<anchor id="ch0141s000000a0006"/><link linkend="ch0141s000000a0034">Table 2</link>). <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> hyphae tend to be of a consistent diameter (4 to 6 μm) and commonly demonstrate 45° branching, with 90° branching less common. <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Scedosporium</emphasis> species look very similar to <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> species in tissue (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0005">5</link>). Sporulation in tissue is rare, but it can be distinctive with certain fungi. For example, aleurioconidia can be indicative of <emphasis>Aspergillus terreus. Fusarium</emphasis> may produce a combination of hyphae and yeast-like structures, and <emphasis>Scedosporium</emphasis> may produce ovoid pigmented annelloconidia (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0004">4</link>). When fungal stains show both unicellular forms and filaments that appear to be hyphae or pseudohyphae, infection with <emphasis>Fusarium, Paecilomyces</emphasis>, or <emphasis>Sarocladium</emphasis> species should be considered, although filamentous yeast should also be included in the differential diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0006">6</link>). Mucoraceous molds have aseptate or sparsely septate hyphae with wide-angle, 90° branching. The hyphae often appear twisted and flattened due to the lack of hyphal support because of the absence of septa; these are often referred to as appearing “ribbon-like” (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0007">7</link>). The Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon on H&amp;E sections may be seen with blastomycosis and sporotrichosis, as well as with infections caused by <emphasis>Basidiobolus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Conidiobolus</emphasis> species. This phenomenon is the deposition of amorphous, eosinophilic material in tissue that occurs as a result of an antigen-antibody reaction. Dematiaceous molds may display multiple forms, such as septate hyphae with parallel walls, rounded forms arranged in chains, or muriform (sclerotic) bodies. The diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis can be made only if pigmented hyphae are observed. Sometimes pigmentation can be observed by use of a traditional KOH preparation; however, care should be taken if these are stained with calcofluor, as this is not taken up well by melanized hyphae. Some structures can provide definitive diagnosis of the etiologic agent (e.g., spherules of <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp.). Specimens obtained from patients treated with antifungal drugs may demonstrate atypical structures, such as variations of hyphal size within the same hyphae, lack of septation within the hyphae, or bulb forms within the hyphae or at the hyphal tips.There are many artifacts that can be mistaken for fungal structures when performing direct microscopy. Lymphocytes in cerebrospinal fluid (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0007">7</link>) may be mistaken for <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> species; fibers and debris may be mistaken for hyphae, as they can fluoresce with calcofluor white; and fat droplets may be confused with budding yeast-like cells. Experience in reading direct microscopy may overcome these problems, and discussions with colleagues may be necessary when doubt persists. Alternatively, use of another method may help to differentiate artifacts from genuine findings.</para>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0009">A positive result on direct microscopy should be reported promptly with as much information included as necessary to clarify the result. For example, “Yeast cells seen” is more helpfully reported as “Microscopic appearance may represent commensal species, e.g.,<emphasis>Malassezia</emphasis>” in a skin sample, if the characteristic broad-based budding associated with this genus has been seen. Examples of various characteristic structures seen in direct microscopy of clinical specimens from fungal infections are shown in <anchor id="ch0141s000000a0007"/><link linkend="ch0141s000000a0023">Fig. 1</link> through <anchor id="ch0141s000000a0008"/><link linkend="ch0141s000000a0022">26</link>.</para>

Importantly, however, their role in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis infections is minimal (refer to <ulink url="ch0144#ch0144s0001">chapter 123</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). Serologic testing for <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> may be helpful for the purposes of diagnosing allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma, and chronic cavitary aspergillosis in non-neutropenic patients (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0141s000000li0009">9</link>). Various techniques have been used for this purpose, including ID and EIAs (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0010">10</link>). These tests mainly measure IgG, but often use poorly defined antigen preparations, including culture extract antigens (e.g., Serion [Germany] and ImmunoCAP [ThermoFischer Scientific]); unspecified recombinant antigens, as are used in the Platelia assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA); or a combination of culture extract antigens with recombinant antigens (e.g., Bordier Affinity Products, Crissier, Switzerland). Notably, each of these kits provides different positive cutoff values based on the population tested during validation, and given the absence of an international anti-<emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> antibody standard, there is no inter-assay standardization. While background antibody levels will be detected, careful assessment of test performance relative to disease state using receiver operator curve analysis would allow for establishment of a threshold associated with antibody levels that are indicative of disease (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0011">11</link>). The clinical utility of <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> antibody detection in cases of invasive aspergillosis (IA) is less convincing, with data not supporting routine use of this assay for diagnosis of IA (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0012">12</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0141s000000p0012"><emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> species produce two routinely detectable antigens, including A and WI-1, of which only the former is used in commercially available kits. Detection of antibodies to <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> can be carried out by ID, CF, or ELISA, and commercially available assays and reagents for these assays are available from multiple different manufacturers (e.g., Gibson Biosciences, Lexington, KY; IMMY, Norman, OH; Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, OH). ID may be positive in approximately 28% to 64% of patients depending on immune status and disease severity, whereas CF is less sensitive, with positivity in less than 20% of patients (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0013">13</link>). As a result, CF is no longer routinely offered in clinical laboratories. With respect to ELISAs, antibodies are detected in ~83% of patients with blastomycosis, although due to cross-reactivity, 47% of specimens from patients with histoplasmosis were also positive by a common <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> ELISA (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0014">14</link>). A more promising study detecting antibodies to the BAD1 antigen, a surface protein, showed a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 99%, with only 3 of 50 patients with histoplasmosis being positive (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0015">15</link>). Although this was an improvement, the authors noted that highest sensitivity was achieved when used in combination with antigen testing.</para>

      <para id="ch0141s000000p0033">As well as culture, the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis can be achieved using antibody and/or antigen detection. Antibodies to<emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> are routinely detected by various methods, including ID, CF, ELISAs, and more recently a lateral-flow assay. Historically, the tube precipitin assay was also used; however, this has now been replaced by the ID test using the same antigens. The ID test primarily detects IgM antibodies to a β-glucosidase antigen (i.e., heated coccidioidin), which is frequently positive early in disease. In contrast, the CF assay detects IgG antibodies to a heat-labile chitinase antigen (i.e., unheated coccidioidin), which is useful in diagnosing acute and chronic disease and can also be used prognostically (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0016">16</link>). Early studies indicated that in primary infection, precipitating antibodies peak by week 3 of infection, with approximately 90% of sera positive, but then decline rapidly, with only 10% of sera positive at 5 months. Complement-fixing antibodies are detected in about 50% of sera by 1 month and continue to increase for several months thereafter (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0017">17</link>). Latex agglutination assays for the detection of <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> antibodies are available commercially from IMMY (<emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> Antibody Latex Agglutination; IMMY, Norman, OK) although IMMY warns that false-positive results can occur and therefore require confirmation by another method.

The ID test detects precipitating antibodies to the H and M antigens, resulting in the formation of H and M “bands.” The M band appears first during infection, being present in approximately 80 to 90% of patients with acute disease, although it can also persist for years after resolution of disease.

GM is released from the cell wall of<emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> hyphae during active growth <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis>, but it is unlikely to be detected in the serum of patients until angioinvasion has occurred (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0033">33</link>). GM can be detected in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), cerebrospinal fluid (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0034">34</link>), and urine in infected patients. The Platelia <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> GM antigen ELISA, produced by Bio-Rad, is CE marked and FDA approved for use with serum and BAL. This assay is based on a monoclonal rat antibody (EBA-2) which coats microtiter wells and is also separately conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, acting as the secondary detector antibody. The amount of GM in each sample is expressed as an index value, which is a ratio of the sample optical density (OD) compared to the cutoff control OD, with GM indices of &gt;0.5 considered positive (Platelia <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> Ag kit insert; Bio-Rad). This assay has been extensively studied in a range of different patient groups, with results showing that sensitivities and specificities vary widely depending on the setting in which it is used. Although the manufacturer currently recommends a cutoff of 0.5 for BAL, some laboratories have considered use of a cutoff of 1, due to the improved specificity at this threshold for testing of BAL.</para>
      <para id="ch0141s000000p0040">Although the GM ELISA is the most widely used assay for the diagnosis of IA, a lateral-flow device has been developed (Isca Diagnostics, Truro, United Kingdom) that uses a monoclonal antibody, JF5, which binds to a protein epitope from an extracellular glycoprotein antigen produced by<emphasis>Aspergillus fumigatus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0035">35</link>). It was hypothesized that, by targeting a non-GM antigen, the problems with cross-reactivity would be reduced. The JF5 monoclonal antibody is used for both the capture and detection of the antigen in serum or BAL, visualized with colloidal gold, and seen as a line that appears within 10 to 15 min of the sample being added to the lateral-flow device (LFD). As the antigen is only produced by growing hyphae, contamination of samples (e.g., BAL) with <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spores should not produce positive results. This has been confirmed in a meta-analysis where sensitivity and specificity in BAL (72 to 86% and 84 to 93%, respectively) are better than in serum (53 to 68% and 81 to 87%, respectively) (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0036">36</link>).</para>

Perhaps more importantly, the LFD had a slightly higher negative predictive value of 95% (versus 81 to 93% for the Platelia GM assay), which may allow clinicians to make more informed decisions about cessation of treatment. Although the LFD has been described as a point-of-care test (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0035">35</link>), the requirement to boil serum samples in a pH-buffered EDTA solution and centrifuge them during processing still means that testing must be done in a laboratory; however, BAL samples may be tested directly.

The risk of angioinvasion, however, differs based on host characteristics (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0033">33</link>).

The presence of high initial CSF titers (≥1:1,024) in patients with HIV infection is known to carry a poor prognosis (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0070">70</link>), and although CSF titers decrease over time in the presence of treatment, they do so too slowly to be useful in monitoring response to therapy (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0080">80</link>). Titers obtained from the same sample with different kits may vary, so laboratories should use kits from a single source.</para>
      <para id="ch0141s000000p0053">A CrAg LFA was approved by the FDA in 2011 for use with serum and CSF (IMMY). This is an immunochromatographic dipstick assay for qualitative and semiquantitative detection of CrAg. Not only is this more sensitive than the LA, but it is also significantly less labor-intensive and time-consuming. The LFA has been shown to provide enhanced sensitivity in serum when compared to both LA (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0081">81</link>) and EIA (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0082">82</link>). Several authors have noted that the titers obtained with the LFA are higher than those obtained by LA due to increased sensitivity by LFA. Although not approved for use with urine or fingerstick capillary blood for point-of-care testing, the LFA has been shown to have good activity in these sample types, ranging from sensitivities of 92% to 100% in urine (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0141s000000li0082">82</link>). Additionally, detection of CrAg in blood was associated with positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 100% for ruling out meningitis (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0083">83</link>). The advantage of the LFA is its lower cost compared to other kits (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0084">84</link>) and its ease of use, particularly in resource-poor settings.</para>
      <para id="ch0141s000000p0054">Multiple causes of false-positive and false-negative results have been documented in the utilization of CrAg kits.

False-negative results due to high antigen titers are known as the postzone effect; for this reason, it is good practice to test undiluted specimens and at a 1:10 dilution.

The first commercially available test for <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> antigen detection was originally developed in the mid-1980s as a radioimmunoassay by MiraVista Diagnostics. This assay has continually been modified and is now offered through the company as a quantitative EIA that is able to be performed on a variety of specimen types. The assay uses polyclonal rabbit antiserum against a polysaccharide antigen from <emphasis>H. capsulatum</emphasis> found in various body fluids during infection (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0088">88</link>). The sensitivity of the assay varies depending on patient and disease characteristics, with most published studies focusing on performance in patients with HIV and disseminated disease, in whom antigen is found in the urine and serum in 95% and 86% of patients, respectively. In other immunocompromised patients, the test is less sensitive, with 82% sensitivity in urine and 60% in serum (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0089">89</link>). <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> antigen testing is primarily useful in the early diagnosis of acute histoplasmosis, within 3 weeks of exposure. The antigen test may also be useful in acute pulmonary disease, in which antigenemia and antigenuria have been reported in 68% and 65% of patients, respectively (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0090">90</link>). The utility of the test in other forms of histoplasmosis is much lower, with sensitivities of 15% or less for mediastinal or chronic pulmonary disease (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0089">89</link>). In addition to serum and urine, the assay has also been evaluated in BAL and CSF. A recent study found that antigen could be detected in BAL from 94% of patients with histoplasmosis; in the same patients, urine and serum were positive in 79% and 65%, respectively (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0091">91</link>). Although there have been no large studies assessing the sensitivity of antigen in CSF, it has been reported to have sensitivities ranging from 38 to 78% in small case series (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0097">97</link>). Antigen titers fall with successful treatment (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0098">98</link>) and rise with relapses (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0099">99</link>), so the test also has prognostic utility.</para>
      <para id="ch0141s000000p0057">One of the drawbacks with the antigen test is the risk of cross-reactivity in patients with blastomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and<emphasis>Talaromyces marneffei</emphasis> infections, and less commonly in patients with coccidioidomycosis and aspergillosis.

These fungal pathogens either produce BDG at a very low level or do not produce it at all. The most commonly used commercial test used for detection of BDG is the Fungitell assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., East Falmouth, MA), which is also the only one that is FDA approved for use in serum. Other BDG detection assays that are commercially available include the Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), Fungitec-G (Seikagaku, Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan), and Maruha (Maruha-Nichiro, Foods Inc., Tokyo, Japan) assays.</para>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0061">The Fungitell assay is a chromogenic, kinetic, quantitative EIA, which detects BDG in picograms per milliliter (pg/ml). The Fungitell assay is based on the ability of BDG to activate the<emphasis>Limulus</emphasis> amebocyte lysate clotting cascade present in the blood of <emphasis>Limulus polyphemus</emphasis>, the North American horseshoe crab. Since the <emphasis>Limulus</emphasis> amebocyte lysate clotting cascade is also activated by another zymogen, factor C, an endotoxin-sensitive serine, factor C is eliminated from the final assay makeup by the manufacturer. The Fungitell assay starts with serum pretreatment using an alkaline reagent, which converts the BDG triple helices to monomers for activation. These monomers then bind to a serine protease zymogen, called factor G, which in turn is activated. The activated factor G then activates a clotting enzyme which converts a colorless reagent to a yellow compound that is measured every 30 seconds over a 40-minute period, to yield an indirect measurement of BDG. Since this is a colorimetric reaction, interference can be seen with hemolytic, icteric, or lipemic samples. Typically, this assay is run on a 96-well plate with all samples run in duplicate.</para>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0062">Early studies of the assay initially used a positivity cutoff threshold of 60 pg/ml (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0101">101</link>). However, in a large multicenter study, the sensitivity and specificity were found to be 69.9% and 87.1%, respectively, for invasive fungal infection (IFI) using the 60-pg/ml cutoff.

Studies have shown varying sensitivity and specificity due to heterogeneity of the studied populations. Also, inclusion of patients with a Mucorales, <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis>, or <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> infection may potentially lower sensitivity of the assay given the known absence of significant BDG levels in these fungi (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0104">104</link>).

KG, Germany). The latter three have the advantage of also being able to detect mutations in the Cyp51A gene associated with azole resistance induced by environmental exposure to azole fungicides. All assays are CE marked but none of these assays is FDA cleared or approved.</para>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0073">There are also commercial kits available for the detection of<emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis> species, including the MucorGenius (PathoNostics) and MycoGENIE (Ademtech) assays; for detection of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species by the Fungiplex Candida assay (Bruker); and several methods for the detection of <emphasis>Pnemocystis jirovecii</emphasis>, including PneumoGenius (PathoNostics), Fungiplex Pneumocystis (Bruker), VIASURE <emphasis>Pneumocytis jirovecii</emphasis> Real Time PCR Detection Kit (CerTest Biotec SL, Zaragoza, Spain), and the RealStar <emphasis>Pneumocytis jirovecii</emphasis> PCR Kit 1.0 (altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). As with the <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> DNA detection kits, these are CE marked but not FDA cleared or approved. Several other DNA-detection kits are marketed by Bruker for research purposes only: Fungiplex <emphasis>Candida auris</emphasis> and Fungiplex Universal, which is a pan-fungal DNA detection kit. Although there have been some small-scale studies and comparisons, it is too early to determine which of these will prove to have the greatest utility in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection.</para>

        <para id="ch0141s000000p0074">For candidiasis, use of whole blood, rRNA, or P450 multicopy targets and an<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> PCR detection limit of ≤10 CFU/ml were all associated with improved assay performance (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0144">144</link>). One of the most promising assays for candidiasis is the T2Candida test (T2Biosystems, Lexington, KY), which is able to detect five species (<emphasis>C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. krusei</emphasis>) directly from whole blood without the need for culture in 2 to 5 hours. There is also a separate cartridge available to detect <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>, although this cartridge is not cleared by the FDA in the U.S. This method uses magnetic resonance technology and has a detection limit of 1 CFU/ml of whole blood. A meta-analysis of eight studies with 2,717 subjects showed sensitivity and specificity values of 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88–94%) and 94% (95% CI, 93–95%), respectively (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0145">145</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0075">Broad-range fungal PCR with sequencing is also an emerging diagnostic technique; however, sensitivity and specificity vary depending on the target used as well as patient population and the specimen type. These assays are more likely to be positive with positive histopathology. There are currently no FDA-approved direct-from-specimen broad-range fungal PCR assays, although several laboratory-developed tests are available for clinical as well research use. Targets for these assays include 28S ribosomal RNA gene or internal transcribed spacer sequence (ITS) DNA. These assays can be performed on a variety of specimen types. All these tests must be interpreted in the context of clinical picture, since these may identify DNA from nonviable, potentially noninfectious agents.</para>
        <para id="ch0141s000000p0076">Finally, the Karius test (Karius Inc., Redwood City, CA) involves unbiased next-generation sequencing of microbial cell-free DNA from plasma, including fungi. One limitation may be that since it is a plasma-based test, it may be negative in cases without bloodstream penetration of organisms. Budget impact analysis does indicate cost saving with the Karius test due to the reduction in invasive tests for diagnostic purposes (<link linkend="ch0141s000000li0146">146</link>). As next-generation sequencing methods, both targeted and metagenomic approaches, continue to be optimized and their clinical role is better defined, these assays will likely play a larger role in clinical care in the future.</para>
