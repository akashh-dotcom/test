      <para id="ch0140s0000p0002">A variety of stains, media, and reagents are available to the mycology laboratory for the detection, isolation, characterization, and identification of yeasts and moulds. Familiarity with the composition and characteristics of these materials is critical to the diagnostic approach when processing specimens from patients with suspected mycotic diseases.</para>
      <para id="ch0140s0000p0003">The direct microscopic examination of properly stained clinical material is rapid and cost-effective and may provide a presumptive identification of the etiologic agent, guiding the laboratory in the selection of media that best support fungal growth and sporulation<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0009">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0011">3</link>). Stained preparations made from fungal cultures are essential for definitive identification. It is important to note that when processing patient specimens, universal precautions should be observed and work should be performed in a biosafety hood under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, particularly when working with blood and other body fluids that may also contain the blood-borne pathogens human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0012">4</link>–<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0014">6</link>). Manipulation and identification of mould isolates under BSL-2 conditions is desirable to reduce cross-contamination of cultures, to protect the laboratory environment, and to prevent exposure to potentially harmful agents. However, different biohazard requirements may apply in different countries.</para>
      <para id="ch0140s0000p0004">Environmental samples, such as soil, suspected of containing the infectious mould forms of<emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> spp., or <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp. should be cultured and manipulated under BSL-3 conditions (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0012">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0140s0000li0014">6</link>). Likewise, BSL-3 conditions should be used to handle mould isolates known to be <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> spp., or <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp. from any source (patient or environmental).</para>
      <para id="ch0140s0000p0005">Many media are available for the primary inoculation and cultivation of fungi from clinical specimens. No one specific medium or combination of media is adequate for all specimens. Media should be carefully selected based on specimen type and suspected fungal agents (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0011">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0140s0000li0015">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0019">11</link>). If the specimen is from a nonsterile site, it is important to include a medium that contains inhibitory substances such as chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and/or cycloheximide. Chloramphenicol or gentamicin inhibits most bacterial contaminants, while cycloheximide inhibits most saprobic moulds. Remember that cycloheximide may also inhibit some important opportunistic fungi such as <emphasis>Fusarium, Scopulariopsis, Pseudallescheria, Trichosporon</emphasis>, some <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Talaromyces</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Penicillium</emphasis>) <emphasis>marneffei</emphasis>, mucoraceous fungi, some dematiaceous fungi, and yeasts such as <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> species and some <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species. Therefore, it is necessary to use a selection of media both with and without inhibitory agents for the primary inoculation of the specimen. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Standard M54-ED2 (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0020">12</link>) is an excellent source for determining the selection and use of fungal medium.</para>
      <para id="ch0140s0000p0006">Benomyl is a fungicide that selectively inhibits many genera of ascomycetes but not the growth of basidiomycetes, mucormycetes, and others (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0021">13</link>). When added to fungal medium (10 μg/ml) such as Sabouraud dextrose agar or potato dextrose agar, evaluating the resistance to benomyl is of particular use in differentiating moulds, particularly those that are not producing identifiable sporulating structures. Benomyl may also be added to a medium to inhibit the growth of unwanted moulds in environmental specimens. In particular, benomyl has been added to birdseed agar medium for the isolation of <emphasis>Cryptococcus gattii</emphasis> from environmental soil samples (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0022">14</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0140s0000p0007">Media can be dispensed into containers such as 25-by-150-mm screw-cap tubes or 100-mm-diameter petri dishes. Tubed media (slants and deeps) offer maximum safety and resistance to dehydration and contamination but have a small surface area for inoculation. Because of the enhanced safety aspects of tubed media, this is the required format for transporting fungal isolates to reference laboratories for further identification, when necessary. Petri plates, unlike tubed agar, offer the advantage of a large surface area for isolation and dilution of inhibitory substances in the specimens, but they must be poured thick, with at least 25 ml of medium, to resist dehydration during extended incubation periods. Because plates are vented, they are more likely to become contaminated during incubation. Plates may be placed in gas-permeable bags or sealed with gas-permeable tape (Shrink Seals; Scientific Device Laboratory, Des Plaines, IL) to offset this disadvantage. The gas-permeable tape also secures the lid of plated media, preventing the accidental removal of the lid outside the biosafety cabinet. Another format, in which medium is poured into a flat-bottom flask (Bactiflask, Remel, ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA; Mycoflask, BD Diagnostics BBL, Sparks, MD), provides the combination of an increase in surface area of the plated medium with the safety of tubed medium. Flasked media may be particularly useful when culturing dimorphic pathogens. Because of their propensity to crack and break, petri dishes or plastic flasks should never be used to transport fungal isolates to reference laboratories.</para>

      <para id="ch0140s0000p0008">Once inoculated, cultures are incubated at 25 to 30°C. When specimens are derived from deep-site locations such as tissue biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), cerebrospinal fluid, etc., duplicate cultures may be prepared and incubated at 35 to 37°C to encourage faster growth of pathogenic fungi. Fungal cultures should be incubated for 4 to 6 weeks before being regarded as negative; however, many cultures can be read as early as 24 h after inoculation. For example, most yeasts are detected within 5 or fewer days, and dermatophytes are detected within 1 week. However, dematiaceous and dimorphic fungi may require 2 to 4 weeks. Therefore, to account for differences in growth rates, fungal cultures should be examined at regular intervals (e.g., daily during the first week, three times the second week, twice at 3 weeks, and once at 4 weeks) rather than being evaluated once at the end of 4 weeks. While growth may be observed within the first few weeks of incubation, incubation should be continued for the original plate, after subculture, to allow for the emergence of slower-growing pathogenic organisms. Manipulation of cultures must be performed inside a certified biological safety cabinet to prevent contamination of the plate and exposure of personnel to potentially hazardous fungi.</para>
      <para id="ch0140s0000p0009">Each new lot of medium, whether purchased or prepared in-house, must be subjected to a quality control protocol that verifies appearance, pH, and performance (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0020">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0140s0000li0023">15</link>). Both positive and negative control strains need to be included in quality assurance testing protocols (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0020">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0140s0000li0023">15</link>). Media for primary isolation should be tested for optimal growth of several fungal pathogens. Selective media should be tested with strains known to be susceptible and resistant to the inhibitory agent in the medium, while differential media should be evaluated with fungi that produce both positive and negative reactions. Many media are also commercially available as prepared plates or tubes. Although manufacturers perform quality control testing, clinical laboratories still need to ensure that media meet performance standards. Some widely used commercially prepared media may be exempt from routine quality assurance testing, when proof of quality assurance testing is provided by the media manufacturer. Nonexempt media still require specific quality assurance testing. A list of media in these categories can be found in CLSI documents M22-A3 and M54-ED2 (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0020">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0140s0000li0023">15</link>). These requirements apply to those working in the United States; regulations may differ in other countries. Accrediting agencies in the United States, such as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act or College of American Pathologists, no longer recognize the exempt status of certain media from quality assurance testing. Therefore, clinical laboratories that undergo inspection by accrediting agencies must perform quality assurance testing on all lots of media used in the laboratory.</para>
      <para id="ch0140s0000p0010">Unless stated otherwise, the reagents and media listed in this chapter should be prepared by dissolving the components in the stated liquid with a magnetic stirring bar. The standard sterilization technique of autoclaving at 121°C at 15 lb/in<superscript>2</superscript> for 15 min should be used when needed. However, certain solutions, such as those containing antibiotics or carbohydrates, cannot be autoclaved because they will be denatured. These solutions are sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm-pore-size filter and added to the post-sterilized medium after being cooled sufficiently; <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> chromogenic agars can be heated in a microwave.</para>
      <para id="ch0140s0000p0011">Storage of prepared reagents in sterile, airtight, screw-cap containers is recommended. Some reagents require storage in dark containers, and some need to be stored refrigerated (2 to 8°C) instead of at room temperature. Special storage instructions are given when appropriate. Standard safety precautions should be taken when preparing the reagents. Follow the safety guidelines for the chemicals being used, in addition to the laboratory safety protocols.</para>

While the proteinaceous components of the host cells are partially digested, the fungal cell wall is left intact and more apparent. An aliquot of specimen is added to a drop of 10% or 20% KOH, which can be preserved with 0.1% thimerosal. The slide is held at room temperature for 5 to 30 min after the addition of KOH, depending on the specimen type, to allow digestion to occur. Digestive capabilities can be enhanced with gentle heating or the addition of 40% dimethyl sulfoxide (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0026">18</link>). Solutions of NaOH (10% or 25% with added glycerin) may be used as alternatives to potassium hydroxide for the direct microscopic examination of hair, skin, and nails for dermatophyte-mediated infections. Visualization of fungal elements may be enhanced by the addition of lactophenol cotton blue, chlorazol black, or glucan-binding fluorescent brighteners such as calcofluor white, which bind to chitin, a major component of the fungal cell wall.</para>

      <para id="ch0140s0000p0020">Calcofluor white and related compounds such as Uvitex 2B and Blankophor are nonspecific, nonimmunological fluorochromes that bind to β-1,3 and β-1,4 polysaccharides, specifically cellulose and chitin of fungal cell walls. Like the auramine-rhodamine stain, calcofluor white has become commonplace in microbiology laboratories because of the rapidity with which specimens can be observed. The fluorochrome can be mixed with KOH to clear specimens for easier observation of fungal elements. Fungal elements appear bluish white against a dark background when excited with UV or blue-violet radiation. Optimal fluorescence occurs with UV excitation. A barrier filter such as 510, 520, or 530 should be used for eye protection. Organisms impart a blue-white to green fluorescence (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0009">1</link>) depending on the combination of excitation and barrier filters used. Typical <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> cysts are 5 to 8 μm in diameter, round, and uniform in size, and they exhibit a characteristic peripheral cyst wall staining with an intense “double parenthesis-like” structure (<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0027">19</link>–<link linkend="ch0140s0000li0029">21</link>). Yeast cells are differentiated from <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> by budding and intense staining. Care must be used in interpreting the calcofluor white staining results because nonspecific reactions may be observed. Cotton fibers fluoresce strongly and must be differentiated from fungal hyphae. Additionally, tissues such as brain biopsy specimens from patients with tumors or other tissues containing elastin fibers may fluoresce and resemble hyphae suggestive of <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> or other moulds with branching hyphae.</para>

KOH (10%) is mixed in equal proportion with calcofluor white solution (0.1 g of CFW M2R and 0.05 g of Evans blue in 100 ml of water). Greater concentrations of KOH may be required, depending on the specimen type (see “Potassium Hydroxide (KOH)” above). The specimen is covered with this mixture and a coverslip is applied. Allow the slide to sit for 5 to 10 minutes prior to viewing the slide to permit the tissue to clear and the stain to interact with the fungal elements. Some nail and tissue preparations may require a longer incubation time (up to 30 minutes) for clearing to occur. Alternatively, the slides may be gently warmed on a slide warmer to speed up the clearing process. Once clearing of the tissue has been achieved, apply gentle pressure to the coverslip to disperse the tissue under the coverslip. For optimal results the slide should be viewed as soon as the tissue has cleared. The preparation is examined with a fluorescence microscope containing appropriate excitation and barrier filters at ×100 to ×400 magnification. Darkly pigmented fungi may stain poorly with calcofluor white because of the pigmentation, which may mask the fluorescence. In this instance, if a dematiaceous mold is suspected, slides should additionally be viewed under light microscopy.</para>

Fungi stain a bright pink-magenta or purple against an orange background if picric acid is used as the counterstain, or against a green background if light green is used. The procedure is a multistep method combining hydrolysis and staining. The periodic acid step hydrolyzes the cell wall aldehydes, which are then able to combine with the modified Schiff reagent, coloring the cell wall carbohydrates a bright pink-magenta. The PAS stain is an excellent general stain because most fungi in clinical material take up the stain. However, the PAS staining procedure is rather involved, requiring several different reagents and time-consuming steps, and has been replaced in many laboratories by the calcofluor white staining procedure. The PAS stain cannot be used with undigested respiratory secretions, as mucin also stains bright pink-magenta.
