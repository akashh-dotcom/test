        <para id="ch0164s0001s0001p0001">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), leishmaniasis continues to be one of the world’s most neglected diseases. It is considered an important zoonosis, with high prevalence in certain Latin American countries, Asia, and Africa. Human leishmaniasis is associated with malnutrition, as well as lack of financial resources affecting the poorest people. The infection is a vector-borne disease that can be caused by approximately 21 different species of the genus<emphasis>Leishmania.</emphasis> Depending on the species involved, infection with <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> spp. can result in different clinical presentations. There are three main forms of leishmaniases, i.e., visceral leishmaniasis (VL, also known as kala-azar), which is the most lethal form of the disease; cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL, the most common and less severe); and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL, which can cause destruction of nasal mucosa and deformities in severe cases). The <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species that cause the different types of clinical disease are morphologically indistinguishable in clinical samples. Because of that, the use of microscopy techniques to identify the parasites to the species level is not practical. A presumptive identification of species can be done in select leishmaniasis cases when clinical symptoms and geographic information are combined with microscopic identification. However, these species can be differentiated using immunological and molecular diagnostic tests.</para>

      <para id="ch0164s0002p0001">The life cycle of<emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species that infect humans is depicted in <anchor id="ch0164s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0164s0003a0004">Fig. 1</link>. The life cycle starts when humans acquire the promastigote stage of the parasite by the bite of an infected female sand fly (step 1). The sand flies inject the infective stages through their proboscis during blood meals. The injected promastigotes are phagocytized by macrophages and other types of mononuclear phagocytic cells that aggregate at the wound site due to the inflammation process caused by the sand fly bite (step 2). Inside the phagocytic cells, the promastigotes transform into amastigotes, which are round or oval and lack a flagellum (step 3). These are the tissue stage of the parasite, which will multiply by simple division and proceed to infect other mononuclear phagocytic cells. The multiplication and invasion of the amastigotes in different tissues cause the distinct forms of leishmaniasis (step 4). In addition, host and other factors play a significant role in the development of the clinical symptoms that identify CL, MCL, or VL. The sand flies become infected by ingesting macrophages infected with <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> amastigotes when they take a blood meal from an infected individual (step 5). Macrophages are normally infected with amastigotes during the acute phase, when the infected individual has detectable parasitemia. After being ingested by the sand fly, the macrophages release the amastigotes (step 6). The amastigotes transform into promastigotes in the insect’s hindgut and midgut (step 7). The promastigotes divide in the hindgut and midgut and migrate to the sand fly’s proboscis, which allows them to be injected into a mammalian host when the sand fly takes another blood meal (step 8).</para>

      <para id="ch0164s0003p0001">According to WHO, leishmaniasis is found in 88 countries, where approximately 350 million people are at risk of acquiring one of the three main forms of the disease, with approximately 12 million cases of infection. It is estimated that 700,000 to 1 million new cases of leishmaniasis occur per year (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0005">5</link>). The geographic distribution of the different subgenera and species is relevant for the case management and also for taxonomic classification. The <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species are separated into Old World and New World <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> based on the development of the organism in the digestive tract (peripyloric or suprapyloric) of the sand fly. No definitive molecular approach has yet been proposed to refine the taxonomic classification of <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species. For the Old World <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> there is only one subgenus, <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis>; however, the New World genus has been divided into the subgenera <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> and <emphasis>Viannia.</emphasis> For instance, cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by the <emphasis>Leishmania major</emphasis> complex is more prevalent in Middle Eastern countries, Afghanistan, and some African countries (Old World), while mucocutaneous leishmaniasis caused by species within the subgenus <emphasis>Viannia</emphasis> is restricted to Latin American countries in South and Central America (New World). The taxonomy of leishmaniasis continues to be a challenge since there is not a unified taxonomic system and discrepancies about the placement of certain species and species complexes exist. Revisions of the taxonomy have been proposed by different authors, and a consensus about a final taxonomic structure has yet to be reached (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0006">6</link>). To add to this complexity, new species have been described, and their placement in the current taxonomic structure can be controversial. Because the different species are morphologically identical, the characterization of <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> may require the combination of different approaches and laboratory methods. In some cases, the geographical distribution and clinical presentation, combined with molecular characterization, can be useful for taxonomic purposes. In that context, specific protein coding genes and other regions of the genome can be very useful in the molecular characterization of <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0007">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0009">9</link>). It is expected that the recent advances in whole-genome sequencing of isolates from different geographic regions could help sort out some of the taxonomic classification issues in the near future (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0010">10</link>). Despite all the issues revolving around the taxonomic classification of <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species, some taxonomic separations are useful for medical purposes and are accepted by the scientific community. <anchor id="ch0164s0003a0003"/><link linkend="ch0164s0003a0006">Table 1</link> shows a taxonomic separation of <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species that emphasizes the type of disease they cause, combined with the geographic distribution.</para>

      <para id="ch0164s0003p0002">Leishmaniasis is transmitted in the Old World by adult female sand flies belonging to the genus<emphasis>Phlebotomus</emphasis> and in the New World by sand flies from the genus <emphasis>Lutzomyia.</emphasis> These vectors belong to the order Diptera, suborder Nematocera, family Psychodidae, and subfamily Phlebotominae. Convincing evidence of vectorial transmission of <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> has been demonstrated for approximately 30 species within both genera (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0012">12</link>). These genera and species of sand flies transmit the parasite to humans and to several different mammals that can serve as natural reservoirs, defining the disease as a zoonosis. Although vectorial transmission is considered the most important mode of transmission, leishmaniasis can also be transmitted by direct contact with an infected lesion or mechanically through bites by stable flies/dog flies (<emphasis>Stomoxys calcitrans</emphasis>).</para>

      <para id="ch0164s0003p0003">In the Old World,<emphasis>L. major, Leishmania tropica, Leishmania aethiopica</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Leishmania infantum</emphasis> are the most important species causing cutaneous leishmaniasis (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0013">13</link>). This form of leishmaniasis is widespread in the Middle East, the Mediterranean littoral, the Arabian peninsula, Africa, the Near East, the Indian subcontinent, and other areas. The most lethal form of leishmaniasis, VL or kala-azar, is caused by <emphasis>Leishmania donovani</emphasis> in the Old World and by <emphasis>L. infantum</emphasis> in the New World (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0014">14</link>). MCL, which can lead to the destruction of the nasal mucosa and occurs in the New World, is caused by different <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species in the subgenus <emphasis>Viannia</emphasis> such as <emphasis>L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>L. panamensis</emphasis>, in addition to species in the <emphasis>L. mexicana</emphasis> complex (<emphasis>L. mexicana</emphasis>). MCL also occurs in the Old World, but there it is mainly caused by species in the <emphasis>L. donovani</emphasis> complex (<emphasis>L. donovani</emphasis>) and <emphasis>L. tropica</emphasis> complex (<emphasis>L. aethiopica</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0016">16</link>) (<link linkend="ch0164s0003a0006">Table 1</link>). In most countries, the different types of leishmaniasis are considered a zoonosis due to the presence of well-known zoonotic reservoirs. Nevertheless, kala-azar in India and Brazil is considered an anthroponosis (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0018">18</link>), and in these countries, VL may exist as an endemic, epidemic, and sporadic disease. The natural reservoirs for leishmaniasis are wild members of the <emphasis>Canidae</emphasis> and various rodents. Dogs and other members of the <emphasis>Canidae</emphasis> family serve as reservoirs for <emphasis>Leishmania donovani</emphasis>, and rats for <emphasis>Leishmania infantum.</emphasis> Members of the <emphasis>Canidae</emphasis> family and cats serve as reservoirs for <emphasis>Leishmania chagasi</emphasis> in the Americas. Individuals with post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) may be very important reservoirs for maintaining the infection during interendemic cycles. More than 90% of the cases of visceral leishmaniasis are found in Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Somalia, and Sudan (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0004">4</link>). In order to control the disease in some regions, Bangladesh, India, and Nepal have established kala-azar elimination programs (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0018">18</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0164s0004p0001">The degree of different clinical presentations can vary according to the geographic area, and many disease variations of leishmaniasis have been described, which makes classical disease categories confusing (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0019">19</link>). In addition, the clinical presentations can be more severe depending on the immunological status of the infected individual, and that can happen despite the type of the infecting species.</para>
      <para id="ch0164s0004p0002">The incubation period of leishmaniasis can be relatively long. In CL infections caused by<emphasis>L. tropica</emphasis> and <emphasis>L. aethiopica</emphasis>, the incubation period may take several months to years. This, combined with the large variety of reservoirs and vectors, makes the eradication of CL very difficult in areas where these species are prevalent (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0013">13</link>). However, in the case of CL caused by <emphasis>L. major</emphasis>, the incubation period may be approximately 2 weeks. The first clinical sign of the infection is the appearance of a firm, painless papule at or near the insect bite site. One or multiple lesions may appear, and the lesions may progress from a simple papule or erythematous macule to a nodule and ulcerate within days to weeks. The papules may be intensely pruritic and will grow to 2 cm or more in diameter. In general, CL is a self-limiting disease, and the lesions may spontaneously heal over time with possible residual scarring (months to years), without treatment or when topical treatments are applied. The infection may remain localized at the insect bite site, where a definite self-limiting granulomatous response develops. Leishmanial lesions have been mistaken for basal cell carcinoma, tropical pyoderma, sporotrichosis, and cutaneous mycobacterial infections. The patient should be watched for development of satellite lesions and lymphatic spread and should also be evaluated for the potential risk of developing MCL, at which time drug therapy may be recommended (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0019">19</link>). The chance of developing lymphatic spread or MCL is dependent on the immunocompetence of the patient and the geographic area of acquisition of the infection (<link linkend="ch0164s0003a0006">Table 1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0164s0004p0003">In areas of endemicity for leishmaniasis, coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be common. In these areas, approximately one-quarter of coinfected patients who remain severely immunocompromised may die within the first month of being diagnosed with a given species of<emphasis>Leishmania.</emphasis> In such cases, leishmaniasis manifests itself like an opportunistic infection, and depending on the level of immunosuppression, the parasites can be detected in atypical sites. The treatment for leishmaniasis can be given concomitantly with HIV active antiretroviral therapy to HIV-infected patients with VL to improve prognosis (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0020">20</link>). However, it is necessary that patients be closely monitored for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and the potential for increased drug toxicity (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0019">19</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0164s0004p0004">The mucosal lesions in MLC are produced most often by a group of species in the<emphasis>Viannia</emphasis> subgenus, which can also cause CL. However, MCL can also be caused by other species such as <emphasis>L. donovani</emphasis> and <emphasis>L. tropica</emphasis> complex (<link linkend="ch0164s0003a0006">Table 1</link>). In the beginning, the primary lesions may be like those found in infections of CL. The lesions progress to mucosal lesions that are often disfiguring, resulting from the chronic local destruction of tissue of the nasal mucosa and the nose, mouth, oro- and nasopharynx, and eyelids, which can affect respiratory function and hamper nutrition. The determining factors that lead to severe mucocutaneous infections are not well understood. However, there is evidence that a <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> RNA virus-1 (LRV1) could play a role in the development of MCL. This virus has been identified in a few species of the <emphasis>Viannia</emphasis> subgenus, but its clinical significance has still to be proven (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0021">21</link>). One of the features that may promote severity of the disease relates to the increased TLR3-mediated cytokine production and elevated parasitemia that are triggered by LRV1 in animal models (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0022">22</link>). Chronic nasal congestion and secretions are a prominent manifestation of MCL. Mouth, palatal, pharyngeal, and laryngeal involvement may also occur as the infection develops. Untreated primary lesions may develop into the mucocutaneous form in up to 80% of cases. Metastatic spread to the nasal or oral mucosa may occur in the presence of the active primary lesion or many years later, after the primary lesion has healed. Mucosal lesions do not heal spontaneously, and secondary bacterial infections are frequent and may be fatal. The differential diagnosis to rule out MCL includes lymphoma, midline granuloma, Wegener’s granulomatosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, cutaneous mycobacterial infection, syphilis, and leprosy.</para>
      <para id="ch0164s0004p0005">Considered to be the most lethal type of leishmaniasis, VL clinical features vary from asymptomatic, self-resolving infections to frank visceral leishmaniasis. The incubation period may be as short as 10 days or as long as 2 years. However, symptoms usually develop between 2 and 4 months after the individual is infected. Common symptoms in persons who are not immunosuppressed include fever, anorexia, malaise, weight loss, and frequently diarrhea. Symptoms could also include nontender hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and occasional acute abdominal pain. Darkening of facial, hand, foot, and abdominal skin (kala-azar) is often seen in light-skinned persons in India. Anemia, cachexia, and marked enlargement of liver and spleen are noted as the disease progresses. The name kala-azar refers to black sickness or black fever in Hindi. The name was given due to the blackening of the skin observed in some patients.</para>
      <para id="ch0164s0004p0006">Cases of VL may overlap with HIV infections in areas where the control of both diseases is substandard. In most HIV-coinfected patients, VL will develop due to the reactivation of a latent infection with the progression of the immunosuppression. The first case of concomitant HIV and VL was reported in 1985, and since then this has become a major public health concern, being reported in as many as 45 countries worldwide (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0023">23</link>). In areas of HIV coinfection, the fatality of VL may be high, with patients having disseminated parasite loads and clinical and laboratory presentation being significantly different from that in areas where this type of coinfection is not prevalent (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0025">25</link>). Both infections suppress the immune system, which can result in more severe VL disease in addition to higher rates of relapse, treatment failure, and higher drug toxicity. Coinfection can be fatal when undiagnosed and untreated, due to the immunosuppression caused by both diseases. Even when properly treated, the mortality rate is high and can reach up to 20% (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0020">20</link>). The fact that individuals coinfected with HIV may not exhibit common VL symptoms seen in immunocompetent individuals makes it very difficult to diagnose such coinfections clinically (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0026">26</link>). HIV/VL coinfection affects many countries in the world, and the current serological tests are not suitable for diagnosis, since they have low sensitivity for detecting most HIV/VL cases. Therefore, more sensitive and specific diagnostic methods based on the use of recombinant proteins and immunoproteomic approaches could be very useful for this purpose (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0027">27</link>). A new guideline has been developed in 2022 by WHO for the treatment of VL in HIV-coinfected patients from East Africa and Southeast Asia. This guideline took into consideration aspects of recent clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of combination therapy conducted in these regions of the world. The guideline offers new possibilities for case management of coinfected patients (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0028">28</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0164s0004p0007">Death due to VL may occur after a few weeks, or after 2 to 3 years in chronic cases. The majority of infected individuals are asymptomatic or have very few or minor symptoms, which resolve without therapy. There has been a significant increase in leishmaniasis in organ transplant recipients since 1990. Most of the reported cases in organ transplant recipients have been visceral leishmaniasis, with a much smaller number of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis cases and, rarely, cutaneous leishmaniasis cases (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0029">29</link>). Differential diagnosis in the acute stage includes amebic liver abscess, Chagas disease, malaria, typhoid, typhus, and schistosomiasis. Subacute or chronic disease has been confused with malnutrition, bacteremia, brucellosis, histoplasmosis, leukemia, lymphoma, malaria, mononucleosis, and schistosomiasis.</para>
      <para id="ch0164s0004p0008">Postdermal leishmaniasis, or PKDL, is a condition seen in India and Sudan in some patients unsuccessfully treated for VL. PKDL usually occurs 6 months or later after completion of therapy. This syndrome is rarely seen in Latin America but has been reported to occur in patients coinfected with HIV (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0025">25</link>). The macular or hypopigmented dermal lesions are associated with few parasites, whereas erythematous and nodular lesions are associated with abundant parasites. This condition must be differentiated from leprosy, syphilis, and yaws.</para>

      <para id="ch0164s0005p0001">The clinical diagnosis of leishmaniasis may be accomplished in some areas where the disease is endemic. The clinical presentation will include different syndromes depending on the species causing the infection. Individuals with CL present with one or multiple skin lesions showing specific characteristics like a volcano, with a raised edge and central crater, with scabs covering some of the sores. These lesions occur at the sites where the sand flies fed and can be painless or painful. Individuals with VL normally have prolonged fever, weight loss, anemia, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, and sometimes swollen glands. Some patients may have abnormal blood testing with low red and white blood cell counts. In areas where the transmission of leishmaniasis is very high, the presence of such characteristic lesions may be enough for the presumptive clinical diagnosis, but followup with a reliable laboratory diagnostic test could be essential for identification of the parasite to the species or complex level, which can facilitate clinical management and decisions about the type of treatment indicated (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0030">30</link>). Whenever there is a suspicion of leishmaniasis based on the initial clinical presentation, multiple specimens should be taken to increase the success of laboratory diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0031">31</link>). In general, not all methods utilized for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis have the same level of sensitivity and specificity, and one method may be successful in detecting the infection while others may be negative. For instance, when infected cells are not present in high numbers, the isolation of the parasites by culturing may fail. However, molecular methods, which are quite sensitive, could be applied directly to the DNA extracted from a portion of the sample that was not utilized for <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> isolation (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0032">32</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0164s0006p0001">The types of specimens that are essential for the laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis include skin biopsy at the lesion site, lymph node fine-needle aspiration, bone marrow aspirate, blood buffy coat, splenic aspirate, and liver biopsy. Collection of splenic aspirate is not generally performed in settings of nonendemicity. In settings of endemicity, it may be recommended for practitioners who have sufficient expertise. The types of specimens to be collected should be determined based on different factors, to allow the application of more than one diagnostic test to achieve consistent results for proper management of CL, MCL, and VL (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0031">31</link>). All cutaneous lesions should be thoroughly cleaned with 70% alcohol, and extraneous debris (the eschar and exudates) should be removed. After debridement, the base of the ulcer can be scraped with a scalpel blade to obtain an exudate for slide preparation or culture. Conversely, specimens can be collected from the margin of the lesion by aspiration, scraping, or punch biopsy or by making a slit with a scalpel blade. Material scraped from the wall of the slit should be smeared onto a number of slides. PCR methods have been shown to be more sensitive than direct microscopy, histology, and culture, but availability is limited mainly to large hospitals or clinics. There is an increasing number of PCR methods available for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. These methods have not been validated or standardized through multilaboratory studies. Because these methods are not validated, the choice of any one molecular method for diagnostic purposes must rely on its published performance characteristics and applicability (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0033">33</link>–<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0035">35</link>). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides relevant information on its website that includes recommendations for laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/leishmaniasis/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/leishmaniasis/index.html</ulink>). Based on these recommendations, laboratories should not rely on one diagnostic method but should use multiple methods for diagnosis (culture, direct microscopy, histology, PCR, and serology if available).</para>
      <para id="ch0164s0006p0002">The core of tissue from a punch biopsy can be used to make imprints or touch preparations on a slide. A tissue core should also be submitted for histological examination for identification of amastigotes. In some cases, recognition of amastigotes in tissues may be more difficult than in smears or imprints. This is because amastigote stages may be crowded within the cells, appearing smaller with morphological features that may not be evident, depending on the angle at which the tissue was cut. Fine-needle aspiration can also be performed by using a 26-gauge needle and a sterile syringe containing sterile preservative-free buffered saline (0.1 ml). The needle is inserted under the outer border of the lesion and rotated several times to collect tissue fluid through aspiration. In the case of VL, tissue obtained by splenic puncture yields the highest rate of positive specimens for VL; however, this procedure carries significant risk to the patient, particularly those with coagulation disorders. Other specimens for the detection of VL include lymph node aspirates, liver biopsy specimens, sternal aspirates, iliac crest bone marrow specimens, and buffy coat preparations of venous blood. Amastigotes with reticuloendothelial cells have been detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, pleural effusions, and biopsy specimens collected from the gastrointestinal tracts and oropharynges of HIV-positive patients. Individuals with PKDL have large numbers of parasites in the skin, particularly those with erythematous and nodular lesions.

Amastigotes detected in tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin can be differentiated from intracellular fungal organisms because they do not stain positive with periodic acid-Schiff, mucicarmine, or Gomori methenamine silver stain. Amastigotes are easier to identify in properly prepared tissue imprints or smears, where the whole organism can be observed. However, the sensitivity of detection may still vary from 15 to 70% depending on the expertise of the laboratory staff conducting the examination (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0036">36</link>).</para>

Most of the molecular diagnostic tests are laboratory-developed tests. The molecular methods applicable to the laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis will comprise real-time PCR methods, conventional PCR, and DNA sequencing analysis of PCR amplicons. Different molecular methods have been described in the literature which were designed to interrogate the samples for different molecular markers. These tests have been applied with some success to the diagnosis of difficult cases of leishmaniasis in different scenarios. Genetic markers such as the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and certain protein coding genes have provided robust characterization in resourceful reference diagnostic laboratories (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0032">32</link>). Application of molecular methods, including DNA sequencing analysis of PCR products, can provide a refined level of characterization of <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species associated with atypical human or zoonotic cases (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0038">38</link>). In 2017, the FDA approved the SMART Leish PCR for the detection of cutaneous leishmaniasis (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). This is a diagnostic platform that was developed based on a partnership between the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity, and the commercial partner Cepheid USA, Inc. The SMART Leish PCR assay is a qualitative test that uses real-time PCR to amplify DNA sequences unique to the organism that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis. Methods such as these are considered more sensitive than slide examination or culture, particularly for the detection of the agents of MCL, which are difficult to culture (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0033">33</link>–<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0035">35</link>). Generally, organisms in mucocutaneous lesions are scant and difficult to detect microscopically. Because infections caused by the <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> subgenus <emphasis>Viannia</emphasis> are considered more aggressive and are more likely to result in treatment failure, molecular techniques to identify the organism to the species level can be very important for therapy. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing have been used to identify <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species and strains when applicable, but this depended on having culturable isolates, and in some cases these methods were not discriminative enough. To improve isolate identification, various rRNA and DNA targets, such as mini-exon or spliced leader sequences, the rRNA internal transcribed spacer, the 7SL-RNA gene, the heat shock protein 70 gene, and the cytochrome <emphasis>b</emphasis> gene, have been used. A great target is kinetoplastic DNA, because there are more than 10,000 copies per organism, thereby increasing the likelihood of detection; however, minicircle heterogeneity is an issue (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0039">39</link>). Use of multiple targets may be necessary due to gene polymorphism within the target sequences (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0039">39</link>).

It allows molecular and other methods to be applied to the cultured isolates for determination of species (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0055">55</link>). If material is to be cultured, it must be collected aseptically. Tissues should be minced prior to culture.

Only certain reference diagnostic laboratories with adequate infrastructure offer culture methods. This is because the procedures available to isolate <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> parasites from clinical samples are laborious and time-consuming and require advanced technical expertise. Cultures, incubated at 25°C, should be examined twice weekly for the first 2 weeks and once a week thereafter for up to 4 weeks before the culture is declared negative. Sensitivity of culture varies from 44 to 58%, with recovery being the poorest in cases of MCL (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0036">36</link>). Certain reference diagnostic laboratories use protocols that combine culturing with other approaches to enhance sensitivity and specificity of detection. For instance, instead of using the whole sample for culture, the sample could be divided into portions for morphologic and molecular analyses (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0033">33</link>).

As the humoral immune response in MCL and CL is low, immunological tests are not frequently utilized in areas with high prevalence of these types of leishmaniasis. In addition, some antigens used in serological tests may cross-react with parasites like<emphasis>Trypanosoma cruzi</emphasis>, which also limits the usefulness of serological methods in areas where transmission of the two parasites overlaps.</para>

Several different vaccine prototypes were developed, evaluated, and patented, with the first patent being filed in 1985 as a joint effort by the Institut Pasteur, the University of Technology of Compiègne, and the Université Pierre et Marie Curie, in France. This vaccine was based on the principle of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and became publicly accessible in 1986. In subsequent years, several vaccine patents were filed by public and private institutions in many countries. The United States currently leads the ranking of patent applications with 74 patents, followed by Brazil with 36 patent applications for <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> vaccines. These patents include different types of vaccines, for instance those that use inactivated/dead parasites or genetically attenuated live <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> parasites, vaccines based on recombinant proteins, as well as DNA vaccines.

In addition, these vaccines have good stability, low antigenic complexity, and low cost to scale up, especially when compared with vaccines using attenuated parasites. In live, genetically attenuated <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> vaccines, essential genes of <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> spp. are turned off, which causes the parasite to go through a short life cycle within the recipient without causing the disease, but enough to generate protective immune response. Such vaccines have demonstrated high potential for immunization, but there is always the risk of reversion of the attenuated to the virulent form (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0069">69</link>). The most relevant patent citations for leishmanial immunization include vaccines containing <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> antigens and adjuvants or preparations that could be used to enhance immune responses against <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> and other antigens. At least one vaccine adjuvant has been described that is able to increase the immunogenicity of the antigen, thus improving humoral and cell-mediated immunity, without the requirement of immunostimulatory components such as mycobacteria or muramyl-type peptides, inactivated parasites, genetically attenuated parasites, or recombinant antigen peptides (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0070">70</link>). Recombinant peptides are poor immunogens when used alone, requiring the use of potent adjuvants and other less traditional approaches to elicit protective immune response. Several vaccines using this rationale have been tested experimentally in animals. Despite the large number of recombinant peptides and approaches tested, there is still a lot of research that is needed to identify a good candidate for human trials (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0071">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0072">72</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0164s0011p0003">Leishmanial DNA vaccines represent the third generation derived from antigen-encoding DNA plasmids, including heterologous prime-boost<emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> vaccine. These vaccines may be promising for control and prevention of VL. One good example is a DNA vaccine that includes sequences that encode different <emphasis>L. infantum</emphasis> genes, e.g., thiol-specific antioxidant protein (TSA), the kinetoplastid membrane protein 11 (Kmp11), and the glycoprotein GP63, for producing an immune response (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0072">72</link>). Comparatively, DNA vaccines are more stable and safer and can effectively induce humoral and T-cell-mediated immunity against VL. Large-scale production of DNA vaccines should be less costly for several reasons, including the fact that no cold chain is needed for distribution. Significant advances related to leishmanial DNA vaccines have been obtained in recent decades, for example improved formulations and new physical delivery methods that increased the vaccine uptake. Several new patents for DNA vaccines have been filed, and some have shown to be effective at least in animal models (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0072">72</link>). In summary, leishmanial vaccines could be of great value in the future to control and prevent visceral leishmaniasis. Vaccines to control veterinary leishmaniasis, such as Leishmune, which is licensed in Brazil for prophylaxis against canine VL, could be used to control <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> dissemination in animal reservoirs such as domestic dogs in regions where leishmaniasis is endemic (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0072">72</link>).

Over 60% of Chagas disease cases can be found in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. Chagas disease was considered a disease of rural areas; however, it is now ubiquitous due to social pattern changes, including rural-to-urban migration and the migration of infected persons to areas where Chagas disease would not usually be suspected. As well, transmission of the disease through blood transfusion is becoming a global issue, due to migration from regions of endemicity to nonendemicity (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0079">79</link>).

Humans contract Chagas disease when the reduviid bug (“kissing bug”) defecates while taking a blood meal and metacyclic trypomastigotes in the feces are rubbed or scratched into the bite wound or onto mucosal surfaces (steps 1–2). The trypomastigotes enter the host through the bite wound or intact mucosal membranes, such as the conjunctiva (step 2). Metacyclic trypomastigotes then invade host cells and transform into amastigotes which are nonmotile round-shaped stages (step 3) (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0083">83</link>). <emphasis>T. cruzi</emphasis> can therefore be found in two forms in humans: as amastigotes and as trypomastigotes (<anchor id="ch0164s0014s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0164s0014s0001a0007">Fig. 6</link> and <anchor id="ch0164s0014s0001a0005"/><link linkend="ch0164s0014s0001a0009">7</link>). The amastigote multiplies by binary fission in cell cytosol and differentiates into trypomastigotes (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0083">83</link>); which cause the clinical manifestations within the scope of Chagas disease (steps 4–5). Then, infected cells are destroyed and both amastigotes and trypomastigotes are released into the blood (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0083">83</link>). The trypomastigote form preferentially transforms to the amastigote stage in skeletal and cardiac muscle but can also infect any nucleated host cell in the blood (step 6). The kissing bug becomes infected by feeding on human or animal blood that contains circulating parasites (step 7). The ingested trypomastigotes transform into epimastigotes in the vector’s midgut (step 8). The epimastigotes multiply in the midgut (step 9) and differentiate into infective metacyclic trypomastigotes in the hindgut (step 1). Transmission of <emphasis>T. cruzi</emphasis> could also occur via blood transfusions, organ transplantation, transplacental transmission, and foodborne transmission.

Trypomastigotes occur in the blood in two forms: a long, slender form and a short, stubby one. The short, stubby form is thought to be the infectious form for the vector. The nucleus is situated in the center of the body, with a large, oval kinetoplast located at the posterior end. A flagellum arises from the basal body and extends along the outer edge of an undulating membrane until it reaches the anterior end of the body, where it projects as a free flagellum. When the trypomastigotes are stained with Giemsa stain, the cytoplasm stains blue and the nucleus, kinetoplast, and flagellum stain red or violet. The amastigotes measure 2 to 6 μm in diameter and are indistinguishable from those found in leishmanial infections (<link linkend="ch0164s0014s0001a0009">Fig. 7</link>).

        <para id="ch0164s0014s0002p0001">Reduviid bugs become infected by feeding on humans that have trypomastigotes circulating in the bloodstream. Other humans get infected when these infected bugs take another blood meal. However, a few other transmission routes are also possible. Transfusion-related transmission, or transmission by blood product, is a serious concern in areas of endemicity because the infective form of parasite enters freely into the new host (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0079">79</link>). Serologic screening of blood donors can be used in these regions; in areas where the disease is not endemic, questionnaires have been used for deferral of prospective donors from areas of endemicity. While potentially positive donors are excluded through a survey, a risk remains, and actions need to be taken in blood banks to avoid transmission of <emphasis>T. cruzi</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0084">84</link>). For example, blood donor units are routinely screened for Chagas disease antibodies using FDA-cleared tests (Abbott Prism Chagas and Ortho T. cruzi ELISA, Abbott Park, IL). Transmission from solid organ donors and shared intravenous needles, as well as vertical transmission from pregnant mothers to the fetus, can also occur (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0079">79</link>).

Due to population mobility (infected patients migrating from areas of endemicity), the infection can be found in many regions where the disease is not endemic, such as Spain and Japan, where physicians may not consider this infection in their diagnostic differential.</para>

      <para id="ch0164s0016p0002">The incubation period following exposure is usually 1 to 2 weeks. Most patients have nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms at all. Acute systemic signs occur around the second to third week of infection and are characterized by high fevers, hepatosplenomegaly, myalgia, erythematous rash, acute myocarditis, lymphadenopathy, and subcutaneous edema of the face, legs, and feet. The acute phase of Chagas disease in immunosuppressed patients is manifested as acute myocarditis or acute encephalitis with a high mortality rate. Most acute cases are never detected and resolve over a period of 2 to 3 months into an asymptomatic chronic stage (indeterminate phase or clinical latency period). These patients remain infected for life unless treated. Approximately 70% of individuals with chronic Chagas infection remain asymptomatic (indeterminate phase); however, they are still capable of transmitting the infection. The remaining 30% of individuals with chronic Chagas infection develop myocarditis or symptoms associated with denervation of the digestive tract (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0078">78</link>). Chronic Chagas disease signs may develop years or decades after undetected infection or after the diagnosis of acute disease. The most frequent clinical sign of chronic Chagas disease is cardiomyopathy manifested by cardiomegaly and conduction changes. Patients who acquire the infection orally (foodborne infection) have a higher incidence of myocarditis and mortality. Some patients are more likely to develop megaesophagus or megacolon. Gastrointestinal Chagas disease is rare outside Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay (southern cone countries). The “mega” condition has been associated with the destruction of ganglion cells, resulting in dysmotility, and causing dysphagia, aspiration, and regurgitation in patients with megaesophagus and severe constipation in patients with megacolon. In chronic Chagas disease, autoimmunity may also be responsible for tissue destruction in addition to the tissue destruction caused by the parasite. Reactivation of Chagas disease in HIV-positive patients usually leads to very high parasitemia and can occur in other immunosuppressed patients (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0078">78</link>). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is seldom observed, but in HIV-coinfected individuals, CNS involvement is frequently noted, and acute fatal meningoencephalitis and granulomatous encephalitis have been described for these patients.</para>
      <para id="ch0164s0016p0003">Congenital transmission from mother to fetus can occur in both acute and chronic phases of the disease. Congenital infections can cause abortion, prematurity, neurological sequelae, and mental deficiency (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0096">96</link>, <link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0097">97</link>). Infants of seropositive mothers should be monitored for up to a year after birth to rule out infection. Transmission of the infection during transplantation of solid organs and other tissues from seropositive donors has also become a significant problem (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0078">78</link>). Although transplantation of any organ or tissue from a seropositive donor should be regarded as infectious, the risk of transmission of the infection is dependent on other factors. Some recipients do not develop infections; however, all should be serially monitored for signs of infection.</para>

To improve identification of positive patients, real-time PCR using multiple gene targets has been advocated. PCR-based diagnosis demonstrates positive diagnosis days to weeks before trypomastigotes are microscopically detectable, though multiple targets are needed due to polymorphism within the gene targets. PCR-based methods have not been standardized, and multicenter studies to validate these tests have not been done. The primary target for many nucleic acid amplification tests has been kinetoplastic DNA due to the large number of copies per organism, thereby increasing the chance of detection of the infection. There have been few studies where various PCR methods used for diagnostic purposes have been compared, as most are laboratory-developed tests. Bloodstream parasitic loads are usually low in chronic patients with Chagas disease compared with parasitemia levels in patients with acute Chagas disease, due to the intermittence of the parasite in the chronic phase. To overcome this limitation, it is recommended to collect serial blood samples.</para>

The FDA and American Association of Blood Banks require that donated blood be screened for Chagas antibodies. It is also recommended by the United Network for Organ Sharing that the presence of these antibodies be tested in tissue donors.

      <para id="ch0164s0022p0001">In order to ameliorate some of the limitations of current diagnostic methods for Chagas disease, many diagnostics are in development. As mentioned above, diagnostic enzyme immunoassays (ELISAs) are commonly employed for<emphasis>T. cruzi</emphasis> diagnosis. However, performance of these diagnostics depends on the quality of antigen preparation adsorbed onto the solid phase. Trypomastigote excreted/secreted antigen (TESA) has been used widely for the detection of Chagas disease in different formats (Western blot, ELISA, multiple antigen binding assay [MABA]) and shows excellent sensitivity and specificity for all of these diagnostic assays. One group has developed four chimeric antigens from <emphasis>T. cruzi</emphasis> (IBMP-8.1 through 8.4) and tested their efficacy in phase 1 and 2 studies using indirect ELISAs. Their most promising antigen, IBMP-8.4, delivered 100% sensitivity and specificity in a panel of 5,014 serum samples. These antigens have also been developed into lateral flow assays (or rapid tests) which maintain high diagnostic accuracy and can aid in large-scale screening and point-of-care diagnosis. Other rapid tests have also been developed with varying sensitivities and specificities, including Stat-Pak (Chembio, Hauppauge, NY) and the FDA-cleared Chagas Detect Plus (InBios, Seattle, WA).</para>

Bed nets are also effective in preventing infections. Serologic screening of blood products for transfusion from areas in which the disease is endemic is highly recommended. An alternative approach to serologic testing for blood donors is the use of questionnaires to defer prospective donors from areas of endemicity. Although none have yet been approved, several vaccines are in preclinical development.

The short, stumpy forms are the infective stage for the tsetse fly. Using Giemsa or Wright stain, the granular cytoplasm stains pale blue and contains dark blue granules and possibly vacuoles. The centrally located nucleus stains reddish. The kinetoplast is located at the organism’s posterior end and stains reddish; the remaining intracytoplasmic flagellum (axoneme) may not be visible. The flagellum arises from the kinetoplast, as does the undulating membrane. The flagellum runs along the edge of the undulating membrane until the undulating membrane merges with the trypanosome body at the organism’s anterior end. At this point, the flagellum becomes free to extend beyond the body. Trypanosomal forms are ingested by the tsetse fly when a blood meal is taken. The trypomastigote has the ability to express a variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) into the coat structure on the outer membrane. The introduction of heterologous VSG molecules into the coat structure contributes to the disruption of the T-independent B-cell recognition of the trypanosome surface coat.

Serologic tests are normally used for screening, with the definitive diagnosis of infection being dependent on microscopic observation of trypomastigotes. CATT is effective in screening the population for suspected cases of <emphasis>T. brucei gambiense</emphasis> infection but not <emphasis>T. brucei rhodesiense</emphasis> infection. CATT requires refrigeration, making it difficult to use in rural areas, whereas the immunochromatographic method does not require electricity, making it easier to use in field settings. Major serodiagnostic problems with CATT include false-positive results due to malarial infections and the fact that many in the population have cross-reactivity due to exposure to animal trypanosomes that are nonpathogenic to humans. CATT does not differentiate between current and past infections, as it detects antibody levels (<link linkend="ch0164s0037s0001li0111">111</link>). Markedly elevated serum and CSF IgM concentrations are of diagnostic value. CSF antibody titers should be interpreted with caution because of the lack of reference values and the possibility of the CSF containing serum due to a traumatic tap. Intrathecal production of immunoglobulins can be found in a number of neuroinflammatory diseases.

Persons visiting areas in which the infection is endemic should wear protective clothing (long-sleeved shirts and long trousers in neutral colors) and avoid areas known to harbor tsetse flies.
