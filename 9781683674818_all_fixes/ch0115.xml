      <para id="ch0115s0000p0002">Acute viral gastroenteritis (AVG) is a common self-limiting illness affecting infants, children, and adults worldwide. Indeed, viral diarrheal diseases are the leading cause of morbidity worldwide, particularly in children less than 5 years of age (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0003">3</link>). In developed countries, AVG is associated with significant morbidity in children and the elderly, while in developing countries these infections have been associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially in infants (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0004">4</link>). The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that around 500,000 die each year as a result of AVG worldwide (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0005">5</link>). Patients with AVG usually present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and dehydration (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0006">6</link>). The clinical manifestation of AVG is due to the effects that the virus and its specific cytotoxins exert on the enterocytes of the intestine (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0007">7</link>). Viral replication in the enterocytes causes alteration in brush border enzyme production, thus causing nutrient malabsorption and osmotic diarrhea (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0004">4</link>). Moreover, viral toxins can lead to direct damage and lysis of the enterocytes and the intestinal villi, thus causing transudative loss of fluids into the intestine (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0008">8</link>). The destruction and loss of cell function can lead to electrolyte abnormalities which can in turn lead to the loss of transporter functionality (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0008">8</link>). AVG can be triggered by many viruses, most often rotavirus, caliciviruses (norovirus and sapovirus), enteric adenoviruses 40/41, and astroviruses (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0009">9</link>). However, in recent years, with the advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS), particularly from stool samples from patients with AVG, the number of potential viral pathogens causing AVG has expanded tremendously. Several viral pathogens are included in the list of potential causative agents of AVG. These include recovirus, tusavirus, bufavirus, polyomavirus, klassevirus/salivirus, Saffold virus, and cosavirus (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0010">10</link>–<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0018">18</link>). This chapter discusses the latest developments in the field of diagnosing common human AVG.</para>

      <para id="ch0115s0000p0003">Rotaviruses (RVs) are members of the<emphasis>Reoviridae</emphasis> family, currently classified into nine species (rotavirus A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, and J) (<anchor id="ch0115s0000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0115s0000a0007">Table 1</link>). The RV capsid contains an 11-segment double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0019">19</link>). RV species are classified based on their host range, sequence analysis of the conserved genome segments (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0006">6</link>) of member viruses, and the serological cross-reactivity of the group-specific antigen (VP6) that is present in the middle of the capsid. On the molecular level, it has been suggested that a cutoff value of 53% of the VP6 amino acid sequence firmly permits differentiation into the distinct RV species (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0021">21</link>). The rapid increase in use of molecular techniques worldwide has made RV genome sequencing the gold standard for classifying the virus (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0022">22</link>). The RV species are commonly referred to as RV groups; RV-A, RV-B, RV-C, and RV-H groups are known to infect animals and humans, whereas the RV-D, RV-E, RV-F, RV-G, RV-I, and RV-J groups infect only animals (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0020">20</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0115s0000p0004">Of the four RV groups that can infect humans, RV-A is the most relevant group in terms of epidemiological impact on human public health (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0023">23</link>). RV-A classification is established by a dual typing system, based on immunological reaction and the structure of the two structural external proteins, VP4 (P genotype) and VP7 (G genotypes), which bind their neutralizing antibodies independently (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0024">24</link>). Currently, at least 41 G genotypes and 57 P genotypes of RV-A have been reported in humans and animals, of which at least 60 combinations have been identified in humans and animals (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0025">25</link>). A whole RV viral genome sequencing classification nomenclature has also been developed to describe RV genome constellation of strains: G<emphasis>x</emphasis>-P[<emphasis>x</emphasis>]-I<emphasis>x</emphasis>-R<emphasis>x</emphasis>-C<emphasis>x</emphasis>-M<emphasis>x</emphasis>-A<emphasis>x</emphasis>-N<emphasis>x</emphasis>-T<emphasis>x</emphasis>-E<emphasis>x</emphasis>-H<emphasis>x</emphasis>, denoting the VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5/6 genes, with <emphasis>x</emphasis> referring to the various recognized genotypes for each gene. There are three major genotype constellations: Wa-like (G1-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1), DS-1-like (G2-P[4]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2), and AU-1-like (G3-P[9]-I3-R3-C3-M3-A3-N3-T3-E3-H3) (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0026">26</link>). Globally, the most common G and P genotype combinations that account for 90% of infections in humans were G1P[8], G2[P4], G3[P8], G4[P8], G9[P8], and G12P[8] (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0027">27</link>).</para>

Fiber-like projections protruding from the pentameric penton base proteins are responsible for host receptor binding (<link linkend="ch0115s0000a0024">Fig. 1A</link>). The capsid surrounds a DNA-containing core that consists of a single-copy viral DNA genome with other viral proteins (terminal protein, polypeptide, PVII, and pX) (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0053">53</link>).</para>

Severe illness is seen mainly in children younger than 5 years of age, with peak incidence in children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years. Sporadic illness and outbreaks in healthy adults, the elderly population, and immunocompromised patients have been reported (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0054">54</link>). AVG causative agents can be transmitted by symptomatic patients and even by asymptomatic carriers who can transmit virus before onset of symptoms (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0055">55</link>–<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0058">58</link>). In general, AVG agents are transmitted by the fecal-oral route; however, RV and NoV airborne transmission has been hypothesized in some gastroenteritis outbreaks (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0059">59</link>–<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0064">64</link>).

This is important for human transmission, as saliva from infected infants directly transmits enteric viruses to their mother’s mammary glands through backflow during suckling. This can lead to a rapid increase in maternal milk secretory IgA antibodies. Thus, this report identifies a new route for enteric viral transmission. This could have significant implications for therapeutics, viral transmission, and patient diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0065">65</link>). Enteric viruses are stable over a wide range of temperature and pH, and even after heating, drying, and freezing, they can survive on human hands and inanimate objects for an extended period.

Numerous viral antigen assays have been used to rapidly determine the cause of AVG (<anchor id="ch0115s0000a0038"/><link linkend="ch0115s0000a0040">Table 2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0115s0000p0037">Several methodologies for the rapid detection of human RV, HAdv, HAsV, NoV, and SaV antigens from patient stool samples have been developed. These include enzyme immunoassay (EIA), latex particle agglutination (LA), immunochromatography test (ICT), and more recently, chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0115">115</link>). The rapid antigen assays, in particular the RV assays, are widely used as point-of-care (POC) assays in hospital settings and can provide patient results within 30 minutes. Additionally, the low cost of these assays provides an advantage in the gastrointestinal diagnostic work-up. Antigen assays are more sensitive than the EM/IEM and tissue culture (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0115">115</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0130">130</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0134">134</link>). Rapid antigen detection assays are widely used in the pediatric setting, as patients shed large amounts of viral particles for several days during the acute phase of infection, thus increasing the sensitivity of these assays. However, a recent study comparing rapid antigen-detection kits against Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) as the gold standard revealed that there was variable sensitivity and specificity for the detection of Revision (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0135">135</link>). The sensitivity and specificity of the SD Bioline (Standard Diagnostics, Inc., South Korea), VIROTECT (Trinity Biotech, Ireland), Rota-Strip (C-1001) (Coris Bioconcept, Belgium), Acon (Acon Laboratories, Inc., San Diego, CA), and VIKIA Rota-Adeno (bioMérieux, France) kits ranged from 52.3 to 95.08% and 20 to 86.62%, respectively (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0135">135</link>). The study clearly showed that clinical laboratories must perform in-house clinical validation of these rapid assays before including them in their test menu.</para>

      <para id="ch0115s0000p0057">Conventional 96-well microplate EIAs for RV and HAdV are widely used due to their reasonably high sensitivity and specificity and consistent test results. EIAs that utilize monoclonal antibodies are widely used for the detection of group A and C RV in patient stool samples (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0136">136</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0137">137</link>). Similarly, EIAs have been developed for the rapid detection of astroviruses and caliciviruses using monoclonal antibodies. These assays had 2-fold greater sensitivity than EIA assays developed using polyclonal antibodies (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0138">138</link>). Most of the HAdV EIAs detect a common group antigen, of which 45 to 95% occurring in stool samples are HAdV serotypes 40 and 41 (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0139">139</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0115s0000p0058">The LA technique is widely used in the clinical setting for the identification of the majority of common human gastrointestinal viruses. Latex particles coated with antibodies against the different viruses agglutinate in the presence of the viral antigen in the patient stool sample (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0140">140</link>–<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0143">143</link>). However, this technique is less sensitive than EM and EIA.</para>
      <para id="ch0115s0000p0059">ICT is technically simple and is a rapid assay for the detection of common human gastrointestinal viruses, with similar clinical sensitivity as the EIA (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0144">144</link>). ICTs are designed as dipsticks or self-contained cassettes and usually include a built-in positive control that can be used to determine that the reaction has been performed and interpreted accurately. ICT is of value for small to moderate-sized laboratories that need to diagnose sporadic AVG cases. ICT can be used in medical laboratories not equipped to carry out advanced diagnostic techniques because they are inexpensive and easy to use and provide rapid on-site results (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0145">145</link>). ICT requires neither specific equipment nor advanced personnel training. One of the drawbacks of ICT is that often these assays suffer from low sensitivity, failing to produce positive results when the viral load in the patient stool sample is low (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0144">144</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0145">145</link>). In a recent study, when the RV/HAdV combo ICT assay performance was compared to PCR, the RV ICT assay gave comparable results; however, the HAdV assay was much less sensitive than PCR and could not be used as a first-line rapid screening tool for HAdV (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0145">145</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0115s0000p0060">RV vaccination can impact the interpretation of antigen tests, as fecal shedding of RV vaccine may occur, especially in the first 9 days postvaccination. Physicians should be aware of the patient’s vaccination status and time of vaccine administration when interpreting positive results (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0146">146</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0115s0000p0061">The CLIA technique is based on the capture of the viral antigen present in the stool sample by antibodies coupled with a molecule capable of emitting light during a chemical reaction (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0147">147</link>).

      <para id="ch0115s0000p0062">Molecular diagnostic techniques have dramatically improved our understanding of the circulation of AVG-causing viruses. This in part was because of the advancement in developing and validating rapid and sensitive assays that detect multiple pathogens simultaneously. Molecular assays were classically designed to directly amplify specific viral genome sequences by PCR for DNA viruses and by RT-PCR for RNA viruses. One of the biggest challenges of performing these molecular assays from stool samples is coping with the PCR inhibitors present in the samples. Because inhibitors can lead to false-negative results, internal PCR assay controls have been utilized to assess the presence of PCR inhibitors.</para>

        <para id="ch0115s0000p0063">Singleplex PCR and RT-PCR initially depended on the amplification and visualization of the viral amplicons in 1 to 2% agarose gels by electrophoresis and depended on the expected size of the amplified amplicon. The viral amplicon accumulates and plateaus as the thermal cycling goes to completion. Many singleplex (and multiplex) assays have been developed and validated for the detection of AVG pathogens (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0149">149</link>–<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0157">157</link>). These assays are more sensitive than EM, tissue culture, and antigen-based assays. Classical PCR assays have advanced our knowledge of the circulation of AVG pathogens, but these assays were primarily developed to genotype the different pathogens. Many assays were developed and used to genotype RV, based on the amplification and sequencing of its VP4 (P-types) and VP7 (G-types) genes (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0158">158</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0159">159</link>).

While these classical PCR and RT-PCR assays have dramatically improved our understanding of the AVG pathogens, they were cumbersome to perform in the diagnostic laboratory, had relatively low throughput, and were typically “open systems” with increased chance of false-positive results due to amplicon contamination in the laboratory.</para>

        <para id="ch0115s0000p0064">Real-time PCR eliminated the need for visualizing the amplified amplicons by agarose gel electrophoresis and instead utilized fluorescently labeled probes to visualize the amplified amplicons while the reaction is running in real time. qPCR and qRT-PCR assays are currently the most used assays for the rapid and sensitive detection of AVG pathogens. These assays have reduced the hands-on time the technologist needs to spend in running the assays; they have higher throughput (generally up to 96 samples per run) and, in addition, eliminate the chance of false-positive results due to contamination, since the qPCR tubes are not opened and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera reads the fluorescence generated from amplification of the pathogen amplicon. Additionally, the ability to use multiple fluorescent labels with different excitation wavelengths allowed for developing and validating multiplex assays for simultaneously detecting one to five pathogens in patient stool samples. Many laboratory-developed and commercial assays are currently available for the simultaneous detection of multiple AVG pathogens (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0161">161</link>–<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0171">171</link>). These assays have excellent analytical sensitivity of &lt;10 genome copies for rotavirus and noroviruses, in addition to excellent limits of quantification ranging over 7 to 8 log dilutions (161, 172–177).

In addition, determining the correct causative agent can help in reducing patient hospitalization length of stay and help physicians prescribe the appropriate antibiotic, thus avoiding antibiotic misuse. The IDSA guidelines recommend empirical treatment of immunocompromised patients or young infants with severe acute watery diarrhea, and thus determining the AVG causative agent will help in reducing antibiotic usage (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0007">7</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0115s0000p0068">Physicians should be cautious when interpreting these panels’ results. With the widespread implementation of rotavirus vaccines, these multiplex molecular assays can detect the shedding of the rotavirus vaccine strains in patient stool samples (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0178">178</link>). RV vaccine strains can be detected after the first RV vaccine dose; detection declines after the second and third RV doses. Physicians should be aware that RV vaccine strains, in particular G1, can be detected in patient stool samples by PCR for up to 2 weeks postvaccination. Ultimately, with the increasing use of these highly sensitive multiplex kits, our understanding of the clinical presentation and corresponding pathogens and the epidemiology of these agents will improve.</para>

        <para id="ch0115s0000p0147">Tissue culture is not considered a useful technique for the diagnosis of AVG pathogens, and it is mainly used in research. Viral isolation is technically demanding and cumbersome, some of the viruses are slow to grow, and some do not grow in tissue culture, such as caliciviruses (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0197">197</link>). Recent reports indicated that the utilization of bile acid allowed SaV, a calicivirus, to grow in the human cell lines NEC8 (testis) and HuTu80 (duodenum). The availability of tissue culture cell lines to propagate some of these viruses has allowed an exponential expansion of our understanding of these pathogens and has allowed for the production of reagents for diagnosis of these agents. RV propagation in primary cells (African green and cynomolgus monkey kidney) directly from stool samples has been more efficient than propagation in continuous cell lines like African green (CV-1) or rhesus (MA104) monkey kidney cells (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0198">198</link>). It is important to note that different RV strains vary in their capacity to grow in tissue culture (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0198">198</link>). To culture RV, culture medium must be supplemented with proteases such as trypsin or pancreatin. HAsVs have been reported to be cultivated in a variety of human and monkey cell lines; however, these cells are not permissive to all HAsV genotypes. HAdV 40/41 can be cultivated in variety of cell lines (HeLa, HEp-2, HEK293, CaCo-2, and PLC/PRF/5 cells). However, the growth in these cell lines can be slow, thus allowing other viruses to overgrow the HAdV.</para>
        <para id="ch0115s0000p0148">Tissue culture diagnostic assays must be complemented with another diagnostic tool, such as molecular or immunofluorescence assays, to determine the type of virus that was cultured, which further delays the viral diagnosis.</para>

        <para id="ch0115s0000p0149">Serological assays have not been widely used for the routine diagnosis of AVG pathogens. Indeed, serological assays have been mainly used to perform serosurveillance studies (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0199">199</link>–<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0201">201</link>). ELISA-based assays that utilize specific viral proteins for the detection of different viral antibodies have been widely used in epidemiological studies of gastrointestinal viruses such as RV, NoV, and AsV (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0202">202</link>, <link linkend="ch0115s0000li0203">203</link>). ELISA assays have been used for monitoring patients’ seroconversion, based on a collection of acute- and convalescent-phase sera during outbreak investigations.</para>
        <para id="ch0115s0000p0150">Several new antibody-measuring technologies have been developed and validated for the detection of AVG pathogens. Biolayer interferometry immunosorbent assay (BLI-ISA) was recently reported to measure the blood plasma IgG antibodies directed against HAsV capsid spike from serotypes 1 through 8 (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0204">204</link>). The luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay, a liquid-phase immunoassay that quantifies antigen-specific serum antibodies, has also been used for the quantitation of NoV antibodies (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0205">205</link>). The LIPS assay can be used as a high-throughput assay for quantitating serum antibodies that recognize diverse viral antigens.</para>
        <para id="ch0115s0000p0151">Antibody-neutralization assays that are based on plaque reduction, or epitope-blocking assays using virus-specific monoclonal antibodies, have been described for some of the gastrointestinal viruses like RV and NoV (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0206">206</link>–<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0209">209</link>).

        <para id="ch0115s0000p0152">Laboratory diagnosis of the causative agent of AVG has been hampered by multiple factors. Initially, physicians depended on empirical judgment to diagnose most AVG, and thus many cases of AVG went unrecognized. Also, because of the self-limiting nature of the illness, short duration of the infection, and absence of specific clinical management of the patients, physicians opt not to look for the viral pathogen causing the disease. The high cost of many commercial assays is another factor prohibiting physicians from requesting laboratory tests to diagnose the AVG pathogen.</para>
        <para id="ch0115s0000p0153">Laboratory confirmation of AVG can be accomplished by using viral antigen detection assays, molecular diagnostic assays, and to much less extent, serology or viral culture (<link linkend="ch0115s0000a0040">Tables 2</link> and <link linkend="ch0115s0000a0061">3</link>). Both serological assays and tissue culture have not been used in the routine laboratory diagnosis of AVG. Serological AVG assays have mainly been used for enteric virus seroepidemiological studies, while tissue culture has not been routinely used because AVG pathogens do not grow well in cell culture.</para>
        <para id="ch0115s0000p0154">Commercially available antigen assays for the rapid detection of RV and, to a lesser extent, HAdV 40/41, NoVs, SaVs, and AsVs allow for the rapid diagnosis of AVG. While these assays are inexpensive, easy to use, and widely available, they generally lack sensitivity and specificity. The moderate sensitivity may be a practical choice for the initial screening of patient stool samples if the tests are available for specific viruses, such as rotavirus.</para>
        <para id="ch0115s0000p0155">Rotavirus antigen detection assays in the pediatric setting have played an important role in the rapid diagnosis of rotavirus infections. This has allowed infection control coordinators to rapidly isolate and cohort RV-infected patients, thus preventing the spread of the infection in the hospital setting (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0211">211</link>). Similar observations were noted for NoV spread in the hospital setting. Several studies have also shown that rapid diagnosis of NoV allowed for the rapid implementation of infection control measures, thus reducing the number of hospital-acquired infections and shortening the duration of an NoV outbreak (<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0055">55</link>–<link linkend="ch0115s0000li0057">57</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0115s0000p0156">The integration of commercially available molecular assays for the detection of multiple fecal viral pathogens has started to replace the traditional assays in many settings. The availability of multiplex PCR assays has also opened the door for better understanding of the epidemiology and the disease patterns of the different enteric viral pathogens in a particular setting. The major advantage of molecular diagnostic methods is the increased sensitivity and specificity for common viruses, such as rotaviruses and adenoviruses, and the ability to detect uncultivable viruses such as noroviruses, astroviruses, and sapoviruses. However, the high sensitivity and specificity of molecular assays have complicated the interpretation of patient results, as frequent detection of viral genomes in the fecal samples of asymptomatic patients has been observed and detection of viral nucleic acid does not necessarily indicate viability. Also unclear is the clinical significance of detecting multiple pathogens in patient stool samples. Physicians should also be aware that patients with multiple viral pathogens could have been exposed to a common source of infection, such as in areas with poor water and sewage handling.</para>
