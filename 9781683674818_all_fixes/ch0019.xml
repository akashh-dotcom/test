      <para id="ch0019s0002p0001">The invention of the compound microscope is attributed to Hans and Zacharias Janssen, a Dutch father-and-son team of eyeglass makers. Their microscope had a magnification of only ×3 to ×9 (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0001">1</link>). Robert Hooke of England published <emphasis>Micrographia</emphasis> in 1665, the first known microscopy text, which included detailed descriptions and illustrations of fungi and insects seen at ×50 magnification through a compound microscope of his own design (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0001">1</link>). This publication had a profound influence on scientists of that era. A review of the original text held by The British Library states, “By changing our perspective, Hooke gives power and beauty to things that might otherwise be dismissed as disgusting or trivial” (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0002">2</link>). In 1670, the Dutch cloth merchant Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek made a single-lens microscope with much greater magnification than previous compound microscopes (approximately ×70 to ×250) and was able to view bacteria and red blood cells (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0001">1</link>). Microscope design and the applications of microscopy advanced slowly over the following centuries. In the 1870s, the German physicist Ernst Abbe developed formulas for calculating microscope optics and determined the maximum resolving power of light microscopy to be 200 nm, slightly smaller than a bacterium. He designed improved oil immersion lenses and illumination, including the Abbe condenser, which is still in use. A decade later, fellow German, August Köhler developed his standard illumination technique (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0001">1</link>). In the 20th century, fluorescence, phase-contrast, and confocal microscopy were optimized (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0001">1</link>). The modern basic light microscope appearance has changed very little and is illustrated with labeled components in <anchor id="ch0019s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0019s0002s0001a0005">Fig. 1</link>.</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0002p0002">The 21st century has witnessed improved illumination with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and the explosion of digital photomicrography and image analysis. With the advent of whole-slide automated digital imaging, first adopted in anatomic pathology, it is now possible to interpret and report Gram stains remotely from a computer screen. This advancement allows microscopy, culture processing, and culture reading to be integrated into total laboratory automation (TLA) systems (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0003">3</link>). Today, the direct examination of specimens and cultured microorganisms by light microscopy is still an integral part of clinical microbiology, serving as the first step in the detection, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of pathogenic organisms. The goals of this chapter are to provide perspective on the utility and limitations of microscopy, to describe the parts and functions of a light microscope, to review applications of specific techniques and stains, to outline and optimize a practical microscopy quality assurance plan in the context of current regulations, and to provide a vision for the sustained utility of microscopy in the molecular and digital era.</para>

        <para id="ch0019s0002s0001p0001">In the past decade, direct-specimen “sample-to-answer” multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests have infiltrated all subdisciplines of clinical microbiology and have become simple and relatively inexpensive enough that they are within reach for all laboratories. Many are even available as point-of-care tests (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0004">4</link>). Readily available molecular tests cannot detect all possible pathogens. Molecular tests cannot distinguish viable from nonviable organisms, cannot easily quantify the relative amounts of pathogens, cannot distinguish colonization from infection (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0005">5</link>), and cannot detect or quantify the normal microbiota present. With a few exceptions, they cannot predict the antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens, nor can they be used as a “test of cure,” because nucleic acids from treated pathogens may remain for up to 3 weeks after treatment (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0006">6</link>). Generally, molecular microbiology tests are more expensive than their traditional counterparts and require proprietary reagents and instruments. For these reasons, molecular techniques have not replaced microscopy and culture. Rather molecular and traditional tests coexist and serve to complement and confirm each other. A prime example is the workup of positive blood culture bottles. The traditional Gram stain from the positive bottle guides the selection of multiplex molecular identification and resistance gene detection panels, which is then followed by traditional susceptibility testing.</para>
        <para id="ch0019s0002s0001p0002">The thorough microscopic examination of a properly collected and stained specimen is still of great utility in the molecular era. The direct specimen Gram stain remains the most versatile, fastest, and least expensive stat multiplex sample-to-answer microbiology test, with the ability to detect and differentiate human cells, bacteria, yeast, fungi, mycobacteria, and some parasites.</para>

        <para id="ch0019s0002s0002p0001">Microscopic examination remains the first step in detecting a broad range of pathogens, both directly from specimens and for assessing the morphology of organisms from solid or liquid culture media. The limit of detection for bacteria in direct specimen Gram stains is 10<superscript>5</superscript> organisms per ml of fluid or tissue, which correlates to approximately one bacterial cell per oil immersion field at ×1,000 magnification (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0007">7</link>). Cytocentrifugation of liquid specimens can enhance the limit of detection to 10<superscript>4</superscript> organisms per ml (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0009">9</link>). The burden of microorganisms in human specimens is often much lower, especially with septate fungi and mycobacteria. The most profound limitation of direct specimen microscopy is poor sensitivity compared to culture and molecular techniques. Published studies have compared the sensitivity of Gram stain to that of culture, and the results vary dramatically by the quality and quantity of the specimen, how the specimen is processed, the specimen type studied, the expertise level of the reader, and the pathogen(s) ultimately identified in culture (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0010">10</link>–<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0014">14</link>). These studies are hampered by the fact that many microbiology specimens are not uniform in consistency, which leads to variations depending on the portion sampled. Respiratory specimens are primary examples, containing purulent secretions from both the lungs and saliva. Multicenter studies reveal excessive sampling variation in replicate Gram stain results of both sputum and tracheal aspirates (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0015">15</link>). In addition, intra- and intertechnologist quality (Q) scores for sputum and tracheal aspirates are highly variable (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0016">16</link>). Another limitation of traditional light microscopy in clinical microbiology is the inability to resolve organisms smaller than 200 nm (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0017">17</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0019s0002s0002p0002">The specificity of microscopy compared to culture may also be an issue in direct specimen examination. Organisms may be seen in a direct specimen examination but fail to grow in culture because the organism is nonviable due to prior antimicrobial treatment or delays in transport. In addition, anaerobic or fastidious organisms may be seen but fail to grow if appropriate incubation times or conditions are not met. Spirochetes or other unusual organisms may be seen by microscopy but are uncultivatable. Artifacts and residual stain precipitate, especially with crystal violet in the Gram stain procedure, may be misinterpreted as microorganisms. Lack of specificity may be further defined by a lack of correlation between the Gram stain reaction of an organism reported in the direct smear compared to culture growth. A direct specimen Gram stain reported as Gram-positive cocci that subsequently grows<emphasis>Moraxella catarrhalis</emphasis> shows a lack of specificity, because the organism was detected but described incorrectly. The Gram stain was likely underdecolorized or misinterpreted by the reader. Gram reaction specificity issues may also be due to the organism itself. <emphasis>Acinetobacter</emphasis>, for example, is notorious for its Gram variability, often appearing as Gram-positive cocci or diplococci in direct specimens but as Gram-negative coccobacilli or bacilli from subsequent culture (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0013">13</link>). Additionally, <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp. may stain as Gram-negative rather than Gram-positive bacilli (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0013">13</link>). Gram stain quality may be influenced by variations in specimen consistency and the thickness of the smear preparation. Thinly prepared smears may result in overdecolorization, and thick smears may result in underdecolorization. Variations in individual technique, especially with the decolorization step, may lead to inconsistencies in staining. Some laboratories have standardized the staining process by using automated instruments.</para>

These three characteristics are altered as light passes through the specimen and the different parts of the optical system of a microscope to produce an image.

      <para id="ch0019s0003p0001">In simple terms, magnification means producing an image of the desired size, larger than the original object. Magnification is principally achieved by refraction, the bending of light behaving as a ray. The refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in a medium such as glass, water, or oil. The higher the refractive index, the more bending of light there is. Common magnifications in the clinical microbiology laboratory are achieved using 10× ocular lenses and 10×, 40×, and 100× objective lenses for total magnifications of ×100, ×400, and ×1,000.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0004p0001">Increased magnification alone is not sufficient for a good-quality image. Without sufficient resolution, the image details will remain unclear. Resolution, or resolving power, is the shortest distance between two points that can be determined to be separate objects. Resolution is dependent on the numerical aperture of the objective lens. The numerical aperture is the range within which the objective lens gathers the cone of light from the condenser, and the larger the numerical aperture, the better the resolution. A high-magnification objective lens with a large numerical aperture, and thus superior resolution, comes at the price of decreased depth of field, which explains the frequent refocusing required with oil immersion microscopy at ×1,000.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0005p0001">Contrast is the ability to find and see the specimen surface or internal structural details distinctly. Differences of bright and dark and color in the specimen are also functions of contrast. The simplest method for altering contrast is to stain the specimen to enhance and distinguish detail. Contrast may also be enhanced by changing the numerical aperture of the condenser by adjusting the aperture diaphragm, without changing the numerical aperture of the objective lens. Color may be altered by the use of filters placed over the light source. The most common is a blue filter, which makes the light from tungsten or halogen lamps resemble a natural daylight color. The manipulation of light by the microscope optics may create unwanted image effects. Defects in the microscopic image are called aberrations. Spherical aberration is apparent when the center of the image is in focus but the periphery is out of focus. Chromatic aberration occurs because different colors of light are refracted differently. Chromatic aberration is apparent when color fringes are visible in the image. Microscope manufacturers put great effort into correcting aberrations, and the expense of an objective lens is directly proportional to its ability to correct aberrations.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0007p0001">Once the light passes through the collector lens, it reflects from a 45° mirror and passes through the field diaphragm. In some microscopes, the field diaphragm is positioned before the reflecting mirror. The field diaphragm determines the illuminated range of the specimen from narrow to wide and is adjusted so that light falls only on the field of view (Köhler illumination). If the field diagram is opened too far, scattered light and reflections will degrade the image quality. The field diaphragm adjustment does not affect resolution, light intensity, or numerical aperture. After passing through the field diaphragm, light may pass through an additional neutral-density or daylight (blue) filter resting on top of the field diaphragm.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0008p0001">Next, the light passes through the aperture diaphragm inside the substage condenser. The aperture diaphragm adjusts resolving power and contrast by adjusting the numerical aperture of the condenser. If the aperture diaphragm is narrowed, contrast is enhanced but resolving power and brightness are reduced. If the aperture diaphragm is widened, resolving power and brightness increase but contrast is reduced. Ideally, contrast is adjusted by setting the scaled condenser aperture diaphragm ring so that the condenser numerical aperture scale position indicates 70% of the numerical aperture of the objective lens in use. Condenser types may vary by desired application, but newer microscopes are equipped with universal condensers supporting bright-field, dark-field, and phase-contrast observation.</para>

Objective lenses are labeled with key features, usually on two sides so that the labeling is always visible to the microscopist (<anchor id="ch0019s0009a0003"/><link linkend="ch0019s0009a0008">Fig. <emphasis role="strong">3</emphasis></link>). The objectives have standardized color-coded rings denoting magnification and immersion type. Additionally, special lenses for phase-contrast and polarized light have special color codes. Some objective lenses have correction collars to compensate for coverslip thickness. Others have an internal iris diaphragm to vary the numerical aperture for special applications. A key safety feature to consider is spring-bound objectives to prevent damage if the objective is accidently slammed into a glass slide while rotating the objective in the nosepiece. If a coverslip is to be applied, objectives with sufficient working distance should be considered. Working distance is defined as the distance between the lens of the objective and the surface of the coverslip or slide. Of note, only #1½ coverslips (0.17-mm thickness) should be used.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0009p0002">All modern microscope objectives purchased from the same manufacturer for the same microscope are parfocal and parcentric, meaning that the image stays focused and centered when the objectives are changed from one magnification to the next. Selecting among the many variations in objectives and applications can be difficult. There are three basic types, and each type corrects more aberrations—and the price rises proportionally. Achromatic (plan achromat) or “education-grade” objectives are the least expensive and are often found on basic teaching microscopes. Achromat objectives are corrected for red and blue chromatic aberration and green spherical aberration and generally have a flat field of view. “Mid-grade” in quality and price are fluorite lenses, also known as semiapochromats or U plan fluorites. These are chromatically corrected for red and blue light and spherically corrected for two or three colors. The corrections yield a higher numerical aperture and increased overall image quality. The most highly corrected and expensive “research-grade” objectives are plan apochromats, which chromatically correct for red, green, and blue and spherically correct for two or three colors. From a practical clinical microbiology laboratory standpoint, achromats are suitable for 10× and 40× objectives, but a minimum of a fluorite/semiapochromat is highly recommended for the 100× oil immersion objective. To demonstrate the relative expense of the three objective lens types, the current (2022) list prices of 100× oil immersion plan achromat, U plan fluorite, and U plan S apochromat from two leading manufacturers are approximately $850.00, $2,350.00, and $6,500.00, respectively.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0010p0001">The eyepieces, or oculars, contain the final lenses in the optical train. These lenses focus the final image onto the eyes of the viewer. The ocular lens has three variables: magnification, eye point, and field number. Eyepieces are labeled with key features, similar to objective lenses. Magnifications of ×10 are the norm in clinical microbiology laboratories. The eye point, or eye relief, is the distance from the lens to the eye that is necessary to see the entire field of view. High-eye-point eyepieces are necessary for people who wear glasses and are usually marked with an eyeglasses picture or icon. Field number is the size of the field of view seen at the proper eye point. Field numbers of 20 are standard and are common on entry-level microscopes. Field numbers of 22 are wide field, and 26.5 is super-wide field. Generally, only one eyepiece contains the diopter adjustment ring, which is necessary to compensate for focusing differences between the eyes. One of the eyepieces may be fitted with a reticle containing an ocular micrometer. The ocular micrometer is especially useful for measuring ova and parasites. Each objective lens should be calibrated on the specific microscope before use and again if any component of the optical train is changed (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0019">19</link>).</para>

The technique is also known as double-diaphragm illumination because it involves adjustments to both the field iris diaphragm in the microscope base and the aperture iris diaphragm in the condenser. There are many variations to the basic approach. Some procedures involve removing eyepieces and peering down the body tube for adjustments, and some state that when changing from a 10× to 40× or 100× objective, realignment of both the field and aperture diagrams is required, but in practice these steps are not practical or necessary. An established succinct procedure that has worked well in a medical laboratory science program is detailed at the end of the chapter. The procedure includes initial diopter and interpupillary adjustments. When set up properly, the microscope will display a bright, evenly illuminated image without glare. The light intensity is adjusted by using the lamp voltage control and/or neutral density filters, not by raising and lowering the condenser. Of note, newer LED-illuminated microscopes from leading manufacturers feature “light intensity management” systems which eliminate the step of adjusting lamp brightness when changing magnification.</para>

A common alternative approach is simply to vary the light intensity to preference and raise the condenser high, almost touching the stage, for oil immersion (×1,000) and lower it toward the microscope base for low-power observation (×10 and ×40). Some laboratories employ convenient swing-out top lens condensers so that the entire condenser does not need to be raised and lowered each time the objective is changed. If feasible, the use of the Köhler approach is highly recommended because it produces superior images and reduces the glare associated with eye fatigue.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0012p0001">Bright-field microscopy is the basic technique of any light microscope in the clinical laboratory. It involves the passage of light through or the reflection of light off a specimen. The light is usually not altered by the application of filters or polarizers. The bright-field approach is the most widely used, with illumination from below the specimen and through a condenser, and observation from above the specimen through a series of objective and ocular lenses. Illumination is provided by either a tungsten filament lamp or, in newer microscopes, an LED. LED-equipped microscopes cost slightly more than similarly equipped halogen bulb microscopes but extend the bulb service life to a claimed 60,000 hours. The stained or unstained specimen appears brightly lit against a white background. The quality of the image is dependent on the thickness and translucency of the specimen and on adjustments to optimize magnification, resolution, contrast, depth of field, and brightness. Upright, inverted, and stereomicroscopes all utilize bright-field microscopy. A common enhancement to bright-field microscopy is oil immersion at ×1,000. Immersion oil occupies the air space between the glass slide and the microscope objective lens. Without oil, the light travels through air to reach the objective lens. Air has a refractive index of 1.003. The oil increases the refractive index to 1.515, maximizing the numerical aperture of the objective lens and producing a homogeneous optical path from the glass slide to the immersion oil and to the objective lens. Some microscopes allow the additional placement of immersion oil between the bottom of the slide and the condenser, further enhancing the light-gathering properties of the system.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0013p0001">The fluorescence microscope was developed in the early 20th century (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0001">1</link>). With reflected-light fluorescence (epifluorescence), organisms on the microscope slide are irradiated by a specific wavelength of intense excitation light, typically from a 100-W mercury or 75-W xenon source. The light is directed horizontally through the illuminator and then vertically down through the microscope objective, which acts as a condenser. The organism then “glows” by releasing a weaker emission light, with only this weaker emission light traveling back up the objective and seen by the viewer. The emission light is always a longer wavelength than the excitation light and is orders of magnitude weaker. The resulting effect of “glowing” against a black background is very easy for the viewer to see, as long as the viewer is in the correct focal plane. The technique is accomplished by using a specific set of excitation and emission (barrier) filters for each application, as shown in <anchor id="ch0019s0013a0003"/><link linkend="ch0019s0013a0005">Table 1</link>. The filters are housed in an optical block or filter cube, along with a dichroic mirror, also known as a beam splitter. A series of optical cubes for multiple applications are housed in a turret on the microscope. Generally, special stains (fluorochromes) are required, but some organisms, such as <emphasis>Cyclospora</emphasis>, autofluoresce under UV light. A principal advantage of fluorescence microscopy is an increase in sensitivity. For example, the acridine orange stain, which stains both RNA and DNA, detects bacteria at 10<superscript>4</superscript> organisms per ml (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0009">9</link>), an order of magnitude more sensitive than the Gram stain. Using stains that have affinity for only certain organisms, such as auramine-rhodamine for acid-fast bacilli, also enhances the specificity of the technique. Another advantage is that slides may be rapidly scanned on low power, switching to high power only if suspicious fluorescent structures are seen. Great care must be taken to stay in the correct focal plane.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0013p0002">In addition to the acridine orange and auramine-rhodamine stains, many laboratories utilize the calcofluor white stain for fungi, various direct fluorescent-antibody techniques, and, most recently, fluorescence<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization. Fluorescence microscopy requires a room that can be darkened, special expertise and reagents, and expensive equipment. Generally, special fluorescence microscope objectives (plan fluor) are needed, with high transmission rates and enhanced flatness of field. The mercury and xenon lamps operate at very high temperatures, have short life spans, and require a tedious alignment process when being replaced. For these reasons, fluorescence microscopy generally is not used in smaller clinical microbiology laboratories. The techniques can be technically demanding and may cause eye strain. Quenching of fluorescence may occur when the beam of light is left on a structure of interest too long, much to the consternation of the inexperienced microbiologist. Caution must be exercised to not expose stained slides to strong room light or sunlight. If a laboratory is considering fluorescence microscopy techniques, consultation with both the reagent vendor and the microscope vendor is advised. Although a fluorescence illuminator may be retrofitted to an existing bright-field microscope, it is advantageous to purchase the microscope and matching illuminator, special objectives, and filters as a bundle. Newer compact fluorescence units utilize fiber optics and do not require tedious alignment of the light source. LED fluorescence units are another option. These units are expensive but generate much less heat, and the bulbs last up to 20,000 hours. Low-autofluorescence immersion oil is required for oil immersion applications. Stained slides for review should be stored away from light at 4 to 8°C.</para>

Some newer microscope models come equipped with universal condensers, making phase-contrast microscopy much more convenient. Phase-contrast microscopy is technically complex, involving changes in both light phase and amplitude (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0020">20</link>). Direct light and refracted light are shifted out of phase ¼ wavelength each so that when each arrives on the image plane, the light is out of phase ½ wavelength, resulting in increased contrast. Phase-contrast microscopy has been applied to viewing direct wet mounts and unstained cell culture where the specimen itself is transparent. The technique enhances the contrast between bright and dark for viewing the interior structures of cultured cells and subtle cytopathic effects common in viral culture. The widespread adoption of molecular techniques for detecting motile organisms, such as <emphasis>Trichomonas</emphasis> and <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis>, and the replacement of cell culture in virology with multiplex direct specimen testing have diminished the utility of phase-contrast microscopy.</para>

Light rays impact an object in the field of view at an oblique angle such that no direct light rays, only reflected rays, enter the microscope objective. Bacteria appear as bright organisms against a dark background. Since this is a wet live technique, the corkscrew-like motility of spirochetes may be observed.

      <para id="ch0019s0017p0001">Direct specimen microscopy is actionable information, especially in normally sterile body fluids or tissues. A physician may initiate antimicrobial therapy based on “Gram-positive diplococci” seen in a Gram stain from cerebrospinal fluid or narrow to antifungal therapy based on “aseptate hyphae” seen in a potassium hydroxide preparation from a case of invasive mucormycosis. Accordingly, microscopic reports should be as accurate and timely as possible, and microscopy should be included in the overall quality assurance program. The quality of microscopy results is dependent on five key factors. An appropriate specimen is processed and applied to the slide in sufficient quantity, fixed and stained correctly, examined and interpreted by a competent microbiologist, and reported in a timely fashion using terminology that is understood by the health care provider who ordered the test. Subsequently, the culture growth should correlate with the microscopic report. If the culture growth does not correlate with the microscopic findings, the discrepancy should be investigated and resolved immediately. Of the five factors listed above, only two can be somewhat standardized through automation. Current total laboratory automation systems can standardize the application of specimens to slides, and automated Gram stainers can standardize the staining process (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0022">22</link>). All of the other factors are profoundly subject to human variables and error. The emerging application of machine learning to the reading, interpretation, and reporting of Gram stains will further standardize microscopy.

      <para id="ch0019s0018p0001">Over 7,900 laboratories globally are accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0023">23</link>). In recent microbiology checklist versions, the CAP has incorporated items addressing microscopy quality. The CAP microbiology checklist item MIC.21530 specifically addresses the use of the Gram stain “to provide a preliminary identification of organisms, evaluate specimen quality when appropriate, and to guide work-up of cultures.” The “Note” commentary below this requirement states, “The policy should address correlation of direct Gram stain results with final culture results.” This requirement does not detail a specific approach, leaving it to the individual laboratory to design an approach that will be deemed acceptable to an inspector. The requirement also does not establish a benchmark for an acceptable error rate for Gram stain-to-culture correlation. A benchmark of overall 90% correlation of Gram stain to culture correlation is reasonable and attainable (author unpublished data). This metric can be tallied monthly and can be used as an ongoing quality metric for the laboratory. Correlations can be further examined by individual culture type and body site. Blood cultures and normally sterile body fluids should be given the highest scrutiny due to the potential for negative patient outcomes (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0013">13</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0019s0018p0002">The task of correlating microscopic to culture results can be daunting, especially for samples from body sites that contain normal microbiotas (respiratory) or are likely to have mixed microbiotas (abdominal or surface wounds). Although some laboratory information systems may be programmed to flag discrepant Gram stain versus culture results, these systems are often burdensome, often flagging an excessive number of slides for review. A simple approach is outlined in flowchart form in<anchor id="ch0019s0018a0003"/><link linkend="ch0019s0018a0007">Fig. 4</link>. The approach was developed after a sentinel event in my laboratory based on an erroneous sterile body site Gram stain that led to inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. I correlated Gram stain to culture growth data from a large reference laboratory for an entire year. Two definite correlations were noted. If a culture grew into the fourth quadrant (heavy or 4+ growth), a corresponding morphotype was reported in the direct specimen Gram stain more than 90% of the time. Conversely, if an organism grew only in the first quadrant (1+), a corresponding morphotype was reported in the direct specimen Gram stain less than 10% of the time (my unpublished data). Similar correlations were noted when quantitative cultures grew &gt;100,000 or &lt;10,000 CFU/ml, respectively. This approach places the responsibility of Gram stain-to-culture correlation on the microbiologist at the bench reading the culture for the first time. The microbiologist correlates what was seen to what is growing, examining for three extremes: Gram stain negative/culture positive (no organism seen despite heavy [4+] growth in culture), Gram stain positive but incorrect morphology/culture positive (an organism seen but incorrect Gram reaction or morphology), and Gram stain positive/culture negative (an organism seen but no corresponding growth in culture). The investigation approach varies depending on the discrepancy but should be timely, preferably before preliminary results are reported to the clinician.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0019p0001">Microscopy competency is an integral part of the overall quality assurance plan. Accrediting organizations require assessment and documentation of competency for all testing personnel for all procedures semiannually the first year an employee tests specimens and at least annually thereafter. Specifically, six elements are required by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for all laboratory disciplines (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0024">24</link>). Briefly, these elements are direct observation of testing; monitoring the recording and reporting of results; reviewing intermediate test results, worksheets, quality control, proficiency testing, and preventive maintenance records; direct observation of instrument maintenance; assessment of test performance through testing previously analyzed specimens; and assessment of problem-solving skills. By combining a Gram stain/microscopy review policy, and through retention of specimens and slides, four of the six elements of competency are met. Two CAP checklist items specifically address microscopy competency. The first addresses Gram stain reporting in the context of culture identification. CAP Microbiology Checklist item MIC.11060, Culture Result Reporting, states in the “Note” section, “Personnel performing Gram stains for this purpose are subject to competency assessment.” CAP Microbiology Checklist item MIC.11350, Morphologic Observation Evaluation, states, “The laboratory evaluates consistency of morphologic observation among personnel performing Gram, trichrome, and other organism stains at least annually.”</para>

      <title>Suggested Slide Retention Policy</title>
      <anchor id="ch0019s0020a0001"/>
      <anchor id="ch0019s0020a0002"/>
      <para id="ch0019s0020p0001">A successful microscopy quality assurance program requires that specimens and/or slides be retained for a reasonable amount of time for potential review. The CAP Laboratory Accreditation Manual states that microbiology slides must be retained for at least 7 days. The slide retention policy should be incorporated into the departmental procedure manual. A simple approach is to keep the stained slides as close to the microscope as possible, filed in “day boxes” that are shielded from light, one box for each day of the week so that the slides may be readily accessed for review. Alternatively, slides may be arranged by body site or bench/work station. Some laboratories may also want to retain an unstained duplicate slide. With the advent of digital cameras attached to microscopes, it is possible to save representative images. This is especially helpful for wet preparations and fluorescence methods that do not keep well over time. An organized collection of slides and/or images with common and uncommon findings should be retained for training and competency purposes. Suitable reference texts should be available at the microscope bench. The<emphasis>Direct Smear Atlas</emphasis>,” published by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, is highly recommended (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0025">25</link>). This laminated, ring-bound text contains over 250 direct specimen Gram stains, all at a consistent ×1,000 oil immersion magnification. The CAP publishes four laminated ring-bound benchtop reference guides containing color photomicrographs for Gram stains, parasitology, mycology, and arthropods (<ulink url="https://documents.cap.org/documents/2021-2022-cap-publications-catalog.pdf">https://documents.cap.org/documents/2021-2022-cap-publications-catalog.pdf</ulink>). It is recommended that at least one microscope in the laboratory be fitted with a dual-head configuration, either side by side or face to face, to facilitate supervisor-to-employee slide review and competency. The dual-head microscope used in this way can fulfill three of the CLIA requirements for competency: direct observation of testing, assessment of test performance through testing previously analyzed specimens, and assessment of problem-solving skills.</para>

      <para id="ch0019s0021p0001">In the United States, microbiology and point-of-care management and laboratory staff should have a general awareness of the scope of provider-performed microscopy (PPM). PPM is defined as a select group of nine moderately complex microscopy tests that may be performed, usually at the point of care, by physicians, midlevel practitioners (nurse midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant), and dentists (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0024">24</link>). Of note, the Gram stain is classified as highly complex, and therefore providers are prohibited from performing this test under the current regulations (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0026">26</link>). The intent of the PPM rule is to allow the provider to easily and quickly perform the analysis on “specimens that quickly deteriorate or are not easily transportable.” CLIA resources specify personnel, training, competency assessments, and safety requirements (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0027">27</link>). The laboratory must develop a quality system and is subject to CMS inspections. Most importantly, the laboratory must obtain a CLIA certificate for PPM procedures issued by CMS through an application process using the CMS-116 form (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0024">24</link>). In some institutions, health care providers, unaware of the regulations, may seek access to the microbiology laboratory to personally perform microscopy on specimens they have collected. Although it may be perceived as a token of good will between the microbiology laboratory and the provider, this practice should be prohibited based on the CLIA regulations.</para>

Instructions for secure transmission of images and patient information are available at<ulink url="http://www.cdc.gov/dpdx">www.cdc.gov/dpdx</ulink>.</para>
        <para id="ch0019s0021s0001p0002">The basic requirements for image capture are an existing light microscope with a trinocular head for the camera mount, a digital microscope camera, recording media such as a USB device, and a color monitor, all placed on a sturdy vibration-free benchtop, away from centrifuges and other equipment that may introduce vibrations. Due to the potential for technical incompatibility and frustration, it is wise to have on-site vendor demonstrations of potential new equipment on the specific microscope on which the camera will be mounted, utilizing the specific microscopic techniques with which images will be captured. If the budget allows, purchasing a new microscope and digital camera as a system with vendor installation and training is a better option. Some newer microscope models feature a one-touch “image capture button” integrated into the base of the microscope. Olympus (Tokyo, Japan), Nikon (Tokyo, Japan), and Zeiss (Jena, Germany) produce high-quality and simple-to-use cameras and accessories specific to their microscopes, provide on-site demonstrations and training, and can make very specific recommendations for compatible computers and tablet-style or wide-screen monitors. The vendors also can make specific recommendations for image analysis and editing software. Digital photomicrographs may be captured in TIFF or JPEG formats. Image file sizes of 2 to 12 megapixels are suitable for most applications, including publication. As the image file size (in megapixels) increases, the camera cost increases proportionally, but increased megapixels cannot compensate for poor microscope objective lenses or poor technique. Exposure settings, manual and automatic, sensitivity settings (ISO), white balance, sharpness, and zoom settings may be varied depending on the application and are quite similar to a standard digital camera. Scale bars may be superimposed onto the images for size/magnification documentation. Fluorescence microscopy is still problematic and requires a more expensive type of camera.</para>

The MetaFer slide scanning and imaging platform uses a 40× dry objective, a departure from the traditional oil immersion ×100 Gram stain.

The images may be zoomed, cropped, and edited from the smartphone with ease. Smartphone images may also be attached to text messages for instantaneous consultation with other health care providers and laboratory directors. If smartphone camera images are incorporated into a laboratory procedure, they should be validated in comparison to duplicate images captured on a microscope-mounted digital camera. Specifically, scale and image quality factors such as sharpness, noise, color accuracy, and contrast must be evaluated. Caution regarding the sharing of images should be observed. Because technology advances faster than legislation, HIPAA compliance and security regulations regarding patient microscopic images shared on mobile devices are still evolving.</para>

        <para id="ch0019s0023s0001p0001">Microscopes should be located on sturdy vibration-free benches away from dusty areas, direct sunlight, and laboratory chemicals such as solvents. Microscopes should not be placed on benches with centrifuges or other vibrating equipment. It is efficient to locate a computer keyboard and monitor next to each microscope to facilitate immediate entry of results. Power supply cords should be certified by the applicable approval agency (Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., in the United States) and be inspected regularly for fraying or cracks. Cords should be connected to grounded three-conductor power outlets. Movement of microscopes from bench to bench should be minimized. Ideally, the microscope and digital camera should be turned off and covered when not in use. Microscopes should be on a regular yearly cleaning and maintenance schedule with documentation. Microscopes in heavy use may need cleaning and maintenance more often. Since immersion oil may act as a solvent, weakening the optical mounting cement, it should be removed from the objectives, condenser, and mechanical stage after each use. Do not allow immersion oil to get on the high dry or low-power lenses. This can be avoided by mounting the low-power objective between the high-power and oil immersion objectives in the nosepiece and only turning the nosepiece clockwise to go from low power to high dry and counterclockwise to go from low power to oil immersion. Threaded nosepiece slots without objectives should be plugged. Lenses should be cleaned only with a manufacturer-recommended cleaner and lens paper. Thorough professional cleaning should be scheduled semiannually.</para>

        <para id="ch0019s0023s0002p0001">Using a conventional microscope for any length of time can become uncomfortable. In one study, roughly 50 to 70% of microscope operators reported pain in the neck, shoulders, back, lower back, lower arms, wrists, and hands and fingers. Eyestrain was reported in 20 to 50%, headaches in 60 to 80%, and leg and foot pain by 20 to 35% (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0026">26</link>). There are five variables that contribute to comfort while performing microscopy: the microscope itself, the bench the microscope sits on, the chair, the individual’s posture, and the amount of time spent at the microscope between breaks. In a busy multiple-employee clinical microbiology laboratory, it is not practical to customize the microscope, the bench, and the chair to an individual, but adjustments can be made to each variable to maximize comfort and minimize pain. Management should make every effort to accommodate employees who report pain from microscopy. The purchase of new equipment is less expensive than missed work days, loss of productivity, and workers’ compensation claims. Some hospitals have ergonomics experts in employee health departments, and they may be of great assistance in convincing management to upgrade or purchase ergonomically friendly equipment.</para>
        <para id="ch0019s0023s0002p0002">Purchase of a newer ergonomically designed microscope or adjustment and modification of an existing microscope can increase eye and neck comfort. Microscope eyepieces should include diopter adjustment to compensate for minor focusing problems. The binocular head height may be adjusted on many microscopes. Fitting the microscope with tilting observation tubes with eyepieces with variable length adjustment is also an option. High-eyepoint eyepieces may be used to accommodate employees performing microscopy while wearing eyeglasses. A less complicated solution is simply to fit each microscope in the laboratory with a digital camera and accompanying computer display, eliminating the practice of peering through the eyepieces altogether. This approach requires some visual adjustment, because the image is rectangular rather than round and does not show the full field of view as displayed in the eyepieces.</para>
        <para id="ch0019s0023s0002p0003">Improper microscope bench height can contribute to poor ergonomics, causing stooping and pain in the shoulders. Modular, adjustable workstations, rather than built-in casework, allow for height flexibility. Kewaunee Scientific offers adjustable benches that can be raised and lowered from 28 to 44 inches at the push of a button. RDM Industrial Products offers similar benches with hand cranks and more expensive versions with memory settings for individual bench height. Other manufacturers offer similar products. A less expensive approach is the use of an aftermarket microscope base to raise and lower the microscope rather than the entire bench. Adjustable bases also allow fore and aft adjustment to tilt the entire microscope for a better viewing angle.</para>

        <para id="ch0019s0023s0002p0004">Ergonomic, customizable laboratory chairs and stools are available from Fisher Scientific and multiple other manufacturers. Chairs with pneumatic adjustment with lumbar support, height and angle adjustment, armrest adjustment, and foot rest rings are available. One size or brand certainly does not fit all, but some manufacturers are eager to supply samples for demonstration. Padded wrist rests are helpful for some microscopists and are available from numerous vendors.</para>
        <para id="ch0019s0023s0002p0005">Proper posture is the most important variable to ensure pain-free microscopy. The Olympus and Nikon websites have excellent resources for microscopy ergonomics, and the following tips are condensed from those sites (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0030">30</link>). The employee should mindfully take a top-to-bottom-of-the-body approach to include the eyes, neck, back, arms, wrists, legs, and feet. The microscope eyepieces should be below the eyes with the eyes looking down at an angle of 30 to 45 degrees. The diopter and interpupillary distance should be adjusted for comfort. The neck and head should bend very little, not to exceed 10 to 15 degrees. The microscopist should adjust the chair as needed and sit with the back as straight as possible but leaning slightly forward with the chair lumbar support supporting the back and the upper portion of the chair supporting the shoulder blades. The upper arms should be perpendicular to the floor with the elbows tight against the body. The forearms should be parallel to the floor, and the wrists should be straight. Be mindful to sit in the chair evenly, applying pressure to the back of both thighs. The feet should be flat on the floor or positioned on a footrest. Achieving the above position takes time and practice. Although it may seem awkward, asking a coworker to observe and assist in microscopy posture is helpful.</para>
        <para id="ch0019s0023s0002p0006">Last, the microscopist should take regular breaks from the microscope, ranging from 5 to 10 min per hour (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0030">30</link>). Walking, stretching, and focusing on distant objects helps to alleviate body and eye stress. In some laboratories, it may be possible to ensure an equitable division of labor such that no one individual is at the microscope for an uncomfortable amount of time.</para>

        <para id="ch0019s0023s0003p0001">Despite recent advances in molecular microbiology, the microscopic examination of specimens will likely remain a key component of the diagnostic process well into the future. A stat Gram stain from a well-collected specimen is faster and detects a wider range of pathogens than any current multiplex molecular test. A wet preparation, though insensitive compared to molecular tests, is a fast and convenient way to detect<emphasis>Candida, Trichomonas</emphasis>, or clue cells indicative of <emphasis>Gardnerella</emphasis>. An acid-fast sputum stain rapidly detects significant acid-producing organisms when a <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> complex PCR is negative.</para>
        <para id="ch0019s0023s0003p0002">The microscope of the future will likely have an integrated video monitor, with traditional eyepieces as a secondary back-up feature, reducing body and eye fatigue. Continuous autofocus, image stabilization, and extended depth of focus through real-time image processing will greatly improve image viewing. LEDs and the miniaturization of fluorescence modules are broadening the range of microscopy techniques.</para>
        <para id="ch0019s0023s0003p0003">The physical location where microscopy is reviewed and interpreted and results are determined is no longer confined to the laboratory. It may be possible for the future clinical microbiologist to work from home. Whole-slide imaging systems with reading of slides from computer screens rather than directly from the microscope have profound implications for microbiology (<link linkend="ch0019s0024s0001li0003">3</link>). Essentially, an entire microscope slide can be scanned through multiple focal planes, stored in a cloud-based system, and viewed and interpreted by anyone, anywhere. The viewer can zoom in and out, make notes, capture images, and make landmarks for return viewing. This technology may extend the role of the “expert” microbiologist to health care facilities that do not have interpretive expertise for CLIA highly complex tests. As imaging and machine learning continue to advance, this technology may augment or even completely replace the human interpretive functions in microscopy.</para>
