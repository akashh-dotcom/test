      <para id="ch0097s0001p0001">The World Health Organization (WHO) has described drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) as a continued “public health threat.” The highest incidence of TB is reported in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, with the following eight countries reporting the highest number of cases and making up two-thirds of the global burden of TB: India, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0001">1</link>). An estimated 3 to 4% of people diagnosed with TB disease have rifampin-resistant TB (RR-TB) or multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). MDR-TB is defined as disease caused by <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> complex (MTBC) organisms that are resistant to isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF), the two most effective drugs in the standard regimen for TB treatment (commonly referred to as “first-line” drugs). Less common but more serious forms of DR-TB are pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB; defined as MDR-TB plus resistance to fluoroquinolones [FQs]) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB; defined as MDR-TB plus resistance to FQs and at least one additional group A drug). Group A drugs are the most potent of the “second-line” TB drugs. They require longer courses of treatment than first-line drugs and include FQs, bedaquiline (BDQ), and linezolid (LZD). The definition of DR-TB continues to evolve as new drugs come to market and treatment regimens evolve; it is important to stay abreast of these changes. It should also be noted that the surveillance definition for DR-TB may vary by jurisdiction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated their definition of DR-TB in January 2022 (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0002">2</link>), and this definition is slightly different from the updated definition released by the WHO in January 2021 (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0003">3</link>). While the threat of DR-TB is an ongoing challenge, new drugs and new drug treatment regimens have shown decreases in toxicity and are better tolerated than older regimens, which in turn may begin to increase compliance and treatment success of DR-TB (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0004">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0001p0002">A delay in diagnosis and/or inappropriate treatment contribute to the transmission of drug resistance (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0005">5</link>). In the United States, a task force was convened to develop a plan to combat and control DR-TB. The task force report emphasized the need to enhance laboratory capacity to rapidly and accurately detect DR-TB (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0006">6</link>). The availability of tools for rapid detection of drug resistance is essential. The Hain Lifescience line probe assay and the Cepheid GeneXpert MTB/RIF were the first tools to be endorsed by the WHO for the molecular diagnosis of DR-TB, in December 2008 and 2010, respectively. The number of endorsed tests is growing with the addition of new tests with different characteristics (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0008">8</link>). Therefore, enhancing the capacity of laboratories to quickly detect drug resistance and to test for susceptibility to drugs used for DR-TB treatment is a key component of the efforts to combat disease. Appropriate treatment of XDR-TB with individualized treatment based on the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) increases the chance of successful outcome. This may include testing a range of drugs, therapeutic drug monitoring, adverse event monitoring and management, and nutritional and psychological support (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0009">9</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0001p0003">Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and aerobic actinomycetes can also cause substantial disease in humans (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0010">10</link>). The incidence of NTM infection continues to increase, particularly in certain patient populations, and AST for NTM and aerobic actinomycetes is an important component of optimal patient care (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0011">11</link>). The use of molecular tests to detect drug resistance and resistance mechanisms may also play an important role in guiding treatment. In addition, the increasing number of new species for which identification, subsequent determination of clinical significance, and AST, if appropriate, are required, continues to challenge laboratories providing this testing (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0012">12</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0001p0004">This chapter includes a description of the main laboratory tools for the detection of antimicrobial resistance (drug resistance) in TB, other mycobacterial infections, and aerobic actinomycetes. There is an increased emphasis on molecular assays in this chapter compared with previous versions, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques which are rapidly developing and becoming more accessible.</para>

        <para id="ch0097s0001s0001p0001">Although a variety of antimicrobial agents are available for treating mycobacterial disease, not all drugs are suitable for treating all types of infections. Furthermore, in the face of antimicrobial resistance, the choice of alternative therapies can be challenging, and clinical experience becomes a prevailing factor. For uncommon mycobacterial infections, the clinician may be faced with a dilemma in choosing a treatment regimen because of a lack of clinical precedence or unclear efficacy. The situation is confounded further by the need to treat mycobacterial infections with a combination of drugs to improve efficacy, to prevent resistance, or to overcome intrinsic resistance. Nevertheless, there have been several recent advances with the approval of new drugs and the improvement of drug regimens that offer hope.</para>
        <para id="ch0097s0001s0001p0002">The antimicrobial agents that are used in treating mycobacterial infections are discussed below and are summarized in<anchor id="ch0097s0001s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0097s0001s0001a0005">Table 1</link> (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0013">13</link>). Antimicrobial agents are discussed below in alphabetical order. For TB, first-line drugs are less toxic, can be given orally using short-course therapy, and are used to treat pulmonary TB disease susceptible to those agents. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document on AST of mycobacteria, M24, currently recommends testing all first-line drugs (INH, RIF, ethambutol [EMB], and pyrazinamide [PZA]) (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>). Testing for second-line drugs may be performed in reference centers when RIF resistance is identified if a laboratory does not have the capacity to perform testing. Whenever possible, rapid molecular testing should be utilized as well as phenotypic AST methods. FQs (moxifloxacin and levofloxacin) and other newer oral antimicrobial drugs are used to build an appropriate MDR-TB treatment regimen. BDQ, LZD, and FQs are the key drugs to test to inform clinicians for DR-TB treatment (group A drugs in the WHO classification) (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0015">15</link>). Group B and group C oral drugs, clofazimine (CFZ), ethionamide (ETH), pretomanid, delamanid (DLM), cycloserine (CS), and <emphasis>para</emphasis>-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) can be used to complete the regimen when one or more of the group A drugs cannot be used (e.g., in the case of pre-XDR-TB or XDR-TB). A 2022 rapid communication by the WHO endorsed a short-course, 6-month MDR/pre-XDR regimen, “BPaL/BPaL-M,” based on three or four drugs (pretomanid, BDQ, and LZD, with or without moxifloxacin) for persons with no previous exposure to these drugs (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0016">16</link>). Injectable drugs such as capreomycin (CAP) and kanamycin (KAN) have been recommended to be phased out of use due to their toxicity and limited efficacy (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0017">17</link>). Amikacin (AMK) may be used only in exceptional cases where an alternative treatment regimen is not available. Pretomanid, in combination with BDQ and LZD, is recommended for pre-XDR-TB and XDR-TB cases, sometimes in combination with moxifloxacin to shorten MDR-TB treatment. Although laboratory testing is not yet widely performed for many of these newer agents, there are reference laboratories that are able to provide this service. For first- and some second-line drugs, commercial molecular tests are available which assist in the selection of an appropriate treatment regimen without needing to wait for culture and phenotypic AST results. In addition, advances in NGS-based technology (whole-genome sequencing and targeted sequencing) allow a high degree of accuracy in predicting resistance to most antimicrobial agents in use for TB treatment. The WHO published a catalog in 2021 that classifies the mutations conferring resistance to the main anti-tuberculous (anti-TB) drugs based on the confidence of the association with resistance (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0018">18</link>). This catalog will be regularly updated to provide information, particularly for newer anti-TB drugs, including BDQ, LZD, DLM, and pretomanid, for which the first version of the catalog currently does not provide sufficient information. The next update to the catalog is expected in the first quarter of 2023.</para>

        <para id="ch0097s0001s0001p0005">Drug resistance in MTBC organisms occurs randomly and at a frequency that varies for the different drugs and is usually the result of single-step mutations. Two types of drug resistance are seen: primary and acquired. Primary drug resistance occurs in an individual who is infected with a drug-resistant strain before antimicrobial treatment is initiated. Acquired resistance can emerge against any of the antimicrobial agents during chemotherapy as a result of spontaneous mutations selected by inadequate or inappropriate treatment (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0019">19</link>). Antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in MTBC have been well studied. There are five well-known categories of resistance found in mycobacteria, including (i) decreased uptake of drug, as seen in dormant acid-fast bacilli; (ii) drug inactivation by constitutive β-lactamases; (iii) increased efflux, as seen in FQ resistance; (iv) alteration of the target, as described below for RIF and INH; and (v) reduced prodrug-activating enzymes, as exhibited in INH and PZA resistance (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0020">20</link>).

Diarylquinolines inhibit mycobacterial ATP synthase, a newly recognized mechanism of anti-TB action distinct from all previous anti-TB drugs. Critical concentrations of BDQ for TB in solid and liquid media have been tentatively established to enable AST (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0030">30</link>).

High-level BDQ resistance has been linked to mutations in the <emphasis>atpE</emphasis> gene that encodes the C ring of ATP synthase. Specific mutations include Asp28Gly, Asp28Ala, Leu59Val, Glu61Asp, Ala63Pro, and Ile66Met.

However, mutations in <emphasis>Rv0678</emphasis> may not be a valid marker of BDQ resistance.

First, the mycobacterial cell wall provides a degree of intrinsic resistance due to its hydrophobic nature and decreased permeability (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0134">134</link>). Mycobacterial drug resistance also arises via drug efflux and enzymatic degradation or inactivation of drugs (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0080">80</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0135">135</link>).

Further study showed that streptomycin resistance prevailed in pulmonary cavitary disease and was selected for under treatment pressure. One study of MTBC demonstrated the probability distribution of resistant mutants due to spontaneous mutation (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0138">138</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0139">139</link>). An MDR-TB phenotype is the result of the sequential accumulation of mutations at different loci and is not due to the acquisition of a single genetic factor (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0101">101</link>). Resistance that appears during drug treatment is due to selection and multiplication of preexisting resistant mutants in the MTBC population infecting the host. Susceptible bacilli are the predominant share of the initial population and are killed upon treatment. This results in a sharp fall in the population of bacilli and is followed by a subsequent rise in population as resistant mutants grow. This “fall-and-rise” phenomenon, as demonstrated in patient sputum, was described in the late 1940s (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0140">140</link>). Mitchison described the “special-populations” hypothesis to explain the action of the major anti-TB drugs against the various subpopulations of MTBC (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0141">141</link>). The subpopulations included: (i) rapidly growing bacilli in the pulmonary lesions; (ii) bacilli that grow in short metabolic spurts; (iii) bacilli that reside in the acidic environment of caseous lesions; and (iv) dormant, nonreplicating bacilli. This hypothesis was the basis for multidrug treatment regimens consisting of early bactericidal activity and later sterilizing activity. One of the reasons for the success of conventional multidrug regimens for TB is that the different drugs each make a unique contribution in eradicating MTBC within each of these special populations. In addition, each drug has a different ability to penetrate into granulomas or to kill bacteria in the caseum (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0142">142</link>). Thus, the use of multiple drugs in the treatment of TB is aimed at both preventing drug resistance and achieving a maximum therapeutic effect. The existence of subpopulations with differing metabolic status also means that conventional pharmacokinetic studies cannot predict the effectiveness of treatment regimens for TB (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0143">143</link>).

      <para id="ch0097s0021p0002">Since the 1960s, the WHO has recognized the need for AST to appropriately manage therapy for TB patients (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0151">151</link>–<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0154">154</link>). Emergence of resistance to any of the drugs included in a regimen should be monitored using pAST at a minimum. Methods of pAST have developed over time to include solid-media assays such as absolute concentration and proportion methods, and manual and automated broth and microbroth dilution methods. These methods will be discussed in detail below.</para>

      <para id="ch0097s0022p0001">Setting standards for mycobacterial AST is a challenging task. For many years, different regulatory bodies have not always been in agreement and have set their standards for mycobacterial AST based upon expert opinion (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0155">155</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0156">156</link>). The basis for pAST is the clinical breakpoint (CB). The CB permits distinction between strains that will most likely respond successfully to treatment at the standard dose (classified as “susceptible”) versus strains that will not respond (classified as “resistant”). The critical concentration (CC) is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that will inhibit the growth of 99% of phenotypically wild-type (pWT) MTBC isolates. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that prevents &gt;99% growth of a microorganism on solid medium or in a broth dilution assay. Epidemiologic cutoff values (referred to as ECOFF or ECV) are considered the microbiological breakpoint and correspond to the highest concentration in a pWT MIC distribution. Strains with MICs that exceed the ECOFF are referred to as phenotypically non-wild type (pNWT). CCs are often set at the ECOFF value or 1 dilution higher. A CB is set up considering pharmacological and outcome parameters, when available. CCs and CBs can differ based on media and protocols and between regulatory bodies.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0022p0002">The procedures used to perform AST and the criteria for interpreting the results consider two factors, (i) the critical proportion of drug-resistant mutants and (ii) the concentration of the drug in the test medium. Based on clinical and bacteriologic studies, the significant proportion of bacilli resistant to an anti-TB drug above which a clinical response is unlikely is generally set at 1% (except for PZA, which is set at 10%).

      <para id="ch0097s0024p0001">Despite decreasing rates of TB worldwide prior to 2020, many countries are now seeing either increasing rates or rates that are not decreasing as expected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on TB services around the world by decreasing patient access to essential TB services (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0001">1</link>). There has also been an increase in DR-TB in many countries in recent years, although some of this increase may be attributed to improved access to molecular detection methods for RR-TB performed directly on primary specimens. Nevertheless, particularly in low-incidence TB countries, mycobacteriology laboratories may experience reduced numbers of requests for cultures and AST at the same time that new rapid molecular technologies are becoming available. Although culture is considered the gold standard in low- and middle-income countries, molecular testing may be performed in the absence of culture. These changing conditions may warrant a reexamination of which laboratories should be performing AST. Laboratories that are unable to maintain proficiency or cost-effectiveness due to low volumes of testing are encouraged to refer specimens for culture. In the United States, jurisdictional public health laboratories may have additional capabilities to support this testing, in addition to the ability to refer to the CDC for molecular detection of drug resistance (MDDR program) and for infectious disease pathology testing (Infectious Disease Pathology Branch [IDPB]) (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0161">161</link>). Such specialized testing services may only be offered at a reference center level. All laboratories handling TB specimens should be linked to a reference center able to provide specialized tests, including advanced molecular testing, AST for all drugs, and pathology. In high-incidence TB countries, those services are provided by members of the Supranational Reference Laboratory Network (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0162">162</link>).</para>

Isolates from different specimen sources on the same patient may also be tested. This ensures the most effective treatment for a patient and contributes to the surveillance database for TB control. Susceptibility testing should be repeated if cultures fail to convert to negative after 3 months of therapy or if there is clinical evidence of failure to respond to therapy. Additional AST should be performed when resistance to RIF or any two first-line drugs is detected, if not performed initially. In addition, if an isolate exhibits monoresistance to the critical concentration of INH, it should also be tested for susceptibility to additional agents such as FQs (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>). If a laboratory is unable to provide this service, then isolates should be referred to another laboratory for timely testing. It should be noted that with new treatment regimens, the drugs that are tested initially may be subject to change. With increased use of broth microdilution testing methods, laboratories may test up to 12 antimicrobials at once, negating the need for testing of first-line agents and then reflexing to second-line agents if required. Laboratories may also start to consider the FQs as “first-line.”</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0025p0002">Methods for mAST should be performed on primary specimens and isolates in addition to pAST. Many molecular methods are now commercially available for the rapid detection of TB and resistance to the most relevant antimicrobial agents (e.g., RIF, INH) and can be performed directly on the specimen. Rapid molecular methods include nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and may soon include NGS techniques, which are being rapidly developed for clinical application. Targeted NGS can provide information on mutations in multiple genes associated with resistance to all anti-TB antimicrobial agents and can be performed directly on specimens (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0164">164</link>–<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0166">166</link>).

      <para id="ch0097s0026p0001">Antimicrobial resistance should be reported to the clinician and health authorities as soon as it is detected. If confirmatory/additional testing is required, a preliminary report indicating that antimicrobial resistance has been detected and further testing is in progress should be issued as soon as possible. The same is true when a delay in AST is anticipated and some results may still be pending. It is important to verify that resistance is not due to contamination or coinfection with NTM.</para>

Currently recommended methods for culture-based AST (pAST), including the agar proportion method, automated broth systems, and broth microdilution method, are described below (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0152">152</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0170">170</link>–<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0173">173</link>).

The Sensititre <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> MYCOTB AST Plate is also commercially available but not FDA authorized (ThermoFisher Scientific). Based on CLSI guidelines (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>), a rapid broth susceptibility testing method should be used in conjunction with rapid methods of primary culture and identification to provide antimicrobial susceptibility results within 28 days of receipt of the specimens in the laboratory (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0163">163</link>). Before implementing any pAST method, a laboratory should validate the system by using a standardized reference method such as agar proportion.</para>

The method was subsequently modified and standardized and is considered the gold standard for AST of MTBC for all drugs except PZA in the United States and many other countries. The agar proportion method is not suitable for testing PZA, because the medium often fails to support growth of TB bacilli when prepared at the required pH of 5.5. Drugs can be either prepared from reference powders (agar diffusion) or added as drug-impregnated disks (disk elution) (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0157">157</link>).</para>

Occasionally, AST may be invalid due to insufficient growth of drug-resistant strains of MTBC on 7H10 medium. To test those isolates, 7H11 medium may be substituted for 7H10, and higher concentrations of some drugs should be used, as shown in <link linkend="ch0097s0023a0003">Table 2</link>.

The total incubation duration is 3 weeks.</para>
        <para id="ch0097s0027s0002p0002">For the indirect method, the source of the inoculum is a pure culture, usually from the primary isolation media. Careful attention should be paid to the selection of colony types so that the final inoculum is representative of all types present, to ensure that there is a balance of potentially resistant and susceptible bacilli. A sufficient number of colonies must be selected to make a suspension that is equivalent to a 1.0 McFarland standard. If there is insufficient growth, a subculture in Dubos Tween-albumin or 7H9 broth should be made and incubated at 35 to 37°C until the turbidity matches a 1.0 McFarland standard. The suspension should not contain clumps of organisms. The actual number of CFU per milliliter is likely to vary from suspension to suspension, so that two dilutions (usually 10<subscript>–2</subscript> and 10<subscript>–4</subscript>) of the suspension must be used to inoculate two sets of media. If there is scant growth, 10<subscript>–1</subscript> and 10<subscript>–3</subscript> dilutions should be used, or the isolate should be subcultured in broth until sufficient growth is obtained. Positive broth cultures from commercial systems may also be used to prepare cell suspensions.</para>
        <para id="ch0097s0027s0002p0003">For the direct method, the inoculum is either a digested, decontaminated clinical specimen or an untreated, normally sterile body fluid, in which acid-fast bacilli are seen in stained smears. To ensure adequate but not excessive growth in the direct susceptibility test, specimens are diluted according to the number of organisms observed in the stained smear of the clinical specimen. A typical dilution scheme is shown in<anchor id="ch0097s0027s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0097s0027s0002a0005">Table 3</link>. Theoretically, this type of inoculum is more representative of the population of the MTBC in a particular lesion in the host. It is prudent to include an undiluted inoculum if the smear-positive specimen is from a patient who is receiving antimicrobial therapy, because a significant proportion of the bacilli seen on the smear may be nonviable. The direct susceptibility test has two major advantages. First, results can be reported within 3 weeks from the time of specimen receipt in the laboratory for a majority of smear-positive specimens. Second, the proportion of resistant bacteria better represents the mycobacterial population in the patient. Use of the direct method may be warranted when DR-TB is suspected or in a region where the prevalence of DR-TB is high. However, cost can become a critical factor when there is a high incidence of smear-positive specimens containing NTM. Also, it is not possible to accurately calibrate the inoculum, which may result in insufficient or excessive growth on drug-free quadrants and render the test invalid. In addition, if contaminants grow, results are not interpretable. The rate of failure for direct susceptibility testing can reach 15% or more, necessitating retesting by the indirect method.</para>

In the agar proportion method, the percent resistance is obtained by dividing the colony count on the drug-containing quadrant by the colony count on the control quadrant. When the percent resistance is greater than 1%, the isolate is considered resistant to the drug.</para>
        <para id="ch0097s0027s0003p0002">For a valid test, the control quadrant of the lower dilution should have at least 50 colonies. If there are fewer than 50 colonies on the control quadrant of the lower dilution (10<subscript>–2</subscript> to 10<subscript>–1</subscript>) by 3 weeks, this indicates insufficient growth, and the test is invalid and should be repeated. The total incubation period is 3 weeks; however, if mature colonies appear on the control quadrant in less than 3 weeks, resistant results can be reported. Susceptible results should not be reported until week 3. If cultures are incubated beyond 3 weeks, false resistance may result due to degradation of the antimicrobial compound.</para>

This is especially critical when the susceptibility test is performed by the direct method. Small colonies of rapid growers, as well as the rough, dry colonies of some MAC strains, may appear similar to MTBC colonies on 7H10 agar. Also, RGM may be slow to grow on primary isolation media, and they will appear as MDR-TB when tested against primary anti-TB agents. Susceptibility testing results from the direct method must never be reported without a preliminary identification of the organism.</para>

The significance of microcolonies is unknown, and each laboratory should determine how to best report these findings, based on its own in-house experience.

      <para id="ch0097s0028p0001">The MGIT was introduced in the mid-1990s for the growth and detection of mycobacteria. Each MGIT tube contains modified Middlebrook 7H9 broth and a fluorescence-quenching-based oxygen sensor (silicon rubber impregnated with ruthenium pentahydrate) in the bottom of the tube. The MGIT 960 system is a fully automated system that continuously monitors the growth of microorganisms hourly through fluorescence detection. When actively growing organisms, not limited to the growth of mycobacteria, utilize the dissolved oxygen, the reduced oxygen concentration enables the generation of fluorescence, which is then measured and expressed as growth units (GU). The MGIT 960 system is approved by the FDA for susceptibility testing of MTBC against STR (alternate abbreviation, STM), INH, RIF, and EMB (SIRE) and PZA. SIRE and PZA kits are sold separately, use different media, and require separate controls. Although STR is now considered a second-line drug and is no longer tested as a first-line drug, SIRE kits still contain this component. Laboratories that still routinely report STR are encouraged to discuss the cessation of this practice with their TB control programs or the clinicians, and only test and report it when specifically requested. As an alternative, kits containing only INH and RIF are available as well as kits with higher critical concentrations for testing INH, EMB, and STR. Several studies have shown that the performance of the MGIT 960 system for testing first-line drugs is equivalent to that of the radiometric BACTEC 460 system (no longer commercially available) and the agar proportion method, and that the time to results is comparable to that for the BACTEC 460 (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0175">175</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0176">176</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0177">177</link>).</para>

The MGIT SIRE drug kit contains lyophilized INH, RIF, EMB, and STR and the SIRE supplement. Certain drugs may be purchased in dry form in a precalibrated vial from BD. In this case, the powder can be reconstituted with the proper diluent directly in the vial at a concentration appropriate for the inoculum in the MGIT tube. Currently, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, KAN, AMK, ETH, and PAS are commercially available from BD as research-use-only (RUO) reagents, despite the WHO recommendation to perform AST using the MGIT system for drugs used to treat MDR-TB for which the CCs are available. Other second-line drugs can be purchased from different sources as dry powders, and concentrated solutions should be prepared considering the formulation of each drug. Concentrated solution, in the appropriate diluent, can be stored at –20°C for up to 6 months. Stability of the concentrated solution varies by drug. Working solutions are usually unstable and should be prepared fresh before use. MGIT 960 may use a two-tier test protocol by testing a higher drug concentration when a strain is resistant to the lower concentration of a drug in the initial testing. However, this is optional, and laboratories may want to obtain input from their TB control programs or the clinicians and set their own policies.</para>

The procedures and the time schedule described in the package insert are written assuming MTBC has been identified and the culture is ready for AST. In a clinical laboratory, when a primary MGIT culture becomes positive, some growth is removed for acid-fast staining and identification tests with immunochromatographic or molecular methods. AST is attempted when MTBC is identified. The workup may take 1 day or even up to 1 week to complete, depending on the laboratory’s workflow policies. By the time MTBC is identified, the amount of growth in the primary MGIT (after the positive culture workup and further incubation) is not the same as that in the so-called day 0 MGIT, defined as when it flagged positive. To follow the procedures and to capture the day 0 growth, it may be necessary to subculture from the primary culture to another MGIT tube and wait until it turns positive. This is important because day 0 is a reference point for complying with the manufacturer’s time schedule to ensure that AST is set up using the proper amount of growth. The seeded MGIT tube should turn positive in 4 to 9 days of incubation. If growth is detected in less than 4 days, either the growth is too heavy or the culture is not pure.</para>

The seeded MGIT tube, after being detected positive by MGIT 960 (day 0), needs to incubate for an additional 1 to 2 days, and AST should be set up within 1 to 2 days of incubation. The primary MGIT tube must be mixed well to obtain a homogenous suspension, used to inoculate the drug-containing MGIT tubes. The inoculum for the growth control is a 1:100 dilution of the inoculum used for the drug-containing MGIT. The volume of the inoculum is 0.5 ml. If AST cannot be set up within 1 to 2 days of incubation after being positive, it can be tested with a 1:5 dilution of the MGIT tube at 3 to 5 days of incubation after being positive.

An isolate is called resistant to a drug when the GU of the drug-containing MGIT tube is equal to or greater than 100, and it is called susceptible when the GU of the drug-containing MGIT tube is less than 100. The test is invalid if the GU of the growth control reaches 400 in less than 4 days, indicating that the growth is too fast (the inoculum is either too heavy or contains contaminants), or in more than 13 days, indicating that the growth is too light.</para>
        <para id="ch0097s0028s0002p0002">When the AST is completed, the MGIT 960 system allows the user to print the AST report. It is important to verify the drug order of the MGIT tubes against the drug order on the report, especially when the report contains resistant results. It is pivotal to verify any resistant result by excluding apparent resistance due to the presence of NTM or other contaminating bacteria before a preliminary report is issued. The following steps are helpful for verification of resistant results. First, examine the turbidity of the MGIT tube with a resistant result. MTBC usually grows as small clumps and settles at the bottom of the tube, and the broth usually remains clear. Without disturbing the MGIT tubes, if the broth appears turbid, the presence of NTM or other bacteria may be suspected. If there is no evidence of presence of NTM or other bacteria and a drug resistance mutation has been detected that corresponds to the drug tube showing resistance, the drug resistance can be reported without additional confirmation. If no molecular work-up to support the drug resistance result was performed, or molecular detection of drug resistance was negative, it is advisable to check for proper cellular morphology. Make a smear from an MGIT tube and perform acid-fast staining to confirm that the cellular morphology is compatible with that of MTBC without the presence of NTM or other bacteria. MTBC usually appears as cording or tight clumps. Although anti-TB agents may alter the typical cording morphology, a dispersed distribution of acid-fast bacilli or random loose clumps throughout the entire smear suggests the presence of NTM. When, on rare occasions, differentiating MTBC from NTM is difficult, it is advisable to make a subculture from the MGIT tube showing drug resistance onto 7H10 or 7H11. Examining the microscopic colony morphology in a few days will help to differentiate MTBC from NTM. As an alternative, molecular tests that detect MTBC and/or NTM DNA can be performed.</para>

        <para id="ch0097s0028s0002p0003">If test results are indeterminate, repeat testing of the isolate by agar proportion or with MGIT 960. If a culture contains non-acid-fast bacteria or NTM, a pure culture of MTBC must be obtained before retesting is attempted. Because reisolation of MTBC may take several weeks, molecular testing for drug resistance mutations should be performed. Each laboratory should determine its own policy regarding the necessity of retesting to confirm initial resistant results. In addition, confirming rarely occurring resistant results such as mono-RIF resistance or mono-EMB resistance by molecular testing is helpful if a mutation associated with drug resistance is detected. If a drug resistance mutation is not detected, drug resistance is unlikely but cannot be ruled out. Retesting by culture-based methods should be considered in cases that are not responding to therapy.</para>

Inoculum preparation from positive MGIT tubes or from a solid medium is the same as that for the SIRE drugs. Usually SIRE and PZA testing are run in parallel, and therefore the inoculum is the same. The interpretation criteria for PZA are also the same as those for the SIRE drugs.

The MIC is defined as the lowest drug concentration that inhibits more than 99% of the bacterial population. In the broth microdilution format, the MIC value is determined by observing the first well, in a series of wells with increasing drug concentrations, in which there is no visible growth. A broth microdilution plate, Sensititre MYCOTB (ThermoFisher), is available commercially and contains 12 lyophilized drugs in a range of concentrations to determine MICs (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0186">186</link>–<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0189">189</link>).

In general, mAST can be categorized into two major types, rapid PCR or probe-based methods and sequencing-based methods that will be described below. Some laboratories may choose to utilize the rapid PCR or probe-based method on primary specimens and sequencing-based methods such as NGS on the resulting isolate. However, methods such as pyrosequencing are rapid and sequence-based and can be utilized on primary specimens and isolates.</para>

This testing can decrease the time to initiation of appropriate therapy, ultimately reducing infectious periods, improving treatment outcomes, and reducing transmission with overall cost savings (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0196">196</link>). Because of the slow growth of MTBC, it often takes 4 weeks or longer to obtain pAST results. In contrast, mAST can be performed on raw specimens or sediments (processed specimens), which significantly shortens the time for obtaining mAST results (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0197">197</link>). This allows clinicians to modify regimens early to treat DR-TB effectively, improves patient outcome, and reduces DR-TB transmission.</para>

These include: (i) patients from regions with a high prevalence of DR-TB who present with a high index of suspicion for TB; (ii) patients who demonstrate a lack of response to treatment; (iii) patients with exposures to persons with a high risk for TB (e.g., students from countries where TB is endemic, health care workers, prisoners, and military personnel deployed to areas of TB endemicity); (iv) patients who have had adverse reactions to critical TB drugs and who could benefit from rapid testing for susceptibility to additional drugs; and (v) patients with mixed or nonviable cultures, or if pAST has failed due to the strain not growing well in the medium (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0198">198</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0097s0031s0002p0011">Cepheid’s Xpert MTB/RIF assay, a real-time PCR, cartridge-based molecular beacon probe assay, received FDA market authorization in 2013 for testing AFB smear-positive and smear-negative, raw or processed, sputum specimens. The version currently available in the U.S. can detect only the presence or absence of mutations affecting probe binding. It is unable to recognize silent mutations that affect probe binding; therefore, they are incorrectly interpreted as indicating RIF resistance. The CDC recommends confirmation of all RIF resistance reports (mutations detected) by a sequencing method (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0199">199</link>). This precaution is particularly important in geographical areas where the prevalence of RIF resistance is low. The new version of Xpert MTB/RIF, known as Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, is endorsed by the WHO, is used in many countries, and offers improved sensitivity for some specimen types compared to the original cartridge. Another cartridge, Xpert MTB/XDR, detects resistance to AMK, ETH, FQs, and INH in addition to RIF, but requires the use of an instrument with 10-color optics (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0200">200</link>).</para>

These assays provide mutation identities for the most commonly observed mutations, while unidentified mutations are discerned by missing wild-type bands. Exhaustive manuals for interpreting LPAs results are available from the WHO (<ulink url="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240046665">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240046665</ulink>).

        <para id="ch0097s0031s0002p0013">Sequencing-based methods, such as Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS), and WGS are also utilized to detect drug resistance in MTBC (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0164">164</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0165">165</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0201">201</link>–<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0205">205</link>). Sequencing methods have the capability of providing mutation identity and allow users to recognize silent mutations, disputed mutations, and mutations that confer different levels of resistance. They can also identify insertions and deletions in genes associated with drug resistance. Different types of sequencing techniques vary in discriminatory power. Pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing can be targeted to genes of interest and often sequence shorter DNA segments. Mutations known to be associated with TB drug resistance can be detected using this technique. There are no FDA-authorized tests available, but assays can be validated as LDTs to detect resistance to some of the key first-line and second-line drugs. Pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing typically take 1 to 2 days to complete, and the former can be performed directly on a clinical specimen.</para>
        <para id="ch0097s0031s0002p0014">tNGS and WGS approaches both provide comprehensive analysis of the MTBC genome and a more accurate mAST profile than provided by pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing. It has been suggested that sequencing of all mutations with a method such as WGS offers advantages over line-probe assays and other commercial molecular assays (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0206">206</link>–<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0209">209</link>). There is value in detecting all mutations, as this can result in a higher sensitivity and provide more definitive data on which to base the utilization of TB drugs. However, these methods typically require cultured material and can take many days to result and report findings, compared to currently available PCR, probe-based, and pyrosequencing methods. mAST using WGS can be accomplished for additional and even novel drugs at no additional cost, contingent only on the knowledge base of characterized mutations, and these testing data could be helpful when designing new treatment regimens (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0207">207</link>). Reports of shorter turnaround times compared to growth-based AST, with results available 7 to 8 days from a positive culture, have also been described with the implementation of this testing (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0210">210</link>). Comprehensive WGS approaches and evaluation of data on low-level resistance mutations and mutations of unknown significance may continue to inform best practices for treatment when strains harboring these mutations are present.</para>
        <para id="ch0097s0031s0002p0015">tNGS enables the detection of a significantly large enough portion of relevant mutations that it can serve a similar role to that of WGS. tNGS has the added benefits of being able to be utilized for direct specimen testing and providing results more quickly than WGS, potentially at a lower cost. The potential to perform tNGS directly on a specimen has been published, including studies describing a commercially available product, the Ion AmpliSeq TB panel (<link linkend="ch0097s0031s0002a0010">Table 5</link>), which provides full-length gene analysis using ion semiconductor NGS (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0164">164</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0166">166</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0204">204</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0211">211</link>). Another RUO system that is CE-IVD marked, Deeplex Myc-TB, uses deep sequencing of a 24-plexed amplicon mix for simultaneous identification of mycobacterial species, genotyping, and prediction of drug resistance of MTBC. This test targets 18 gene regions associated with resistance to 15 first- and second-line drugs (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0212">212</link>–<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0214">214</link>). The ability to provide comprehensive detection of mutations and derive additional information on the MTBC genome before culture is available could have a dramatic impact on TB diagnosis and patient management. Methods for pAST should be performed as a follow-up to mAST, whenever resources permit, and each country should have available at least one reference laboratory to perform this testing if not available locally. An algorithm that incorporates mAST will increase the cost of TB laboratory work. Certain jurisdictions have added molecular testing, such as WGS, as an initial AST method on isolates (e.g., the New York State Department of Health and Public Health England). In some jurisdictions, when isolates are determined to be pan-susceptible by WGS, pAST is not performed, and some isolates are only reflexed to selective pAST based on WGS results. A large multicenter study has shown that when WGS mAST is used in low-burden TB settings, where RR-TB is low incidence, the workload of pAST can be reduced by 90% (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0205">205</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0097s0031s0002p0016">Laboratories may consider performing MIC testing for isolates when a new mutation is identified by mAST, to determine the level of resistance it confers. Databases that correlate isolate MICs with mutations evolve as new mutations are detected and inform and improve all MTBC mAST methods. With increased use of mAST in diagnostic laboratories, discrepancies between mAST and pAST are expected. Silent mutations do not confer drug resistance in most cases, and isolates with mutations that confer low-level resistance often test susceptible by pAST in liquid media (<link linkend="ch0097s0031s0002a0010">Table 5</link>). Other causes of discrepancies include: (i) generation of unreliable pAST results due to procedural errors, or testing strains with MICs close to the CC or use of a CC that is too high; (ii) use of mAST commercial tests that do not detect all the determinants of drug resistance; (iii) use of an NGS technology in which the analysis pipeline is unable to detect insertions or deletions; and (iv) testing of original samples containing a low proportion of drug-resistant variants. When considering the results of mAST, the absence of mutation(s) does not rule out resistance, and when mutations are identified, actions should be taken to investigate the possibility of false resistance before reporting. Continual assessments and improvements in mAST, and comparing the results it generates to pAST, will undoubtedly lead to more rapid and comprehensive tests for MTBC drug resistance and ultimately to improvements in patient management and infection control.</para>

      <para id="ch0097s0032p0001">The inoculum suspension is prepared by touching several isolated colonies that have the same morphology with a sterile applicator stick. Growth on the stick is transferred to a tube containing 4.5 ml of sterile water and glass beads (e.g., 7 to 10 3-mm beads) until the turbidity matches the turbidity of a 0.5 McFarland standard by visual examination or by using a nephelometer. The suspension is mixed vigorously on a vortex mixer for 15 to 20 seconds and then allowed to stand so any remaining large clumps can settle; the supernatant is then used for the inoculum suspension.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0032p0002">If freeze-dried microtiter plates are used without the broth already added, the final inoculum (with an organism density of approximately 5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml) is prepared by transferring 50 μl of the suspension to 10 ml of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth for RGM, or 10 ml of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth plus 5% OADC for slowly growing NTM. Tubes are inverted 8 to 10 times to mix the suspension thoroughly. Alternatively, if using prepared plates that contain antimicrobials in 100 μl of broth, it is necessary to calculate the volume of standardized suspension to be added to 36 ml of water diluent to obtain a final organism concentration of 1 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> to 5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml (1 × 10<superscript>4</superscript> to 5 × 10<superscript>4</superscript> CFU per well in a 0.1-ml volume). The volume depends on the delivery system that is being used.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0032p0003">Final inoculum suspensions are mixed well (by inverting the tube several times or vortexing) and poured into plastic troughs, after which 100 μl is transferred to each well of the microdilution tray. Each inoculated tray is covered with an adhesive seal and incubated in ambient air (CO<subscript>2</subscript> should be avoided when testing macrolides). Simultaneously inoculating a nutrient agar plate, such as 5% sheep blood or Trypticase soy agar, with a loopful of the final inoculum to check for purity is recommended.

The MIC is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits visible growth (appearing either as turbidity or as a granular deposit of cells in the bottom of the well) for all of the agents tested except trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. For this drug, the endpoint is the well with approximately 80% inhibition of growth compared to growth in the control well, which contains no drug.</para>

        <para id="ch0097s0033s0001p0001">MAC is among the most frequently encountered<emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> species in many clinical laboratories. Isolation of MAC from blood is especially important in HIV-infected patients. Although the incidence of disseminated MAC in HIV-infected patients has dramatically decreased due to effective prophylaxis and the immune system restoration associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy, it still occurs in patients who develop resistance to antiretroviral treatment or who exhibit drug intolerance or poor compliance. In many of these patients, recovery of MAC represents a relapse of MAC disease rather than a new infection. MAC is also an important cause of chronic pulmonary lung disease (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0011">11</link>) and in the United States is the leading cause of lung disease due to NTM (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0215">215</link>). Patients with MAC lung disease generally may be placed in one of the following groups: those who have underlying lung disease with apical fibrocavitary lesions, postmenopausal women and occasional males with bronchiectasis and nodular opacities, and patients with cystic fibrosis.</para>

Of the agents in the regimen, correlation between <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> susceptibility test results and clinical response has been demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial only with the macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0216">216</link>). Because the mechanism of acquired resistance in isolates of MAC is the same for both of these drugs (mutation in the adenine at position 2058 or 2059 of the 23S rRNA gene, the presumed macrolide binding site on the ribosomal unit [93, 95]), and because there are technical difficulties associated with testing azithromycin, current CLSI guidelines state that clarithromycin is the only macrolide to which susceptibility of MAC isolates should be evaluated (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>). Brown-Elliott and colleagues have shown that AMK MIC values also correlate with clinical response, supporting initial testing of AMK as well as clarithromycin (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0217">217</link>). Very importantly, although EMB, RIF, and RFB are useful clinically, MIC values may not reliably predict clinical outcome. Because of the lack of data establishing a correlation between MIC values and clinical response to these drugs, breakpoints separating susceptible from resistant strains have not been determined. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that susceptibility results for these three drugs not be reported for MAC. If STR is being considered therapeutically, it may be tested, but because it has not been adequately studied, interpretive breakpoints have not been established, and only the MIC value without an interpretation should be reported.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0034p0002">Treatment of macrolide-resistant MAC isolates and susceptible isolates from patients who cannot tolerate macrolide therapy is problematic, and the role of susceptibility testing in guiding therapy for these patients is not clearly defined. In such situations, results for the second-line drugs moxifloxacin and LZD may be reported, although the<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> effectiveness has not been proven. Two other antimicrobials that may be considered in multidrug regimens for macrolide-resistant MAC infections are BDQ and CFZ. However, as with STR, breakpoints that separate BDQ and CFZ-susceptible from -resistant strains have not been determined; therefore, only the MIC value without an interpretation should be reported (see previous discussion of BDQ and CFZ in this chapter for further information and references).</para>

      <para id="ch0097s0036p0001">As mentioned above, broth microdilution is recommended for susceptibility testing of all NTM. The CLSI currently recommends cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with 5% OADC or OAD (pH 7.2 to 7.4), although some MAC isolates grow poorly in this medium. There may be more than one colony type present, especially as the culture ages. Historically, it has been recommended to test the transparent colony type, if possible, because this variant was considered more virulent and more resistant to antimicrobial agents than the opaque variant (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>). However, it is now becoming clear that there may be more than one MAC species present, represented by different colony types that may have different susceptibility patterns. The clinical significance of this finding is still unclear (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0218">218</link>). Tween 80 or other surfactants should not be used to disperse clumps of bacilli because of the potential synergistic effect of the surfactant activity of Tween 80 and antimicrobial agents.</para>

If either or both of the latter two drugs are tested, only the MIC value should be reported. Because untreated wild-type strains of MAC rarely, if ever, are intermediate or resistant to clarithromycin, the CLSI subcommittee recommends that laboratories confirm such results by repeat testing (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>). A confirmed intermediate result may indicate emerging resistance; therefore, patients with such an isolate should be carefully monitored, and susceptibility testing should be performed on subsequent MAC isolates. Because the <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> effectiveness of the secondary agents (i.e., moxifloxacin and LZD) for MAC disease is unproven, reporting the results should be restricted to situations in which the clinician has extensive experience in the use of these drugs in the treatment of MAC disease, or for research purposes.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0037p0002">It has been shown that AMK resistance in MAC is often associated with one or more mutations in the 16S rRNA (<emphasis>rrs</emphasis>) gene (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0217">217</link>). Therefore, if AMK is planned to be included in the therapeutic regimen and the isolate appears to be resistant by broth microdilution, the result may be confirmed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene to detect the 1408, 1409, or 1411 mutation. However, if none of these mutations is detected, it cannot be assumed that the isolate is susceptible to AMK, because another yet-to-be-determined resistance mechanism may be present.</para>

MIC values and an interpretation, as listed in the most current edition(s) of CLSI documents that address recommendations for mycobacterial susceptibility testing, should be reported for these drugs. Although STR may be useful clinically, breakpoints to establish susceptibility and resistance for NTM have not been established; therefore, only the MIC (with no interpretation) should be reported if this drug is tested.

For some antimicrobial agents (e.g., clarithromycin, imipenem, and tobramycin), susceptibility test results apply to certain species or groups of RGM; therefore, identification of isolates to the species and subspecies level, preferably using a molecular method, is strongly recommended.

Tobramycin is used predominantly for treatment of <emphasis>M. chelonae</emphasis> infections and is not recommended for treatment of infections due to other rapid growers, because MIC values generally are in the resistant range.

      <para id="ch0097s0043p0001">The recommended method for testing<emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> and other aerobic actinomycetes is broth microdilution (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>). Additionally, based on data from a multisite reproducibility study, use of a disk diffusion test for sulfisoxazole (250-μg disk) should be considered when testing <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> species as a check of the inoculum adequacy and to confirm sulfonamide MIC results (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0045">45</link>). Because <emphasis>R. equi</emphasis> grows within 24 h in most susceptibility panels for Gram-positive bacteria, it can be tested following the guidelines for staphylococci described in the most recent edition of CLSI documents M07 and M100.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0043p0002">Like<emphasis>Rhodococcus</emphasis>, isolates of <emphasis>Gordonia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Tsukamurella</emphasis> often grow more rapidly than most other aerobic actinomycetes. For this reason, it is important to inspect the growth control of the MIC panel after 24 to 48 h to determine if growth is adequate to read the MIC values. The recommended MIC method for these two genera is the same as that of the <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> species. Isolates of <emphasis>Gordonia</emphasis> are often pan-susceptible to the agents tested for <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis>, whereas isolates of <emphasis>Tsukamurella</emphasis> may show variable resistance to ceftriaxone and, more commonly, resistance to amoxicillin clavulanate.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0043p0003">The antimicrobial agents recommended for susceptibility testing are AMK, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, doxycycline and/or minocycline, imipenem, LZD, moxifloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tobramycin. For<emphasis>R. equi</emphasis> only, two additional drugs should be tested: vancomycin and RIF. Although broth dilution is preferred, for a few species-drug combinations, the accuracy of the results may be questionable. For example, ceftriaxone results may be falsely resistant when testing <emphasis>N. brasiliensis</emphasis>, and when testing <emphasis>N. farcinica</emphasis>, imipenem results may be falsely resistant. In addition, there appears to be a problem with as-yet-unexplained reproducibility of broth microdilution testing of ceftriaxone with <emphasis>N. cyriacigeorgica</emphasis> and <emphasis>Nocardia wallacei</emphasis> and of sulfonamides with other species, but especially <emphasis>N. farcinica</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. wallacei</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0248">248</link>). The problem with sulfonamides most likely is technical, failing to appropriately read 80% growth. The issue with ceftriaxone possibly is related to variable β-lactamase production; however, studies to thoroughly investigate this potential problem are needed.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0043p0004">Inoculum preparation is described in detail in the most current edition of CLSI document M24. Briefly, a heavy suspension is prepared in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth or sterile, deionized water or saline, using colonies from a blood or Trypticase soy agar plate that has been incubated at 35 ± 2°C in air until growth is sufficient (usually 3 to 7 days). Large clumps of organisms are broken up by using a micropestle or glass beads and mixing vigorously on a vortex mixer. The suspension is allowed to sit for approximately 10 to 15 minutes so that the clumps settle. Several drops of the supernatant are then added to 2 ml of water or saline in a tube compatible with a nephelometer available in the laboratory. The turbidity of the suspension is adjusted to equal the density of a 0.5 McFarland standard.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0043p0005">Panels and Mueller-Hinton agar plates are inoculated with the appropriately prepared suspension. Panels are covered with an adhesive seal, placed in a plastic bag, and incubated at 35 ± 2°C in ambient air and evaluated for growth after 48 to 72 h. If growth in the growth control well is sufficient at that time, MIC values are recorded; if not, panels are reincubated and read daily until growth is adequate, for up to a total of 5 days. The exception is<emphasis>Actinomadura</emphasis>, which may require incubation for up to 10 days for adequate growth. However, when the incubation period extends beyond 5 days, MIC values for β-lactam drugs, carbapenems, and tetracyclines may be inaccurate as a result of deterioration, and a comment should be added to the report.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0043p0006">To assess the adequacy of the inoculum, the quantity of organism growth on the sulfisoxazole disk diffusion test should be evaluated after incubation in ambient air at 35 ± 2°C for 3 to 5 days. Growth should appear as obvious streak marks with clear areas between the streaks; it should not be confluent.</para>
      <para id="ch0097s0043p0007">As with the NTM, the MIC is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits visible growth for all drugs except trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, for which the endpoint is generally considered to be the well with 80% growth inhibition compared with growth in the positive control well (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>). However, accurately determining 80% is often difficult. Therefore, another option is to interpret the MIC as the dilution showing a significant difference in the degree of growth compared to the positive control well or to an adjacent well that contains a higher concentration of drug.</para>

Sulfisoxazole disk diffusion is interpreted as follows: a zone of inhibition of ≥35 mm indicates susceptibility to sulfonamides and a zone of ≤15 mm indicates resistance (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0248">248</link>). A zone size of 16 to 34 mm is uninterpretable because currently there are insufficient data to determine intermediate susceptibility. If the results of broth dilution and disk diffusion testing are discrepant, both methods of testing should be repeated, and/or the isolate should be sent to a reference laboratory with experience testing these organisms. Because most isolates of <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> are susceptible to sulfonamides, resistance to TMP-SMX should not be reported until it is confirmed by a referral laboratory that has extensive experience with susceptibility testing of <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> species. As stated previously, if incubation is extended beyond 5 days, a comment should be added to the report.</para>

Laboratories should test the strains recommended by the CLSI. Currently, the availability of a commercial proficiency testing program for susceptibility testing of aerobic actinomycetes is limited.

        <para id="ch0097s0045s0001p0001">In 2018, the CLSI published an updated M24 document describing AST methods and interpretive criteria for mycobacteria, nocardiae, and other aerobic actinomycetes (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0014">14</link>). This new standard replaced the previous edition of the document published in 2011. Additionally, another new document was published in 2018, M62 1st edition, which was revised as M24S in 2021, and included updated breakpoints, QC tables, and recommendations for quality control testing frequency (<link linkend="ch0097s0045s0002li0240">240</link>).
