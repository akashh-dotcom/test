      <para id="ch0135s0001p0002">Understanding the mechanisms of viral drug resistance is critical for clinical management of individuals receiving antiviral therapy, for developing new antiviral drugs, and for drug resistance surveillance. This chapter reviews the mechanisms of resistance to antiviral drugs used to treat infections by eight common viruses: herpes simplex (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), influenza A and B, hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0001p0003">Antiviral drug resistance is mediated most often by mutations in the molecular targets of drug therapy, and the development of drug resistance is the most compelling evidence that an antiviral drug acts specifically by inhibiting the virus rather than its cellular host. Drug-resistant virus subpopulations may exist at low levels in clinical isolates or may arise only during drug exposure. The error-prone polymerases in RNA viruses render the development of resistance more frequent than in DNA viruses.</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0001p0004">Drug-resistant viruses are identified by<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> passage experiments in which wild-type viruses are cultured in increasing concentrations of an inhibitory drug and by <emphasis>ex vivo</emphasis> analysis of virus isolates obtained from individuals receiving antiviral therapy. Measuring drug susceptibility involves culturing a fixed inoculum of virus in serial dilutions of an inhibitory drug. The drug concentration required to inhibit virus replication by 50% (EC<subscript>50</subscript>) is the most commonly used measure of susceptibility. Drug susceptibility assays are not designed to determine the drug concentration required to inhibit virus replication <emphasis>in vivo.</emphasis> They are instead designed to identify viruses with reduced drug susceptibility relative to wild-type viruses. The clinical significance of reductions in drug susceptibility is determined by studying the treatment response of individuals harboring viruses with reduced susceptibility.</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0001p0005">One of the fundamental paradigms of viral drug resistance to emerge in the past 2 decades is that antiviral drug resistance mutations often consist of major mutations that reduce drug susceptibility by themselves and accessory mutations that generally compensate for the decreased fitness associated with many of the major mutations. With a few notable exceptions, major drug resistance mutations do not occur in previously untreated patients, whereas accessory mutations are often polymorphic.</para>

        <para id="ch0135s0001s0001p0001">Most FDA-approved drugs for treatment of herpesvirus infections target the viral DNA polymerase (<anchor id="ch0135s0001s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0135s0002a0004">Table 1</link>). Guanosine analogs that are selectively phosphorylated by viral enzymes are preferred as initial therapy (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0001">1</link>). Oral bioavailability is improved by the use of prodrugs that are metabolized to the parent drug. Acyclovir (ACV), its prodrug valacyclovir, and famciclovir, the prodrug of penciclovir (PCV), have been used successfully for genital HSV infections, VZV infections, and mucocutaneous HSV infections in immunocompromised hosts. Ganciclovir (GCV) and its prodrug, valganciclovir, are used to treat CMV infection. These guanosine analogs are supplemented by foscarnet (phosphonoformate [FOS]), a pyrophosphate analog, and cidofovir (CDV), a cytosine nucleotide analog, both of which do not depend on activation by viral enzymes and are alternative treatments for those not responding to initial therapy. Helicase-primase inhibitors include pritelivir, currently in a phase III clinical trial for acyclovir-resistant HSV infection (NCT 03073967), and amenamevir, which is approved in Japan for treatment of herpes zoster (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0002">2</link>). Letermovir (LMV) is an orally bioavailable CMV terminase inhibitor with FDA approval for prevention of clinically significant CMV infection after hematopoietic cell transplantation (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0003">3</link>). Maribavir (MBV) is an orally dosed inhibitor of the CMV UL97 kinase approved for treatment of resistant or refractory CMV infections in transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0004">4</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0135s0002p0001">ACV and PCV are initially monophosphorylated by the HSV thymidine kinase (TK) and then converted to triphosphates by cellular enzymes. ACV triphosphate causes chain termination of replicating DNA and formation of a dead-end complex that strongly inhibits the viral DNA polymerase (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0005">5</link>). Compared with ACV, PCV triphosphate is formed at higher concentrations and persists longer in infected cells but is a less potent inhibitor of the viral DNA polymerase (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0006">6</link>). Because the viral TK enzyme is not essential for HSV replication, a wide variety of TK mutations can decrease the phosphorylation of nucleoside analogs, and this is by far the most common mechanism of ACV and PCV resistance (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0008">8</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0135s0002p0002">Drug-resistant TK mutants are classified as TK negative, usually arising from frameshift or stop mutations that delete important functional domains, or as TK low, where the mutation reduces the phosphorylation of both natural nucleosides and antiviral drugs (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0008">8</link>). TK-altered mutants that selectively reduce the phosphorylation of antiviral nucleosides occur less commonly. Although TK mutations selected by PCV may differ from those selected by ACV, cross-resistance is expected (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0009">9</link>). Among clinical isolates, frameshifting nucleotide insertion mutations or frameshifting deletion mutations at homopolymeric TK loci (e.g., runs of G bases) are common (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0010">10</link>). TK point mutations conferring drug resistance have been mapped to catalytic, ATP-binding, nucleoside-binding, or dimerization domains (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0008">8</link>). The effect of specific mutations on TK activity and drug susceptibility is determined by site-directed mutagenesis of control strains, contributing to an increasing database (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0008">8</link>). Mixed heterogeneous populations of resistant genotypes evolve in individual subjects (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0011">11</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0002p0003">TK-negative HSV mutants are attenuated in mouse models of virulence, latency, and reactivation (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0012">12</link>). However, animal studies (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0013">13</link>) and clinical reports (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0014">14</link>–<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0016">16</link>) show that resistant viruses cause overt disease and recurrent infection. Latent acyclovir-resistant TK variants have been identified in human trigeminal ganglia (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0017">17</link>). Even isolates with frameshift mutations that are predicted to be TK negative may in fact express some TK activity that enables reactivation from latency (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0013">13</link>), through such mechanisms as ribosomal frameshifting (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0018">18</link>). Although drug-resistant HSV TK mutants can easily be selected in cell culture, the frequency of isolation of ACV-resistant HSV in clinical practice is typically &lt;1% in immunocompetent hosts and 7 to 16% in immunocompromised hosts (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0020">20</link>). Hematopoietic cell transplant recipients are a high-risk population (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0020">20</link>), with 28% of those with viral breakthrough during ACV prophylaxis having resistant virus in a prospective study (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0021">21</link>). ACV-resistant corneal HSV isolates were found in 11 (6.4%) of 173 immunocompetent patients with keratitis (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0022">22</link>); this may result from persistence and reactivation of virus, including resistant strains, at sanctuary sites evading normal host immune defenses (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0023">23</link>). DNA polymerase (<emphasis>pol</emphasis>) mutations are occasionally responsible for HSV resistance to ACV, PCV, FOS, and CDV (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0024">24</link>). Because the viral DNA polymerase is an essential gene for replication, mutations are more selective and usually consist of single amino acid changes in functional domains of the enzyme. Mutations conferring ACV resistance are distributed among several conserved <emphasis>pol</emphasis> regions, with clustering of mutations in palm and finger structure domains (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0024">24</link>) and frequent cross-resistance to FOS, for which mutations are similarly clustered. Many natural <emphasis>pol</emphasis> sequence polymorphisms exist that require phenotypic characterization (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0025">25</link>). There is limited information about CDV resistance mutations in clinical isolates, but there appears to be little cross-resistance with ACV or FOS (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0026">26</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0135s0003p0002">Mechanisms of VZV drug resistance are analogous to those of HSV. Most ACV-resistant VZV contains TK gene mutations that result in TK deficiency or altered substrate specificity, including stop, frameshift, and substitution mutations (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0026">26</link>). Although VZV TK has less sequence polymorphism than the HSV TK (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0029">29</link>), uncharacterized amino acid substitutions may prevent clear interpretation. Alternative drugs used for ACV-resistant VZV are usually FOS and CDV, since their antiviral activity is not TK dependent. Less commonly, ACV resistance may result from mutations clustering in the palm and finger structure domains of the VZV DNA polymerase, with some mutations conferring FOS cross-resistance (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0028">28</link>).

Risk factors for CMV drug resistance are prolonged viral replication and antiviral drug exposure as seen in immunocompromised hosts (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0033">33</link>). Genotypic resistance testing for CMV is standard diagnostic practice because of unavailability of timely phenotypic testing on clinical isolates.

Because tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and tenofovir alafenamide have similar resistance profiles, they are both referred to here as tenofovir. Although tenofovir alafenamide achieves higher intracellular levels than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, it has not been shown to have greater<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> activity against tenofovir-resistant strains. Additionally, there are four approved HIV-1 entry inhibitors: the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc, the postattachment inhibitor ibalizumab, and the attachment inhibitor fostemsavir.

The virus population within an individual consists of an ensemble of innumerable related genotypes, often called a quasispecies. The selection of drug-resistant variants depends on the extent to which virus replication continues during incompletely suppressive therapy, the ease of acquisition of a particular mutation, and the effect of drug resistance mutations on drug susceptibility and virus replication (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0050">50</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0135s0004s0001p0003">In previously untreated individuals with drug-susceptible HIV-1, many different drug combinations lead to prolonged virus suppression and, in most patients, immune reconstitution. Once complete HIV-1 suppression is achieved, it usually persists indefinitely if therapy is not interrupted.

Recurrent viremia and immunological decline nearly always ensue when therapy is discontinued regardless of the previous duration of virological suppression.</para>

The proportions of HIV-1-infected persons with transmitted NRTI, NNRTI, PI, and INSTI resistance in the United States diagnosed between 2014 and 2018 were 6.9%, 12.0%, 4.2%, and 0.8%, respectively (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0051">51</link>).

The dependence of NRTIs on intracellular phosphorylation complicates the<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> assessment of their activity, because phosphorylation occurs at different rates in the highly activated lymphocytes used for susceptibility testing and the wider variety of cells infected <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis>, explaining why NRTI resistance levels differ in their dynamic ranges (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0060">60</link>). Specifically, clinical isolates from persons failing NRTI therapy may have several-hundred-fold reductions in susceptibility to zidovudine, lamivudine, and emtricitabine but rarely have &gt;5-fold reductions in susceptibility to abacavir and tenofovir. Slight reductions in susceptibility to this second category of drugs, however, are clinically significant.</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0005p0002">There are two biochemical mechanisms of NRTI resistance. One mechanism is mediated by discriminatory mutations that reduce RT affinity for an NRTI, preventing its addition to the growing DNA chain (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0061">61</link>). Another mechanism is mediated by mutations that facilitate primer unblocking through the phosphorolytic removal of NRTIs incorporated into the HIV-1 primer chain (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0062">62</link>). Primer unblocking mutations, because they are selected by the thymidine analog inhibitors zidovudine and stavudine, are also referred to as thymidine analog mutations (TAMs). The most common TAMs include M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219Q/E. Although thymidine analogs are now used infrequently, TAMs remain common, because they often persist for many years in previously treated individuals, and they remain important, because they confer cross-resistance to abacavir and tenofovir (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0055">55</link>).

Indeed, M184V is the most common mutation to emerge in patients developing virological failure on a first-line regimen. Although M184V limits the antiviral activity of lamivudine and emtricitabine, regimens containing these NRTIs retain efficacy because M184V/I reduces HIV-1 fitness and increases susceptibility to zidovudine and tenofovir (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0063">63</link>).</para>

The nelfinavir-associated DRMs D30N and N88D were once among the most commonly observed DRMs when nelfinavir was in widespread use. These two DRMs are still occasionally observed in cases of transmitted drug resistance. N88D is associated with potential low-level atazanavir resistance. There are several scenarios in which viruses that are resistant to atazanavir, darunavir, and lopinavir retain susceptibility to tipranavir. Specifically, the DRMs I50V, I54L, and L76V are darunavir resistance mutations that increase tipranavir susceptibility (<ulink url="https://hivdb.stanford.edu/dr-summary/resistance-notes/PI/">https://hivdb.stanford.edu/dr-summary/resistance-notes/PI/</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0008p0032">The relative conformation of the CCD, NTD, and CTD domains and the tetrameric functional form of HIV-1 IN has been inferred primarily from crystallographic studies of the homologous integrase of the prototype foamy virus (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0088">88</link>) and of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM structures showing the catalytically active HIV-1 integrase strand-transfer complex catalytically joined to viral and target DNA (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0089">89</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0090">90</link>). These structures show that INSTIs bind within a well-defined pocket, formed by the interface between two integrase protomers and viral DNA. Many of the mutations with the greatest effect on reducing INSTI susceptibility are highly conserved residues in the INSTI binding site and residues 140 to 149, which form a flexible loop important for catalysis following integrase-DNA binding.</para>

      <para id="ch0135s0011p0002">Subtype B viruses make up 95% of HIV-1 strains in the United States and 60% of strains in Europe but only about 10% of strains worldwide. Subtype B viruses played an outsized role in the earliest ARV development efforts and in the earliest studies of ARV resistance. Nonetheless, existing ARVs appear equally effective at treating subtype B and non-subtype B viruses. Moreover, with several notable exceptions, most HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) occur in similar proportions in different subtypes (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0078">78</link>). For example, subtype C viruses have a unique polyadenine stretch between codons 63 and 65, which predisposes them to substitute a guanosine triphosphate (G) for an adenosine trisphosphate (A) at the second position of codon 65 after tenofovir exposure, resulting in the DRM K65R (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0117">117</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0118">118</link>). Most other examples of preferentially selected DRMs result from intersubtype differences in codon usage. For example, in efavirenz-treated individuals, the NNRTI resistance mutation V106M occurs much more often in subtype C viruses than in other subtypes because V106M requires a single-base-pair change in subtype C viruses, GTG (V) → ATG (M), but a two-base-pair change in all other subtypes, GTA (V) → ATG (M) (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0119">119</link>).</para>

Following infection, its genome localizes to the nucleus, where it is converted to the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) form that serves as the template for transcription of mRNA and genomic RNA. Genomic RNA is then reverse transcribed to viral DNA, and the resulting viral cores either bud into the endoplasmic reticulum and are exported from the cell or return to the nucleus for conversion back to cccDNA. HBV cccDNA can be eliminated by cell turnover but not by drug therapy, and as a result, eradication of infection occurs infrequently (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0120">120</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0121">121</link>).</para>

Nonetheless, the impact of the resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) selected by these DAAs continues to influence treatment strategies.</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0014p0003">Currently, the joint Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines and the European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines recommend simplified pangenotypic FDCs, including glecaprevir-pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, for treatment-naive adults with or without compensated cirrhosis in all genotypes (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0128">128</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0177">177</link>). Additionally, several other DAAs remain in use in some countries because of their affordability. For example, in countries where the pangenotypic FDCs are not available, elbasvir-grazoprevir for genotypes 1 and 4 and sofosbuvir-ledipasvir for genotypes 4, 5, and 6 are recommended as alternative regimens. The response to therapy and treatment guidelines continues to be influenced by HCV genotype and by the extent of liver disease.</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0014p0004">Treatment guidelines for patients who previously experienced virological failure on a DAA regimen can be complicated, because treatment efficacy is influenced by the previously received regimen, the presence of cirrhosis, and in some cases HCV genotype and/or the presence of specific NS5A inhibitor RASs (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0128">128</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0177">177</link>). Approaches to salvage therapy may require the use of a three-drug regimen containing sofosbuvir in combination with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir or velpatasvir-voxilaprevir, prolongation of therapy beyond 12 weeks, and/or the use of ribavirin (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0178">178</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0179">179</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0135s0015p0001">Many studies have identified HCV mutations that emerge during<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> passage experiments and in patients with virological failure. The term RAS is preferred to “drug resistance mutation” in the HCV field because the consensus amino acids, the amino acids selected by DAAs, and the phenotypic effects of different amino acids at a position are highly genotype dependent. When referring to a RAS, one should therefore specify the genotype and subtype, because the consensus amino acid at several amino acid positions often differs among genotypes and subtypes (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0180">180</link>). The phenotypic effects of RASs were originally assessed primarily in GT1 subtype a (GT1a) and GT1b replicons and infectious clones. As an increasing number of studies are being performed with GT2 to GT6 replicons and clones, it has become apparent that the same DAA often selects for different RASs in different genotypes and that the same RASs often have different effects in different genotypes (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0180">180</link>). Drug resistance profiles may also differ between different subtypes within the same genotype (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0181">181</link>–<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0184">184</link>). Genetic mechanisms of resistance to HCV inhibitors are shown in <anchor id="ch0135s0015a0003"/><link linkend="ch0135s0015a0005">Table 4</link>.</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0015p0002">Although there is extensive cross-resistance within the PI and NS5A classes, the newer DAAs in these classes generally have pangenotypic activity and substantially higher genetic barriers to resistance. However, analyses linking specific RASs to SVR rates have been complicated by the complex interplay between RASs, DAA regimens, HCV genotype and subtype, the extent of liver disease, and duration of therapy. To make these analyses tractable, most studies have focused on the RASs with the greatest reductions in susceptibility, which is &gt;100-fold reduced susceptibility for the NS5A inhibitors and &gt;10-fold reduced susceptibility for the PIs (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0185">185</link>–<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0189">189</link>). A consensus has also emerged that RASs that are detectable by Sanger sequencing or at levels of ≥15% by next-generation sequencing are more clinically significant than RASs present at lower levels (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0128">128</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0190">190</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0015p0003">The effects of baseline RASs on SVR rates have been studied in multiple clinical trials in both DAA-naive and -experienced patients. Although the effect of baseline RASs is relatively small, lower response rates have been observed in GT3 cirrhotic patients (81 to 92%) and GT1 and GT3 patients with prior sofosbuvir-velpatasvir experience (78 to 85%) who harbored baseline RASs (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0191">191</link>–<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0194">194</link>). In addition to the epidemic genotypes, patients from sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia who are infected with subtypes other than GT1a/b, GT2a/b, GT3a, GT4a/d, GT5a, and GT6a have often shown SVR rates below 90%, in part because of a possibly increased prevalence of naturally occurring NS5A RASs in several of the less well studied subtypes (182, 195–200).</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0015p0004">In previously untreated patients in high-income countries, pretherapy genotypic resistance testing is not recommended, because the currently recommended pangenotypic regimens are highly effective against the most prevalent genotypes and subtypes. In previously untreated patients in low-income countries, genotypic resistance testing would theoretically be more useful, because in many of these countries, nonpangenotypic DAAs are used. However, such testing is generally not practical in many of these countries. For patients who experienced virological failure on a previous DAA-containing regimen, expert consultation is recommended. A successful treatment regimen can usually be designed without the use of genotypic resistance testing (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0128">128</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0189">189</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0201">201</link>–<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0203">203</link>). Nonetheless, indications for genotypic resistance testing will continue to evolve, and this testing may eventually play an increased role, particularly in the management of patients with previous virological failure on a DAA-containing regimen (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0204">204</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0135s0019p0002">The three-dimensional structures of NA from influenza B virus and from several influenza A virus subtypes have been solved by X-ray crystallography (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0249">249</link>–<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0251">251</link>). NA is a homotetramer containing monomers of about 470 amino acids, depending on the type and subtype. NA has a hydrophobic stalk peptide at its N terminus, responsible for membrane anchoring. A globular head contains its active site, a pocket into which sialic acid and substrate analogs bind. The most commonly used numbering system is based on alignment to the influenza A virus N2 subtype.</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0019p0003">Influenza virus NAs of different A subtypes differ from one another at about 50% of their amino acids, and influenza A virus NA differs from influenza B virus NA at about 70% of its amino acids. Nonetheless, the folded structure of the polypeptide brings into proximity a number of amino acids that are nearly invariant in all influenza virus strains. Eight of these strain-invariant amino acids directly contacts sialic acid, including R118, D151, R152, R224, E276, R292, R371, and Y406 (N2 numbering). Eleven provide the framework that supports these catalytic residues: E119, R156, W178, S179, D198, I222, E227, H274, E277, N294, and E425 (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0252">252</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0253">253</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0135s0019p0004">NA inhibitors are sialic acid analogs that competitively inhibit NA.

Oseltamivir, which is administered orally, is a carbocyclic analog of sialic acid with a bulky side chain necessitating a conformation change in NA to allow binding (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0251">251</link>). Because zanamivir is administered as an aerosol and because its structure is more similar to the natural sialic acid than that of oseltamivir, zanamivir resistance occurs much less frequently than oseltamivir resistance (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0254">254</link>). The intravenous formulation of peramivir enables it to be a suitable antiviral option for severe influenza cases, although it is not approved for this specific indication in the United States (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0243">243</link>).</para>

In addition, specific genetic lineages within an influenza A subtype may differ in their levels of NAI susceptibility and in their predisposition to specific NAI resistance mutations. Therefore, ongoing genotypic and phenotypic surveillance is required to identify changes in the intrinsic susceptibility and replicative capacity of circulating NA variants and the spectrum of mutations selected in patients receiving NAIs (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0255">255</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0135s0024p0001">The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a 1,273-amino acid trimeric glycoprotein responsible for entry into host cells. Each spike monomer has a largely exposed S1 attachment domain and a partially buried S2 fusion domain (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0312">312</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0313">313</link>). Part of S1, called the receptor-binding domain (RBD; residues 306 to 534), binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Approximately 20 RBD residues bind the ACE2 receptor. The part of the RBD containing these residues is referred to as the receptor-binding motif, whereas the remainder of the RBD is called the RBD core. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0314">314</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0315">315</link>).

      <para id="ch0135s0024p0003">The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has witnessed the emergence of large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 variants containing various spike mutations with reduced susceptibility to one or more MAbs. Variants that spread widely and displayed evidence of being more transmissible, causing more severe disease, and/or reducing neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, have been classified as variants of concern by the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The first four variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) contain one or more of the following RBD mutations: K417N/T, L452R, T478K, E484K, and N501Y. The most recent variant of concern, omicron (BA.1 subvariant), contains 15 RBD mutations, including G339D, S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, and Y505H. The omicron BA.2 variant contains three additional RBD mutations—T376A, D405N, and R408S—but does not contain G446S and G496S. In addition, several other RBD mutations associated with reduced MAb susceptibility have been reported in other widely circulating variants, in variants from persons receiving MAbs, and in immunocompromised persons with prolonged infections (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0323">323</link>–<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0325">325</link>).</para>

The BA.1 variant displays ~50-fold-reduced susceptibility to cilgavimab-tixagevimab and 4-fold-reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab, the BA.2 variant displays ~5-fold-reduced susceptibility to cilgavimab-tixagevimab and 20-fold-reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab, and the BA4 and BA5 variants display ~50-fold-reduced susceptibility to cilgavimab-tixagevimab and 15-fold-reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab (<link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0327">327</link>, <link linkend="ch0135s0024s0001li0328">328</link>).
