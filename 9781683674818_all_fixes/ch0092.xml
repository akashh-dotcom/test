      <para id="ch0092s0000p0001">The performance of antimicrobial susceptibility tests (ASTs) to help guide patient therapy is one of the most important functions of a clinical microbiology laboratory. ASTs are conducted to assess the ability of an antimicrobial agent to inhibit or kill bacteria<emphasis>in vitro.</emphasis> AST results are used to support antimicrobial therapy decisions, influence stewardship policies, assess the activity of new drugs in development, and monitor the spread of bacterial resistance (see <ulink url="ch0091#ch0091s0001">chapter 73</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). The most commonly used AST methods to date can be categorized into (i) dilution methods that generate minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and (ii) disk diffusion methods that generate a zone diameter result. Several international scientific organizations, including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), and the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), update and publish detailed nonproprietary standards for performance of AST dilution and diffusion methods (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0092s0000p0002">It is important to note there is a difference between a “standard” method and a “reference” method. Multiple laboratories may perform a test using a defined, “standard” procedure (i.e., they follow the same steps of the procedure). The goal is that different laboratories will use the same procedure to perform the test. For example, a commercial test that includes materials and a standard operating procedure is a “standard” or “standardized” test. That same commercial test might not also be considered a “reference” method. A method is not considered a “reference” method until it is agreed to be a “reference” method by independent standards setting organizations within the field of study. In clinical microbiology, a standard AST method is considered a reference method when that method has been reviewed by relevant organizations and/or regulatory bodies, such as the ISO, CLSI, and EUCAST. By definition, a reference method is standardized. Broth microdilution AST is a standard method that has been agreed as the reference AST method by ISO, CLSI, and EUCAST (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>). The broth microdilution AST reference method is nonproprietary, it is performed without the need for sophisticated instrumentation, and the basic reagents/disposables are available from multiple sources to support its use globally.</para>
      <para id="ch0092s0000p0003">Another AST reference method for certain species, including anaerobes,<emphasis>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Helicobacter pylori</emphasis>, is the agar dilution method (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0008">8</link>). In addition to the reference broth microdilution and agar dilution methods, CLSI publishes standards for broth macrodilution and disk diffusion (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0003">3</link>). EUCAST publishes a disk diffusion standard and refers laboratorians to the ISO reference method for broth microdilution (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>). The ISO 20776-1 and the CLSI M07 reference standards for broth microdilution, despite a few minor differences, are essentially the same and are generally considered comparable reference methods by regulatory agencies and in the scientific literature (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0092s0000p0004">Most clinical microbiology laboratories in the United States and in many developed countries utilize manual or automated commercial dilution products that provide AST results which are demonstrated to correspond to the ISO/CLSI broth microdilution reference method. Additionally, a wide range of emerging technologies are being investigated for use in AST. Various commercial methods and emerging technologies are described and compared in<link linkend="ch0092s0001">chapter 74</link>.</para>
      <para id="ch0092s0000p0005">The choice of AST methods to be used in individual laboratories is based on factors such as relative ease of performance, cost, flexibility in selection of drugs for testing, availability of automated or semiautomated devices to facilitate testing, and the perceived accuracy of the methodology (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0006">6</link>). The reference broth microdilution method is typically used by pharmaceutical companies to establish MIC data for new antimicrobial agents, by research laboratories and device manufacturers as a reference by which new susceptibility testing methods are evaluated, and by reference laboratories for confirming unusual susceptibility test results. Although it has become increasingly uncommon, some clinical microbiology laboratories use the reference broth microdilution method for routine diagnostic testing, including preparing their own broth microdilution panels. More frequently, clinical microbiology laboratories use commercial manual or automated systems or a combination of MIC and disk diffusion methods for routine susceptibility testing.</para>
      <para id="ch0092s0000p0006">The methods described in this chapter are intended primarily for testing commonly isolated aerobic or facultative bacteria that grow well after overnight incubation in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMHB) or on unsupplemented Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA). Also included in this chapter is the CLSI test for performing disk diffusion directly from positive blood culture broth (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0003">3</link>) and the EUCAST RAST (rapid AST directly from blood culture bottles) (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>). Alternative media and methods for some fastidious or uncommon organisms are described in <ulink url="ch0095#ch0095s0001">chapter 77</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> as well as in the CLSI M07 and M100 standards (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0003">3</link>). Methods for testing infrequently isolated or fastidious bacteria not included in CLSI documents M02 and M07 are found in CLSI document M45 (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0007">7</link>). Standards for testing anaerobic bacteria are provided in <ulink url="ch0096#ch0096s0001">chapter 78</ulink>, CLSI M100, and CLSI M11 (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0008">8</link>) and on the EUCAST website (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>). The CLSI and EUCAST standard methods for fastidious organisms serve a critical role to help ensure quality in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In the future, greater international harmonization for testing of anaerobic, fastidious, and uncommonly isolated bacteria is needed.</para>

      <para id="ch0092s0000p0007">When an AST is developed for a new antimicrobial agent, or when the breakpoints of an older agent are under review, if applicable, the ISO/CLSI broth microdilution method is used to provide the reference MICs. Once reference MIC results are available, interpretive criteria, known as clinically relevant breakpoints (e.g., susceptible [S], susceptible–dose dependent [SDD], intermediate [I], resistant [R], and nonsusceptible [NS]), are applied to categorize the test results (see<anchor id="ch0092s0000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0092s0000a0005">Table 1</link>). In addition to interpretive criteria of S, I, and R, EUCAST defines a laboratory-focused alert called the “Area of Technical Uncertainty” (ATU). The ATU is not meant as an interpretive category; rather, it is meant to alert laboratory staff where there is a predictable issue with interpretation of AST results (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0092s0000p0017">Briefly, clinically relevant breakpoints are first established for MIC results generated by the reference method. These breakpoints are established on the basis of the (i) epidemiologic cutoff (ECV or Ecoff) values, which are determined by comparing the normal MIC distributions for wild-type bacterial species with distributions of strains with known resistance mechanisms affecting the drug class; (ii) pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data from animal models of infection and modeling of human PK/PD data (nonclinical PK/PD cutoff); and (iii) data from clinical outcome studies including clinical exposure-response (CER) relationship (clinical cutoff and CER cutoff) (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0009">9</link>). Subsequently, disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoints are set by comparing standard method disk diffusion zone diameters on a large collection of strains to reference method-derived MIC data and choosing zone diameter breakpoints so that interpretive errors between the MIC and disk diffusion methods are within acceptable limits (a more detailed description is provided in <ulink url="ch0091#ch0091s0001">chapter 73</ulink>).</para>

      <para id="ch0092s0000p0018">Reporting of AST results will depend on the purpose of the AST. When MIC testing is performed for patient care, the MIC value is typically reported along with the interpretive category (S, I, SDD, R, NS), but for disk diffusion testing, only the interpretive category is reported, as disk zone diameters are difficult to interpret or to correlate to drug levels. While most clinicians typically use only the interpretive category to make their treatment decisions, providing the actual MIC value could be useful for dose adjustment or patient monitoring. If ASTs are performed for epidemiological, stewardship, or research purposes, changes in MIC or zone diameter values can be tracked, for example, as an early indicator of resistance emergence. Emerging resistance mechanisms may also be identified among those isolates in which the antimicrobial agent MIC is above the ECV but within the clinically susceptible (S or SDD) or intermediate category for that agent. Other considerations, such as the selection of agents to include in AST, are covered in<ulink url="ch0090#ch0090s0001">chapter 72</ulink>.</para>
      <para id="ch0092s0000p0019">While novel methods for AST are emerging, the reference broth microdilution method continues to play a crucial role, serving as the “gold standard” for evaluation of the activity of new antibacterial agents, for resistance surveillance, and for regulatory clearance of commercial AST systems. However, the broth microdilution test has advantages and disadvantages. Advantages of the ISO/CLSI standard reference broth microdilution method include (i) accessibility of a global reference method for laboratories to help ensure comparability across global regions and (ii) many years of data correlating MIC results to clinical outcomes and PK/PD. Disadvantages of the broth microdilution method include (i) the inherent biological variability that exists for any test that involves growth of bacteria and (ii) an<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> bacterial process like growth and resistance gene expression may not reflect the same process <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis>, particularly during infection.</para>

The disposable plastic panels can be prepared to contain several different antimicrobial agents to be tested simultaneously. Although it is currently not specified by ISO or CLSI, the plastic multiwell trays typically used for AST testing are polystyrene, nontreated microtiter panels (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>). Panels may be prepared in-house or obtained commercially. The reference method includes both freshly made panels and frozen panels. Many commercial broth microdilution panels are dried. These dried panels are validated by the manufacturer to demonstrate comparability to the fresh or frozen panels. When commercial dried panels are used, the manufacturer’s recommendations concerning storage, inoculation, incubation, and interpretation should be followed (see <ulink url="ch0093#ch0093s0001">chapter 75</ulink>). The primary focus of this section will be the in-house preparation and use of broth microdilution panels. However, most of the principles and practices discussed here are pertinent to the broth microdilution AST method regardless of the source of the antibiotic panels.</para>

For most generic antimicrobial agents, diagnostic-grade powders are available from commercial suppliers. For newer agents, the powders can be requested directly from the pharmaceutical manufacturer. The solvents and dilution procedures required for different antimicrobial agents may vary and are based on the solubility of antimicrobial agents or problems associated with binding of the antibiotic to the plastic in the panel or pipette systems. For example, dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin all require addition of polysorbate 80 at some step in the dilution process because of inherent binding of these agents to plastics.

After the antimicrobial dilutions have been dispensed into the plastic trays, the panels are typically stacked in groups of 5 to 10, with a tray lid or an empty tray placed on top to minimize contamination and evaporation. Each stack is sealed in a plastic bag and frozen immediately, preferably at −60°C or colder, or at −20°C if a lower temperature freezer is not available. ISO guidance states that filled trays may be used immediately or may be stored for up to 3 months or until documented QC or other evidence indicates degradation of the antimicrobial agent (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>). Care must be taken in storing highly labile compounds such as cefaclor, clavulanic acid, and the carbapenems, which may lose potency during storage. Trays with these agents should be stored at ≤−60°C. If thawed, panels must be used or discarded but not refrozen, since freeze-thaw cycles cause substantial deterioration of β-lactam antibiotics. For this reason, −20°C household-type freezers with self-defrosting units must not be used.</para>

        <para id="ch0092s0000p0031">The recommended final inoculum for broth dilution testing is 5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml. There are two methodologies for preparing the inoculum, both of which utilize turbidity comparison to 0.5 McFarland standard. A 0.5 McFarland standard can be obtained commercially or prepared in the laboratory by mixing 0.05 ml of 1.175% barium chloride dihydrate (BaCl<subscript>2</subscript> ∙ 2H<subscript>2</subscript>O) with 9.95 ml of 1% sulfuric acid (H<subscript>2</subscript>SO<subscript>4</subscript>) (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>). To validate the McFarland standard, colony counts should be performed periodically with <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis> ATCC 25922, based on turbidity equivalent to the 0.5 McFarland to assure that the concentration is equivalent to approximately 1 × 10<superscript>8</superscript> to 2 × 10<superscript>8</superscript> CFU/ml. The first inoculum preparation method is the colony suspension method (formerly called the direct colony suspension method): well-isolated colonies of the same morphological type from a nonselective agar plate may be directly suspended in broth to match the turbidity of the 0.5 McFarland standard (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0017">17</link>). The second method is the broth culture method (formerly called the growth method) and can be preferable when colony growth makes it difficult to create a smooth suspension: at least three to five well-isolated colonies of the same morphological type are inoculated into a broth that will support good growth (such as tryptic soy broth) and incubated until turbid. The turbidity is adjusted to match that of a 0.5 McFarland standard (approximately 1 × 10<superscript>8</superscript> to 2 × 10<superscript>8</superscript> CFU/ml, based on <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> strain ATCC 25922) by diluting with more broth (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>). The organism suspension is further diluted, with the dilution depending on the MIC panel well volume and method used for inoculation. For example, when the broth well volume is 0.1 ml and the inoculum volume is 0.01 ml, the initial organism suspension (turbidity equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard) is diluted 1:20 (5 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> CFU/ml) and further diluted 1:10 (0.01 ml of final organism suspension into 0.1 ml of broth in well) to yield a final well concentration of 5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml. Alternatively, if the broth well and inoculum volumes are both 0.05 ml, the initial organism suspension is diluted 1:100 (1 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> CFU/ml) and further diluted 1:2 (0.05 ml of final organism suspension into 0.05 ml of broth in well).</para>
        <para id="ch0092s0000p0032">Multipoint metal, plastic inoculum replicators, multichannel pipettes, or other inoculating devices designed to collect and deliver appropriate volumes are used to transfer the inoculum from the diluted organism suspension to the wells of the broth microdilution panel. Optimally, broth microdilution trays should be inoculated within 15 min of inoculum preparation, and an aliquot should be subcultured to check the purity of the isolates (termed a “purity plate”). Finally, one well of each panel not containing an antimicrobial agent should be inoculated and used as a growth control; a second uninoculated well serves as a sterility control.</para>
        <para id="ch0092s0000p0033">The ISO standard reference method requires that viable colony counts be performed on the test suspension for each patient isolate to ensure the test wells contain approximately 5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml. Colony counts can be performed by removing 10 μl from the growth control well immediately after inoculation and diluting it in 10 ml of broth or saline (1:1,000 dilution). Then 100 μl of this dilution is spread over the surface of a suitable agar plate (1:10 dilution), which is then incubated overnight. According to the ISO standard, the acceptable number of colonies (range: 20 to 80, which equates to 2 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> to 8 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml in the growth well) must be observed or the MIC results for the strain cannot be reported (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>). The CLSI standard recommends at least quarterly performance of colony counts with <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> ATCC 25922 to ensure that the final inoculum concentration routinely obtained closely approximates 5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>). Since there can be variations in colony counts based on organism species typically related to cell size, presence of capsule, clumping in suspension, or other growth characteristics and age of culture, adjustments to the inoculum dilution procedure may be required to provide the final optimal well concentration of 5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml. Also, insufficient inoculum can be a significant problem with the detection of inducible resistance mechanisms (such as β-lactamases) of some organisms that may not be recognized as a problem based on the MICs obtained for the susceptible QC strains.</para>

        <para id="ch0092s0000p0035">Before MICs for clinical isolates are read and recorded, the growth control wells should be examined for organism viability and the inoculum purity plate should be checked. Tests are invalid if viability and purity plates do not meet CLSI or ISO standards. Additionally, the ISO standard requires that “the appropriate cell number concentration of the inoculum has been established” (see “Inoculation Procedures” above). The MICs obtained for the QC strains should be within ranges defined by either CLSI, EUCAST, or a relevant regulatory agency (see “Quality Control for Dilution Methods” below). Various viewing devices are available for reading MIC microdilution panels. The simplest and most reliable method is the use of a parabolic magnifying mirror and tray stand that allows clear visual inspection of the undersides of the microdilution trays. Growth is best determined by comparison with that in the growth control well and generally is indicated by turbidity throughout the well or by buttons, single or multiple, in the well bottom. The MIC for most agents is the lowest concentration exhibiting complete inhibition of visible growth (<anchor id="ch0092s0000a0022"/><link linkend="ch0092s0000a0024">Fig. 1</link>).

          <para id="ch0092s0000p0038">A major advantage of broth microdilution is that it is now a well-standardized global reference method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A substantial body of data exists on the broth microdilution method, and continuous improvements have been made and continue to be made to help increase the reproducibility, interlaboratory comparability, and intralaboratory comparability of the method. Cooperation among scientific and regulatory organizations, including the CLSI and EUCAST, resulted in the publication of the ISO/FDIS International Standard in 2006, which was the first globally agreed standard for broth microdilution AST (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0020">20</link>). An updated version of the ISO AST standard was published in 2019 (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>). The significance of this cooperation and the resulting global standard should not be underestimated. Prior to ISO 20776, there were potentially impactful differences in the test methodology used in different countries to generate broth microdilution MICs. This meant that different MICs would frequently be generated for the same isolate in laboratories using different broth microdilution methods. Several minor differences in methodology continue to exist between CLSI and ISO; however, the ISO 20776-1 document states that the ISO method is “essentially the same” as CLSI broth microdilution described in the M7 CLSI standard (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>). These subtle differences in methodology, such as incubation ranges (e.g., CLSI: 35 ± 2°C and ISO: 35 ± 1°C), are generally considered to be insignificant and acceptable. While differences in clinically relevant breakpoints continue to exist for several reasons (see <ulink url="ch0091#ch0091s0001">chapter 73</ulink>), existence of a global reference standard in the method itself has been a major step forward in quality and comparability of global MIC results.</para>
          <para id="ch0092s0000p0039">Another advantage of broth microdilution is that the inoculation and reading procedures allow convenient simultaneous testing of multiple antimicrobial agents with individual isolates. Commercially prepared frozen antimicrobial agent panels are available that allow laboratories to meet the ISO/CLSI global reference broth microdilution standard. Such products provide frozen panels with wells containing prepared antimicrobial dilutions. Dried panels are also available; however, as noted previously, use of a dried panel means that the testing is not being performed according to the reference broth microdilution method.</para>

          <para id="ch0092s0000p0041">Disadvantages of the broth microdilution global reference method include challenges due to the small volume tested and the technical skills required for performance and variability in MIC results, due to slight differences in the test process or inherent variability of the bacteria (e.g., expression of β-lactamases). The small volumes (see “Inoculation Procedures” above) used in the broth microdilution method can make detection of certain resistance mechanisms, such as inducible β-lactamases and heterogeneously resistant populations, difficult. The need for skilled laboratory personnel to perform and troubleshoot broth microdilution testing could also be considered a disadvantage of the reference method. The most significant disadvantage is that even when the current reference methods described by CLSI and ISO are followed by technical experts, there continues to exist both biological and technical variability in the method such that MIC results are typically considered to have a ±1 dilution error. Additionally, improper inoculum preparation and challenges in determining the endpoint of the growth in the microtiter wells can result in greater than ±1 dilution difference in an MIC result. For some organism/drug combinations, such as<emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> and β-lactam agents, MICs for the same isolate can range across five dilutions (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0021">21</link>). While some variability is biologic, CLSI, EUCAST, and ISO continue to clarify the guidance documents and modify the reference methodology to eliminate as many technical variables as possible.</para>

If two or more colonies persist at antimicrobial concentrations beyond an otherwise obvious endpoint, or if there is no growth at lower concentrations but there is growth at higher concentrations, the isolate should be subcultured to confirm purity and the test should be repeated. Substances that may antagonize the antibacterial activities of sulfonamides and trimethoprim may be carried over with the inoculum and cause “trailing,” or less definite endpoints (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0026">26</link>). Therefore, the MICs of these antimicrobial agents should be interpreted as the endpoints at which 80% or more diminution of growth occurs. Although much less pronounced, trailing endpoints may also occur for some organisms with bacteriostatic drugs such as chloramphenicol, the tetracyclines, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0092s0000p0062">The agar dilution method described in this chapter and in the CLSI M07 is a recognized standard method for susceptibility testing. The agar dilution method is efficient because it allows simultaneous testing of many isolates with a few drugs (such as when new agents are evaluated in the pharmaceutical industry). Microbial contamination or population heterogeneity is more readily detected by the agar method than by broth methods. While broth microdilution is now considered the international reference method for determining MICs, the agar dilution method is considered the reference test method for fosfomycin and mecillinam (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0005">5</link>). Also, for most anaerobes, <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>H. pylori</emphasis>, the agar dilution method is the CLSI reference method for susceptibility testing (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0007">7</link>). The major disadvantages of the agar method are associated with the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks of preparing the plates, especially if the number of different antimicrobial agents to be tested for each isolate is high or if only a few isolates are to be tested. Since testing of streptococci and <emphasis>Haemophilus</emphasis> spp. requires incubation in 5% CO<subscript>2</subscript>, which decreases the pH of the medium, MICs for azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin may be elevated (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0029">29</link>). Also, as the broth microdilution reference method has gained prominence, agar dilution is not always fully evaluated for newer antimicrobial agents.

These β-lactamase-producing strains are chosen in part to demonstrate a difference in activity between the β-lactam alone compared to the BL/BLI combination. It is important to test the β-lactam without the inhibitor to ensure that the QC strains have not lost ability to produce the target β-lactamase. QC strains should be obtained from a recognized source such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) or other reliable commercial sources. On occasion, the previously approved QC strains may not be sufficient for routine QC and/or quality assurance (QA) purposes (e.g., does not reliably detect a problem testing condition or does not accomplish troubleshooting, validation and/or verification, or assessment objectives).

Alternatively, CLSI provides two plans to demonstrate acceptable performance to reduce the frequency of MIC (or disk diffusion) QC tests from daily to weekly. The weekly QC-testing options are only applicable if MIC (or disk diffusion) tests are performed at least once a week. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates clinical laboratory testing in the United States through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, established a requirement (effective January 1, 2016) that reducing QC from daily to weekly is only an option if an individual quality control plan is in place (see<ulink url="ch0017#ch0017s0001">chapter 2</ulink>).</para>

If this frequency is exceeded, the laboratory must perform corrective action to determine the source of the error and to correct it as described below. However, if daily QC testing does not reveal an excessive rate of errors, daily testing may be replaced by weekly testing as outlined in one of the two plans below according to CLSI guidance M07 (M02) (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0002">2</link>).

If no more than 1 of 20 or 3 of 30 results per combination are outside the accuracy range, weekly testing may replace daily testing.

If 0 or 1 result is out of range, conversion to weekly QC testing is permitted. If 2 or 3 are out of range, testing of an additional 15 replicates is required.

To perform the test, commercially prepared 6-mm filter paper disks impregnated with a specified single concentration of an antimicrobial agent are applied to the surface of an agar plate that has been inoculated with the test organism to form a “lawn” of growth covering the entire agar surface. The drug in the disk diffuses through the agar. As the distance from the disk increases, the concentration of the antimicrobial agent decreases logarithmically, creating a gradient of drug concentrations in the agar medium surrounding each disk. Concomitant with the diffusion of the drug, the bacteria that were inoculated onto the surface and were not inhibited by the concentration of the antimicrobial agent in the agar continue to multiply until a lawn of growth is visible across the agar surface.

A pH outside the range of 7.2 to 7.4 may adversely affect susceptibility test results. If the pH is too low, drugs such as the aminoglycosides, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones will appear to lose potency, whereas others (for example, the penicillins and tetracyclines) may appear to have excessive activity. The opposite effects are expected if the pH is too high (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>).</para>

If refrigerated, they should be wrapped in plastic or stored in sealed packages to minimize evaporation. The CLSI M2 standard states that plates are stable for 7 days, but could have a longer shelf life if precautions are taken to prevent drying and QC is in range at the time of testing. Just before use, if excess moisture is visible on the agar surface, plates should be placed in an incubator (35 ± 2°C) or, with lids ajar, in a laminar-flow hood at room temperature until the moisture evaporates (usually 10 to 30 min). At the time the medium is to be inoculated, no droplets of moisture should be visible on the agar surface or on the petri dish lid (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0002">2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0092s0000p0079">Various components of or supplements to Mueller-Hinton medium may affect susceptibility test results; therefore, appropriate QC procedures (see “Quality Control for the Disk Diffusion Method” below) must be performed, and zone diameters must be within acceptable limits. For example, media containing excessive amounts of thymidine or thymine can reverse the inhibitory effects of sulfonamides and trimethoprim, causing zones of growth inhibition to be smaller or less distinct (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0002">2</link>). Organisms may therefore appear to be falsely resistant to these drugs. Variation in the concentrations of divalent cations, primarily calcium and magnesium, affects results of aminoglycoside and tetracycline tests with <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> isolates (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0002">2</link>). A cation content that is too high reduces zone sizes, whereas a cation content that is too low has the opposite effect. Sheep blood should not be added to Mueller-Hinton medium for testing of nonfastidious organisms because the blood can significantly alter the zone diameters with several agents and bacterial species (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0026">26</link>). Disk diffusion is not reliable for testing daptomycin because of the poor diffusion of the molecule. In addition, calcium content may reduce zone sizes if insufficient, and high calcium content may increase zone sizes. Excess zinc ions may reduce carbapenem zone sizes (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0013">13</link>).

When isolates of staphylococci or enterococci are tested, any discernible growth (especially a haze of pinpoint colonies) within the zone of inhibition around the oxacillin disk (for staphylococci) or vancomycin disk (for enterococci) is indicative of likely resistance. For other bacteria, discrete colonies growing within a clear zone of inhibition may indicate testing of a mixed culture that should be subcultured, reidentified, and retested. However, the presence of colonies within a zone of inhibition may also indicate selection of high-frequency mutants predicting eventual resistance to that agent (e.g.,<emphasis>Enterobacter</emphasis> spp. with penicillins and cephalosporins). Such small in-growth colonies are frequently seen when testing fosfomycin.

The primary limitation of the disk diffusion test is the spectrum of organisms for which it has been standardized.

In addition, the disk method does not reliably detect daptomycin resistance in staphylococci and enterococci (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0038">38</link>).

Care should be taken when testing vancomycin and enterococci because zone sizes in the intermediate category are often observed for strains resistant by broth dilution method.

Second, the medium used may be a source of error if it fails to conform to recommended composition and performance. Factors common to both agar-based and broth-based systems are the pH of the medium, which should be between 7.2 and 7.4 for MHA or broth, and their cation content. The concentration of magnesium and calcium in the broth medium should be that published in the reference ISO/CLSI method to help ensure reliable results (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0015">15</link>).

        <para id="ch0092s0000p0101">The binding of some agents to surfaces, especially plastic used in susceptibility testing, has been addressed with certain agents (oritavancin, telavancin, and dalbavancin) with addition of polysorbate 80. For colistin testing, polysorbate is currently not recommended. With the recent increase in colistin use and reports of colistin resistance, there is an increased need for susceptibility testing. However, primarily because of the affinity of colistin for plastic and poor diffusion in agar, susceptibility testing remains a challenge. Although CLSI and EUCAST currently recommend testing by broth microdilution, an investigation of four colistin MIC methods (agar dilution, broth macrodilution, broth microdilution, and gradient strip) demonstrated significant variation in MICs with broth microdilution and concluded that the best reproducibility was achieved with the agar dilution method (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0047">47</link>). Another recent study has shown significant colistin binding to polystyrene and, in contrast, low binding with polypropylene (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0048">48</link>). See CLSI M100 and the EUCAST website for the most recent guidance on colistin AST (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0092s0000p0102">Testing of certain antimicrobial agents with some bacteria may yield misleading results because<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> results do not necessarily correlate with <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> activity. Examples include aminoglycosides and narrow-spectrum cephalosporins tested with <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp.; all β-lactam agents, except penicillin, oxacillin, cefoxitin, and ceftaroline, tested with staphylococci; cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (except concentrations used to detect high-level resistance), clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole tested with enterococci; and cephalosporins tested with <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>). Therefore, for these combinations of organisms and drugs, results should not be reported. Other errors associated with reporting include possible transcriptional errors for laboratories that use a manual recording and reporting system and possible errors in transmission of data for laboratories in which an automated susceptibility test system is interfaced with the laboratory and/or hospital information system.</para>
        <para id="ch0092s0000p0103">For several species of bacteria, resistance to a commonly tested antimicrobial agent is expected. For example, several species of<emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>, including <emphasis>Klebsiella, Citrobacter</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Enterobacter</emphasis> spp., among others, should test as ampicillin resistant (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0003">3</link>).

A susceptible result for any of these bacterium-antimicrobial combinations could indicate an error in antimicrobial susceptibility testing or bacterial identification.

      <para id="ch0092s0000p0104">The dilution and diffusion methods described in this chapter have been developed through careful studies and standardized by national professional organizations and diagnostic device manufacturers. Despite this, there are still some organisms for which methods have not yet been standardized (e.g., coryneform bacteria and some fastidious bacteria in the case of disk testing) or which fail to provide reliable results with some of the standard tests (e.g.,<emphasis>S. maltophilia</emphasis> and <emphasis>B. cepacia</emphasis> in the case of disk diffusion testing of some drugs).</para>
      <para id="ch0092s0000p0105">Other problems occur with detecting resistance mechanisms in isolates that may possess inducible resistance (e.g., clindamycin resistance in staphylococci and some streptococci,<emphasis>vanB</emphasis>-type resistance in some enterococci, or AmpC-type β-lactamase in some Gram-negative species). Similarly, there are issues with detection of resistance mechanisms that result in subtle phenotypic expression under standard inoculum and test conditions (e.g., extended-spectrum β-lactamase [ESBL] or carbapenemase expression in some <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>). Special methods to detect these resistance mechanisms are outlined in <ulink url="ch0094#ch0094s0001">chapter 76</ulink>. Controversy has existed regarding the need to identify the resistance mechanisms such as ESBLs or carbapenemases to make treatment decisions. Revised CLSI cephalosporin, aztreonam, and carbapenem interpretive criteria that are consistent with recent PK/PD data and the most common dosing regimens obviate the need for ESBL or carbapenemase confirmation before a treatment decision is made (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0003">3</link>). In general, it is the MIC value, or the phenotypic expression of a resistance mechanism, that seems most predictive of therapeutic outcome in an individual patient, as opposed to the presence of resistance genes in the causative pathogen. However, there may still be a need to identify certain resistance mechanisms (especially those that are plasmid mediated) for epidemiological and infection prevention purposes.</para>

However, general guidelines for acceptable performance (e.g., rates of essential agreement and category agreement) have been developed through an international consensus effort (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0051">51</link>).

        <para id="ch0092s0000p0107">Interpretive categories for MIC methods and disk diffusion are established after both intralaboratory and interlaboratory reproducibility are verified for these methods. The broth microdilution AST is the global reference method. Breakpoints for evaluating disk diffusion results are determined based on optimal correlation with MIC results. There are limitations to the use of the disk diffusion test. Daptomycin, dalbavancin, polymyxin B, and colistin are antimicrobial agents that do not diffuse well in agar, so in most cases disk diffusion is not an accurate method for these agents and MIC methods are required (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0053">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0054">54</link>). MIC tests are also recommended for susceptibility testing of staphylococci to vancomycin because vancomycin susceptibility testing by disk diffusion is not an accurate method for distinguishing vancomycin-intermediate from vancomycin-susceptible staphylococci (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0055">55</link>). Also, MIC testing is necessary for accurate category assignment of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> isolates to penicillin, several cephalosporins, and carbapenems (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0056">56</link>). For some bacteria, there are limited or no disk diffusion data available from well-controlled studies; thus, establishing interpretive criteria for most drugs of interest is not feasible (e.g., <emphasis>S. maltophilia, Bacillus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Leuconostoc</emphasis> spp.). There are several instances where elevated but susceptible MIC values can be clinically useful, particularly for epidemiologic purposes. For example, isolates of <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> that show elevated fluoroquinolone MICs but that are still in the susceptible category may possess a first-step fluoroquinolone mutation (of <emphasis>gyrA</emphasis>) or possibly a plasmid-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance mechanism (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0057">57</link>). Similarly, an elevated but susceptible-range cephalosporin MIC in an isolate of the <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> with the older breakpoints (pre-2010) may indicate production of an ESBL. With the revised CLSI or EUCAST cephalosporin breakpoints for the <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>, tests for ESBL detection are no longer required for the care of individual patients, but ESBL production is useful information for epidemiological and infection control purposes (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>). When treating an infection caused by a multidrug-resistant isolate, which may be susceptible only to a single antimicrobial agent, clinicians may consider using agents that give intermediate or even resistant results at an alternative dose, a different route of administration to optimize drug concentrations at the site of infection, or combinations of agents to try to effect a cure (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0058">58</link>). An MIC result combined with agent-specific PK/PD data may help to guide this decision.</para>

        <para id="ch0092s0000p0108">In recent years, there has been a growing consensus between EUCAST, CLSI, and the FDA about data sets and methods for breakpoint setting. All three organizations agree that microbiological, PK/PD, and clinical exposure-response relationships and clinical outcome by MIC data are the key considerations when selecting clinically relevant breakpoints. In addition, EUCAST and CLSI have developed an approach to establishing epidemiological (wild-type) cutoff values (called Ecoffs by EUCAST and ECVs by CLSI) (<link linkend="ch0092s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0092s0000li0059">59</link>). However, while there has been an increasing convergence of breakpoints themselves, there are still a number of differing breakpoints for several reasons apart from methodological ones, such as different disk masses or test media (see <ulink url="ch0090#ch0090s0001">chapter 72</ulink>). Consensus on the clinically relevant data, mathematical models, and analysis processes required for setting breakpoints continues to evolve. It is likely that breakpoints will increasingly converge as methods for breakpoint setting become more standardized internationally.</para>

The ability to predict<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> response with simple, reproducible <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> assays has significantly improved patient care. The dilution and disk methods described in this chapter, though vastly improved since their development, are not perfect. Organizations such as CLSI and EUCAST continue to clarify or modify the techniques to increase reproducibility and clinical relevance. Susceptibility tests are becoming more rapid, increasing their potential for clinical impact earlier in the patient care process. Alternative methodologies, including phenotypic and genotypic approaches, are evolving and promise to alter the way that antibacterial agents are selected, dosed, and monitored. Whole-genome sequencing and measurements of gene expression (e.g., mRNA quantification) may become cornerstones of future susceptibility testing assays (see <ulink url="ch0093#ch0093s0001">chapters 75</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0094#ch0094s0001">76</ulink>). With a few exceptions, the reference broth microdilution method described in this chapter is considered the “gold standard.” As novel methods and precision medicine approaches emerge, the landscape of antimicrobial susceptibility testing will likely evolve in ways that will continue to improve patient care.</para>
