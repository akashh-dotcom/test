        <para id="ch0138s0000p0002">Although there are greater than 135,000 named species of fungi, the number of undescribed species has been estimated to be more than 12 million, and between 1,000 to &gt;2,500 new species are described annually (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0002">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0004">3</link>). Of the known fungal species, greater than 700 have commonly been associated with disease in humans and animals, and &gt;100 are true pathogens, capable of causing cutaneous or subcutaneous infections, such as the dermatophytes, or invasive disease in otherwise healthy individuals, such as endemic dimorphic species (e.g., <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> spp.) as well as <emphasis>Rhinocladiella mackenziei</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cladophialophora bantiana</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0005">4</link>). However, an increasing number of ubiquitous fungi, primarily environmental molds found in soil or on plants, wood, compost heaps, or decomposing food, are being implicated as opportunistic pathogens capable of producing serious disease in immunocompromised hosts and those with multiple comorbidities. These molds, which are familiar to plant pathologists, food microbiologists, and mycologists, are unfamiliar to clinical microbiologists with little to no formal training in fungal identification. Identification of fungi solely by phenotypic characteristics requires familiarity with a range of different structures and terminology. However, the advent of rapid molecular and proteomic assays have transformed this process, facilitating the accurate identification of clinical isolates. In addition, these new methods of analysis are having a substantial impact on the taxonomy and nomenclature of fungi, including many medically important species.</para>

          <para id="ch0138s0000p0003">Fungi form a clade of eukaryotic organisms that differ from other groups in several aspects. Fungal cells are encased within a rigid cell wall, mostly composed of chitin, glucan, chitosan, mannan, and glycoproteins, with the compositions different between different groups of fungi. In contrast, animal cells have no cell walls, and plant cell walls have cellulose as the major component. As in other eukaryotic organisms, fungal cells have a true nucleus with a surrounding membrane, and cell division is accompanied by meiosis or mitosis.</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0004">Fungi lack chlorophyll (i.e., they are heterotrophic, meaning that they obtain energy through the intake and digestion of organic substances). Thus, they require preformed organic carbon compounds for their nutrition and live embedded in a food source or medium in order to obtain nourishment by secreting enzymes into the external substrate and then absorbing nutrients through their cell wall. Fungi are ubiquitous in nature and perform an essential service by returning nutrients removed by plants to the soil.</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0005">Fungi can be either multicellular or unicellular. The basic structural unit of multicellular fungi is a chain of multinucleate, tubular, filament‐like cells (termed a hypha, plural hyphae). The vegetative stage of most multicellular fungi consists of a mass of branching hyphae, termed a mycelium or thallus. Each individual hypha has a rigid cell wall and increases in length as a result of apical growth with mitotic cell division. In some fungi, the hyphae remain aseptate (without cross‐walls). In other groups, the hyphae are divided into compartments or cells by the development of more or less frequent cross‐walls, termed septa, and such hyphae are referred to as septate. Fungi that exist in the form of microscopic multicellular mycelium are commonly called molds.</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0006">Many fungi can exist in the form of independent single cells and propagate by budding out similar cells from their surface. The bud may remain attached to the parent cell and produce another bud, or it may become detached from the parent cell. When buds remain attached and produce other buds, a chain of cells may be produced. Fungi that do not produce hyphae, but instead consist of a loose arrangement of budding cells, are called yeasts. Under certain conditions, continued elongation of the parent cell before budding results in a chain of elongated cells, termed pseudohyphae. Unlike a true hypha, the connection between adjacent pseudohyphal cells shows a marked constriction. Yeasts are a growth form observed in a wide range of unrelated fungi and are neither a natural nor a formal taxonomic group.</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0007">Many medically important fungi change their growth form as part of the process of tissue invasion. These dimorphic pathogens usually change from a multicellular mold form in the environment to a budding, single‐celled yeast form in tissue under the influence of temperature (known as thermal dimorphism). Well‐known examples include<emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Sporothrix</emphasis> spp. (see <ulink url="ch0147#ch0147s0001">chapter 126</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). Many other fungal pathogens, although not thermally dimorphic, demonstrate subtle morphological differences between forms found in tissue and in culture (e.g., <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. exhibiting yeast, pseudohyphae, or hyphae in tissue, which is species specific) (see <ulink url="ch0142#ch0142s10001">chapter 121</ulink>).</para>

          <para id="ch0138s0000p0008">Some fungi reproduce by means of microscopic propagules called spores or conidia. The term “conidium” (plural, conidia) is used to describe propagules that result from asexual reproduction (involving mitosis only). Asexual conidia are identical to the parent, with the exception of the occasional mutation. These are generally short‐lived propagules that are produced in enormous numbers to ensure dispersion to new habitats. Many fungi are also capable of sexual reproduction (involving meiosis, preceded by fusion of the nuclei of two cells). Some species are self‐fertile (homothallic) and able to form sexual structures between different cells within an individual thallus. Most, however, are heterothallic and do not form sexual structures unless two compatible isolates come into contact. Once two compatible haploid nuclei fuse, meiosis can occur, and this results in the production of the sexual spores. In some species the haploid sexual spores are borne singly on specialized generative cells, and the whole structure is microscopic in size. In other cases, however, the spores are produced in millions in macroscopic “fruiting bodies” such as mushrooms. The structures observed with sexual reproduction form one scheme for the classification of the fungi.</para>

          <para id="ch0138s0000p0009">The scientific names of fungi are subject to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) that was adopted in 2011 (<ulink url="http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php">http://www.iapt‐taxon.org/nomen/main.php</ulink>). The ICN rules must be followed when proposing the name for a new fungal species, or the name being proposed can be rejected as invalid (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0006">5</link>). The main requirements for valid publication of a new name include: (i) the name must be in Latin binomial form; (ii) the proposal must be accompanied by an English or Latin description; (iii) a living culture of the specimen on which the author based the description of the species must be deposited in a recognized culture collection; and (iv) the name must be registered with the online taxonomy database MycoBank (<ulink url="http://www.mycobank.org/">http://www.mycobank.org/</ulink>) and assigned a MycoBank registration number.</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0010">Names of fungi change for various reasons. Many common and widely distributed species have been described as new several times and thus have come to have more than one name. In general, the correct name for any species is the earliest name published in line with the requirements of the code of nomenclature. Later names are termed synonyms. However, the ICN permits certain exceptions, the most significant of which is when an earlier generic name has been overlooked, a later name has then come into common use, and a reversion to the earlier name would cause problems (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0006">5</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0011">Another reason for changing the name of a fungus is when new research determines that the transfer of a species from one genus to another is necessary or establishes it as the type of a new genus. Such changes are quite in order, but with the provision that the specific epithet should remain unchanged, except for inflection according to the rules of Latin grammar. However often a species is transferred to a new genus, the correct species epithet is always the first one that was applied to that particular organism. As an example, when<emphasis>Phialophora parasitica</emphasis> was moved to a new genus, it became <emphasis>Phaeoacremonium parasiticum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0007">6</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0012">Many fungi appear to bear more than one name, and this is often confusing to microbiologists, as this is an apparent departure from the basic principle of biological classification, in which an organism can only have one correct name. As previously noted, many fungi have an asexual stage (or anamorph), characterized by the production of asexual conidia, and a sexual stage (or teleomorph) characterized by sexual spores (e.g., ascospores, basidiospores). Many fungi propagate asexually and the teleomorph is unknown or only rarely encountered. Because of this, separate names have been assigned to the anamorphs and teleomorphs, which may have occurred at different times without the connection between them being recognized. With the widespread application of molecular methods, it is now possible to confirm that these separate forms constitute a single species. There are numerous instances where different names applied to the asexual and sexual forms of the same species are now redundant (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0008">7</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0013">These developments are reflected in the most recent code of nomenclature. As of 1 January 2013, the system of permitting separate anamorph and teleomorph names ended; the dual‐naming system is no longer permitted, and mycologists have begun the process of choosing one name from existing names for many fungal species. All legitimate names proposed for a species, whether for the sexual or asexual form, can in the future serve as the correct name for that species. Working groups and committees have been established under the auspices of the International Commission on the Taxonomy of Fungi (ICTF) (<ulink url="http://www.fungaltaxonomy.org/subcommissions">http://www.fungaltaxonomy.org/subcommissions</ulink>), and these will propose lists of accepted and rejected names for ratification.</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0014">Name changes for fungi are not new, but these have accelerated as a consequence of the availability of new molecular data. Species recognition based on phylogenies has led to more accurate delineation of taxonomic boundaries that resulted in the ongoing revisions to classification of pathogens (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0009">8</link>). An example of a fungus that has undergone multiple name changes is <emphasis>Scedosporium boydii.</emphasis> This species was first described in 1922 as <emphasis>Allescheria boydii</emphasis> under the genus <emphasis>Monascus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0010">9</link>). In 1970, Malloch, while studying members of the Microascaceae, observed that the ascomata and ascospores produced by <emphasis>Allescheria boydii</emphasis> did not fit with those of the accepted species in <emphasis>Monascus</emphasis> or any of the existing genera of cleistothecial ascomycetes. Malloch proposed a new genus, <emphasis>Petriellidium</emphasis>, for <emphasis>A. boydii</emphasis> and placed the new genus in the Microascaceae (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0011">10</link>). In 1943 and 1944, Negroni and Fisher described a new genus and species <emphasis>Pseudallescheria shearii</emphasis> for an ascomycete that was isolated from a human case of mycetoma, and McGinnis et al. (1982) found that <emphasis>Petriellidium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Pseudallescheria</emphasis> were congeneric (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0012">11</link>). Thus, <emphasis>Pseudallescheria</emphasis> was adopted as the proper name for this genus. Although <emphasis>Petriellidium</emphasis> was described earlier than <emphasis>Pseudallescheria</emphasis>, the decision to use <emphasis>Pseudallescheria</emphasis> as the proper name and place <emphasis>Petriellidium</emphasis> into synonymy was a consideration to the medical community regarding the difficulty brought about by name changes of medically important fungi. Moreover, McGinnis et al. also found evidence that <emphasis>P. shearii</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. boydii</emphasis> were conspecific. Because <emphasis>P. boydii</emphasis> was described in 1922, <emphasis>P. shearii</emphasis> must be treated as a later synonym of <emphasis>P. boydii</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0012">11</link>). <emphasis>Pseudallescheria</emphasis> species have <emphasis>Scedosporium</emphasis> anamorphs. In accordance with the new International Code of Nomenclature, <emphasis>Scedosporium</emphasis> has priority over <emphasis>Pseudallescheria</emphasis>, and thus <emphasis>Scedosporium boydii</emphasis> is adopted as the current name (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0013">12</link>).

These changes may have clinical repercussions in that there may be disconnects between the mycological and medical literature, potentially leading to issues in patient management. Steps can be taken to mitigate these effects. For example, reporting laboratories can support the transition by reporting both the more familiar species name and the new name, e.g., “<emphasis>Candida krusei</emphasis> (now known as <emphasis>Pichia kudriavsevii</emphasis>),” “<emphasis>Bipolaris spicifera</emphasis> (now known as <emphasis>Curvularia spicifera</emphasis>),” “<emphasis>Madurella grisea</emphasis> (now known as <emphasis>Trematosphaeria grisea</emphasis>),” or “<emphasis>Candida lusitaniae</emphasis> (now known as <emphasis>Clavispora lusitaniae</emphasis>)” (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0014">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0138s0000li0015">14</link>). In addition, the NCBI databases for journal articles and molecular data are strongly supported by a standardized taxonomy database, which ensures that searches for a particular organism retrieve all relevant material, regardless of the species names that were originally submitted (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0014">13</link>). Another example where confusion resulting from newly created names may be prevented is with the use of the term “species complex” (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0008">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0138s0000li0015">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0138s0000li0016">15</link>), which has been recommended for <emphasis>Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis> species complex and <emphasis>Cryptococcus gattii</emphasis> species complex (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0017">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0138s0000li0018">17</link>). This term has been proposed to be used in the medical literature for a group of highly similar organisms when evidence of the clinical relevance between them is lacking (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0008">7</link>). Borman and Johnson suggested that with clear guidance and continued communication between clinicians and laboratories, taxonomic progress and changes in fungal nomenclature can move forward while minimizing risk to patients (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0014">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0138s0000li0019">18</link>). The timing of the implementation of name changes remains a challenge for different groups. This includes professional societies that develop and publish guidelines related to fungal infections, as well as diagnostic device manufacturers that may require regulatory review and approval of changes that are made to their libraries approved for clinical use. Clinical microbiology laboratories also have to determine how frequently updates need to be made to their laboratory information systems for reporting results and how to handle changes when there is still debate regarding the accepted taxonomy of certain groups (e.g., <emphasis>Fusarium solani</emphasis> versus <emphasis>Neocosmospora solani</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0020">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0138s0000li0021">20</link>), or when formal registration of revised names is lacking within recognized registries, such as Mycobank.</para>

          <para id="ch0138s0000p0018">The sexual spores and their mode of production have historically formed the main basis for the classification of fungi into the Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. In some fungi, however, the asexual stage, or anamorph, has proved so successful as a means of rapid dispersal to new habitats that the sexual stage, or teleomorph, either has disappeared or has not yet been discovered. Even in the absence of the teleomorph, it is now often possible to assign these fungi to the Ascomycota or Basidiomycota on the basis of DNA sequences of the anamorphs (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0022">21</link>). In the past, these asexual fungi were classified in an artificial group, the “Fungi Imperfecti” (also termed the “form‐division Deuteromycota”) and were divided into artificial form‐classes according to the morphological characteristics of their asexual reproductive structures (i.e., Blastomycetes, Coelomycetes, and Hyphomycetes). There is no longer any separate formal grouping for those fungi that appear to be strictly anamorphic, or for which no teleomorph has been discovered. Nonetheless, mycologists continue to employ the asexual reproductive characteristics of molds, at least for routine identification purposes (see below).</para>

          <para id="ch0138s0000p0019">The advent of molecular phylogenetics has led to a revolution in microbial taxonomy. Previously for fungi, this was largely based on their morphological characteristics, rather than on the physiological and biochemical differences that were of such importance in bacterial classification. Recently, comparative DNA sequence analysis has led to a radical and ongoing revision of fungal taxonomy based on a phylogenetic approach (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0023">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0138s0000li0024">23</link>). With this approach, a species is defined as a group of organisms that share concordance of multiple molecular genealogies (DNA sequences at different loci), rather than organisms that share a common morphology or organisms that can mate with one another. Concordant branches among the phylogenetic trees are used to connect species. Many different DNA loci, genes, and gene fragments have been explored, but the most widely used remain the conserved regions of the rRNA genes, in particular the two internal transcribed spacer regions of ribosomal DNA.</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0020">Advances in phylogenetic analysis have led to major revisions in the classification of eukaryotic organisms. Under one proposal (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0025">24</link>), eukaryotes are divided into five monophyletic lineages or supergroups: (i) the SAR (derived from the acronym of three groups united in this clade: Stramenopiles, Alveolata, and Rhizaria); (ii) Archaeplastida; (iii) Excavata; (iv) Amoebozoa; and (v) Opisthokonta (see <ulink url="ch0159#ch0159s10001">chapter 136</ulink>). In this classification, these supergroups replace the previous kingdoms that encompassed the eukaryotes, and the true fungi make up a monophyletic clade within the supergroup Opisthokonta. This also includes the single‐celled animals and several protist clades (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0025">24</link>). Based on molecular analysis, a number of organisms have been reassigned to the fungi, most notably <emphasis>Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis>, now placed in the phylum Ascomycota, and the microsporidia (see <ulink url="ch0143#ch0143s0001">chapters 122</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0153#ch0153s0001">132</ulink>).</para>
          <para id="ch0138s0000p0021">There are also a number of human and animal pathogens, including<emphasis>Pythium insidiosum</emphasis> and <emphasis>Rhinosporidium seeberi</emphasis> (see <ulink url="ch0152#ch0152s0001">chapter 131</ulink>), that, while not fungi <emphasis>sensu stricto</emphasis>, are “parafungi” or “pseudofungi,” protists sharing morphological features with the true fungi. <emphasis>Lagenidium</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Pythium</emphasis> spp. are slime‐fungus‐like organsims that were formerly classified in the kingdom Stramenopila, phylum Oomycota. They develop sparsely septate mycelioid structures similar to those seen in filamentous fungi. These genera are closely related to some algal groups and are now placed in the SAR supergroup (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0025">24</link>). <emphasis>Rhinosporidium seeberi</emphasis> is a nonculturable organism that produces large spherical sporangia filled with endospores in tissue.

          <para id="ch0138s0000p0022">One of the consequences of the widespread employment of molecular analysis for fungal identification and classification has been the discovery of genetically distinct populations that deserve species status. These newly recognized cryptic species, which can only be distinguished by molecular or proteomic means, and not by morphologic characteristics, are found within many medically important species. For example, cryptic species in<emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis> var. <emphasis>capsulatum</emphasis>—i.e., <emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis> var. <emphasis>capsulatum</emphasis> North American class 1, <emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis> var. <emphasis>capsulatum</emphasis> North American class 2, and <emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis> var. <emphasis>capsulatum</emphasis> Latin American group A—have been proposed to species status as <emphasis>Histoplasma mississippiense, Histoplasma ohiense</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Histoplasma suramericanum</emphasis>, respectively (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0026">25</link>). <emphasis>Coccidioides posadasii</emphasis> has been separated from <emphasis>Coccidioides immitis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0027">26</link>), while <emphasis>Blastomyces gilchristii</emphasis> and <emphasis>Paracoccidioides lutzii</emphasis> are genetically distinct from <emphasis>B. dermatitidis</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. brasiliensis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0028">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0138s0000li0029">28</link>). It is unclear at present whether the detection of these particular cryptic species contributes to patient management. However, this may change, and there are examples where cryptic species have been found to possess distinct phenotypic characteristics of potential clinical relevance. For instance, <emphasis>Aspergillus lentulus,</emphasis> a cryptic species in <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> section <emphasis>Fumigati</emphasis>, is less susceptible to antifungal agents (see <ulink url="ch0144#ch0144s0001">chapter 123</ulink>) (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0030">29</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0138s0000p0023">Traditionally, the kingdom Fungi has been organized in a hierarchical manner, each rank being named with, and recognizable by, a particular ending: phylum, ‐mycota; subphylum, ‐mycotina; class, ‐mycetes; order, ‐ales; family: ‐aceae (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0031">30</link>). Each family is composed of a number of genera, and these are divided into species. With the advent of molecular methods and phylogenetic analysis, there has been particular instability in the use of higher taxonomic ranks because of the comparative nature of the data and also because no “gold standard” exists to define boundaries between different groups at any level (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0008">7</link>). In their comprehensive phylogenetic classification of the kingdom Fungi, Hibbett et al. (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0015">14</link>) accepted 7 phyla, 10 subphyla, 35 classes, 12 subclasses, and 129 orders. However, these familiar grouping names are no longer used in the latest revision to eukaryote classification (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0002">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0138s0000li0025">24</link>). Tedersoo et al. (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0002">1</link>) introduced several changes at the phylum (plural phyla) and class levels and created subkingdoms to enable clarity in the relationships of phyla. The nine subkingdoms that constitute the true fungi are Dikarya (Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Entorrhizomycota), Mucoromyceta (Calcarisporiellomycota, Glomeromycota, Mortierellomycota, and Mucoromycota), Zoopagomyceta (Entomophthoromycota, Kickxellomycota, and Zoopagomycota), and Chytridiomyceta (Chytridiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, and Neocallimastigomycota), which comprise multiple phyla, whereas Aphelidiomyceta, Basidiobolomyceta, Blastocladiomyceta, Olpidiomyceta, and Rozellomyceta each cover a single phylum. The phylum Zygomycota is no longer accepted due to its polyphyletic nature (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0032">31</link>). Eight taxa were raised from lower taxonomic levels to phylum rank—i.e., Basidiobolomycota, Calcarisporiellomycota, Glomeromycota, Entomophthoromycota, Kickxellomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Mortierellomycota, and Olpidiomycota—to follow the criteria of monophyly and comparable divergence time.</para>

Three subphyla (Pezizomycotina, Saccharomycotina, and Taphrinomycotina) are recognized (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0032">31</link>). Sexual reproduction leads to the development of haploid spores, termed ascospores, which are produced in a sac‐like structure termed an ascus. The Ascomycota show a gradual transition from primitive forms that produce single asci to species that produce large structures, termed ascocarps or ascomata, containing numerous asci. Variations in ascus structure are of major importance in the classification of these fungi. Asexual reproduction consists of the production of conidia from a generative or conidiogenous cell. In some species the conidiogenous cell cannot be distinguished from the rest of the mycelium. In others, a special structure is produced which bears one or more conidiogenous cells. Many genetically unrelated species among the Ascomycota have very similar conidial structures, while other genetically similar species differ vastly in their morphological characteristics.</para>

          <para id="ch0138s0000p0032">The subphylum Taphrinomycotina contains only one medically important genus,<emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>, formerly classified as a member of the kingdom Protozoa, but now reassigned to the class Pneumocystidomycetes on the basis of small‐subunit rDNA and other genetic sequence comparisons (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0034">33</link>). The subphylum Saccharomycotina contains a single class of medical importance, the Saccharomycetes, to which most opportunistic pathogenic ascomycetous yeasts belong. The subphylum Pezizomycotina contains 14 classes, two of which are of medical importance: the Eurotiomycetes and the Sordariomycetes, which encompass the filamentous ascomycetes (<link linkend="ch0138s0000li0002">1</link>).</para>

The morphological characteristics of their conidia and the manner in which the spores are produced serve as the main distinguishing features. Holoblastic conidia range in size from minute unicellular to large thick‐walled multicelled conidia. In some species, the first‐formed conidium buds to produce a second, and the second produces a third, and so on until a chain of conidia is produced, with the youngest at its tip (acropetal). Because each spore can produce more than one bud, a branching chain becomes possible (e.g.,<emphasis>Cladophialophora</emphasis> species). In another group, the conidiogenous cell that produced the first spore then grows past it to produce a second.

In some phialidic molds, such as species of <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Acremonium</emphasis> (see <ulink url="ch0145#ch0145s0001">chapter 124</ulink>), the conidia are not firmly attached to each other and often move aside to accumulate in a wet mass around the phialide, which makes them suited for water dispersal. In other phialidic molds, such as species of <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Penicillium</emphasis>, continuous replenishment of the inner wall of the tip of the phialide results in the formation of an unbranched chain of connected conidia, with the youngest at the base (basipetal).

In annellidic conidiogenesis the first blown‐out cell becomes a conidium, and subsequent conidia are formed by blowing out through the scar of the previous one.

Macroscopic characteristics, such as colonial form, surface color, pigmentation, and growth rate, are often helpful in mold identification. Although the culture medium, incubation temperature, age of the culture, and amount of inoculum can influence colonial appearance and growth rate, these characteristics remain sufficiently constant to be useful in the process of identification. Molds that fail to sporulate in culture may be impossible to identify to the species level using morphology, and it is therefore important to select culture conditions which favor sporulation.
