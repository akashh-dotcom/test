      <para id="ch0025s000000p0001">Health care-associated infections (HAIs) represent one of the most common complications of health care delivery, affecting over 700,000 people admitted to acute-care hospitals in the United States each year (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0001">1</link>). The World Health Organization reports that millions more across the globe suffer each year from infections acquired in the health care setting, estimating the pooled HAI prevalence among hospitalized patients worldwide to be 10.1% (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0002">2</link>). Every health care facility should therefore have an infection prevention program (IPP) charged with monitoring, preventing, and controlling the spread of infections in the health care environment. Because infection prevention requires the detection of both infections and colonization with potential pathogens, the clinical microbiology laboratory (CML) plays a critical role in any comprehensive IPP. In this chapter, we discuss the impact of HAIs on patient outcomes and health care costs and the organization of the hospital IPP and describe the important role that the CML plays in HAI prevention.</para>

      <para id="ch0025s000000p0002">An HAI is an infection that is acquired in a hospital or health care facility (i.e., the infection was not present or incubating at the time of contact with the health care environment). For most bacterial infections, symptom onset more than 48 h after contact with a health care facility provides evidence supporting acquisition in the health care environment. Because hospital stays are getting shorter and more patients are receiving treatment in outpatient settings, many HAIs are not recognized during hospitalization or may be associated with health care environments other than acute-care hospitals (e.g., ambulatory surgery centers, dialysis centers, and long-term-care facilities). IPPs must therefore devise strategies that accurately capture HAIs in both inpatient and outpatient settings (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0003">3</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0025s000000p0003">Approximately 5 to 10% of patients admitted to acute-care hospitals acquire an infection during hospitalization (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0004">4</link>). In a recent point prevalence survey of U.S. hospitals, the most common HAI types were pneumonia, gastrointestinal infection (including <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> infection), and surgical site infection (SSI). They accounted for 25.7%, 21.3%, and 16.2% of all reported HAIs, respectively, while <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> was the most commonly reported pathogen (15.4%) (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0001">1</link>). Many HAIs are associated with medical devices (e.g., urinary tract catheters in catheter-associated urinary tract infections [CAUTI], endotracheal tubes in ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP], and central venous catheters in central line-associated bloodstream infections [CLABSI]). For these types of infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends calculating HAI rates using device-days as the denominator as a way to adjust for risk when comparing rates over time or between similar units in different facilities. <anchor id="ch0025s000000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0025s000000a0008">Table 1</link> provides definitions for commonly used epidemiology terms.</para>

Among the bacterial causes of HAI, a specific group of pathogens has raised concerns due to their frequency and propensity for antibiotic resistance. Known as the ESKAPE pathogens (<emphasis>Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</emphasis>-<emphasis>A. baumannii</emphasis> complex, <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Enterobacter</emphasis> spp.), they are responsible for over 70% of HAIs in intensive care settings (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0006">6</link>–<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0011">11</link>). The pathogens that are currently of greatest concern are multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods (MDR-GNRs). These include extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-and carbapenemase-producing <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> and multidrug-resistant non-glucose fermenters such as <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> and <emphasis>A. calcoaceticus</emphasis>-<emphasis>A. baumannii</emphasis> complex (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0012">12</link>). Rapid and accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are key to supporting patient care and infection prevention efforts. It is also important to observe that the spectrum and distribution of organisms causing HAIs have been changing continuously (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0006">6</link>). From the 1970s through 2000, health care-associated pathogens shifted from Gram-negative to Gram-positive organisms, and <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. emerged as a major problem (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0007">7</link>). The incidence of HAIs involving staphylococci and enterococci increased as these organisms became increasingly resistant to antibiotics (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0008">8</link>). More recently, MDR-GNRs have become increasingly prevalent (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0009">9</link>–<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0011">11</link>). For example, a CDC report that drew data from 890 U.S. hospitals reported that while carbapenem resistance has stabilized, the incidence of HAIs involving ESBL-producing <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> increased significantly between 2012 and 2017 (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0012">12</link>). Finally, the multidrug-resistant fungus <emphasis>Candida auris</emphasis> emerged in 2009 and was implicated in numerous hospital outbreaks (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0013">13</link>).</para>

Because patients with the most severe underlying illnesses are also the most vulnerable to HAIs, it is very difficult to estimate the proportion of crude mortality that is directly attributable to HAIs. Studies that adjust for confounding variables are called attributable-mortality studies. Estimates of the attributable mortality associated with health care-associated bloodstream infections are 14% for infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0014">14</link>); 31% and 37% for infections caused by vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), respectively (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0016">16</link>); and 38 to 49% for infections caused by <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0018">18</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0006">HAIs also increase hospital costs and length of stay. A 2009 CDC report estimated the annual direct medical costs of HAIs to U.S. hospitals to be between $28.4 and $33.8 billion (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0019">19</link>). A 2013 meta-analysis reported that CLABSI are the costliest HAIs in U.S. hospitals, costing over $45,814 per case. This was followed by VAP ($40,144), SSI ($20,785), <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection (CDI; $11,285), and CAUTI ($896) (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0020">20</link>).

      <para id="ch0025s000000p0007">Fortunately, many HAIs are preventable. The Study of the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) showed that the presence of an active IPP reduces HAIs by 32%, while the absence of such a program increases HAI rates by 18% (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0021">21</link>). Moreover, during the 1990s, the CDC National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system reported a reduction in risk-adjusted infection rates in intensive care units (ICUs) for all monitored infection types (CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAP). The elements that were critical for reducing HAI rates were targeted surveillance in high-risk populations (using standardized definitions), adequate staffing of IPPs with trained infection preventionists (IPs), and prevention efforts designed to address issues identified during evaluation of infection rates (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0022">22</link>). More recently, hospitals using evidence-based prevention strategies (or “bundles”) reported significant reductions in device-associated HAIs (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0024">24</link>). For example, a collaborative study involving over 100 ICUs in Michigan demonstrated a two-thirds reduction in CLABSI rates following implementation of a CLABSI prevention bundle, with a reduction to zero in the median monthly CLABSI rate among participating ICUs (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0024">24</link>). Widespread use of bundled interventions may drive continued reductions in HAI rates reported by the CDC (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0025">25</link>).</para>

The most complete and accurate surveillance program would involve an IP reviewing the charts of all hospitalized patients daily, but this approach would be impractical in most hospital settings. IPPs should therefore focus their resources on the highest-risk areas (e.g., intensive care, hematology-oncology, burn, and organ transplant wards) and use screening techniques to optimize case detection. IPs can use a variety of data sources (e.g., microbiology reports, nursing care plans, antibiotic orders, radiology reports, vital signs, and discharge diagnoses) to determine which patient records should be further reviewed.</para>

        <para id="ch0025s000000p0015">Microbiology laboratory results are a particularly important source of data for surveillance, as it is estimated that more than 80% of HAIs can be identified through review of positive cultures (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0028">28</link>). Increasingly, IPPs have implemented electronic surveillance systems that interface directly with the laboratory information system (LIS) or electronic health record to improve the scope and efficiency of its surveillance activities. Such systems allow IP teams to monitor laboratory results in real time. In an effort to reduce subjectivity and facilitate electronic reporting, mandatory reporting definitions have been increasingly reliant on objective data (e.g., laboratory test results) with less emphasis on subjective clinical data (e.g., signs and symptoms). As an example, the CDC’s NHSN now includes metrics for “LabID Events” that track health care-associated methicillin-resistant <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> (MRSA) and <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> directly from laboratory results and do not include clinical criteria (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0033">33</link>).

This trend has important implications for surveillance and the role of the CML (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0035">35</link>). If interhospital comparisons of HAI rates are to have any meaning, all hospitals must use methods with similar performance characteristics, and HAI definitions must be as objective as possible so that they are not susceptible to “gaming” (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0029">29</link>).

In addition, there have been reports of CMLs experiencing pressure to change diagnostic approaches with the goal of reducing HAI rates (even at the expense of test performance). Examples include CML directors being asked to adopt less-sensitive diagnostic methods for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> detection to reduce reportable CDI cases or to accept policies to culture urine from all new admissions in an attempt to demonstrate that positive findings were “present on admission” (i.e., not an HAI) (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0035">35</link>). The CDC and CMS have taken the position that “depart[ing] from standard diagnostic practices to avoid reporting infections to NHSN” can “put patients at risk,” leading to “use of antibiotics that is not necessary, such as treatment for bacterial colonization rather than infection, or antibiotic treatment that is not informed by culture results” (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0037">37</link>). In summary, although public disclosure and pay-for-performance programs based on HAI rates have raised hospital-level interest in HAI reduction, we need to ensure that HAI reduction initiatives improve, rather than hinder, efforts to prevent HAIs (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0035">35</link>–<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0038">38</link>).</para>

The obvious implication was that health care workers do not routinely adhere to best practices of care. For this reason, IPs must perform surveillance not only for important outcomes (HAIs) but also for important processes (e.g., rates of hand hygiene performance and use of maximal sterile barriers during central venous catheter placement).

However, reductions in analytical turnaround time are helpful only if they are linked to rapid incorporation of the information into antimicrobial management decisions. An active ASP using a computerized decision support system can streamline this process by automatically alerting the stewardship team when restricted antibiotics are ordered, indicating where the patient resides, listing other medications the patient is receiving, and showing pertinent CML results (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0048">48</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0049">49</link>). Other useful alerts include notification if a patient is receiving double antimicrobial coverage or no antimicrobial coverage for an identified pathogen and identification of potential candidates for a switch from intravenous to oral therapy or for discontinuation of therapy when cultures fail to detect a potential pathogen. One ASP projected that a decision support system saved the institution over $600,000 annually compared to the ASP without the decision support system (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0049">49</link>).

Monitoring of blood culture contamination rates and inoculation volumes is important for ensuring satisfactory specimen quality in blood cultures.</para>

      <para id="ch0025s000000p0024">The accuracy and precision of the organism identification systems used in a hospital laboratory have important implications for HAI control efforts. Infection prevention involves maintaining constant vigilance for any evidence of organism transmission between patients or from other sources (environment and personnel) to patients (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0034">34</link>). Most commonly, this involves looking for increases in frequency in tests reporting organisms above a baseline rate. The ability to detect such events is enhanced by organism identification to the species level. Laboratories that have the means to identify HAI pathogens accurately to the species level may detect outbreaks that would have otherwise gone undetected. In contrast, incomplete or incorrect identification of organisms may obscure problem areas.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0025">Recently, the shift of organism identification to proteomic approaches (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry [MALDI-TOF MS]) from biochemical methods has greatly enhanced the ability of many laboratories to identify organisms accurately to the species level. However, the introduction of MALDI-TOF MS has had some interesting and unintended consequences for IPP activities. First, some species that were previously lumped into large categories (e.g., “diphtheroids”) can now be accurately and reliably identified (e.g.,<emphasis>Brevibacterium casei, Dermabacter hominis</emphasis>). These unfamiliar names can confuse IPPs, particularly when determining if patients with positive blood cultures meet NHSN CLABSI criteria. The NHSN has made efforts to update their commensal-organism list in an effort to help IPPs to distinguish contaminants from pathogens when applying these criteria (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0053">53</link>). Thus, the laboratory and IPP personnel should consider options that limit confusion, including, in some cases, reporting not only the precise species-level name but also the species “group” or complex that aligns with the more familiar categories to which clinicians and IPs have become accustomed.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0026">A key task of the IPP is to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (MRSA, VRE, MDR-GNR, and<emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>), and the CDC has published a comprehensive guideline to assist in this effort (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0054">54</link>). However, the success of any program to control MDROs depends on the ability of the laboratory to detect these organisms. Laboratory directors must keep current with literature documenting the ability of existing antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) systems to detect emerging resistance mechanisms and must be prepared to implement, if necessary, additional methods when existing systems fall short. For example, automated systems did not perform well in the detection of vancomycin resistance in staphylococci and carbapenem resistance in <emphasis>Klebsiella</emphasis> when these phenotypes first emerged (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0055">55</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0056">56</link>), necessitating the use of additional confirmatory test methods. Laboratory directors should be aware that various organizations, including the CLSI, the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the CDC, publish and regularly update guidance on best practices for MDRO testing (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0057">57</link>–<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0059">59</link>). If the laboratory uses methods that do not accurately identify organisms or particular resistance patterns, the IPP may not identify serious problems or even outbreaks. Conversely, IPs may investigate spurious problems, thereby diverting and wasting precious resources.</para>

This communication can occur via phone call, e-mail, or fax. As previously stated, electronic surveillance systems now allow IPPs to monitor laboratory results in real time. For some test results, laboratory personnel should communicate directly with the IPP to ensure that appropriate control measures are implemented swiftly. Examples of organisms requiring immediate notification of the IPP include<emphasis>Neisseria meningitidis, Legionella</emphasis>, acid-fast bacilli, and emerging MDROs such as carbapenem-resistant <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>. In addition, unusual pathogens or potential agents of bioterrorism (e.g., <emphasis>Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis</emphasis>, and orthopox viruses) should be reported immediately to the IPP and any applicable state or local authorities. The organisms requiring immediate notification may vary from one institution to another. For example, an MDRO may have become endemic in one hospital, to the point that the IPP no longer requires immediate notification. State and local reporting mechanisms may also vary and include electronic options.</para>

      <para id="ch0025s000000p0028">Most HAIs are not associated with outbreaks; they are endemic rather than epidemic infections. However, when the IPP team detects a cluster or outbreak of HAIs, they must act promptly to identify the etiologic agent if it is not known, define the extent of the outbreak, determine the mode of transmission of the pathogen, and implement appropriate control measures. The CML must provide appropriate laboratory support during this time.<anchor id="ch0025s000000a0042"/><link linkend="ch0025s000000a0044">Table 5</link> outlines the recommended steps in an outbreak investigation and role of the CML at each step.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0029">Outbreak investigations can be facilitated if the IPP prepares in advance. One step in this process is to identify the most common types of outbreaks that have occurred in the hospital (e.g.,<emphasis>S</emphasis>. <emphasis>aureus</emphasis> wound infections in the surgical ICU or legionellosis on the renal service). Laboratory and IPP personnel can then determine what resources (e.g., personnel, time, money, materials, space, or special tests) would be required to investigate a “typical” outbreak. Laboratory and IPP staff should also anticipate the extra costs associated with outbreak investigations so they can work with hospital administration to include funds for those efforts in annual budgets.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0030">Outbreaks are often detected retrospectively, either after resolution or when they are already beginning to wane. Therefore, a major challenge for the CML is detecting outbreaks early enough to allow effective intervention. Computer decision support may assist in identifying clusters of infections with the same organisms that occur at the same time in the same patient care area (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0061">61</link>), but outbreaks are often first detected by an observant laboratorian at the bench. Thus, effective and regular communication between laboratory personnel and the IPP staff is essential to this effort. Given the stress inherent in an outbreak investigation and the speed with which important decisions must be made, the IPP team, including laboratory personnel, may need to communicate daily to discuss new findings and make decisions.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0031">Some problems and potential pitfalls of outbreak investigation are pertinent to the CML and bear specific mention. Foremost among these is the problem of determining when to proceed with an outbreak investigation in the first place. The number of cases necessary to constitute an outbreak depends on the organism, the patient population, and the institution involved. For example, while numerous cases of<emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis> urinary tract infection in a long-term-care facility may not constitute an outbreak, even a single health care-associated case of group A streptococcal surgical wound infection or vancomycin-resistant <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> infection merits an outbreak investigation. A second important problem is that of a pseudo-outbreak. A pseudo-outbreak has occurred when an apparent outbreak turns out not to be an outbreak after all. The usual cause of a pseudo-outbreak is either misdiagnosis (e.g., infection has not actually occurred) or misinterpretation of epidemiologic data (e.g., infections have occurred, but clustering or epidemic transmission has not). The CML can also be the source of pseudo-outbreaks (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0062">62</link>–<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0069">69</link>). Problems in the CML that can lead to pseudo-outbreaks include contamination of reagents for stains (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0064">64</link>), false AST results (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0063">63</link>), and contamination of culture specimens from construction or renovation projects (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0066">66</link>) or cross-contamination during specimen processing (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0069">69</link>). Careful attention to quality control, sterile technique during specimen processing, and preventive measures during construction and renovation projects can decrease the likelihood of pseudo-outbreaks originating in the CML.</para>

      <para id="ch0025s000000p0032">There are several circumstances in which it is important to determine if two or more organisms are genetically related and thus likely to have a common source. These circumstances include (i) outbreaks, clusters, and other transmission investigations, where evidence for patient-to-patient transmission or a common reservoir of infection is sought, (ii) determination of the pathogenesis or origin of an individual infection (e.g., comparison of an infecting isolate to strains previously found as colonizers of the patient or environment), and (iii) surveillance for emergence or spread of a particularly virulent or epidemic clone (e.g., USA300 MRSA and the BI/NAP1 strain of<emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>). In many situations, species identification and AST results may provide evidence for (or against) an epidemiological link. However, because many organisms have predictable resistance patterns, AST patterns are not discriminatory enough, and additional tests are required to determine whether the isolates are truly related. Generally, genotypic or DNA-based typing methods have replaced phenotypic typing methods (e.g., AST, biochemical profiles, and bacteriophage susceptibility patterns), as they offer superior ability to discriminate between unrelated strains. Given the dramatic reduction in cost and time needed to sequence a bacterial or viral genome, whole-genome sequencing has become the gold standard for molecular typing of health care-associated bacterial pathogens (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0070">70</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0033">The ideal genotypic typing system should be standardized, reproducible, stable, sensitive, broadly applicable, readily available, and inexpensive. The typing method should also have proven value in previous epidemiologic investigations. Further discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of the many available typing systems is beyond the scope of this chapter and is summarized in<ulink url="ch0027#ch0027s0001">chapter 12</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>.</para>

Infection prevention and CML personnel should decide which isolates should be banked and how long they should be stored based on their epidemiological importance and the available resources. We recommend that all isolates from normally sterile sites (e.g., blood and cerebrospinal fluid), important or emerging MDROs (e.g., carbapenem-resistant <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>) from any site, and other epidemiologically important pathogens (e.g., <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis>) be saved for a period of 3 to 5 years.</para>

      <para id="ch0025s000000p0035">The CML is often called upon to detect potential pathogens that may colonize patients, health care workers, and the hospital environment. For example, several U.S. states (as well as the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care system) have mandated the routine use of MRSA “active surveillance and isolation” (using culture or molecular methods to identify patients that are MRSA colonized but not clinically infected, to place them in contact isolation), a process that remains controversial (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0071">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0072">72</link>). As more extensive experience with MRSA active surveillance accumulates, there is also interest in determining how best to apply active surveillance to prevent the transmission of other MDROs, including VRE, MDR-GNRs such as carbapenem-resistant <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>, and even <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0073">73</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0036">A major reason for careful consideration before launching into large-scale active surveillance efforts is that such measures are complex and resource intensive. Indeed, the prospect of performing active surveillance cultures for a large number of diverse MDROs (which requires that culture samples be obtained from several anatomic sites of each patient) will inevitably threaten to overwhelm the resources of most CMLs, IPPs, and hospital units. In addition, recent data suggest that the so-called horizontal infection prevention approaches (approaches that target all infection types and are applied to an entire population, such as hand hygiene) are preferred over a focus on “vertical” approaches (those that target a specific pathogen, such as MRSA) (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0074">74</link>). For example, a recent cluster-randomized trial demonstrated that universal decolonization of all ICU patients was more effective than active surveillance in reducing rates of bloodstream infection and positive MRSA clinical cultures (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0074">74</link>). Similarly, a large (13-ICU) European study found that “active surveillance and isolation” for MRSA, VRE, and MDR-GNR did not reduce acquisition of these MDROs when implemented in the context of improved hand hygiene and chlorhexidine bathing (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0075">75</link>). In our view, active surveillance culturing for MDROs should be limited to new introduction of problematic pathogens, continued transmission of an MDRO despite implementation of standard and enhanced infection prevention practices, or outbreak settings. In these settings, active surveillance should always be seen as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, well-established horizontal infection prevention practices (e.g., hand hygiene, chlorhexidine bathing, and bundled practices for prevention of device-associated infection). In addition, the costs of any active surveillance program should be borne by the hospital, since the testing is done to guide infection prevention efforts, not to inform patient treatment.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0037">Health care workers are also occasionally screened for carriage of epidemiologically significant organisms like MRSA as part of an outbreak response. Screening for other organisms (e.g.,<emphasis>Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis>) may also be performed as part of an HAI or outbreak investigation. Infection prevention and CML personnel should weigh two important factors before deciding to culture samples from hospital personnel during an outbreak investigation: (i) finding the outbreak strain on the hands or in the nares of a health care worker does not establish the direction of transmission or definitively implicate the health care worker as the source or reservoir for the outbreak, and (ii) culturing samples from hospital personnel indiscriminately can lead to confusing results and can generate ill will toward the IPP. In general, only samples from health care workers who are epidemiologically linked to cases should be cultured (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0053">53</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0025s000000p0038">For some organisms (e.g., MRSA), screening methods are standardized and well established, while for others (e.g., MDR-GNRs), such methods are evolving as more complex resistance phenotypes emerge (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0077">77</link>). <anchor id="ch0025s000000a0051"/><link linkend="ch0025s000000a0055">Table 6</link> outlines current approaches to screening patients and health care workers for organisms of epidemiologic significance.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0039">At one time, the hospital environment was felt to be the major source of HAI pathogens. Since then, it has been recognized that patients usually acquire infection from their own colonizing flora (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0082">82</link>). Nonetheless, the hospital environment can serve as a source of this colonizing flora, which is transmitted to patients on the clothing and hands of health care personnel (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0083">83</link>). Thus, there are specific circumstances in which environmental sampling for quality assurance or for detection of potential pathogens is necessary. Routine sampling for quality assurance should be limited to biologic monitoring of sterilization processes and monthly cultures of water and dialysate for hemodialysis. Rarely, it may be useful to perform a short-term evaluation of the effectiveness of hospital cleaning and disinfection (for example, sampling surfaces for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> after terminal room cleaning to evaluate the effectiveness of cleaning practices). Likewise, sampling the hospital potable water for <emphasis>Legionella</emphasis> spp. is indicated after diagnosis of a health care-associated legionellosis case or as part of a comprehensive program to decrease the risk of health care-associated legionellosis (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0082">82</link>, <link linkend="ch0025s000000li0084">84</link>–<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0086">86</link>). Air sampling for mold spores can be an important step in identifying the source of fungal disease transmission in highly immunocompromised patients. Rarely, sampling of other inanimate objects or surfaces may be indicated if such objects or surfaces are implicated in pathogen transmission. <anchor id="ch0025s000000a0052"/><link linkend="ch0025s000000a0068">Table 7</link> outlines current approaches to screening the hospital environment for organisms of epidemiologic significance. Importantly, the CML should not routinely process environmental samples—this testing should be performed by a reputable and appropriately certified environmental testing laboratory.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0040">As a general rule, routine, undirected cultures of samples from health care workers or the hospital environment should not be performed, because such cultures are labor intensive, lack standardization, and rarely provide useful information (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0082">82</link>). Except as previously outlined, such sampling should only be done as part of an epidemiologic investigation in consultation with the hospital epidemiologist. When an epidemiologic investigation reveals a common organism in patient and/or environmental samples, the CML should also provide access to epidemiologic typing methods, as previously discussed.</para>

      <para id="ch0025s000000p0042">It is important to note, however, that provision of SARS-CoV-2 test results was only one aspect of the CML’s contribution to a hospital’s efforts to function in this pandemic. Due to severe supply chain shortages limiting availability of swabs, viral transport media, testing kits, reagents, and instruments; many hospitals were compelled to triage patients for testing (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0090">90</link>). Daily communication about testing capacity with the IPP and other stakeholders was necessary at many institutions to ensure that the most critical cases were identified and prioritized for testing. Supply chain limitations also forced some CMLs to validate SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using unconventional specimens (e.g., saliva), swabs (e.g., 3D printed), transport media (e.g., saline or phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]), and procedures (e.g., specimen pooling, heat extraction, or extraction-free testing) (<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0091">91</link>–<link linkend="ch0025s000000li0096">96</link>). The CML needed to collaborate closely with IPP personnel and other stakeholders when altering existing testing procedures to ensure that they understood the rationale for the temporary change and its implications for test performance, turnaround time, and interpretation of results.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0043">Next, the CML has played a key role as a liaison with reference laboratories. Early in the pandemic, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced an emergent public health need for<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic tests that detect SARS-CoV-2. At the time, the secretary’s announcement effectively required CMLs to either submit a request for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for their own SARS-CoV-2 assay or send specimens to another laboratory that offered a test with an EUA. Many CMLs therefore depended heavily on commercial laboratories for testing while waiting for availability of kits under EUA from their usual vendors. As vendors of molecular microbiology tests obtained EUAs for their SARS-CoV-2 assays, CMLs were then able to implement testing in-house. Later in the pandemic, CMLs continued to serve in this liaison role in a number of ways. First, most molecular SARS-CoV-2 assays that are currently used in hospital-based CMLs were granted EUA based on sampling of the upper respiratory tract (e.g., nasopharyngeal/anterior nares/oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal wash, nasal wash, or saliva). Many CMLs therefore send lower respiratory tract samples for molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing to reference or commercial laboratories that have validated their SARS-CoV-2 assays on a wider range of specimen types. Also, with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, there has been increasing demand for whole-genome sequencing in patients who have a history of travel, vaccination, or documented previous infection. Many CMLs have collaborated with state and local public health laboratories to screen a subset of positive specimens for population-level surveillance.</para>
      <para id="ch0025s000000p0044">Finally, as the pandemic progressed, CML leaders have served as advisors to IPPs, health care providers, and hospital leaders regarding a wide range of testing issues: the comparative performance of different molecular SARS-CoV-2 platforms, sensitivity of different specimen types, the impact of the timing of testing on molecular SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity, and the pros and cons of other testing modalities that emerged as the pandemic progressed (e.g., molecular tests, antigen-based tests, viral typing, and serologic testing).</para>

        <para id="ch0025s000000p0045">The CML is an essential element of the IPP in every health care facility, playing critical roles in surveillance, outbreak detection and management, pandemic management, antimicrobial stewardship, risk assessment and planning, and education. The development and application of new technologies in the CML can greatly enhance infection prevention efforts. Close collaboration between CML and personnel from infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship programs is required to ensure optimal HAI prevention, which saves money and lives.</para>
