      <para id="ch0172s0000p0002">Adult cestode tapeworms have a flattened body composed of the scolex, bearing the fixation organs such as suckers, hooks, and bothria; the neck, where the cellular reproduction occurs; and the strobila, formed by numerous segments called proglottids. Proglottids generate in the neck region and mature as they progress distally. The more distal proglottids are gravid and almost completely occupied by a uterus full of eggs. These eggs are passed in the stool of the carrier, either inside intact proglottids or free after the proglottids disintegrate. In some species, motile proglottids can actively migrate out of the anus. Adult tapeworms are hermaphroditic, and each proglottid contains male and female reproductive organs.</para>
      <para id="ch0172s0000p0003">Tapeworms live in the lumen of the small intestine, attached to the mucosa by the scolex. They absorb nutrients from the host’s intestine both at the scolex and the strobila by using a specialized tegument (<anchor id="ch0172s0000a0002"/><link linkend="ch0172s0000a0008">Fig. 1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0172s0000p0004">There are four common tapeworms that inhabit the human intestine:<emphasis>Dibothriocephalus/Adenocephalus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Taenia saginata, Taenia solium</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Hymenolepis nana.</emphasis> They differ widely in size, with <emphasis>Dibothriocephalus latus</emphasis> measuring up to 12 meters and <emphasis>H. nana</emphasis> measuring up to 3 cm. Other important differences include intermediate host range and transmission forms (<anchor id="ch0172s0000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0172s0000a0012">Table 1</link>). <emphasis>Dipylidium caninum</emphasis> and <emphasis>Hymenolepis diminuta</emphasis> are uncommon tapeworms that can also inhabit the human gut; these parasites are reviewed in <ulink url="ch0174#ch0174s0001">chapter 151</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis> In addition, a number of cestode larvae can produce human disease after infective tapeworm eggs are ingested, mainly cysticercosis (<emphasis>T. solium</emphasis>), cystic echinococcosis (<emphasis>Echinococcus granulosus</emphasis>), and alveolar echinococcosis (<emphasis>Echinococcus multilocularis</emphasis>). Uncommon larval cestode infections include coenurosis (<emphasis>Taenia multiceps</emphasis>), sparganosis (<emphasis>Spirometra mansonoides</emphasis>), and cysticercosis (<emphasis>Taenia crassiceps</emphasis>). Tapeworms, and especially tapeworm larval infections, represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality in underdeveloped and industrialized countries, particularly in rural areas and among immigrants from areas of endemicity.</para>

Fixatives could be 10% formalin, acetic acid-formaldehyde-alcohol, or sodium acetate-acetic acid-formaldehyde. Fixed pieces can be stained by injecting Semichon’s carmine or India ink.

Porcine cysticercosis is a serious economic problem for farmers in developing countries. However, the most serious consequences of the infection are associated with human cysticercosis (<link linkend="ch0172s0000li0020">20</link>). Larval vesicles located in the human central nervous system (<anchor id="ch0172s0000a0071"/><link linkend="ch0172s0000a0073">Fig. 2</link>) cause seizures or other neurological symptoms. Indeed, neurocysticercosis is associated with a significant proportion of seizure cases in areas of endemicity (<link linkend="ch0172s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0172s0000li0036">36</link>). The clinical manifestations of neurocysticercosis are related to the number, size, and location of the cysticerci and to the severity of the host’s immune response to the parasites. Symptoms and signs are varied and nonspecific. Parasites in the brain parenchyma usually cause seizures and headache, whereas those located in the cerebral ventricles or in the subarachnoid space (“racemose” cysticercosis) cause intracranial hypertension and hydrocephalus. The diagnosis is made using brain imaging, either computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but these methods have different applications. CT has a lower cost (quite important for poor areas where the disease is endemic), is more widely available, and has better sensitivity for the detection of calcified parasites. Conversely, MRI has better sensitivity for small lesions, viable cysts, and subarachnoid and intraventricular parasites. Serology, when available, can aid in the diagnosis. The serologic assay of choice is an immunoblot using seven cysticercal antigens, with a 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity in patients with more than one lesion. In cases with a single lesion, the sensitivity decreases to approximately 70% (<link linkend="ch0172s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0172s0000li0026">26</link>). Antigen detection assays are available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and may be useful for treatment response evaluation, especially among patients with subarachnoid disease (<link linkend="ch0172s0000li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0172s0000li0037">37</link>). Treatment of neurocysticercosis uses antiparasitic agents (albendazole or praziquantel) for viable parasites, usually given with steroids to ameliorate the inflammation produced by the death of the cyst. The use of albendazole-praziquantel combinations increases treatment efficacy in individuals with multiple brain cysts (<link linkend="ch0172s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0172s0000li0039">39</link>).

      <para id="ch0172s0000p0067">The life cycle of<emphasis>E. granulosus</emphasis> includes dogs as the definitive host and herbivores (mainly sheep) as the intermediate host. Herbivores become infected with the larval stage, called hydatids, by ingesting eggs dispersed in the feces of tapeworm-infected dogs. Human cystic echinococcosis is an important cause of morbidity, requiring costly surgical and prolonged medical treatment. This cestodiasis is endemic to most of the Old World, particularly Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Lebanon, Turkey, South America, and Africa. Sporadic autochthonous transmission is currently recognized in Alaska and other states in the United States (<link linkend="ch0172s0000li0040">40</link>). The affected organs are most commonly the liver and lungs. Although uncommon, the heart, brain, bones, kidneys, and spleen may be affected. The diagnosis is made using ultrasound in solid organs and chest X-ray films in lung infections. CT scan of the abdomen or thorax may help characterize the cysts and potential complications (<link linkend="ch0172s0000a0073">Fig. 2</link>). Antibody detection by serology may aid in the diagnosis, with an overall sensitivity between 80 to 85%, but with variations depending on cyst location and integrity. Serology is more sensitive for hepatic than for pulmonary cysts and for complicated cysts than for uncomplicated ones. Treatment uses antiparasitic agents (albendazole or albendazole plus praziquantel) for small cysts or before surgery; PAIR (puncture, injection, aspiration, and reinjection), which is an ultrasound- or CT-guided aspiration and sterilization of the cyst cavity; or either laparoscopic or open surgery (<link linkend="ch0172s0000li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0172s0000li0042">42</link>).

      <para id="ch0172s0000p0068">The adult stage of<emphasis>E. multilocularis</emphasis> lives in the small intestine of the definitive host, commonly wild predators in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring in parts of Europe, Asia, Japan, and North America, including Alaska (<link linkend="ch0172s0000li0044">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0172s0000li0045">45</link>). The larval stages infect microtine rodents that usually serve as the common intermediate host. Human infections (causing alveolar hydatid disease) occur by accidental ingestion of the oncosphere by contamination with the feces of the definitive host. The manifestation of alveolar hydatid disease resembles a slowly developing “malignant tumor” of the liver, with subsequent invasion of the blood vessels and bile ducts and metastatic dissemination. The lesions vary in size and can produce minor foci up to large infiltrating structures in the host’s tissue. Thus, alveolar hydatid disease differs greatly in its pathology and clinical course from cystic hydatid disease. This disease often affects people aged over 50 years and is characterized by a chronic course lasting for months or years. Clinical manifestations relate to the extent of tumor-like lesions of the cyst. Besides physical examination, diagnosis usually is based on imaging techniques, including ultrasound, CT, and MRI, supported by serology. Treatment is mainly surgical. Chemotherapy with benzimidazole agents is restricted to residual, postsurgical, or inoperable lesions (<link linkend="ch0172s0000li0046">46</link>).</para>
