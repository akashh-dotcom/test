HAV has a primitive capsid related to picorna-like viruses (dicistroviruses), which infect insects (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0001">1</link>). HAV strains show little variation in nucleotide sequence over time or place. There are five closely related genotypes (I to V) but only one serotype (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0002">2</link>). Genotypes I to III, further divided into subgenotypes A and B, have been associated with infections in humans, while genotypes IV to V are simian in origin. Evolutionary ancestral forms have been found in small mammals, such as bats, rodents, hedgehogs, and shrews (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0003">3</link>).</para>

This family has two subfamilies (<emphasis>Orthohepevirinae</emphasis> and <emphasis>Parahepevirinae</emphasis>). Members of the subfamily <emphasis>Parahepevirinae</emphasis> infect the cutthroat trout. The subfamily <emphasis>Orthohepevirinae</emphasis> comprises four genera: <emphasis>Paslahepevirus</emphasis> infecting humans and several other mammals, <emphasis>Avihepevirus</emphasis> infecting chickens, <emphasis>Rocahepevirus</emphasis> infecting rats and ferrets, and <emphasis>Chirohepevirus</emphasis> infecting bats.

The species Paslahepevirus balayani consists of eight distinct HEV genotypes but only one serotype. Genotypes 1 and 2 infect humans exclusively and are seen in developing countries (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0006">6</link>). They are responsible for outbreaks. Genotypes 3 and 4 have an animal reservoir, mainly pigs, and infect humans in developed countries. HEV genotypes 3 and 4 have been detected in a large number of animals, such as domestic swine, wild boar, deer, rabbit, and mongoose (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0006">6</link>). HEV genotypes 5 and 6 have been detected in wild boars in Japan (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0007">7</link>) but not yet in humans.

      <para id="ch0113s000000p0004">HAV is a small RNA virus with an icosahedral capsid. There are two forms of fully infectious particles. One form of virion, first identified by Feinstone et al. (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0009">9</link>), is nonenveloped and is shed in feces. This form is approximately 27 nm in diameter and has a density of 1.22/cm<superscript>3</superscript> on iodixanol gradients. The second form, virions circulating in the blood, is cloaked in host cell membranes; the virions’ size is 50 to 110 nm, and their density is 1.08 g/cm<superscript>3</superscript> (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0010">10</link>). The protein composition of the HAV membrane has been determined by quantitative proteomics analysis (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0011">11</link>). While membrane envelopment protects HAV against neutralizing antibody, it also facilitates early but limited detection of HAV infection by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0012">12</link>). This may account for the minimal type I interferon response observed early in acute HAV infection (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0013">13</link>). HAV is resistant to low pH (&lt;3.0) and shows remarkable thermal stability. Cooking or boiling water and food at 85°C for at least 1 min is necessary to inactivate HAV (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0014">14</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0113s000000p0005">The HAV genome is a single-strand positive-sense RNA approximately 7.5 kb long (<anchor id="ch0113s000000a0007"/><link linkend="ch0113s000000a0010">Fig. 1</link>). It consists of an uncapped 5′ noncoding region including an internal ribosome entry site structure, a single long open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 2,227 amino acids with 3 segments (P1, P2, and P3), and a short 3′ noncoding region that ends in a poly(A) tail.</para>
      <para id="ch0113s000000p0006">The large polyprotein is cleaved into 10 mature proteins (<link linkend="ch0113s000000a0010">Fig. 1</link>). The P1 segment is processed into the four structural proteins of the viral capsid: VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. The largest of the capsid proteins, VP1, is 274 amino acid residues in length in nonenveloped HAV virions and has an 8-kDa carboxyterminal extension (pX [also known as 2A]; 71 residues in length) in enveloped HAV virions (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0010">10</link>). pX plays a critical role in capsid assembly and HAV envelopment but is cleaved from VP1 by a host proteinase upon loss of the membrane. VP2 contains a YPX3L late domain that binds Alix and vascular protein sorting 4 homolog B (VPS-4B) components of the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0010">10</link>). VP4, a small polypeptide lacking a terminal myristoylation signal required in the assembly process for the other picornaviruses, is essential for virion formation but is not present in the mature particles. The HAV capsid, composed of 12 pentamers, comprises 60 copies of each of the 3 major proteins—VP1, VP2, and VP3. The remainder of the polyprotein (P2 and P3 segments) is processed into nonstructural proteins required for HAV RNA replication: 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B (also known as VPg, which is covalently linked to the 5′ end of the HAV genome), 3C<superscript>pro</superscript> (a cysteine protease responsible for most posttranslational cleavages), and 3D<superscript>pol</superscript> (the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase).</para>

Genome organization of HAV and HEV. (A) HAV: The 5′ end of the RNA genome con-tains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and the 3′ end is polyadenylated. The HAV RNA genome contains a single ORF encoding a polyprotein that is processed by the viral protease 3Cpro (black trian-gles). (B) HEV: The 5′ end of the RNA genome is capped with 7-methylguanosine, and the 3′ end is polyadenylated. ORF1 encodes the nonstructural proteins, including a methyltransferase (MT), cysteine protease (P), polyproline region (PPR), macrodomain (X), helicase (Hel), and RNA polymerase (Pol). ORF2 and ORF3 encode the structural proteins from a bi-cistronic subgenomic RNA. ORF4 (genotype 1) interacts with eukaryotic elongation factor 1 isoform-1. NC, noncoding region.

HEV replicates in intestinal cells and reaches the liver as enveloped virions (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0016">16</link>). Nonenveloped virions, first identified by Balayan (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0017">17</link>), are found in the feces.

      <para id="ch0113s000000p0010">ORF1 encodes a nonstructural protein about 1,700 amino acids long that is involved in HEV RNA replication. This protein contains several functional domains: a methyltransferase/guanyltransferase, a cysteine protease, a macrodomain (X domain), an RNA helicase that has 5′-nucleoside triphosphatase activity, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0023">23</link>).

      <para id="ch0113s000000p0011">ORF2 encodes the 660-amino-acid virus capsid protein, which has been divided into three domains: shell (S), middle (M), and protruding (P) (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0113s000000li0032">32</link>). The P domain is the major target for neutralizing antibodies and contains a putative receptor binding domain. Capsid monomers self-assemble to form dimers and then the decamers that encapsulate the virus RNA. The capsid consists of 180 copies arranged as an icosahedron with T = 3 symmetry (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0033">33</link>). Immunological and structural studies of the capsid protein have contributed to the development of a hepatitis E vaccine (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0034">34</link>).

Most cases of transfusion transmitted HEV infection are asymptomatic, and only a small minority of recipients of infected blood products develop symptomatic hepatitis. The frequency of positive HEV RNA blood donors across many countries ranges from 1:600 to 1:14,799 (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0078">78</link>).

Persistent HEV shedding in stools at the end of therapy was associated with HEV relapse after the end of therapy (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0138">138</link>). Ribavirin therapy was also shown to be efficient for treating HEV infection in stem cell transplant patients (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0139">139</link>). It has been suggested that ribavirin inhibits HEV replication through the depletion of guanosine triphosphate pools (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0140">140</link>). Deep sequencing has identified several HEV RNA mutations, such as G1634R. Recent studies showed that ribavirin increases HEV heterogeneity, which seems to be reversible (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0141">141</link>–<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0144">144</link>). However, the role of HEV RNA variants and their impact on HEV treatment outcome are uncertain (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0141">141</link>, <link linkend="ch0113s000000li0142">142</link>). Pegylated interferon was also successfully used for treating HEV infection in liver transplant patients (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0145">145</link>, <link linkend="ch0113s000000li0146">146</link>). However, it cannot be used in other organ transplant patients because it increases the risk of acute rejection (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0147">147</link>). Finally, no alternative antiviral therapy to ribavirin or pegylated interferon is available. There are no robust data to recommend the use of ribavirin during the acute phase of HEV infection.</para>

      <para id="ch0113s000000p0127">Most enzyme immunoassays for anti-HEV IgM and IgG are commercially available in Europe and Asia in microplate formats (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0176">176</link>) (<link linkend="ch0113s000000a0061">Table 2</link>). Multiparametric automated instruments are in development (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0177">177</link>). Several immunochromatographic assays allowing rapid diagnosis are also available in different countries (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0178">178</link>, <link linkend="ch0113s000000li0179">179</link>). These point-of-care tests, which are easy to use and give a result within a few minutes, can be very useful in resource-limited countries. The antigens used are usually recombinant ORF2 and/or ORF3 proteins from HEV-1 strains. The diagnostic performance of these immunoassays varies considerably and must be evaluated carefully (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0176">176</link>, <link linkend="ch0113s000000li0180">180</link>). However, they can detect antibodies against all HEV genotypes.</para>
      <para id="ch0113s000000p0128">The presence of anti-HEV IgM in the serum is a key marker of an acute infection (<link linkend="ch0113s000000a0065">Fig. 3</link>). Using a validated PCR assay as a reference, studies showed that IgM immunoassays, including rapid tests, had sensitivities of &gt;97% for immunocompetent patients and 80 to 85% for immunosuppressed patients; their specificity was &gt;99.5 % (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0178">178</link>, <link linkend="ch0113s000000li0179">179</link>, <link linkend="ch0113s000000li0181">181</link>). Of note, longitudinal follow-up of patients with proven acute hepatitis E by nucleic acid testing showed a persistence of anti-HEV IgM for 6 to 12 months (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0097">97</link>). Several studies using different serum panels have compared the performance of IgM assays (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0180">180</link>). In one study, five IgM assays were compared using sera from immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals with a proven HEV infection (positive HEV RNA) (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0176">176</link>). Only 71% of the results from all the assays were concordant. In another study, there were also discrepancies when single samples of 10 seroconversion panels were assayed (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0182">182</link>). However, it is difficult to compare the findings of the different studies, because differences in assay performance may be related to different versions of the test employed (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0182">182</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0113s000000p0129">The presence of anti-HEV IgG alone is a marker of past infection (<link linkend="ch0113s000000a0065">Fig. 3</link>). Due to large differences in analytical sensitivity between IgG immunoassays, it is difficult to compare seroprevalence rates from different populations obtained by different laboratory methods. Using an international standard (WHO reference reagent established in 2002; National Institute for Biological Standards and Control [United Kingdom] code 95/584), the limits of detection of commercial anti-HEV IgG assays vary from 0.25 WHO unit/ml to 2.5 WHO units/ml. As highlighted in a meta-analysis of studies of HEV seroprevalence in Europe (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0183">183</link>), the most sensitive immunoassay (Wantai test) produced the highest estimates of anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence. Several studies showed that when populations initially screened with an insensitive “first-generation” IgG assay were retested, the seroprevalence rose by a factor ranging from 2 to 4 when a more sensitive validated assay was employed (91, 184–187). The determination of anti-HEV IgG concentration could be useful for estimating the risk of reinfection after a natural infection or vaccination (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0188">188</link>–<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0190">190</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0113s000000p0130">Regarding HAV infection, serologic tests for anti-HAV IgM are essential for identifying new cases and outbreaks. The increasing availability of molecular characterization techniques has made it possible to link apparently sporadic cases and to associate them with slowly evolving multinational outbreaks (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0113s000000li0191">191</link>). Hepatitis A is a reportable disease in Europe, the United States, Australia, and many other countries where patient contacts can be managed by hygienic measures and active or passive immunoprophylaxis. At a global level, optimal vaccination policies and recommendations are based on the prevalence of anti-HAV IgG.</para>
        <para id="ch0113s000000p0131">Regarding HEV infection, the recent availability of high-performance serologic and molecular tools allowed a significant change in the understanding of global epidemiology (endemicity in many industrialized countries due to zoonotic transmission) and pathology (chronic hepatitis E and neurological manifestations) (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0192">192</link>). The good performance of the most recent anti-HEV IgM assays makes them suitable for routine diagnosis. However, HEV RNA testing is necessary in immunocompromised patients because the humoral immune response is frequently impaired in this population. HEV RNA testing is also necessary for identifying chronic infection when the HEV RNA persists for 3 to 6 months and for monitoring interventions based on the reduction of immunosuppression or antiviral therapy (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0192">192</link>). Surveillance systems are in place in most European countries where infections are predominantly caused by HEV genotype 3, the most prevalent virus genotype in the animal reservoirs (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0193">193</link>). However, the surveillance strategies and algorithms are quite heterogeneous. Surveillance through reference laboratories exists in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Spain. Hepatitis E is a reportable disease in several countries. Last, the recognition of transfusion-transmitted HEV has led to estimations of the recipient risk and the definition of optimal strategies for improving blood safety in several developed countries (<link linkend="ch0113s000000li0079">79</link>).</para>
