      <para id="ch0156s0001p0002">Invasive fungal infections cause extensive morbidity and mortality, and 1.5 million cases occur worldwide each year with mortality rates as high as 30 to 80% across infection types (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0001">1</link>). The most serious fungal infections occur as a consequence of other serious health problems such as asthma, AIDS, cancer, organ transplantation, diabetes, and corticosteroid therapies (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0002">2</link>). All require specialized testing for diagnosis and antifungal therapy. More than 90% of all reported fungal-related deaths result from species that belong to one of three genera: <emphasis>Cryptococcus, Candida</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0002">2</link>). Failure to treat effectively often leads to death, serious chronic illness, or blindness. The global importance of fungal infections has led to expanded use of antifungal agents for treatment and prevention. Unfortunately, treatment options for invasive fungal infections are limited, as there are few chemical classes represented by existing antifungal drugs. In recent years, new promising drug classes have emerged against novel targets, but most are still in clinical stage development (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0003">3</link>). Classes of registered antifungal drugs include azoles, echinocandins, polyenes, flucytosine, and an enfumafungin. The azoles (e.g., fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole) target ergosterol biosynthesis. Like cholesterol in mammalian cells, ergosterol is the major sterol in fungal plasma membrane. The polyenes amphotericin B and nystatin bind ergosterol in the plasma membrane, where they form large pores that disrupt cell function. Flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine) inhibits pyrimidine metabolism and DNA synthesis. Finally, the echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin) and enfumafungin (ibrexafungerp) are cell wall-active agents that inhibit the biosynthesis of β-1,3-glucan, a major component of the fungal cell wall. The expanding use of antifungal agents has led to rising drug resistance among susceptible fungal species, which negatively impacts patient management. A greater understanding of biological factors contributing to mechanism-specific resistance is critical to the field of medical mycology. The epidemiologic, biological, and molecular nature of antifungal drug resistance is the topic of this chapter.</para>

        <para id="ch0156s0001s0001p0001">The development of antifungal resistance is complex and relies on multiple host and microbial factors. A discussion of drug resistance must distinguish between multifaceted clinical resistance and microbial resistance to antifungal agents.</para>
        <para id="ch0156s0001s0001p0002">“Clinical resistance” refers to therapeutic failure, where a patient responds poorly or not at all to an antifungal drug following administration at a standard dose. A variety of host, drug, pharmacological, and microbial factors contribute to therapeutic failure. A major factor is the immune status of the host. Antifungal drug action and the host immune system often must work synergistically to control and clear an infection. Patients with severe immune dysfunction are more refractory to treatment, as the antifungal drug must combat the infection without the positive benefit of the immune response. The presence of indwelling catheters, artificial heart valves, and other surgical devices contributes to refractory infections, as the infecting fungus attaches to these objects, creating resilient biofilms that resist drug therapy. The site of the infection also contributes to clinical resistance, as appropriate therapy requires that a drug reach its microbial target at a suitable concentration to inhibit growth or kill the organism. Yet, we still do not have a good understanding of drug penetration at the site of infection or within host reservoirs, with the result that some microorganisms are exposed to drug at suboptimal levels. Finally, patient compliance with prescribed drug regimens is critical for effective treatment, as poor adherence reduces drug effectiveness, contributing to development of persistent and drug tolerant cell populations.</para>
        <para id="ch0156s0001s0001p0003">“Microbiological resistance” refers to decreased susceptibility of a fungal strain to an antifungal agent, which is reflected in standardized antifungal<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> susceptibility testing relative to susceptible standard reference strains, as defined by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Susceptibility testing provides a measure of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or minimum effective concentration (MEC), and resistance breakpoints (Bp) refer to those drug concentrations that distinguish strains with which there is a high likelihood of treatment success from those organisms where treatment is more likely to fail (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0004">4</link>). The Bp values represent threshold levels of <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> MIC (or MEC) that are derived from extensive evaluation of pharmacodynamic responses in animal models of infection, mechanism-specific resistance, and clinical response (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0005">5</link>). In some cases, it is not possible to assign breakpoints; instead, epidemiologic cutoff values (ECOFFs or ECVs) are established which define the upper limit of the susceptible wild-type population of infecting organisms (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0006">6</link>). They provide guidance about the likelihood that an organism will be drug susceptible. As some fungi can rapidly develop and express drug tolerance mechanisms, interpreting the results of <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> antifungal susceptibility testing can be problematic, as MICs above the breakpoint do not always directly correlate with <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> response to antifungal therapy (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0003">3</link>). Microbiologic resistance can be primary (intrinsic) or secondary (acquired). Primary resistance is found naturally among certain fungi without prior drug exposure; although it typically involves mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance, it may also reflect unknown mechanisms.</para>

      <para id="ch0156s0002p0001">Antimicrobial agents are generally developed for efficacy against the most prominent yeast and mould pathogens causing disease (e.g.,<emphasis>Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus</emphasis>). Universal broad-spectrum activity (e.g., panfungal), while desirable, is rarely achieved, and there will always be a subset of species or naturally occurring variants of mostly susceptible species that are inherently resistant. Presently, there are more than 200 species of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis>, and while less than 40 are known to cause human infections (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0007">7</link>), there is great genetic diversity that can impact drug action. The extended application of antifungal agents against a wide spectrum of mycoses can result in the selection of naturally occurring species with inherent resistance (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0008">8</link>). The overall selection of resistant species or subspecies, or less susceptible variants of susceptible species, from environmental or patient reservoirs typically occurs uncommonly (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0009">9</link>), although in recent years some notable yeast and mould exceptions have emerged (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0011">11</link>).

      <para id="ch0156s0003p0001">The azole antifungal agents are the most prominent example of drug selection for less susceptible species (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0012">12</link>). Numerous global epidemiological studies have documented the impact of widespread triazole use on the distribution and shift of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species toward less susceptible strains like <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> and <emphasis>Candida krusei.</emphasis> In many regions where azole use is prevalent, there has been a shift away from <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> as the predominant cause of invasive infections toward less susceptible non-<emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> species (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0013">13</link>). <emphasis>Candida glabrata</emphasis>, which can rapidly acquire resistance to fluconazole and other azoles, is the species whose incidence has increased the most in the past decade (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0013">13</link>). Similarly, fluconazole use is linked to emergence of the intrinsically resistant <emphasis>C. krusei</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0014">14</link>), as well as <emphasis>Candida guilliermondii</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0015">15</link>). More recently, <emphasis>Candida auris</emphasis> has emerged as an important multidrug-resistant species with resistance to azoles, polyenes, and echinocandins (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0016">16</link>). In many cases, inherent resistance to fluconazole confers cross-resistance to more highly active triazoles like voriconazole. This is not true for <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> and other moulds that are inherently resistant to fluconazole but susceptible to more highly active triazoles. Yet, breakthrough infections against triazole drugs have been reported for <emphasis>Aspergillus ustus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0017">17</link>) and <emphasis>Aspergillus lentulus</emphasis>, which show pleiotropic resistance to multiple antifungals (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0018">18</link>). Sometimes a susceptible species develops a prevalent variant that is the source of resistant infections. In the bacterial world, the spread of drug-resistant strains from a common progenitor is commonly observed. Such transmission is not typically observed with drug-resistant fungi. Notable exceptions include <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0016">16</link>) and environmentally derived strains of azole-resistant <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0019">19</link>), which spread locally and globally (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0020">20</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0156s0006p0001">The widespread use of antifungal drugs has resulted in both monoresistance and multidrug resistance (MDR) among prominent invasive yeasts (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0033">33</link>). <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> is a recently emerging multidrug-resistant health care-related pathogen found in health care settings that causes both topical and invasive fungal disease (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0011">11</link>) with a reported crude mortality rate of 45% (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0034">34</link>). As many as 25% of strains exhibit multidrug resistance to the currently available antifungal drugs. This ability to overcome fitness defects, often associated with multidrug resistance, may be a product of robust stress adaptation that allows this organism to survive more than 2 weeks on inert surfaces, resulting in large outbreaks (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0035">35</link>). The recent experience in South Africa illustrates the nature of multidrug resistance among clinical bloodstream isolates. Of 400 <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> isolates evaluated in 2016 and 2017, 90% were resistant to at least one antifungal agent, with 94% resistant to fluconazole alone (MIC, ≥32 μg/ml), 6% resistant to fluconazole and amphotericin B (MIC ≥2 μg/ml), and 0.3% resistant to amphotericin B alone. Furthermore, 0.5% of isolates were pan-resistant to azoles, polyenes, and echinocandins. <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> has five globally distributed clades; of 92 isolates selected for whole-genome sequencing, 84% clustered in clade III, including the pan-resistant isolates, while 14% were in clade I. Most <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> isolates are resistant to azoles, while resistance to polyenes and echinocandins is less common (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0036">36</link>). <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> can also undergo rapid stress adaptation in response to drug pressure and environment. It has thoroughly adapted to successfully colonize human mucosal membranes and survive <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> immune and competing microbial (microbiome) pressures. Furthermore, <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> can resist antifungal drug pressure, resulting in highly resistant stable “genetic escape” mutants (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0037">37</link>). Among the <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species, <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> remains the most frequent cause of azole and echinocandin resistance (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0037">37</link>). Finally, in recent years, yeasts of the genus <emphasis>Trichosporon</emphasis> have been increasingly identified as a cause of life-threatening invasive trichosporonosis (IT) in humans and are associated with an exceptionally high mortality rate. <emphasis>Trichosporon</emphasis> spp. are intrinsically resistant to front-line echinocandin antifungal agents, which accounts for numerous reports of therapeutic failure. Moreover, <emphasis>Trichosporon</emphasis> spp. have low susceptibility to polyenes and azoles and can be regarded as multidrug-resistant pathogens (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0038">38</link>). Many of the mechanisms of resistance present in mono-resistant strains (see below) are common to the MDR strains.</para>

      <para id="ch0156s0007p0001">Azoles inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol, the principal sterol in fungal cell membranes, by interfering with the action of lanosterol 14α-demethylase, which is encoded by<emphasis>ERG11</emphasis> (<emphasis>Cyp51A</emphasis> in <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis>). There are many licensed azole antifungal drugs (imidazoles, triazoles), yet the triazole drugs fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole are the most prescribed drugs for prophylaxis or treatment of invasive fungal infections. Triazoles differ in their target affinities, which influences their spectrum of activity. Hence, fluconazole has the weakest interaction with its target and shows the narrowest spectrum of activity. It is active against many yeasts, but it has poor activity against moulds. The more highly active triazoles, like voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole, interact more strongly with the demethylase target and show broad-spectrum activity against yeasts and moulds, as well as activity on some fluconazole-resistant strains. Fluconazole and voriconazole are very similar in chemical structure, while posaconazole and itraconazole are more closely related. It is this moderate chemical diversity around a core unit that promotes cross-reactivity and, at times, differential susceptibility, which ultimately depends upon the nature of the resistance mechanism (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0039">39</link>).</para>

Overall, these studies confirm that acquired resistance among susceptible species like <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> is low (1 to 3%), while resistance is more significant in non-<emphasis>albicans Candida</emphasis> species. The SENTRY Global Antifungal Surveillance Program recently reported on the antifungal drug susceptibility of 20,788 invasive isolates of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. from North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region over a 20-year period from 1997 to 2016 (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0044">44</link>). Fluconazole resistance (FluR) largely remained uncommon among all <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> isolates, while FluR was observed in <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. tropicalis.</emphasis> The highest rates of FluR isolates were seen in <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> from North America and in <emphasis>C. tropicalis</emphasis> from the Asia-Pacific region (9.2%). Overall, there has been a steady increase in <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> resistant to fluconazole detected over 20 years (1997 to 2016) in the United States (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0044">44</link>). Of 23,305 clinical isolates of <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis>, there was a higher population of resistant isolates: 15.7% and 10% for fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively. There was a yearly trend upward for increased azole resistance among <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0045">45</link>), and resistance to fluconazole varied by region (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0042">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0043">43</link>). In 2014, the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts (TSARY), involving 1,106 <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> isolates, found that 2.8% and 2.2% were resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0046">46</link>). The SENTRY Antifungal Surveillance Program reported, for the Asia-Western Pacific (APAC) region during 2012–2014, fluconazole resistance rates of 6.8, 5.7, and 3.6% for <emphasis>C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. tropicalis</emphasis>, respectively (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0047">47</link>). In China, from 2009 to 2013, resistance to fluconazole, voriconazole, and itraconazole was 7.6%, 3.2%, and 1.8%, respectively (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0048">48</link>).

This contrasts with low fluconazole resistance among <emphasis>C. parapsilosis</emphasis> isolates in most U.S. institutions (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0051">51</link>).

Resistance conferred by <emphasis>FKS2</emphasis> can be reversed following treatment with calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0154">154</link>), which downregulates <emphasis>FKS2</emphasis> expression (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0180">180</link>). The enfumafungin ibrexafungerp also shows resistance to amino acid substitutions in Fks subunits, although it would appear that the drug binding site, while overlapping somewhat with echinocandins, is different, as the drug can overcome the most prominent Fks mutations conferring echinocandin resistance (e.g., S645P in <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis>). Resistance appears more limited to modification at F641S in <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> and equivalent position in other <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species and limited amino acid changes outside the echinocandin hot spot regions (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0181">181</link>). In <emphasis>Aspergillus fumigatus</emphasis>, echinocandin breakthrough resistance is rare but also appears to involve highly conserved amino acid residues with hot spot 1 of Fks1 (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0182">182</link>, <link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0183">183</link>). In some patients, clinical breakthrough infections occur in the absence of an FKS modification. In these strains, it has been observed that there is a change in the lipid microenvironment of the membrane, rendering glucan synthase insensitive to drugs like caspofungin. This is attributed to a rise in the abundance of sphingolipid pathway members dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0184">184</link>). Finally, amino acid substitutions in Fks1 of <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> may confer reduced fitness (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0154">154</link>, <link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0185">185</link>), as they decrease glucan biosynthesis (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0185">185</link>), resulting in altered cell wall morphology (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0186">186</link>). A consequence of reduced fitness is that resistant strains compete poorly with wild-type counterparts (<link linkend="ch0156s0023s0004li0186">186</link>), which may explain why resistance is generally associated with acquired <emphasis>de novo</emphasis> resistance and not horizontal transmission.</para>

Polyene drugs bind the fungal-specific sterol ergosterol in the plasma membrane, resulting in formation of high-conductance channels that allow ions and other cellular components to flow from the cell, causing cell death. For decades, amphotericin B was a mainstay therapy for invasive fungal infections including invasive aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, candidemia, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and mucormycosis. However, its avidity for sterols like cholesterol in animal cell membranes contributes to renal toxicity and hence its relegation as a second-line antifungal option.

        <para id="ch0156s0023s0003p0001">As the global burden of invasive fungal infections rises, antifungal therapy remains a critical element of patient management. Yet, treatment choices are restricted due to the limited classes of antifungal agents and to antifungal resistance. New drug classes are emerging, and several are in later stages of clinical development. The mechanisms contributing to drug resistance are largely well characterized. They include reducing the drug-target interaction by modifying the target (drug affinity changes or target abundance) or reducing the effective cellular content of drug (ABC or MFS drug pumps, biofilm glucan trap).<emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> shows a full complement of resistance mechanisms, yet not all mechanisms are present in all fungal strains despite the genetic potential. For example, the expression of drug transporter genes is more important for azole resistance in <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> than development of target site mutations. In contrast, echinocandin resistance in all <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> strains is dependent on development of target site mutations, while drug pumps play no effective role. Azole resistance in <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> is mostly influenced by target site mutations, while in some strains drug pumps and unknown mechanisms may play a significant role. Much is known about the genetic regulatory elements that influence expression of drug target genes <emphasis>ERG11</emphasis> and <emphasis>FKS</emphasis>, as well as prominent ABC and MFS transporters. In some strains, point mutations in transcription factors are sufficient to upregulate expression, while in others, large-scale changes in chromosomes including isochromosome formation alter the transcriptional profiles. Heteroresistance has emerged as an important transient mechanism to modulate cell susceptibility to drug among clonal organisms among <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species, especially with azoles. Perhaps most alarming is the rise of multidrug resistance among <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> and the highly transmissible <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>, which tolerate the presence of multiple drug resistance mechanisms directed at multiple classes of antifungal agents with limited or no fitness cost. Biofilms are an important influence, as they convert normally susceptible planktonic cells into highly resistant cell communities and create persister cells that can seed resistance. Fungal cells are highly dynamic and adapt to environmental challenges, including the presence of antifungal agents. Compensatory mechanisms, such as enhanced chitin biosynthesis, following echinocandin or enfumafungin action help ensure cell wall integrity. Furthermore, a wide range of cellular stress response pathways contribute to cell stability and development of drug-adapted persister cells that have the potential to escape therapy by induction of permanent resistance mechanisms. A detailed understanding of the principal resistance mechanisms and factors contributing to their evolution is important for developing new diagnostic approaches that help identify drug resistance and create new strategies for therapeutic intervention that prevent and overcome resistance. Furthermore, by interfering with adaptive responses, it may be possible to develop combination drug regiments that both overcome and prevent resistance.</para>
