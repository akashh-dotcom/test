        <para id="ch0080s000000p0001">The recognition of spirochetes as human host-associated organisms dates back nearly 400 years, when Van Leeuwenhoek described spiral, nimble “animalcules” in human oral plaque and other pioneers of light microscopy visualized spirochetes in human feces (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0069">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0070">2</link>). Determination of taxonomic relationships among spirochetes has been complicated by their fastidious nature and the refractoriness of many to cultivation. Paster et al. (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0071">3</link>) demonstrated using 16S rRNA gene sequences that spirochetes can be grouped into a single deeply branching phylum containing five clusters: <emphasis>Treponema, Spirochaeta, Borrelia</emphasis> (now <emphasis>Borrelliella</emphasis> [Lyme disease spirochetes] and <emphasis>Borrelia</emphasis> [relapsing fever spirochetes]), <emphasis>Serpulina</emphasis> (now <emphasis>Brachyspira</emphasis>), and <emphasis>Leptospira.</emphasis> The relatedness among the members of individual clusters, however, varied considerably. Interspecies similarities among <emphasis>Borrelia</emphasis> were &gt;97%, suggesting recent evolutionary divergence. In contrast, the approximate 10% sequence differences among treponemes pointed towards divergence over a greater evolutionary time frame, a conclusion consistent with the diversity of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts known to harbor treponemes as symbionts (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0072">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0073">5</link>). The prevailing dogma has been that, despite its genetic diversity, the spirochetes comprise a phylum by two unifying taxonomic features: helical morphology and motility conferred by axial periplasmic flagella (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0071">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0074">6</link>). This dogma was upended in the early 2000s by the discovery of free-living and termite-associated, flagella-less, nonmotile, spherical bacteria found by 16S rRNA gene sequences to be members of the spirochete phylum, most closely related to the genus <emphasis>Spirochaeta</emphasis> (hence, their designation <emphasis>Sphaerochaeta</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0075">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0076">8</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0080s000000p0002">Investigators once believed that cultivatable treponemes were nonpathogenic forms of<emphasis>Treponema pallidum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0077">9</link>). Miao and Fieldsteel (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0078">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0079">11</link>) dispelled this idea using DNA-DNA hybridization to demonstrate that <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> Nichols strain DNA shared less than 5% homology with DNAs of cultivatable treponemes but was indistinguishable from that of a <emphasis>Treponema pertenue</emphasis> (yaws) strain. Their work led to the reclassification of the agents of venereal syphilis, endemic syphilis, and yaws as <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> subspp. <emphasis>pallidum, endemicum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>pertenue</emphasis>, respectively; <emphasis>Treponema carateum</emphasis>, the cause of the skin disease pinta, retained its status as a distinct species because no isolates were available for study (still true to this day) (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0080">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0081">13</link>). <emphasis>Treponema denticola</emphasis> has long been regarded as the prototype oral treponeme and its presence strongly correlates with periodontal disease (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0082">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0083">15</link>); however, this one species represents only a small fraction of the resident treponemal phylotypes in gingivitis and periodontitis, most of which are uncultivable (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0083">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0084">16</link>). In 1997, all <emphasis>Serpulina</emphasis> species were reclassified as <emphasis>Brachyspira</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0085">17</link>). <emphasis>Brachyspira hyodysenteriae</emphasis> is the cause of porcine dysentery, a severe mucohemorrhagic colitis of pigs, while <emphasis>Brachyspira pilosicoli</emphasis> is recognized as a cause of diarrheal disease in pigs, chickens, and dogs (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0070">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0086">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0087">19</link>).

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0003">The four members of the genus<emphasis>Treponema</emphasis> that cause venereal syphilis and the endemic treponematoses (endemic syphilis, yaws, and pinta) are morphologically identical and &gt;99.7% identical at the genomic level (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0090">22</link>). This extraordinary degree of genomic similarity reflects the high level of conservation of most regions of the chromosome along with the lack of mobile genetic elements, pathogenicity islands, prophages, and plasmids; these genetic traits are consistent with the extremely narrow host range of the pathogenic treponemes in nature and in the laboratory (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0090">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0091">23</link>). Differences between the <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> subsp. <emphasis>pallidum</emphasis> and subsp. <emphasis>pertenue</emphasis> genomes arise from polymorphisms at a relative handful of genetic loci, many encoding known or putative outer membrane proteins (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0090">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0092">24</link>). Traditionally, the only means of distinguishing the treponematoses was by differences in geographic distribution, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and host range in experimental animals (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0091">23</link>). Of late, however, genomics has made possible the development of molecular methods for differentiating pathogenic treponemes in clinical samples (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0090">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0093">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0094">26</link>). <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> subsp. <emphasis>pallidum</emphasis> is the only treponemal subspecies that regularly breaches the blood-brain barrier upon hematogenous dissemination during early infection (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0095">27</link>–<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0097">29</link>). The workhorse Nichols strain of <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> subsp. <emphasis>pallidum</emphasis> was isolated in 1912 from the cerebrospinal fluid of an individual with secondary syphilis (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0098">30</link>) and has been propagated since by intratesticular inoculation of rabbits (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0099">31</link>). Interestingly, genomic sequencing has revealed that <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> strains currently circulating globally can be divided into two clades, Nichols- and SS14-like; the SS14 cluster appears to be superseding the Nichols strain-like strains (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0100">32</link>–<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0102">34</link>). For more than a century, investigation of syphilis pathogenesis was hindered by the inability to continuously culture <emphasis>T. pallidum in vitro.</emphasis> Recently, however, Edmondson et al. (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0103">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0104">36</link>) reported an historic breakthrough: long-term logarithmic multiplication of several <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> strains by repeated subculture using a newly developed culture medium with a microaerobic rabbit epithelial cell cocultivation system. Rabbits have long been the animals of choice for studying syphilitic infection, and, despite the recent successes with long-term <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> cultivation, rabbit inoculation (“rabbit infectivity testing” or RIT) is the only means by which strains can be isolated from clinical specimens (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0099">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0105">37</link>). How closely the rabbit model recapitulates human syphilis remains a matter of debate.</para>

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0004"><emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> is approximately 0.2 μm in diameter, has tapered ends, and ranges in length from 6 to 20 μm (<anchor id="ch0080s000000a0007"/><link linkend="ch0080s000000a0006">Fig. 1</link>). Because of their small diameter, pathogenic treponemes cannot be visualized by bright field microscopy, nor do they take up Gram stain. Consequently, <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> is best visualized by phase-contrast or darkfield (DF) microscopy (<link linkend="ch0080s000000a0006">Fig. 1A</link>). Cells typically consist of 6 to 14 flat waves with a wavelength of 1.5 μm and amplitude of ~0.3 μm (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0104">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0106">38</link>). <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> has outer and cytoplasmic membranes with periplasmic flagellar filaments between the two attached to flagellar motors at each end of the cell (<link linkend="ch0080s000000a0006">Fig. 1B</link> and 1C). Cryoelectron microscopy has revealed that the ends consist of ultra-structurally complex cones consistent with their function frequently observed in cell culture systems as attachment organelles (<link linkend="ch0080s000000a0006">Fig. 1D</link>) (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0103">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0106">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0107">39</link>). <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> grows slowly (doubling time of 30 to 33 h in rabbits (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0108">40</link>) and poorly tolerates desiccation, elevated temperatures, and high oxygen tensions (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0109">41</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0080s000000p0005">Once considered to be an anaerobe, the bacterium was reclassified as a microaerophile based on the finding that it replicates best<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> in ambient oxygen concentrations of 3 to 5% (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0109">41</link>), values that closely approximate those measured in mammalian tissues (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0110">42</link>). <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> relies predominantly, if not entirely, upon glycolysis for production of ATP and is unable to synthesize fatty acids, nucleotides, enzyme cofactors, and most amino acids (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0092">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0109">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0111">43</link>). The fact that <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> must acquire an extraordinarily broad range of nutrients from its obligate human host implies that it possesses a diverse array of transporters to shuttle these molecules across its outer and cytoplasmic membranes (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0092">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0111">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0112">44</link>).

In addition to lacking genes for the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0111">43</link>), the outer membrane contains an extraordinarily low density of integral membrane proteins (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0092">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0113">45</link>). Many of the bacterium’s dominant immunogens, including those commonly used for serodiagnostic purposes, are lipid-modified, periplasmic substrate-binding proteins involved in transport of nutrients across the cytoplasmic membrane (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0092">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0113">45</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0007">Oral treponemes are anaerobic, spiral-shaped organisms ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 μm in diameter and from 5 to 16 μm in length (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0120">52</link>). They can be differentiated based on biochemical parameters, such as growth requirements, carbohydrate fermentation, and enzymatic activities, in addition to molecular methods (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0080">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0084">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0121">53</link>).

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0009">The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were approximately 22 million prevalent cases of syphilis and 7.1 million incident cases in 2020. The majority of cases have occurred in underdeveloped countries, particularly the African region, in which the adult syphilis prevalence in 2020 is estimated to be 1.7% among both sexes compared to 0.11% in the European region (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0137">69</link>). Syphilis disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM), and a global systematic review and meta-analysis reported a pooled syphilis prevalence from 2000–2020 of 7.5% among MSM, ranging from 1.9% in Australia and New Zealand to 10.6% in Latin America and the Caribbean (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0138">70</link>). In 2016, approximately 988,000 pregnant women worldwide were reported to have active syphilis, resulting in an estimated case rate of congenital syphilis of 473 per 100,000 live births (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0137">69</link>). This rate of congenital syphilis decreased 12% relative to 2012, due in part to an increase in the proportions of pregnant women with at least one antenatal clinic visit from 85% to 88%, syphilis testing from 59% to 66%, and treatment from 74% to 78% across all regions (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0139">71</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0080s000000p0010">In the United States (U.S.), syphilis was nearing elimination in 2000 after steady declines following the “sex for drugs” cocaine-related outbreak of the late 1980s to early 1990s (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0140">72</link>). However, rates of primary and secondary (P&amp;S) syphilis began doubling in 2012, predominantly affecting MSM, and have increased almost every year, increasing 6.8% during 2019–2020 (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0141">73</link>). The U.S. male-to-female ratio for syphilis in 2020 was 4:1, and MSM account for 53% of all male P&amp;S syphilis cases (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0141">73</link>). However, there has been a notable increase in the heterosexual syphilis epidemic in the U.S. which may be due to mixing between sexual networks, with an increased number of men who have sex with both men and women serving as “bridges” between MSM and heterosexual networks (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0142">74</link>). P&amp;S syphilis rates among women have more than doubled from 1.9 per 100,000 in 2016 to 4.7 per 100,000 in 2020 (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0141">73</link>). Congenital syphilis remains an important preventable cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in the U.S., underscoring the importance of identification and treatment of syphilis in pregnant women (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0143">75</link>). The national congenital syphilis rate of 57.3 cases per 100,000 live births in 2020 represents a 254% increase relative to 2016 (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0141">73</link>).</para>

Similar high-risk behaviors promote transmission of both HIV and <emphasis>T. pallidum.</emphasis> Genital ulcers can facilitate HIV acquisition and transmission by breaching protective mucosal barriers, recruiting HIV-susceptible CD4/CCR5-positive immune cells, and increasing HIV shedding in the genital tract (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0146">78</link>). Prior studies conducted among adults living with HIV/AIDS worldwide reported a median prevalence of 9.5% for syphilis (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0147">79</link>). In 2021, 45.9% of cases among MSM were HIV positive, compared to 7.8% of cases among men who have sex with women only, and 5.6% of cases among women (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0141">73</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0012">The primary mode of syphilis transmission is through sexual contact, with exudative lesions of primary and secondary syphilis being the most infectious (<anchor id="ch0080s000000a0015"/><link linkend="ch0080s000000a0019">Fig. 3</link>). Estimates of the risk of sexual transmission vary greatly from 10% to 80%; the 30% transmission rate reported by Schroeter et al. (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0148">80</link>) is the generally accepted estimate (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0149">81</link>). Vertical transmission of syphilis due to transfer across the placenta has been recognized for centuries (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0150">82</link>). Neonates also can become infected from exposure to lesional exudate or infected maternal blood within the birth canal (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0150">82</link>). Since the 1940s, transmission of syphilis through blood transfusion in the U.S. has been negligible due to routine testing of donor blood and refrigeration of blood products (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0151">83</link>). However, transfusion-associated syphilis remains a concern in underdeveloped countries with inadequate screening programs (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0152">84</link>). There have been rare instances of syphilis transmission via solid organ transplantation (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0153">85</link>).</para>

Transmission of endemic syphilis occurs via nonsexual contact through infectious lesions on the skin and mucous membranes or via shared drinking and eating utensils (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0091">23</link>). In the early 1950s, the WHO estimated that there were globally between 50 and 150 million active cases of yaws, possibly a million cases of endemic syphilis, and a lesser number of pinta cases (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0154">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0155">87</link>). In 1952, the WHO and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) launched an eradication campaign that over an approximate 10-year period decreased the global prevalence of endemic treponematoses by more than 95%, to approximately 2.4 million cases (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0155">87</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0156">88</link>). Unfortunately, local health services were unable to sustain these gains, and yaws began to re-emerge in the late 1970s (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0155">87</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0156">88</link>). During 2010–2013, 256,343 yaws cases were reported to WHO from 13 low- and middle-income countries in West Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, with 84% of cases from Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Ghana (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0157">89</link>). Serosurveys and molecular studies have revealed that infection with <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> subsp. <emphasis>pertenue</emphasis> is widespread among non-human primates (NHPs) in sub-Saharan Africa (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0158">90</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0159">91</link>), raising the possibility, with important implications for control of yaws, that NHPs serve as an enzootic reservoir for the pathogen.

Syphilis is described in terms of four stages: primary; secondary; early latent (less than 1 year duration) and late latent (greater than 1 year duration); and tertiary syphilis, based on clinical findings. In 2018, the surveillance case definition for syphilis was revised (<anchor id="ch0080s000000a0023"/><link linkend="ch0080s000000a0028">Table 1</link>) to change the terms early latent syphilis and late latent syphilis to “early non-primary non-secondary syphilis” and “unknown duration or late syphilis,” respectively. These changes were made to remove the term “latent” from the case definitions, in order to clarify that certain clinical manifestations (e.g., neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, otosyphilis) may occur during any stage of syphilis (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/DCL-syph-case-def-sept-4-2017.pdf">https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/DCL-syph-case-def-sept-4-2017.pdf</ulink>). In the U.S., cases of neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, or otosyphilis should be reported according to stage of infection, with reporting of the clinical manifestations as defined in <link linkend="ch0080s000000a0028">Table 1</link> in the case report data (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/default.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/default.htm</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0080s000000p0017">Early syphilis typically commences with the appearance of one or more mucocutaneous lesions days to weeks following inoculation of<emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0149">81</link>). Primary syphilis occurs when spirochetes replicating at the site of inoculation induce a local inflammatory response, giving rise to one or more painless chancres. The clinical consequences of spirochete dissemination, collectively referred to as secondary syphilis, become manifest 4 to 10 weeks after the chancre. Secondary syphilis can affect any organ (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0149">81</link>) during the disseminated stage of <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> infection and can present with fever, malaise, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. Mucocutaneous lesions, including maculopapular rashes involving the palms and soles, are by far the most common presentation; however, condyloma lata, which are moist papules or nodules appearing in the anogenital area, are typically more infectious. Lesions of secondary syphilis usually resolve in 3 to 12 weeks, leading to asymptomatic stages. The Oslo Study of Untreated Syphilis showed that 25% of patients experience secondary relapses, mostly within the first year, but as late as 5 years (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0164">96</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0080s000000p0018">Neurosyphilis has been grouped into five major categories with substantial overlap in presentations: asymptomatic, meningeal, meningovascular, parenchymatous, and gummatous (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0165">97</link>). All forms of tertiary syphilis have decreased markedly in incidence in the post-antibiotic era. Meningeal syphilis may present as headaches, neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting, while meningovascular syphilis can result in strokes. Ocular syphilis and otosyphilis are associated with neurosyphilis and can occur during any stage of infection. Gummas are large necrotizing granulomatous lesions that may involve skin, bone, viscera, or the central nervous system (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0166">98</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0167">99</link>). Cardiovascular syphilis, due to persistent infection of the blood vessels in the wall of the aorta (vasa vasorum), typically presents as aortic valvular insufficiency, coronary stenosis, and/or aortic aneurysm (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0168">100</link>).</para>

However, there have been reports of HIV-infected patients presenting with symptomatic early neurosyphilis occurring within the first 12 months of infection, which is otherwise rare in HIV-negative persons (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0165">97</link>).

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0022">Endemic syphilis usually begins as a generalized infection in the absence of an obvious primary lesion and is characterized by ulcerative lesions of the oropharyngeal mucosa (mucous patches), angular stomatitis with split papules at the corners of the mouth, intertrigial condylomata (similar to those of venereal syphilis), painful periostitis, and rashes (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0091">23</link>).

In contrast to yaws, the pinta primary lesion is an itchy, scaly papule or plaque that appears after an incubation period of 1 week to 4 months and expands to greater than 10 cm but does not ulcerate. Secondary lesions (pintids) usually appear 2 to 6 months later. Tertiary lesions consist of well-defined hyperchromic, hypochromic, achromic, or dyschromic plaques.</para>

It originates from dental plaque on the surfaces of teeth, in concert with alterations in the normal oral microbial flora, including overgrowth of treponemal species, such as <emphasis>T. denticola</emphasis>, that incite inflammation of the gums, i.e., gingivitis (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0176">108</link>). Along with <emphasis>Porphyromonas gingivalis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Tannerella forsythia, T. denticola</emphasis> forms the “red complex” strongly associated with severity and progression of periodontal disease.

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0025">In 1967, Harland and Lee (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0180">112</link>) coined the term intestinal spirochetosis to describe a noninflammatory condition of the large bowel in which spirochetes attached end-on to the colonic epithelium in a dense, palisade-like arrangement, forming a basophilic “false brush border” (<link linkend="ch0080s000000a0011">Fig. 2A</link>). Although they identified spirochetes in 9 of 100 consecutive biopsies examined, they were unable to relate these findings to symptomatology. The confusion and controversy regarding the clinical significance of human intestinal spirochetosis (HIS) have not abated over the years despite extensive phylogenetic and biochemical characterization of intestinal spirochetes and advances in methodologies for their isolation and/or detection (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0070">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0086">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0181">113</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0182">114</link>). In the randomized, population-based study by Thorell et al.

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0026">Because<emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> in clinical specimens cannot be cultivated on artificial medium, the diagnosis of syphilis has to rely on the direct detection of treponemes in clinical specimens and/or reactivity in serological tests (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0186">118</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0187">119</link>). The method used for direct detection of <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> depends upon the stage of disease, the clinical presentation, and the type of specimen obtained. <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> can be detected in lesion exudate by DF microscopy or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). NAATs can be performed on primary and secondary syphilis lesion swabs and non-lesion samples collected via oral swabs, oral rinse samples, anal canal swabs, urine, and semen (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0188">120</link>–<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0190">122</link>). Ano-rectal and pharyngeal swabs can also be tested by NAATs (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0190">122</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0191">123</link>). Aqueous or vitreous fluid can be tested by DF or NAATs from suspected ocular syphilis cases (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0192">124</link>). Tissue biopsies are rarely performed on genital ulcers but are used for diagnosing non-genital manifestations of secondary and tertiary disease, often when something other than syphilis (usually malignancy) is suspected. NAATs can be performed on either fixed or unfixed tissue, although unfixed tissue is preferable. NAATs are not recommended for testing CSF under routine circumstances because treponemes are present in a substantial percentage of spinal fluids from early syphilis patients who lack neurological complaints or findings, and treatment of these individuals for central nervous system involvement has not been shown to be beneficial (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0169">101</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0186">118</link>). Other specimens such as lymph node aspirates and amniotic fluids, although rarely obtained, also can be examined by DF and NAATs, while placenta or cord tissue can be examined by silver staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and NAATs (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0150">82</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0080s000000p0027">The order of sample collection from genital ulcers or moist lesions depends on the tests to be performed. Samples are typically collected first for DF (see below), followed by NAATs. Ideally, the specimen for DF should be free of red blood cells, other microorganisms, and tissue debris (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0120">52</link>). To collect serous exudate for NAATs, firmly press and roll a sterile Dacron- or cotton-tipped swab along the base of the ulcer or lesion (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0193">125</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0194">126</link>). The swab then should be suspended in a cryotube containing nucleic acid transport medium such as the Hologic Aptima Multitest Swab Collection Kit (Hologic Inc., San Diego, CA), BD Universal Viral Transport (UVT) System (Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ), Remel MicroTest M4RT (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), or Universal Transport Medium (UTM; Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA). Tissue or fine needle aspirates (e.g., lymph nodes) for silver staining or IHC need to be fixed as soon as possible in 10% buffered formalin at room temperature, and sent to the laboratory for paraffin embedding, sectioning, and staining. To test products of conception for congenital syphilis, a 3- to 4-cm section of umbilical cord distal from the placenta should be obtained as soon as possible after delivery and processed as for tissues, above (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0195">127</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0080s000000p0028">A detailed procedure for collecting a specimen for DF examination has been described by Wheeler et al. (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0196">128</link>). A step-by-step instructional video can be obtained without charge from the CDC. A step-by-step instructional video can be obtained without charge from the CDC by emailing a request to <ulink url="mailto:stdlaboratoryspecim@cdc.gov">stdlaboratoryspecim@cdc.gov</ulink>. Briefly, the site is gently cleansed and abraded with sterile gauze moistened with physiological saline until serous fluid appears; the specimen is then collected onto a clean glass slide and a coverslip is applied.</para>
      <para id="ch0080s000000p0029">Specimens obtained for DF microscopy should be examined within 5 to 20 min since diagnosis relies upon identification of motile treponemes (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0197">129</link>). Serum collected for rapid plasma reagin (RPR) testing should be stored at 2 to 8°C and tested within 72 hours or, if testing will be delayed, stored at 2 to 8°C for 5 days or at –20°C or below until testing (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0197">129</link>). Plasma collected for RPR should be stored at 2 to 8°C and tested within 5 days (Arlington Scientific Inc., Springville, UT). For TP-PA, serum should be stored at 2 to 8°C if testing will be done within 5 days, and plasma should be stored at 2 to 8°C and tested within 48 hours (Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Frozen plasma should not be used for RPR or TP-PA testing. Serum or plasma for Trep-Sure (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland) should remain at ambient temperature for no longer than 8 hours or at 2 to 8°C for up to 48 hours; if assays are not completed within 48 hours, then serum or plasma should be frozen at or below –20°C. Samples of unfixed tissue, ulcer exudate, mucosal or skin lesions, ano-rectal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, CSF, ocular fluid, oral rinse, semen, urine, and amniotic fluid require storage at –20°C to –80°C if NAATs cannot be performed immediately. Formalin-fixed samples can be stored at room temperature prior to embedding and sectioning or DNA extraction (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0198">130</link>). Specimens collected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) should be stored in the same manner as for NAATs.</para>
      <para id="ch0080s000000p0030">If specimens must be sent to a different laboratory for analyses, previously frozen serum or plasma must be shipped on dry ice. Transportation of whole blood for serological testing can be done at ambient temperature if testing is done on-site; otherwise, samples should be stored at 2 to 8°C and transported overnight with cool packs (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0197">129</link>). CSF for serology can be transported on cold packs or dry ice if also being examined by NAATs. If testing will be delayed more than 5 days, CSF should be frozen at –20°C or below (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0197">129</link>). Samples collected in NAAT transport media can be shipped overnight on cold packs or dry ice depending on validated testing procedures. Formalin-fixed tissue samples can be shipped at ambient temperature.</para>
      <para id="ch0080s000000p0031">Serum is the specimen of choice for conventional nontreponemal and treponemal tests, but plasma can also be used with some of the enzyme immunoassays and newer treponemal assays (see serologic tests below). Plasma can be used for the RPR and toluidine red unheated serum (TRUST) assays, but not for the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, because heat inactivation of plasma enhances fibrin formation, leading to false-positive results. Plasma should be tested within 48 hours to avoid false-positive test results (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0197">129</link>). Fingerstick whole blood, serum, or plasma can be used for rapid syphilis tests. The sensitivities of a number of rapid tests have been shown to be higher with serum (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0199">131</link>). Whole blood for NAATs should be collected in tubes containing EDTA as anticoagulant (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0193">125</link>). When screening for congenital syphilis, the mother’s serum or neonatal serum should be used rather than cord blood for quantitative nontreponemal antibody testing; treponemal testing on neonatal serum is not recommended because of difficulties of interpretation due to passive transfer of maternal antibodies (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0200">132</link>). For IgM-specific tests, the infant’s serum is also required since cord blood specimens can be contaminated by maternal blood.</para>

Quest Diagnostics currently offers a real-time PCR test targeting the flagellar biosynthetic protein (<emphasis>flhB</emphasis>) gene for use on CSF and genital lesion swabs. The test has an analytical sensitivity of 100 genomic copies/ml. Medical Diagnostics Laboratories, LLC, has a real-time PCR test for <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> for use on OneSwab, UroSwab, ThinPrep, whole blood, biopsy (unfixed), and paraffin-embedded tissue. PlexPCR VHS is a CE-IVD and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)-cleared commercial assay available from SpeeDx (Sydney, Australia), which detects herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus (VZV), and <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> in a multiplex format (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0214">146</link>). The assay is used for testing genital and non-genital lesion swabs. The CE-IVD-cleared Allplex Genital Ulcer Assay, available from Seegene (Seoul, South Korea), detects seven pathogens (HSV-1 and -2, <emphasis>H. ducreyi, T. pallidum</emphasis>, lymphogranuloma venereum [LGV], cytomegalovirus [CMV], and VZV). NAATs are most useful for genital ulcers and other exudative lesions, which typically contain large numbers of treponemes and can be sampled noninvasively. Abrading maculopapular lesions of secondary syphilis prior to sampling with swab can yield an adequate specimen for NAATs. Genomic DNAs for NAATs are usually extracted from 200 μl of nucleic acid transport medium containing a genital ulcer swab sample using commercially available DNA extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit, Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). Laboratories with real-time PCR capability can use the TaqMan-based multiplex PCR assay developed in the STD Laboratory Reference and Research Branch, Division of STD Prevention at the CDC. This assay simultaneously detects <emphasis>T. pallidum, H. ducreyi</emphasis>, and HSV-1 and -2. Gene targets, primers, and probes for the assay have been described previously (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0211">143</link>). Since <emphasis>H. ducreyi</emphasis> is relatively uncommon these days, this assay can be modified to detect <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> and HSV-1 and -2.</para>

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0047">There has been a proliferation of new automated enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), immunoblots, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and multiplex flow immunoassays, and their use as treponemal specific screening tests has increased over the past few decades due to the needs for high throughput in large laboratories (<anchor id="ch0080s000000a0063"/><link linkend="ch0080s000000a0073">Tables 4</link> through <anchor id="ch0080s000000a0064"/><link linkend="ch0080s000000a0094">7</link>). In resource-poor countries, the development of rapid syphilis tests has filled the need for simple, inexpensive methods that can provide immediate results (<anchor id="ch0080s000000a0065"/><link linkend="ch0080s000000a0099">Table 8</link>). Initial rapid syphilis tests identified only treponemal antibodies, but several rapid tests now have dual platforms that provide nontreponemal antibody or HIV antibody testing along with the treponemal assay (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0238">170</link>–<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0240">172</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0048"><link linkend="ch0080s000000a0060">Table 2</link> presents the prominent features of the nontreponemal antibody tests. These tests use a precisely defined combination of cardiolipin, lecithin, and cholesterol that flocculates upon reaction with IgM and IgG antibodies. Detailed protocols for performing the RPR, VDRL, and TRUST assays can be found in <emphasis>A Manual of Tests for Syphilis</emphasis>, published by the American Public Health Association (<ulink url="http://www.apha.org">http://www.apha.org</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0080s000000p0049">The VDRL test is a quantitative flocculation reaction performed on special glass slides (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0197">129</link>). The results are read microscopically at 100×, with the highest titer causing flocculation taken as the endpoint. The RPR card test, performed on serum or plasma, contains finely divided charcoal particles as a visualizing agent (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0197">129</link>). In the RPR card test, serial dilutions of serum or plasma (heated or unheated) are prepared on a plastic-coated card, after which the RPR antigen is added. The presence of antibodies causes flocculation, while suspensions without antibodies remain uniformly gray. The TRUST is a macroflocculation assay, very similar to the RPR, in which the charcoal is replaced with toluidine red (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0197">129</link>). The sensitivity of the TRUST is similar to that of the RPR (<link linkend="ch0080s000000a0073">Table 4</link>), while its specificity is slightly higher (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0120">52</link>). Recently, automated RPR tests using latex agglutination or immunoassay have been developed to increase capacity for testing larger numbers of samples and minimize person-to-person variation (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0241">173</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0242">174</link>). However, the quantitative range of automated RPR may be limited (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0243">175</link>). The automated RPR tests also have had variable results, including a high proportion of false-positive tests especially at low titers when screening low-prevalence populations (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0244">176</link>).</para>

Because of the nature of the conjugate used, the FTA-ABS test cannot distinguish between IgG or IgM antibodies. The serum is subjectively scored based upon the fluorescence intensity. The test can be performed with unheated CSF for diagnosis of neurosyphilis (see below). The CSF FTA-ABS test is less specific for neurosyphilis than the CSF-VDRL but is highly sensitive (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0200">132</link>). Because of the subjectivity involved in reading samples and the need for expensive microscopy equipment, the FTA-ABS is used much less frequently in clinical practice.</para>

        <para id="ch0080s000000p0054">Since the 1980s, numerous EIAs have been developed for syphilis diagnosis, the majority of which use recombinant<emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> antigens to detect IgM, IgG, or both. The 15-, 17-, 44.5-, and 47-kDa lipoprotein antigens are the most frequently utilized because they induce strong, persistent antibody responses and are thought to be expressed only by pathogenic treponemes (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0247">179</link>). Although EIAs using recombinant antigens might be expected to perform better than assays using <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> lysates (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0248">180</link>), this has not been borne out (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0249">181</link>–<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0251">183</link>). EIAs utilize several different formats including (i) antibody class capture, (ii) sandwich capture, and (iii) competitive assay. Some of the initial EIAs that specifically detect treponemal IgM (<link linkend="ch0080s000000a0099">Table 8</link>) were based on antibody class capture using goat or rabbit anti-human antibodies and purified <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> antigens labeled covalently to peroxidase (conjugates) to complex with the patient’s antitreponemal antibodies. Examples are the Mercia Syphilis IgM (Microgen Bioproducts Ltd., Camberly, UK) and the <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> μ-capture IgM ELISA (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany). Two-step sandwich EIAs use either immobilized whole or recombinant <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> antigens to coat microplate wells. Examples include the Trep-Sure (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland) and the ICE Syphilis (Murex Biotech Ltd., Dartford, UK). One-step sandwich EIAs have similar formats; examples include the Enzywell Syphilis Screen (DIESSE Diagnostica, Siena, Italy) and Syphilis EIA II (Newmarket Laboratories Ltd., Newmarket, UK).</para>

The Western blot (WB) techniques use<emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> antigens that are fractionated with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and reacted with patient serum. The MarDx test (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland), which uses whole <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> lysate, is used to define serum reactivity when screening and confirmatory treponemal tests are discrepant (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0252">184</link>).

The Luminex assay differs from EIAs in two ways: (i) the capture antibody is attached to a suspension of polystyrene beads instead of the wells and (ii) the polystyrene beads are dyed with fluorophores of differing intensities that confer on each bead a unique fingerprint, enabling multiplex antibody detection. After the sandwich immunoassay, the bead suspension is analyzed using a dual laser flow cytometry detection system. The MFIs that have been developed include the BioPlex 2200 Syphilis assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and the AtheNA Multi-Lyte assay (Zeus Scientific, Branchburg, NJ). There is also a BioPlex 2200 Syphilis Total &amp; RPR automated assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) that detects total (IgG/IgM) treponemal and nontreponemal antibodies with high sensitivities and specificities compared to other treponemal tests and the manual RPR (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0253">185</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0254">186</link>); however, false-positive results with the automated RPR in this assay have been reported and may be associated with COVID-19 vaccinations (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0255">187</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0080s000000p0059">Most of the rapid tests for syphilis are immunochromatographic strip assays that detect treponemal antibodies using whole blood from fingerstick specimens, serum, or plasma. All of the rapid syphilis tests use recombinant<emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> antigens to detect IgM and IgG antibodies, and typically provide results within 25 minutes. A meta-analysis of rapid treponemal tests used globally reported that their overall sensitivities and specificities were comparable to laboratory-based treponemal assays (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0199">131</link>). However, positive rapid treponemal antibody tests require follow-up nontreponemal antibody titers for further evaluation. Interestingly, a novel point-of-care test for the detection of <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis>-specific IgA antibodies has been recently investigated as an alternative to laboratory-based RPR testing, used in combination with a total syphilis antibody screening test in South Africa and China, with promising results (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0256">188</link>).</para>

A study conducted by Fakile et al. (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0257">189</link>) found that, although the Syphilis Health Check had a sensitivity of 100% using fingerstick whole blood compared with a combined reference of a positive RPR/EIA, this decreased to 50% when compared to the treponemal EIA alone. Another study reported that the Syphilis Health Check had a sensitivity and specificity of 88.7% and 93.1%, respectively, compared with treponemal tests when using serum specimens (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0258">190</link>). The Chembio DPP HIV-Syphilis System is one of several rapid tests that combine both treponemal and HIV antibody testing on the same platform (<link linkend="ch0080s000000a0099">Table 8</link>) using recombinant or synthetic HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0259">191</link>).

An additional advantage of NAATs for diagnosis of genital ulcer disease (GUD) is that multiplex analysis for other causes of GUD, most importantly HSV-1 and HSV-2 (see above), is possible. A recent study demonstrated a PCR sensitivity of 83.9% on maculopapular lesions of secondary syphilis that were abraded prior to swab sampling (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0279">211</link>).

Sera with extremely high nontreponemal test titers can give weak, atypical, or even negative “rough” reactions at low dilutions when antibody excess prevents agglutination, referred to as the “prozone phenomenon.” The incidence of this phenomenon has been estimated at 0.83% and could occur during any clinical phase, particularly during primary and secondary syphilis (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0282">214</link>).

Although treponemal antibody-based tests have increased sensitivity, they can also be negative in early primary infection.

Response to therapy in syphilis patients can be defined by: (i) resolution of symptoms or disease manifestations; (ii) at least a 4-fold decline in nontreponemal titers or a change in two dilutions (e.g., from 1:16 to 1:4) using the same assay; and/or (iii) seroreversion of nontreponemal serological tests to nonreactive (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0186">118</link>).

For serological monitoring after treatment, repeat nontreponemal titers are recommended at 6 and 12 months for early syphilis, and at 6, 12, and 24 months for late syphilis. More frequent serological monitoring is recommended for HIV-infected persons and pregnant women after syphilis treatment. A sustained 4-fold increase in nontreponemal titers persisting for more than 2 weeks is suggestive of either reinfection or treatment failure and requires further clinical evaluation for HIV coinfection and central nervous system involvement from <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0186">118</link>).</para>

This property accounts for the main strength of these treponemal tests, which is their high level of sensitivity, but also their cardinal weakness, i.e., the inability to distinguish active from inactive disease. The greatest value of the treponemal tests is in distinguishing between true- and false-positive nontreponemal test results. In general, treponemal tests are expected to remain positive for life; however, seroreversion of treponemal antibody tests among previously infected syphilis patients with HIV coinfection has been reported (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0301">233</link>).</para>

All of the commercially available treponemal tests have high specificities (at or near 100% in tested panels) and, not surprisingly, nearly 100% sensitivities in diagnosing secondary syphilis. A study involving seven treponemal assays including CIAs and MFIs demonstrated that these methods have excellent sensitivity for detection of early syphilis overall (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0303">235</link>). Schmidt et al. (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0250">182</link>) evaluated nine EIAs using highly selected sera from patients with primary syphilis. Higher sensitivity correlated with (i) the volume and dilution of serum used, (ii) assay format (i.e., capture and competitive tests showed higher sensitivity than sandwich-based assays), and (iii) detection of IgM as well as IgG antibodies. The greater sensitivity for primary syphilis of assays that include IgM detection is presumed to be due to the earlier appearance of IgM versus IgG antitreponemal antibodies. IgM-specific EIAs have sensitivities ranging from 88 to 90% in primary syphilis, 76 to 100% in secondary syphilis, and 19 to 69% in early latent syphilis (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0311">243</link>).

Therefore, a careful clinical history is important to distinguish untreated infection from previously treated syphilis. For persons who do not have a prior history of syphilis treatment, a second treponemal test, preferably the TP-PA or a different treponemal assay from the screening test, should be performed (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0186">118</link>). A reactive second test confirms that the person has or had syphilis while leaving unresolved the issue of disease activity. If the second treponemal test is nonreactive, the clinician could decide that no further evaluation or treatment is indicated or that treatment is indicated for individuals at high risk. The reverse screening algorithm for syphilis testing could lead to increased patient follow-ups, overtreatment, and potentially higher costs (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0313">245</link>). In a low-prevalence population, the reverse algorithm can result in a higher proportion of false-positive tests than the traditional algorithm (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0314">246</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0315">247</link>). The traditional algorithm is preferred in certain populations, such as HIV-infected MSM, with a high prevalence of prior syphilis and a high proportion of false-positive screening EIAs (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0316">248</link>). Therefore, several issues should be considered prior to the implementation of the reverse syphilis screening algorithm including disease prevalence, pretest probability of the patient having syphilis, and the laboratory’s need for automation.</para>
        <para id="ch0080s000000p0078">Some studies have investigated the use of index values or signal strength of automated treponemal immunoassays to reduce the need for a second treponemal test in the reverse algorithm (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0317">249</link>–<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0319">251</link>). An index value is calculated as the OD value of a blank well subtracted from the OD of a specimen well, divided by the mean OD of three cutoff calibrators included in the assay (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0317">249</link>). A study conducted by Fakile et al. (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0320">252</link>) involving four treponemal antibody tests showed that increasing signal strength values correlated with increasing reactivity of confirmatory testing, and identified signal strength cutoffs for each assay corresponding to ≥95% reactivity with TP-PA or FTA-ABS, when it may be appropriate to forego confirmatory testing.</para>

The rapid treponemal antibody-based tests are most sensitive during infections with high nontreponemal antibody titers; their lower sensitivities observed in primary syphilis indicate the need for supplementation with additional tests among high-incidence populations to avoid missing early syphilis cases (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0238">170</link>). Rapid syphilis tests based on treponemal antibody detection should be followed with nontreponemal antibody testing to assist in staging.

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0080">CSF abnormalities are common in early syphilis patients without neurologic symptoms, and a high proportion of such individuals have treponemes in their CNS, yet they do not require enhanced therapy (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0096">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0169">101</link>). For these reasons, routine lumbar puncture is not recommended in early syphilis (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0096">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0200">132</link>). A CSF examination should be performed if there is clinical evidence of neurologic involvement (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, motor or sensory deficits, cranial nerve palsies, or symptoms or signs of meningitis or stroke) (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0096">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0200">132</link>). Some investigators have recommended lumbar punctures in HIV-infected patients with serum RPR titers of <emphasis role="underline">&gt;</emphasis>1:32 or CD4 counts below 350 cells/μl (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0323">255</link>), although there are no data demonstrating long-term benefits of enhanced therapy in this patient population. Current CDC recommendations are to reserve lumbar puncture for HIV-infected patients with an abnormal neurologic examination (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0096">28</link>). The diagnosis of neurosyphilis is based on a combination of clinical and CSF abnormalities (e.g., CSF cell count, protein, or reactive CSF-VDRL) in the presence of reactive serologic tests and neurologic signs and symptoms (<link linkend="ch0080s000000a0028">Table 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0096">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0200">132</link>). The VDRL-CSF test is considered to have high specificity but low sensitivity, in the range of 30 to 70% (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0096">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0200">132</link>). A nonreactive VDRL-CSF test result, therefore, does not rule out neurosyphilis. The FTA-ABS CSF test has high sensitivity but low specificity for neurosyphilis because reactivity can be due to the passive transfer of IgG antitreponemal antibodies across the blood-brain barrier rather than intrathecal production of antibodies. A nonreactive FTA-ABS CSF test essentially rules out a diagnosis of neurosyphilis (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0200">132</link>). Some studies shown that the CSF TP-PA is highly sensitive for neurosyphilis (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0324">256</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0325">257</link>); a titer of ≥1:640 may be useful in identifying patients with neurosyphilis when the CSF-VDRL is nonreactive (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0326">258</link>). Other studies have explored the use of other methods, including intrathecal anti-<emphasis>Treponema</emphasis> IgG ELISA for neurosyphilis diagnosis, with promising results (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0327">259</link>). Demonstration of intrathecal synthesis of antitreponemal IgG can enhance the specificity for cases in which the combined clinical and laboratory data are suggestive but not definitive for a diagnosis of neurosyphilis (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0328">260</link>). Measurement of the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 in CSF also has been proposed as a biomarker for neurosyphilis in HIV-infected individuals (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0329">261</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0330">262</link>) but needs further study, particularly with regard to specificity (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0331">263</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0080s000000p0081">A clear consensus exists that serologic tests for syphilis perform well in persons coinfected with HIV and can be relied upon for accurate diagnosis and follow-up in such individuals (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0096">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0186">118</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0200">132</link>). However, some caveats to this statement exist. HIV-infected individuals can have a higher incidence of false-positive nontreponemal and treponemal tests such as EIAs (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0290">222</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0295">227</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0316">248</link>); the use of antiretroviral therapy appears to decrease the odds of BFP nontreponemal antibody tests (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0332">264</link>). Second, nontreponemal test titers in HIV-infected individuals tend to be higher compared to patients without HIV infection (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0169">101</link>). Third, there may be an increased risk of serological failures among HIV-infected persons with early or late latent syphilis (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0333">265</link>). Lastly, rare instances of negative serologic tests in HIV-infected persons with biopsy-confirmed secondary syphilis also have been reported (<link linkend="ch0080s000000li0276">208</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0334">266</link>, <link linkend="ch0080s000000li0335">267</link>).</para>
