        <para id="ch0047s0001s0001p0001">Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a group of closely related slowly growing mycobacteria, collectively named the<emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> complex (MTBC). Despite being an ancient disease, TB is still one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world and currently infects a quarter of the global population (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0001">1</link>). TB may occur on a spectrum between latent or active disease, with the majority of MTBC infections being latent. Most active cases result in pulmonary TB (~85%), but MTBC may cause disease in virtually any part of the body (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0002">2</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0047s0001s0001p0002">MTBC infections can be prevented and treated successfully, but access to care and the emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB dramatically affect patients and public health efforts. In 2019, an estimated 3% of new cases and 18% of previously treated cases were multidrug- or rifampin-resistant TB (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0001">1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0047s0001s0001p0003">Fortunately, the overall incidence of TB is decreasing. The END TB Strategy by the World Health Organization (WHO) aims for an 80% reduction in new TB cases, a 90% reduction in TB deaths, and a reduction in catastrophic costs for TB-affected households by 2030 compared to 2015 (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0001">1</link>). Diagnostic testing is an essential part of this strategy and can be used to increase detection, identify drug resistance, and ensure that patients are on appropriate treatment, thereby reducing the overall morbidity and mortality.</para>

        <para id="ch0047s0001s0002p0001">The genus<emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> is related to other mycolic acid-containing genera and falls within the family <emphasis>Mycobacteriaceae</emphasis> (see <ulink url="https://www.bacterio.net/genus/mycobacterium">https://www.bacterio.net/genus/mycobacterium</ulink>) (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0004">4</link>). The MTBC comprises 13 strains/species (<anchor id="ch0047s0001s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0047s0001s0003a0005">Table 1</link>): <emphasis>M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. bovis</emphasis> bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), <emphasis>M. caprae, M. africanum, M. pinnipedii, M. microti</emphasis>, “<emphasis>M. canettii</emphasis>,” “<emphasis>M. mungi</emphasis>,” “<emphasis>M. orygis</emphasis>,” “<emphasis>M. suricattae</emphasis>,” dassie bacillus, and chimpanzee bacillus (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0005">5</link>). Members of the MTBC have undergone several taxonomic reclassifications, which has resulted in confusing nomenclature. Most recently, Riojas et al. proposed that currently recognized species of the MTBC be united as strains of <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> based on their similarity using next-generation sequencing (NGS), digital DNA-DNA hybridization, and average nucleotide identity techniques. For example, <emphasis>M. africanum</emphasis> would be <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> var. africanum (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0005">5</link>). This system has not been widely adopted, so the strains in the MTBC are referred to here as members or species using their historical nomenclature (<link linkend="ch0047s0001s0003a0005">Table 1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0047s0001s0002p0002">Identification to the species level can be useful for epidemiologic, public health, and therapeutic reasons. MTBC members differ significantly in morphology, biochemistry, host spectra, animal niches, antimicrobial susceptibility, geographic ranges, and epidemiological patterns. However, despite these differences, members of the MTBC are genetically similar, with only about 0.01 to 0.03% synonymous nucleotide variation and no significant genetic exchange among them (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0006">6</link>–<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0008">8</link>). 16S rRNA gene sequences show &gt;99% identity at the nucleotide level for some species, and they share identical matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiles (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0010">10</link>). Commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) cannot usually differentiate among members of the complex, and specific primers targeting genes where differences are observed must be used to differentiate these species (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0012">12</link>).</para>

Differences in risk factors and the mode of acquisition between members of the MTBC are an important reason to identify organisms to species level in certain cases.

Laboratories must validate any heat inactivation procedure before it is put into use. Following validation, the method should be detailed in the laboratory procedures and should state the temperature of inactivation (e.g., 80°C or 95°C), acceptable time period for the heat inactivation step (e.g., minimum of 30 min to a maximum of 60 min), and whether inactivation is performed in a heat block or oven. Note that if inactivation is done in a heat block, the liquid at the top of the tube may not reach the desired temperature; as a result, tubes should be incubated for 1 h at 80°C and vortexed at 15-min intervals. The oven or heat block temperatures should be monitored prior to use, and the start and end time of heat inactivation should be recorded. An inactivation assessment is recommended to be performed every 6 months or when there are equipment modifications. The assessment can be performed as follows: 1-ml aliquots of an<emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> suspension (known concentration determined by serial dilution or titration) are inactivated by incubation according to the procedure. Each heat-inactivated suspension is then plated onto Middlebrook 7H10 solid media plates in triplicate and incubated at 37°C for 8 weeks, checked periodically for growth. No growth should be present after 8 weeks of incubation (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0077">77</link>–<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0079">79</link>).</para>

For the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus; Qiagen, Germantown, MD), 1 ml of whole blood is drawn directly into each of four collection tubes, or 5 ml of blood is collected in a single lithium-heparin tube and later transferred to the four QFT-Plus tubes.

      <para id="ch0047s0020p0001">Microscopy has traditionally been used as the primary diagnostic screen for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) from specimens, particularly because the technique is inexpensive and requires minimal instrumentation and infrastructure. Furthermore, compared with culture, smears have a relatively rapid turnaround time and allow laboratories to report results within 24 hours of sample receipt (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0087">87</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0047s0020p0002">Smear microscopy techniques use either fluorescence or carbol fuchsin-based staining methods that are described more fully in<ulink url="ch0046#ch0046s0001">chapter 30</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>. Evaluations of these staining methods suggest that carbol fuchsin-based methods have a sensitivity for AFB ranging from 20 to 70% compared to culture, with Ziehl-Neelsen stains being more sensitive than Kinyoun stains (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0088">88</link>–<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0090">90</link>).

Microscopes with special light sources are required to visualize fluorescent staining. For instance, light-emitting diode (LED) fluorescence microscopy is becoming more commonplace in laboratories and has the advantage of better illumination and resolution compared to conventional halogen or mercury, with bulbs that are rated for several thousand hours and extremely low heat emission (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0095">95</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0096">96</link>). Because of their higher sensitivity, better contrast, and ability to be read at lower magnification, fluorescent stains are preferred over carbol fuchsin-based stains when performing AFB microscopy directly from specimens (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0097">97</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0047s0020p0003">In resource-rich nations, AFB smear microscopy for pulmonary samples is typically performed after decontamination and centrifugation since smears made from concentrated respiratory samples have greater sensitivity (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0098">98</link>). Overall sensitivity from microscopy is also increased by collecting multiple specimens. Current guidelines recommend collection of three sputum specimens at 8- to 24-hour intervals, with at least one being an early-morning specimen to improve the sensitivity of diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0014">14</link>). The first smear captures approximately 86% of cases, the second captures an additional ~12%, and the third captures only 3% more cases (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0099">99</link>). Based on these data, the WHO changed its guidelines to recommend performing two AFB smears as opposed to the prior recommendation of three smears (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0100">100</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0047s0020p0004">In many high TB burden settings, sputum-smear microscopy still remains the primary diagnostic technique for evaluating individuals presenting with the signs and symptoms of TB. NAATs have been found to have higher sensitivity and specificity than AFB smear microscopy, particularly in patients with paucibacillary disease and in people living with HIV (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0101">101</link>). Because of this, WHO updated its guidelines in 2020 to recommend that NAATs (i.e., WHO-recommended rapid diagnostics) be used for TB diagnosis instead of AFB smear microscopy (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0002">2</link>). In countries with low TB incidence, AFB smears can be used for additional purposes. For instance, interpretation of NAAT results can be enhanced by correlation with AFB smear microscopy results (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0102">102</link>). Additionally, AFB smear microscopy is considered useful in determining infectiousness, monitoring of treatment progress in patients with TB, and making decisions about release from airborne infection isolation (AII) (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0103">103</link>). AFB smear microscopy is also an inexpensive tool that can simultaneously screen for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which are increasing in prevalence in these regions (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0104">104</link>). In one report, the combination of a positive AFB smear with a negative MTB NAAT rapidly ruled out active pulmonary MTB and ruled in NTM infection in a low-prevalence setting. Interestingly, little benefit was found for collecting and testing more than two respiratory specimens in this low-prevalence setting for both diagnostic or rapid AII discontinuation purposes (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0105">105</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0047s0021p0001">NAATs are molecular assays that provide sensitive, specific, and rapid detection of MTBC. They may be used directly on processed or unprocessed clinical specimens, thereby facilitating early and accurate diagnosis of TB, prompting initiation of therapy, identifying the need for contact investigation, and ultimately reducing overall disease transmission (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0106">106</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0107">107</link>).

For instance, release of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis patients from AII conditions has historically been based on serial AFB smears from sputum, but the Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay was FDA cleared in 2015 as a sensitive tool to determine the need for continued isolation (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0110">110</link>). A single test detected 97% of smear-positive, culture-positive TB cases, while a second, serially collected specimen increased sensitivity to 100%. When applying these performance characteristics to a setting of moderate TB prevalence (e.g., 22% of cultured cases are confirmed as MTBC), the negative predictive value of a single test is estimated to be 99.7%, while two serially collected specimens would have a negative predictive value of 100% (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0110">110</link>). Importantly, NAATs should not be used to monitor response to treatment or be used to release patients from AII after laboratory confirmation of TB, because of their inability to differentiate live organisms from the nucleic acid of dead organisms (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0081">81</link>).</para>

While U.S.-based guidance does not yet recommend NAAT for all specimen types, guidelines from the WHO indicate that NAAT testing is preferred for initial diagnostic testing of MTBC for pulmonary TB and TB meningitis in adults and children (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0002">2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0047s0021p0003">Many molecular tests for TB have been designed and evaluated (<anchor id="ch0047s0021a0003"/><link linkend="ch0047s0021a0005">Table 3</link>). When implementing tests for TB, it is important for laboratories to consider multiple variables including the test regulatory status (e.g., FDA approved/cleared, CE marked, laboratory developed). In general, commercially available tests may be preferred in some laboratory settings over laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) because standardized protocols provide a decreased need for technical molecular expertise, and because extensive validation of the test is not required. In the United States, most mycobacteriology laboratories may find it difficult to perform validation studies with extrapulmonary specimens because the numbers of these samples received may be too small to permit a significant assessment of parameters such as sensitivity and specificity. However, when validated, LDT methods may allow testing on nonrespiratory specimens and they can be performed at a lower cost compared to commercial assays (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0111">111</link>–<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0114">114</link>).

      <para id="ch0047s0021p0004">There are several other important points of consideration for laboratories. Some tests are intended for reference laboratory use, while others are aimed at the point-of-care and peripheral health care settings, depending on whether they are batched versus random access, whether they require a significant amount of labor, and their throughput. The underlying platform technology is also an important component to consider when evaluating the performance characteristics of each test. There are five main NAAT technologies for TB diagnosis directly from specimens: (i) real-time PCR, (ii) line probe assays (LPAs), (iii) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), (iv) transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), and (v) sequencing.</para>

      <para id="ch0047s0022p0001">The GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) is currently the only direct NAAT available in the United States that has FDA market authorization. It is a qualitative nested real-time PCR method that detects the MTBC and rifampin resistance in real time using molecular beacon probes. The assay is automated and can be performed under BSL-2 conditions. It requires minimal hands-on time (~2 minutes) and produces results in approximately 2 hours (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0118">118</link>). The Cepheid GeneXpert MTB/RIF is FDA cleared for smear-positive and smear-negative raw sputum and processed sputum sediments but can be validated for testing of extrapulmonary specimen types with variable sensitivity and specificity (<anchor id="ch0047s0022a0003"/><link linkend="ch0047s0022a0005">Tables 4</link> and <anchor id="ch0047s0022a0004"/><link linkend="ch0047s0022a0008">5</link>). An updated version of the assay, the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, has a lower limit of detection and a faster turnaround time, but this test is not available on the U.S. market (<link linkend="ch0047s0022a0005">Tables 4</link> and <link linkend="ch0047s0022a0008">5</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0047s0022p0002">Molbio Truenat MTB and MTB Plus assays (Goa, India) are real-time PCR assays performed on a chip (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0119">119</link>). They are intended for detection of MTBC directly from a specimen in about 1 hour, with positive samples being reflexed to a second Truenat MTB/RIF Dx assay for detection of rifampin resistance. While there are concerns about the low sensitivity of these assays (73% and 80% for the MTB and MTB Plus in sputum samples, and 84% for MTB-Rif resistance detection in positive samples), a recent study found performance comparable to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0120">120</link>). Notably, the assays also are semiquantitative, have high specificity, and are battery operated, meaning that they can be useful in lower-resourced countries without a consistent power supply (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0002">2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0047s0022p0003">Seegene (Seoul, South Korea) produces several real-time PCRs that can detect multiple targets simultaneously from a clinical specimen. Some of these have CE marking; none are FDA approved. One assay, the Anyplex MTB/NTMe Real-time assay, can directly detect MTBC and NTM. The sensitivity of this assay was higher for MTBC (64%) than for NTM (41%) compared to culture (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0121">121</link>). A similar assay called the Anyplex MTB/NTM Real-time assay was reported to have higher performance compared to culture (87% for MTBC and 74% for NTM) (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0122">122</link>). Another assay, the Anyplex II MTB/MDR, can detect MTBC and 25 mutations associated with rifampin and isoniazid resistance directly from clinical specimens, therefore providing more complete information about MDR TB than the Xpert MTB/RIF (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0123">123</link>).</para>

In the LPA process, nucleic acid is extracted from the sample and amplified by PCR. The amplicons are reverse-hybridized onto a nitrocellulose strip that is fixed with probes against specific target sequences within mycobacteria. The pattern of hybridization to the various target sequences allows for identification of the mycobacterial species and resistance markers. Results from LPAs may be obtained in as little as 5 hours, although the laboratory turnaround time is typically around 24 to 48 hours (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0128">128</link>).</para>

They are also considered an open system, and strict adherence to PCR workflow protocols, quality assurance, and utilization of external controls is critical to avoid amplicon contamination. Importantly, however, available LPAs can be used to identify multiple targets, such as the presence of other NTM, or even the presence of multiple mutations associated with drug resistance, such as resistance to rifampin, isoniazid, and second-line antimycobacterials (<link linkend="ch0047s0021a0005">Table 3</link>). There are several manufacturers of LPAs for identification of MTBC and/or its drug resistance markers (<link linkend="ch0047s0021a0005">Table 3</link>). These assays are not FDA-market authorized in the U.S., but some are endorsed by the WHO, have CE marking in Europe, or have approval for use in other regions.

      <para id="ch0047s0031p0002">Because of the nature of the mycobacterial cell wall, an extraction step is needed before the organism is spotted onto the target plate.

It is important to verify that the extraction procedure kills MTBC with a well-designed inactivation study. The extracted proteins are then spotted onto the plate.

However, the members of the MTBC cannot be differentiated by this method. Also, MALDI-TOF MS requires a large biomass, and therefore subculture to solid media and incubation for 1 to 3 weeks for MTBC may be necessary, resulting in a delay of identification. Studies on the identification of mycobacteria directly from positive liquid media, such as BD BACTEC MGIT (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or VersaTREK Myco broth (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cleveland, OH), have shown variable results, but may be more accurate for MTBC compared to the NTM (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0163">163</link>–<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0165">165</link>). It is important to ensure that cultures are pure, as mixed cultures can result in no identification or, more frequently, in incorrect identifications.

Whole blood samples are centrifuged to separate out the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which are washed and then counted to achieve a standard number of PBMCs per patient. While this can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, using a fixed number of cells provides comparable and consistent results across samples, even in patients with low lymphocyte levels.

A set of 43 spacers is used in standard spoligotyping assays, each of which is PCR amplified and then reverse hybridized onto a membrane. The presence or absence of each unique spacer results in a banding pattern that is read out as a 43-digit barcode, which is then translated into a 15-digit code (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0215">215</link>–<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0217">217</link>).

The allele for each gene is assigned, and each isolate is then characterized according to its unique allelic profile. A study comparing spoligotyping, MLST, and MIRU-VNTR was performed to evaluate the discriminatory power among the three methods to assess the genetic diversity of <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis>. Of the three methods, MLST provided the least discriminatory power while MIRU-VNTR demonstrated the greatest (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0220">220</link>). However, more recently, Kohl et al. improved the assay by developing a WGS approach with a new set of 2,891 core loci for the MTBC, using a range of <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> strains as well as other members of the complex.

A 3-year study in Europe genotyped MTBC isolates with both cgMLST and SNP-based WGS methods.

      <para id="ch0047s0042p0003">The higher resolution of WGS compared to conventional typing methods allows additional insight into the transmission dynamics of TB within communities since it facilitates the detection of clusters and possible transmission pathways with greater confidence (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0225">225</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0226">226</link>); for example, transmission of strains like the Beijing lineage that are poorly differentiated by other methods (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0226">226</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0227">227</link>).

Determining the most suitable algorithm for a laboratory is dependent on multiple factors, such as sample volume, the availability of appropriate facilities (e.g., a BSL-3 laboratory), staffing levels, technical skill, and the patient population served (e.g., high- versus low-prevalence settings) (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0004">4</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0047s0042s0001p0002">Ultimately, any methods and algorithms used should aim to detect or rule out MTBC as quickly as possible. Almost all hospital-based laboratories should offer rapid testing to detect or rule out MTBC, such as NAAT testing directly from specimen. However, providing a full scope of mycobacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is neither necessary nor appropriate for most hospital-based clinical microbiology laboratories. These methods are highly labor-intensive and require experienced and dedicated staff, so many clinical laboratories choose to refer part or all of these services to reference or PHLs (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0233">233</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0047s0042s0001p0003">Timely reporting of results to health care providers is essential for effective treatment and management of patients. CDC guidelines recommend that AFB smears be reported within 24 hours (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0233">233</link>). Additional reports should be issued when growth is first seen from solid or liquid media, when an identification of the mycobacterium is made, and, finally, when susceptibility testing is completed. For MTBC, the CDC guideline states that identification from culture should be reported within 21 days of specimen receipt in the laboratory and that first-line drug susceptibilities should be reported within ≤28 days of the identification of MTBC (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0087">87</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0233">233</link>). These goals represent a challenge for laboratories, with only 49% of PHLs receiving samples within 1 day of collection, 89% reporting a smear result within 1 day of receipt, and 72% generating an identification of MTBC within 21 days of receipt (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0087">87</link>). Barriers to meeting these turnaround times include staffing, funding, laboratory operations that are not 24/7, long delivery times, delayed specimen shipments, batch shipments or testing, and limitations with information technology (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0087">87</link>). The increasing implementation of molecular methods can help decrease the overall turnaround time of MTBC detection and any associated drug resistance.</para>
        <para id="ch0047s0042s0001p0004">Reporting to public health programs is also necessary for interrupting transmission of MTBC at the community and national levels. In addition to other health care providers, laboratory directors are responsible for ensuring that suspected or confirmed results for MTBC in (i) smears, (ii) cultures, (iii) any other assays such as NAATs, and (iv) genotype (if available) are reported to their state or local TB programs within 24 hours (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0234">234</link>). Referral laboratories should supply all necessary information to the originating laboratory, for the latter to also comply with these requirements for testing performed out-of-state (<link linkend="ch0047s0042s0002li0234">234</link>). It is incumbent on the clinical laboratories to be aware of the TB reporting requirements (statutes, administrative code, and regulations) in their jurisdiction.</para>
