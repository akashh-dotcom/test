      <para id="ch0089s0000p0001">Antimicrobial chemotherapy has played a vital role in the treatment of human infectious diseases since the discovery of penicillin in the 1920s. Hundreds of antimicrobial agents have been developed, and multiple agents in a variety of classes are currently available for clinical use. However, the sheer numbers and continuing development of agents make it difficult for clinicians to keep up with progress in the field. Similarly, this variety presents significant challenges for clinical microbiologists, who must decide which agents are appropriate for inclusion in routine and specialized susceptibility testing.</para>
      <para id="ch0089s0000p0002">This chapter provides an overview of the antibacterial agents currently marketed in the United States, with major emphasis on their mechanisms of action, spectra of activity, important pharmacologic parameters, and toxicities. Selected agents not available in the United States are briefly mentioned as well. Antibiotics that have fallen into disuse or remained investigational are mentioned only briefly.</para>

      <para id="ch0089s0000p0004">The major antibacterial action of penicillins is derived from their ability to inhibit multiple bacterial enzymes, namely, penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), that catalyze the last steps of peptidoglycan synthesis (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0089s0000li0002">2</link>). This ability to inhibit bacterial cell wall enzymes, such as the transpeptidases, usually confers bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria. This activity of the penicillins is often related to their ability to trigger membrane-associated autolytic enzymes that destroy the cell wall.</para>
      <para id="ch0089s0000p0005">Penicillins also can bind to bacterial endopeptidases, to bacterial carboxypeptidases, and to bifunctional PBPs with both transpeptidase and transglycosylase activities, enzymes involved in bacterial cell division (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0003">3</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0089s0000p0006">Levels of oral absorption differ markedly among the penicillins. As a natural congener of benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), phenoxymethyl penicillin (penicillin V) resists gastric acid inactivation and is better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract than is penicillin G. Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic analog of ampicillin and has greater gastrointestinal absorption than ampicillin (95% versus 40% absorption). The isoxazolyl penicillins (also referred to as antistaphylococcal penicillins) cloxacillin and dicloxacillin are acid stable and are also absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, allowing for oral administration. Nafcillin and oxacillin are administered only intravenously.</para>
      <para id="ch0089s0000p0007">Repository forms of penicillin G, available in procaine or benzathine, delay absorption from an intramuscular depot. Procaine penicillin G provides detectable levels for 12 to 24 h, while benzathine penicillin G achieves only very low levels in blood for prolonged periods (3 to 4 weeks) and is useful for the therapy of syphilis and for prophylaxis of streptococcal pharyngitis and rheumatic fever.</para>
      <para id="ch0089s0000p0008">Penicillins are well distributed to many body compartments, including lung, liver, kidney, muscle, bone, and placenta. Penetration into the eye, brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and prostate is poor in the absence of inflammation. These drugs are metabolized to a small degree and are rapidly excreted, essentially unchanged, via the kidney. With average half-lives of 0.5 to 1.5 h, they are usually administered every 4 to 6 h to maintain effective blood levels. The renal tubular excretion of penicillins can be blocked by probenecid; thus, their half-lives in serum are prolonged, though this is rarely done in clinical practice. Recommended dosage reductions for many penicillins begin in patients who demonstrate a creatinine clearance of less than 50 ml/min, with alterations being made to either the dose, the frequency of administration, or both. Dosages of all penicillins except nafcillin, oxacillin, and dicloxacillin are adjusted for hemodialysis. Many penicillins also require significant dosage adjustments for peritoneal dialysis.</para>

Penicillin G is the drug of choice for treatment of syphilis and <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> infections. Penicillin V has a spectrum of activity similar to that of penicillin G. Both drugs are drugs of choice for the treatment of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis and for the primary and secondary prevention of rheumatic fever (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0007">7</link>). Penicillinase-resistant penicillins, of which oxacillin, nafcillin, and dicloxacillin are the three in clinical use, are effective primarily against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. The agents are at least 25 times more active than other penicillins against penicillinase-positive staphylococci. Although they are also active against fully penicillin-susceptible <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. pyogenes</emphasis>, their MICs for these organisms are higher than those of penicillin G. They are not active against enterococci, members of the order <emphasis>Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas</emphasis> spp., or members of the <emphasis>Bacillus fragilis</emphasis> group. Mecillinam and temocillin, two penicillins not currently available in the United States, have increased stability to hydrolysis by β-lactamases, including some extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). However, their increased enzymatic stability is balanced by the loss of activity against Gram-positive bacteria.</para>

Severe anaphylactic reactions, which can be fatal, may occur in previously sensitized patients rechallenged with penicillins, but fortunately, such reactions are quite rare. At high doses (usually &gt;30 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> U/day), penicillin G can cause myoclonic twitching and seizures due to central nervous system toxicity. All of the penicillins may cause interstitial nephritis due to an allergic reaction. Hepatitis has been associated with prolonged use of oxacillin. High doses of many of the currently available penicillin formulations are associated with considerable sodium loads that have rarely been linked to hypokalemia. Neutropenia may occur with any of the penicillins, particularly when administered at high doses for longer than several weeks. Thrombocytopenia and Coombs test-positive hemolytic anemia are rare complications of penicillin therapy. Bleeding tendencies due to interference with platelet function can occur with the use of carboxypenicillins and ureidopenicillins (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0011">11</link>).

Cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefprozil, cefuroxime axetil, cefdinir, cefditoren pivoxil, cefixime, cefpodoxime proxetil, and ceftibuten can be dosed orally with good gastrointestinal absorption (60 to 90% of the oral dose). Cefuroxime axetil is an acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime, and it is de-esterified at the intestinal mucosa and absorbed into the bloodstream as cefuroxime. Cefditoren pivoxil and cefpodoxime proxetil are prodrugs that are absorbed and hydrolyzed by esterases <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> to release the active drugs cefditoren and cefpodoxime, respectively. Relatively high concentrations of these agents are attained across the placenta and in synovial, pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal fluids. Levels in bile are usually high, especially with the injectable ceftriaxone, which has significant biliary excretion. The parenteral cephalosporins cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime penetrate into the CSF and are useful for the treatment of meningitis. Cefuroxime penetrates inflamed meninges, but levels in CSF are inadequate for providing bactericidal activity against susceptible bacteria.</para>

Like that of the penicillins, the renal excretion of cephalosporins, except for ceftriaxone, is impeded by probenecid. In general, these agents are removed by hemodialysis but not by peritoneal dialysis.

The narrow-spectrum cephems (cephalosporin I or first-generation cephalosporins), exemplified by cephalexin and cefazolin, have good Gram-positive activity and relatively modest Gram-negative activity. They are active against penicillin-susceptible <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> as well as penicillin-susceptible <emphasis>S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes</emphasis>, and other aerobic and anaerobic streptococci. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci are resistant to most cephalosporins, including these narrow-spectrum agents, although penicillinase-producing non-MRSA (methicillin-susceptible <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> [MSSA]) isolates are susceptible. Some <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>, including non-β-lactamase-producing strains of <emphasis>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Proteus mirabilis</emphasis>, are susceptible. <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> spp., including <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>, many <emphasis>Proteus</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Serratia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Enterobacter</emphasis> spp. are resistant. These agents are active against penicillin-susceptible anaerobes except members of the <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> group. They have only modest activity against <emphasis>H. influenzae</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="ch0089s0000p0020">The broad-spectrum (cephalosporin II or second-generation) cephalosporins, cefuroxime and cefprozil, are stable against some β-lactamases found in Gram-negative bacteria and, as a result, have increased activity against Gram-negative organisms. Although these agents are more active than narrow-spectrum drugs against<emphasis>E. coli, Klebsiella</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Proteus</emphasis> spp., and some <emphasis>Enterobacter</emphasis> and <emphasis>Serratia</emphasis> strains, they are hydrolyzed by plasmid-encoded ESBLs and carbapenemases now produced by many <emphasis>Enterobacterales.</emphasis> They have good activity against <emphasis>Haemophilus</emphasis> spp., including ampicillin-resistant <emphasis>H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria</emphasis> spp., and many anaerobes (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0089s0000li0018">18</link>). None of these agents has useful antimicrobial activity against <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> spp.</para>
      <para id="ch0089s0000p0021">Cefoxitin and cefotetan belong to a chemically unique group of expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (cephamycins) that have marked activity against anaerobes, including members of the<emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> group, though resistance within the <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> group to the cephamycins is increasingly problematic (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0089s0000li0020">20</link>). Cefotetan is two to four times less active than cefoxitin against Gram-positive cocci, but it is more potent than cefoxitin against susceptible <emphasis>Enterobacterales.</emphasis> The two cephamycins are equally active against <emphasis>H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis>, including penicillin-resistant strains. While these drugs are comparable in their activities against the <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> group, cefoxitin is more active than cefotetan against <emphasis>Prevotella</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Porphyromonas</emphasis> spp., and Gram-positive anaerobic cocci. Cefotetan has the advantage of a more prolonged half-life in serum. Both molecules are also stable against ESBLs produced by a variety of <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>, though their clinical utility for infections due to these organisms remains uncertain.</para>
      <para id="ch0089s0000p0022">Expanded-spectrum (cephalosporin III or third-generation) cephalosporins are generally less active than the narrow-spectrum agents against Gram-positive cocci, but they are much more active against the<emphasis>Enterobacterales.</emphasis> Their expanded spectrum of activity against Gram-negative organisms is due primarily to their stability to low-level production of chromosomal β-lactamases and to the early plasmid-encoded penicillinases (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0010">10</link>). They are also notable for their ability to pass through the outer cell envelopes of Gram-negative bacilli (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0089s0000li0022">22</link>). There are two subclasses among these agents: those with potent activity against <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> (ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime, and ceftolozane) and those without such activity (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and the oral agents in this subclass). Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, however, are more potent against streptococci than the other expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, while the Gram-positive activity of ceftazidime and ceftolozane is clinically marginal. All the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins are hydrolyzed by ESBLs and carbapenemases that may be found in Gram-negative pathogens. Ceftazidime combined with the β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam is able to counteract the effects of many of these enzymes, with the exception of a few OXA-type enzymes or metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) (see below).</para>

Causes of the coagulopathy include (i) alteration of the healthy gut biota by the antibiotics, with inhibition of the synthesis of vitamin K and its precursors, and (ii) the <emphasis>N</emphasis>-methylthiotetrazole side chain, which inhibits the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase enzyme responsible for converting clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X to their active forms and also prevents regeneration of active vitamin K from its inactive form (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0047">47</link>). Also of note has been the recent recognition of neurotoxicity, which manifests primarily as impaired consciousness in patients with impaired renal function who are receiving high doses of cefepime (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0048">48</link>). In July 2012, the U.S. prescribing information was updated to reflect concerns regarding increased seizure risk with use of cefepime at high doses, again particularly in older patients with decreased renal function. Use of cefepime had at one time been linked to an increased risk of mortality for the treatment of febrile neutropenia (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0049">49</link>), but a meta-analysis of larger and more recent databases performed by the FDA does not support that claim (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0089s0000li0051">51</link>). However, an increase in all-cause mortality attributed to cefiderocol was observed in patients in the CREDIBLE-CR clinical trial compared to those treated with the best available therapy for the treatment of serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Numerically more deaths occurred in the cefiderocol arm of that trial, mainly in the subset of patients infected with <emphasis>Acinetobacter</emphasis> spp. It is important to note that this was a small trial, the patients were critically ill, and these challenges with <emphasis>Acinetobacter</emphasis> were not seen in the larger phase 3 pneumonia trial (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0052">52</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0089s0000p0082">Aminoglycosides are bactericidal agents that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding irreversibly to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. The aminoglycoside-bound bacterial ribosomes then become unavailable for translation of mRNA during protein synthesis, thereby leading to cell death (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0158">158</link>). The aminoglycosides also cause misreading of the genetic code, with resultant production of nonsense proteins. To reach the intracellular ribosomal binding targets, an aerobic energy-dependent process is necessary to enable successful penetration of the bacterial inner cell membrane by the aminoglycosides. The requirement of an aerobic environment for this step accounts for the aminoglycosides’ lack of activity against anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial uptake of these agents is facilitated by inhibitors of bacterial cell wall synthesis, such as β-lactams and vancomycin. This interaction forms the basis of antibacterial synergism between aminoglycosides and β-lactam antibiotics. There are three known mechanisms of bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides: (i) decreased intracellular accumulation of the antibiotic by alteration of the outer membrane’s permeability, decreasing inner membrane transport, or active efflux; (ii) modification of the target site by mutation of the ribosomal proteins or 16S RNA or posttranscriptional methylation of 16S RNA (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0159">159</link>); and (iii) enzymatic modification of the drug (the most common resistance mechanism) (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0160">160</link>).</para>

Hypotension, prolonged duration of therapy, preexisting renal insufficiency, and possibly excessive trough serum aminoglycoside concentrations increase the risk of nephrotoxicity with these agents. The recent publication of the head-to-head comparison of plazomicin with meropenem for complicated urinary tract infections offers a contemporary evaluation of the nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides when using optimized PK/PD dosing for short durations in non-critically ill patients (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0171">171</link>).

The congeners form three groups based on their durations of action. Tetracycline is a short-acting drug, demeclocycline is an intermediate-acting drug, and doxycycline and minocycline are long-acting drugs. Demeclocycline is used mostly for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and is not routinely used for its antibacterial properties. Glycylcyclines are a group of semisynthetic tetracycline derivatives containing a glycylamido substitution at position 9. Tigecycline (a 9-<emphasis>t</emphasis>-butylglycylamido derivative of minocycline) was the first glycylcycline available for clinical use (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0213">213</link>).

They enter bacteria by an energy-dependent process and bind reversibly to the 30S ribosomal subunits, preventing the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal acceptor A site in the RNA-ribosome complex (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0218">218</link>, <link linkend="ch0089s0000li0219">219</link>). Resistance to tetracyclines occurs among clinical isolates as a result of active efflux of the drug from the cell, an altered ribosomal target site that prevents binding of the drug (ribosomal protection), or production of modifying enzymes that inactivate the drug. With stearic hindrance from the bulky side group at position 9, glycylcyclines are unaffected by bacterial ribosomal protection proteins and evade most efflux pumps present in tetracycline-resistant strains.

Ingestion of food, especially dairy products, and other substances, such as divalent- and trivalent-cation-containing antacids and iron preparations, impairs the absorption of these drugs; these challenges remain with the oral formulation of omadacycline. Less interference with absorption by foods occurs with doxycycline and minocycline. Minocycline and doxycycline are readily absorbed, and therefore lower doses are required. Peak concentrations in serum of 3 to 5 μg/ml are reached in 2 h after standard oral dosages. Intravenous preparations are available, and peak concentrations in serum of 3 to 9 μg/ml are reached in 1 h after intravenous administration, depending on the tetracycline infused and the dose (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0224">224</link>).

Doxycycline is eliminated unchanged in the urine, and 35 to 60% of the dose is recovered in the urine.

Pleuromutilins were first identified in the 1950s after being isolated from the mushroom <emphasis>Clitophilus scyphoides.</emphasis> The first agent from this class for human use was retapamulin, which became available for topical use in the late 1990s. Toxicity and other considerations limited the development of the class for systemic use until the approval of lefamulin (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0429">429</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0089s0000p0228">Lefamulin is available for oral and intravenous use. Bioavailability of the oral formulation is approximately 25%, and this is reflected in the 4-fold difference between the intravenous and oral doses (150 mg intravenously versus 600 mg orally) (<link linkend="ch0089s0000li0428">428</link>). An intravenous dose of 150 mg results in a peak serum concentration of approximately 3.5 μg/ml, with an AUC that is equivalent to that seen with the 600-mg oral dose. Food reduces the AUC and peak of the oral formulation by 20%. The drug is highly bound to serum proteins, with approximately 5% of serum concentrations being free drug. Lefamulin diffuses well into epithelial lining fluid with an epithelial lining fluid AUC/free serum AUC ratio of 15. It has a half-life of nearly 8 h and is hepatically metabolized through cytochrome P450 3A, with 75% of the dose excreted in the feces, primarily as metabolites. Due to this mechanism of elimination, dosage changes are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment and the drug is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic failure. Careful monitoring for drug interactions due to either inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A is warranted. Lefamulin also appears to be a mild inhibitor of CYP3A based on its ability to increase the AUC of midazolam by 200%.</para>

Activity against the <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> and non-lactose-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli is lacking, likely due to efflux mechanisms.

Nausea and vomiting were also numerically more common in the lefamulin arm than the comparator arm. Lefamulin has the potential to prolong the QTc interval, and coadministration with other agents that prolong the QTc interval should be avoided. Finally, the prescribing information also states that based on animal studies, lefamulin is potentially embryo-fetus toxic and should be avoided in pregnant women.</para>

Several factors can influence the level of antimicrobial agent in individual patients, including inherent differences in the patients themselves, their physical condition, the dosages, and the routes of administration. The values can also be influenced by the assay methods used to obtain them. Therefore, these concentrations should be used only as approximate values, and clinicians should use their knowledge of the patient and the drugs, the recommendations from U.S. FDA-approved package inserts, or other reputable sources in planning their therapeutic regimens.</para>
