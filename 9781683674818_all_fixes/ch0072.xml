        <para id="ch0072s0000p0001">Anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming bacilli (rods) are widely distributed among the phyla<emphasis>Actinomycetota</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Actinobacteria</emphasis>) and <emphasis>Bacillota</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis>). Even though these phyla include both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, this chapter focuses on the latter, although a number of these bacteria are also facultative. Additionally, some members of this group of bacteria can stain Gram negative despite possessing a Gram-positive cell wall. It should also be noted that rare species within these taxonomic groups are spore forming and are included in this chapter. Many anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods have undergone some degree of taxonomic reclassification over the years because of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. However, since the publication of the last edition of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>, phylogenomic analyses resulting from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies have resulted in the wide-scale taxonomic reclassification of numerous genera in this chapter. Nevertheless, despite this taxonomic reclassification, so long as a previously used name remains validly published it can continue to be used.</para>
        <para id="ch0072s0000p0002">The number of genera within the broad category of anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods is vast. Thus, bacteria discussed in this chapter are limited to those isolated from human sources and considered validly published; invalidly published bacteria in this group are not discussed. Finally, metagenomic characterization of the human microbiome by next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods has continued to lead to the discovery of novel genera within both phyla<emphasis>Actinomycetota</emphasis> and <emphasis>Bacillota.</emphasis> This group of bacteria will therefore continue to expand as metagenomics is applied in even wider settings.</para>

        <para id="ch0072s0000p0004">The large degree of taxonomic heterogeneity among members of the genus<emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> has been recognized for some time. At the time of writing, there are over 30 officially recognized species of <emphasis>Actinomyces.</emphasis> Phylogenomic analyses have led to the recent reclassification of many <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> species into seven new genera, with the clinically important pathogens being limited to five genera (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0001">1</link>).

The genus <emphasis>Propionibacterium</emphasis> previously contained bacteria isolated both from human sources and dairy products (i.e., so-called “classical propionibacteria”). However, recognition that the cutaneous species form a distinct clade within this genus led to significant taxonomic reclassification of this genus (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0011">11</link>).

P. lymphophilum</emphasis> appears as both club-shaped rods and coccoid forms, while <emphasis>P. innocua</emphasis> is a pleomorphic rod that is arranged in clusters and V forms. Of the three newly described genera in the family <emphasis>Propionibacteriaceae</emphasis> isolated from humans, <emphasis>Enemella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Parenemella</emphasis> generally appear as coccobacilli (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0015">15</link>), whereas cells of <emphasis>Vaginimicrobium</emphasis> are pleomorphic or club-shaped rods that tend to appear singly (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0016">16</link>).</para>

The phylogenetic relationship between the diverse species within this genus was previously recognized as complicated and in need of additional studies to better illuminate the classification of lactobacilli.

As a result, this genus was, and is, incredibly phylogenetically diverse. Many <emphasis>Eubacterium</emphasis> species have subsequently been reassigned to other previously described, as well as novel, genera. Alternatively named members of the genus <emphasis>Eubacterium</emphasis> are therefore now widely distributed among many orders within the phylum <emphasis>Bacillota.

Both are rod-shaped bacteria, but the latter is arranged as pairs or clumps. Many <emphasis>Eubacterium</emphasis> species are closely related to clostridia.

        <para id="ch0072s0000p0020">Most Gram-positive anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods are members of the commensal microbiota found on and within the mucocutaneous surfaces of the human body (i.e., orogastrointestinal and urogenital tracts as well as the skin). While certain bacteria within this group are associated with a healthy microbiome, dysbiosis (i.e., imbalance) of this microbiome can be associated with the presence of a disease state (e.g., bacterial vaginosis [BV]). The roles that individual bacterial species play in promoting dysbiosis and disease states are only beginning to be elucidated. Where members of this group cause infections, the host itself is the most likely source. Infections with the commensal microbiotas of others can occur in the case of infections resulting from bite wounds (human or animal) or clenched-fist injuries from striking the face and mouth (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0083">83</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0072s0000p0021">Infections with non-spore-forming, anaerobic, Gram-positive rods can occur when these bacteria gain access to privileged sites. These bacteria seldom cause infections alone and are instead usually involved in polymicrobial infections associated with mucosal surfaces (<anchor id="ch0072s0000a0015"/><link linkend="ch0072s0000a0023">Table 1</link>). Many anaerobes involved in infections of the head and neck originate from the oral cavity, whereas most vaginal and bladder infections with these bacteria are of fecal origin. With intra-abdominal infections due to organ perforation, the organisms present depend on the microbiota present at the site of leakage. For surgical patients, anaerobes are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Anaerobic bacteria can occasionally spread to adjacent tissues and the bloodstream, with serious consequences, with anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods accounting for up to one-quarter of bacteremia due to anaerobes (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0084">84</link>). For anaerobic bacteremia, the gastrointestinal tract (GI) is the most common source, followed by abscesses, gynecologic infections, and wound infections. The incidence and range of anaerobic, Gram-positive rods found in blood cultures may be underestimated, because many of these bacteria are slow growing and have fastidious nutritional requirements in contrast to <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species and <emphasis>Bacteroides fragilis</emphasis>, which grow readily and rapidly in commonly used broth media (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0085">85</link>).</para>

However, infection can result when these bacteria are introduced into deeper tissues because of trauma or surgery or when the mucosal surface is damaged by the presence of foreign material. Actinomycosis is a granulomatous disease that occurs more frequently in adult patients, though it can also be found in children (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0087">87</link>). It is often associated with the presence of sinus tracts and is typically diagnosed based on clinical and histopathologic evaluation. Actinomycosis is classically associated with the presence of sulfur granules, though sulfur granules may not always be present in pus. When visualized microscopically, sulfur granules have characteristic aggregates of branching Gram-positive rods, surrounded predominantly by polymorphonuclear cells (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0088">88</link>). Nevertheless, actinomycosis is almost universally polymicrobial in nature: 94.5% of cases of cervicofacial actinomycosis had other bacteria coisolated, with 47.6% of cases having both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria coisolated (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0089">89</link>). It is estimated that 75 to 95% of actinomycosis cases overall have other bacteria present, with <emphasis>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</emphasis> and anginosus group streptococci being commonly coisolated in addition to other aerobes and/or anaerobes (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0090">90</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0072s0000p0023">Actinomycosis is commonly categorized into orocervicofacial, thoracic, and abdominopelvic forms. Orocervical is the most common form of actinomycosis and accounts for over 50% of all actinomycosis cases. Poor dentition and oral hygiene are risk factors for infection, which can occur secondary to untreated dental caries, dental extraction, or trauma. The hard palate is an uncommon site for actinomycosis. Bisphosphate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with these organisms has been reported, which can be observed among oncology patients (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0091">91</link>). Thoracic actinomycosis is believed to occur secondary to aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, though it can also result from either hematogenous or direct spread from other local sites. The diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis is frequently delayed on account of its nonspecific initial clinical presentation. One study reported that one-third of thoracic actinomycosis cases were initially misdiagnosed as malignancy (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0092">92</link>). In addition to lung cancer, the differential diagnosis for thoracic actinomycosis includes pneumonia and tuberculosis. The disease can progress to empyema necessitatis, wherein abscess formation occurs on the thoracic wall with subsequent erosion and invasion of the surrounding bone structures (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0093">93</link>). The majority of pelvic infections are found in women using intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0094">94</link>).

          <para id="ch0072s0000p0024">Among the current and alternatively named members of the genus<emphasis>Actinomyces, Actinomyces israelii, A. gerencseriae, A. graevenitzii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>A. propionica</emphasis> are believed to be most associated with classic actinomycosis (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0088">88</link>). It is important to note that these bacteria can also cause actinomycosis beyond just classical actinomycosis; cutaneous, musculoskeletal, pericarditis, and central nervous system (CNS) infections, as well as disseminated disease, have all been previously observed. Keratitis, endophthalmitis, and canaliculitis due to these bacteria have also been described. The importance of current and alternatively named members of <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> as agents of granulomatous breast infections is an emerging clinical entity (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0096">96</link>). A variety of species are associated with breast abscesses and, when isolated, more frequently occur as constituents of a polymicrobial culture (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0097">97</link>). These bacteria are also associated with a variety of dental and oral infections, including dental caries, endodontic infections, odontogenic abscesses, and dental implant-associated infections (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0098">98</link>–<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0101">101</link>). Oral <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and alternatively named <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> species can be detected in the bloodstream following dental procedures (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0102">102</link>). These bacteria can also be frequently isolated from sputum samples of adult cystic fibrosis patients when anaerobic culture methods are used, though the clinical significance of this finding is unclear (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0103">103</link>). Finally, these organisms are causes of genitourinary infections (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0104">104</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0072s0000p0025">The species most frequently isolated from clinical infections within this group are<emphasis>Schaalia turicensis, Schaalia radingae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>W. neuii</emphasis> and are found in a range of soft tissue infections including perianal, groin, axillary, breast, and periauricular abscesses (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0105">105</link>). <emphasis>Gleimia europaea, Schaalia funkei, Schaalia georgiae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>A. timonensis</emphasis> are also isolated from similar soft tissue infections. In addition, <emphasis>A. naeslundii</emphasis> and <emphasis>A. israelii</emphasis> have been isolated from infected hip prostheses (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0106">106</link>). Several <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> species (and alternatively named species), including <emphasis>Schaalia cardiffensis, A. gerencseriae, A. naeslundii, Schaalia odontolytica</emphasis>, and <emphasis>A. urogenitalis</emphasis>, have been associated with infections of IUDs, though <emphasis>A. israelii</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. turicensis</emphasis> are most commonly implicated (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0107">107</link>–<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0109">109</link>). <emphasis>Schaalia meyeri</emphasis> has been shown to have a predilection for causing pulmonary actinomycosis, and dissemination to other organs has been observed (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0092">92</link>). Pericarditis caused by <emphasis>A. israelii</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. meyeri</emphasis> has been reported (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0110">110</link>). Due to the small numbers of human clinical isolates reported to date, the natural habitats, and clinical associations of <emphasis>A. dentalis, Gleimia hominis, P. hongkongensis, B. nasicola, A. oricola</emphasis>, and <emphasis>A. radicidentis</emphasis> have yet to be fully determined.</para>
          <para id="ch0072s0000p0026">One major caveat in our understanding of the epidemiology of actinomycosis is that the majority of published studies did not use molecular methods for species identification (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0089">89</link>). Thus, described species-level disease associations should be interpreted cautiously. In one study in which all <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> strains isolated from invasive specimens were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the following observations were made (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0111">111</link>). <emphasis>A. graevenitzii</emphasis> was recovered only from lung fluids or tissues and not from any other source. All <emphasis>S. radingae</emphasis> strains were isolated from skin and soft tissue infections of the thoracic region, and the majority of <emphasis>W. neuii</emphasis> strains from skin and soft tissue abscesses, the latter finding having been confirmed independently (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0112">112</link>). <emphasis>W. neuii</emphasis> has also been associated with a wide variety of infections, including late periprosthetic joint infection of the shoulder (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0113">113</link>), bacteremia, and postoperative endophthalmitis (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0112">112</link>). Most bloodstream infections were due to <emphasis>S. odontolytica. A. israelii</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. meyeri</emphasis> were isolated from CNS infections (e.g., brain abscesses). With the application of 16S rRNA gene PCR followed by NGS to brain abscess specimens, <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and alternatively named members of the genus were commonly detected (most frequently <emphasis>S. meyeri</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0114">114</link>). However, the clinical significance of this molecular detection is not entirely clear, as many of these patients did not have the organism isolated in culture, and were therefore not specifically treated for <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis>, yet had favorable outcomes. It is apparent that additional species of this group of bacteria remain to be described, with 18% of isolates from pulmonary fluids and blood cultures being undescribed species (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0111">111</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0072s0000p0027"><emphasis>Actinotignum schaalii</emphasis> is the species most frequently implicated in human disease among the genera <emphasis>Actinotignum</emphasis> and <emphasis>Actinobaculum.</emphasis> Bacteremia, endocarditis, Fournier’s gangrene, abscesses, cellulitis, discitis, and spondylodiscitis have also been reported (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0115">115</link>–<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0117">117</link>). Most reported infections involve the urinary tract, with infections most commonly encountered in the elderly. However, some evidence suggests that this bacterium may also cause urinary tract infection (UTI) among pediatric patients (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0118">118</link>). <emphasis>A. schaalii</emphasis> also appears to be a member of the urinary microbiota, which can complicate interpretation of its significance when isolated from urine culture (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0119">119</link>). These bacteria have also been detected from swabs of the genitourinary area but not fecal swabs (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0120">120</link>). Importantly, the true prevalence of urinary tract infection due to this group of bacteria is likely to be underestimated, as isolation <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> requires incubation for at least 48 h in the presence of CO<subscript>2</subscript>, neither of which conditions are not routinely employed by most clinical laboratories performing urine cultures.</para>
          <para id="ch0072s0000p0028">Physicians may not be familiar with the clinical significance of these organisms and thus may not consider their isolation in blood culture significant (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0121">121</link>). An additional issue hindering recognition of these organisms as agents of infection is that phenotypic identification systems have traditionally been unable to accurately identify these organisms. <emphasis>A. schaalii</emphasis> bacteremia is associated with a mortality rate of 16%, with over 50% of patients experiencing severe sepsis. However, this finding may be due to the advanced age and comorbidities among many of the patients who develop infection with this bacterium (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0122">122</link>). <emphasis>A. massiliense</emphasis> is associated with soft tissue abscesses, with a single case report of pelvic inflammatory disease reported (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0123">123</link>). <emphasis>Actinotignum urinale</emphasis> has been isolated from a patient with chronic renal failure (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0124">124</link>), and cases of <emphasis>A. urinale</emphasis> and <emphasis>A. sanguinis</emphasis> bacteremia have been reported (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0122">122</link>).</para>

While these bacteria are frequently dismissed as contaminants by clinical laboratories, appreciation for their role as agents of infection has increased in recent years (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0137">137</link>). In particular, the ability of <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> to form biofilms on the surface of foreign material within the body has been extensively described. <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> has emerged as an important cause of neurosurgical shunt infections as well as an agent of infections associated with breast implants, intraocular lenses (keratitis), and cardiac devices (i.e., prosthetic-valve endocarditis and implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD] and pacemaker infections) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0138">138</link>–<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0141">141</link>). One-third of <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> endocarditis cases are complicated by intracardiac abscess formation, potentially as a result of delayed treatment due to the initial isolation of <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> being deemed insignificant (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0142">142</link>). Cases of native-valve endocarditis caused by <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> have also been reported (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0143">143</link>).

          <para id="ch0072s0000p0032">Arguably, it is the role of<emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> as a causative agent of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) that has garnered the most attention. These infections typically have a delayed onset (i.e., &gt;3 months after arthroplasty) and are indolent in presentation, with pain often being the only presenting symptom (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0149">149</link>). <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> colonizes the sebaceous glands and hair follicles, with a predilection for the upper body, and thus infections are observed more frequently in shoulders than in hips and knees (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0135">135</link>).

Interpretation of the significance of isolation of this bacterium from patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty is complicated by the fact that this organism can be readily isolated from the surgical incisions of patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty or revision arthroplasty procedures (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0152">152</link>), including from patients who had received antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0153">153</link>). Interestingly, isolates of <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> from deep sites differ from those isolated more superficially in terms of biofilm production abilities and appear to belong to different phylotypes and possibly even subspecies (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0154">154</link>). There has been some suggestion that the visualization of beta-hemolysis on sheep blood agar can distinguish deep isolates from those present due to contamination, though this has not been confirmed (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0155">155</link>).

Thus, the optimal incubation period and culture period for the isolation of <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> from prosthetic joint and blood culture specimens remains to be fully defined. Interestingly, some data suggest that extended incubation might not be required for the isolation of <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> from CSF specimens (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0343">343</link>). The potential reasons for these differences in apparent required incubation time are unclear.</para>

        <para id="ch0072s0000p0072">Traditionally, identification of bacterial isolates in clinical microbiology laboratories has been performed using phenotypic tests. Among the anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods, a number of organisms are known to be relatively inert and thus not reliably identified by phenotypic methods (e.g.,<emphasis>Eubacterium</emphasis> and closely related species). Nevertheless, many laboratories have for many years relied on commercially available phenotypic identification systems for the identification of anaerobes, which is now being superseded by MALDI-TOF MS. The advent of 16S rRNA gene sequencing has revealed that phenotypic identification methods can be problematic for certain anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing, taxonomic relationships have been revealed to be even more complex, though this method is not widely used by most clinical laboratories for organism identification.</para>

      <para id="ch0072s0000p0073">Initial characterization of an unknown isolate typically involves an assessment of aerotolerance (growth in air or in air plus 5% CO<subscript>2</subscript>), colonial morphology, the presence or absence of hemolysis, pigmentation, and fluorescence under long-wave UV illumination (365-nm wavelength). Colony morphology may provide clues regarding the organism involved; for instance, a “molar tooth” appearance is typical for <emphasis>A. israelii, A. gerencseriae, B. nasicola, A. oricola, A. propionica, S. wiggsiae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. nodatum</emphasis>, whereas colonies from other <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and alternatively named <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> members can exhibit a “breadcrumb” appearance (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0104">104</link>). <emphasis>A. graevenitzii</emphasis> may produce both molar-toothed and smooth, entire colonies. However, most species discussed in this chapter produce small, relatively nondescript colonies. A number of anaerobic, non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods are capable of fluorescence and/or pigment production: <emphasis>A. graevenitzii, A. propionica</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. lenta</emphasis> show orange or red fluorescence under UV light (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0174">174</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0344">344</link>), and pink/red pigmentation of colonies is typical for <emphasis>S. odontolytica</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0345">345</link>). However, other <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and alternatively named <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> spp. can also produce pigment, especially on rabbit laked blood agar, with <emphasis>A. graevenitzii</emphasis> appearing as nearly black, <emphasis>A. radicidentis</emphasis> as brown, and <emphasis>A. urogenitalis</emphasis> as reddish colonies (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0100">100</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0072s0000p0074">An assessment of Gram stain morphology can also contribute to a presumptive identification, although laboratorians should be aware of organisms that produce an unexpected Gram stain morphology or those that stain Gram negative either by nature or by being easily overdecolorized. Examples of this include more recently described nonbranching species of<emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0098">98</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0346">346</link>), as well as <emphasis>F. alocis</emphasis> and <emphasis>M. mulieris</emphasis>, which routinely stain Gram negative (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0072">72</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0347">347</link>). <emphasis>Actinotignum, Eubacterium</emphasis>, and other closely related species show Gram variability when older (&gt;3-day-old) cultures are used for staining. Overdecolorization of Gram-positive organisms can also occur due to exposure to oxygen or to damage from fixatives and reagents causing a breakdown of the physical integrity of the cell wall. Thus, limiting the time of exposure to oxygen between incubation and staining improves the reliability of the Gram stain for anaerobic bacteria (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0348">348</link>). Because of the possibility of overdecolorization, confirmation of the Gram reaction may be required using either the string test with a solution of 3% potassium hydroxide (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0349">349</link>) or use of special-potency antibiotic susceptibility disks (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0350">350</link>); Gram-positive species are generally resistant to colistin (10 μg) and susceptible to vancomycin (5 μg) and often to kanamycin (1 mg). The intrinsic resistance of some <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> species/strains, e.g., <emphasis>L. rhamnosus</emphasis>, to glycopeptides should be taken into consideration.</para>
      <para id="ch0072s0000p0075">Additional rapid tests for initial grouping of non-spore-forming, Gram-positive anaerobes include testing for production of catalase (H<subscript>2</subscript>O<subscript>2</subscript> at a concentration of 15%), indole, nitrate reduction, and motility (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0351">351</link>). Depending on the specimen site and the number of isolates recovered in culture, a presumptive identification to the genus level may suffice. Identification to the species level should ideally be performed whenever non-spore-forming anaerobic Gram-positive rods are present in pure cultures in clinical specimens or as the predominant organism from normally sterile sites.</para>

      <para id="ch0072s0000p0076">Identification of anaerobic, non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods to the species level historically involved phenotypic characterization based on sugar fermentation reactions and enzymatic profiles, the latter being performed with individual diagnostic tablets, fluorogenic substrate tests, or preformed enzyme kits. This approach has been shown to be problematic from several standpoints. First, insufficient growth and poor reproducibility of reactions cause difficulties in interpretation of results obtained with biochemical tests (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0100">100</link>). Use of young cultures and a heavy inoculum was recommended for biochemical testing, with extended incubation (up to 48 h) required for some strains. Second, changing taxonomy within this group of organisms led to the discovery that traditional biochemical approaches lack sufficient specificity for accurate identification in many cases. For example, members of the <emphasis>A. naeslundii</emphasis>/<emphasis>Actinomyces viscosus</emphasis> group cannot be individually differentiated by phenotypic tests alone. Biochemical reactions for a number of the genera discussed in this chapter are shown in <anchor id="ch0072s0000a0073"/><link linkend="ch0072s0000a0078">Tables 2</link> to 5. However, many of the papers upon which these tables are based reported results for only a single isolate or a limited number of isolates, and different reaction results have been observed in subsequent studies in a number of cases. Readers should also be aware that ascertaining reactions based on commercial phenotypic systems (described in the next paragraph) can vary from the results shown in <link linkend="ch0072s0000a0078">Tables 2</link> to 5.

However, use of this method also required extended incubation of the organism (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0351">351</link>). In addition, GLC analysis of cellular fatty acids and examination of protein patterns by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis have been used taxonomically to distinguish among strains within a species and among organisms within a genus or family. Despite its utility, GLC was not a method that was widely available in most clinical laboratories.</para>
      <para id="ch0072s0000p0078">For the aforementioned reasons, the availability of commercial identification systems for anaerobic bacteria was an important development in the ability of clinical laboratories to identify anaerobic bacteria. These systems, in essence, miniaturized the assessment of enzymatic and carbohydrate fermentation profiles. A variety of these are available from a number of manufacturers and include API ID 32A (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France), RapID Ana II (Remel, Lenexa, KS), BBL Crystal anaerobe ID kits (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems), and the Vitek 2 ANC ID card (bioMérieux). These systems have been historically adopted by many clinical laboratories, as they are easier to use and in many cases have a considerably shorter turnaround time than conventional phenotypic testing, with some systems requiring only a 4-h incubation. Like traditional biochemical methods, these systems typically require a heavy inoculum (3 to 4 McFarland optical density). A major limitation of these systems has been the lack of adequate representation of organisms in the database of reactions used to make the identification (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0353">353</link>). It is also important to note that the same analyte for a given isolate can produce different results when tested by different commercial systems.</para>
      <para id="ch0072s0000p0079">It is recommended that identification systems being validated for use in the clinical laboratory be capable of correctly identifying &gt;90% of the isolates tested (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0354">354</link>). However, the results of studies investigating the performance of these systems have showed variable performance for anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods, with reported species-level identification accuracies ranging from &lt;30% to &gt;90% for this group of bacteria depending on the study (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0355">355</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0356">356</link>). These studies have several limitations, including the lack of adequate representation of anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods being tested, including only organisms targeted by the system database, and using phenotypic rather than genotypic reference identification methods. Higher identification rates are reported when the organisms tested are limited to those contained within the database (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0355">355</link>). When the performance of the BBL Crystal anaerobe, RapID Ana II, and Vitek 2 ANC systems were directly compared for anaerobic Gram-positive non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods, these systems correctly identified the isolates tested to the species level in 29.4%, 35.3%, and 52.9% of cases, respectively, compared with GLC analysis (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0357">357</link>). Misidentification rates of 5.9%, 47.1%, and 11.8% were observed for these organisms with the BBL Crystal anaerobe, RapID Ana II, and Vitek 2 ANC systems, respectively. When the results of testing with the Vitek 2 ANC card were compared with those of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 60.1% and 79.4% of isolates tested were correctly identified to the genus and species levels, respectively (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0358">358</link>). While correct species-level identification rates of 90% were observed for organisms that are present within the database, a misidentification rate of 84% was observed for organisms tested that were not present in the system database, with only 47% correctly identified to the genus level (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0358">358</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0072s0000p0082">Although 16S rRNA gene sequencing has become the gold standard for organism identification, not all organisms can be taxonomically separated using the 16S rRNA gene. Thus, sequencing of other housekeeping genes (e.g.,<emphasis>metG</emphasis>) or even multilocus sequence typing was required for certain organisms, e.g., <emphasis>A. naeslundii, A. johnsonii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>A. oris</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0367">367</link>). More recently, WGS has emerged as a disruptive technology that is replacing 16S rRNA gene sequencing as the new gold standard for organism identification (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0368">368</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0369">369</link>), though it is not yet widely available in the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories. Whereas 16S rRNA gene sequencing may not adequately distinguish between certain bacterial species, WGS exhibits far greater discriminatory power with respect to both organism identification and strain typing. The use of NGS methodologies combined with 16S rRNA gene PCR has led to characterization of the microbiota of various sites within the human body as well as the discovery of novel bacteria across many taxonomic orders (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0370">370</link>–<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0374">374</link>). The primers used for 16S rRNA gene amplification as well as the methodologies used for NGS can themselves introduce bias if used on polymicrobial specimens (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0375">375</link>). Nevertheless, WGS and microbiome characterization are undoubtedly on track to be more widely used in the field of clinical microbiology in the future.</para>

      <para id="ch0072s0000p0083">MALDI-TOF MS has revolutionized the field of clinical microbiology by enabling laboratories to rapidly and accurately identify routine isolates of bacteria and yeasts (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0376">376</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0377">377</link>). Implementation of MALDI-TOF MS for routine organism identification leads to dramatic increases in the number of organisms that can be identified within the first day of culture workup compared with traditional phenotypic identification methods (87.2% versus 9.4%, respectively) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0378">378</link>). There are two MALDI-TOF MS systems that are FDA cleared for <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic (IVD) use in the United States: the MALDI Biotyper CA system (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany) and the Vitek MS (bioMérieux; previously Shimadzu). Both systems are also available with research-use-only (RUO) databases, which are additionally capable of having user-built database additions and customization. Guidelines have been published on the use of MALDI-TOF MS for organism identification by clinical laboratories (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0379">379</link>). At the time of writing, both of these FDA-cleared databases have a relative paucity of broad representation of the organisms discussed in this chapter. In the case of the Bruker CA system, there is wide representation of alternatively named <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> members in the manufacturer’s list of claimed bacteria, whereas there is almost zero representation of alternatively named <emphasis>Propionibacterium</emphasis> members. Similarly, reference spectra for only 5 <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> species are present in this database. In contrast, while the Vitek MS system has no lactobacilli as “claimed” organisms, it has over 20 <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> species present, but these are considered “unclaimed” and thus require additional testing. The Vitek MS system is unable to differentiate between <emphasis>A. schaalii</emphasis> and <emphasis>A. sanguinis.</emphasis> If a clinical laboratory is using an FDA-cleared system, it would be prudent to review the constituent members of the databases in use to assess and mitigate against relevant dearths in organism coverage.</para>
      <para id="ch0072s0000p0084">A number of important elements have emerged regarding the performance of MALDI-TOF MS for identification of anaerobes including anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods. First, extraction of the cellular proteins appears to be required for optimal performance, though this requirement is far more pronounced for the Bruker system. This extraction can be performed by an overlay of formic acid prior to the addition of matrix (on target) or by full tube extraction (with ethanol, acetonitrile, and formic acid) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0380">380</link>). Extraction was associated with improved performance for the Bruker Biotyper with both tube and on-target extraction methods (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0380">380</link>). Second, multiple studies have shown that the performance of the RUO databases can be improved by lowering the threshold of the identification score used for species-level as well as genus-level identifications. Use of a score of ≥1.9 instead of the manufacturer-recommended ≥2.0 led to correct species-level identification rates of 92.5% for <emphasis>Actinobacteria</emphasis> tested with the Bruker Biotyper (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 417) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0381">381</link>). Last, performance has been shown to improve as the databases are further developed in terms of breadth and depth of organism coverage and representation. The performance of MALDI-TOF MS for anaerobic bacteria does not appear to be influenced by exposure to oxygen (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0382">382</link>).</para>

      <beginpage pagenum="1052"/>
      <para id="ch0072s0000p0085">Most published data on the performance of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of anaerobes (including non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods) involved RUO rather than the IVD-cleared databases. Early studies showed suboptimal rates of identification for anaerobes (67.2% and 49% for the Bruker and Vitek MS, respectively) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0383">383</link>). Importantly, these studies reported that identifications were not obtained for <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and alternatively named <emphasis>Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Eggerthella, Blautia, Solobacterium</emphasis>, or <emphasis>Turicibacter</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0383">383</link>), with <emphasis>A. israelii</emphasis> misidentified as <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> (now <emphasis>Eggerthia</emphasis>) <emphasis>catenaformis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0384">384</link>). Use of identification score thresholds lower than those recommended by the manufacturers (e.g., 1.8) led to increased rates of identification but also increased rates of misidentification (7.9% and 1.4% for Bruker and Vitek MS, respectively) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0383">383</link>). Subsequent studies using expanded databases have shown improved overall performance for several of the aforementioned organisms. Using a user-built database, Schmitt and colleagues successfully identified <emphasis>S. moorei, Bulleidia, Eggerthella, Alloscardovia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>A. schaalii</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0080">80</link>). Whereas earlier versions of the Bruker MALDI Biotyper database were unable to identify <emphasis>S. moorei, Turicibacter</emphasis> species, or <emphasis>Collinsella</emphasis> species (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0385">385</link>), later versions are now able to do so (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0381">381</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0072s0000p0086">Nevertheless, expansion of the databases does not always equate to improved performance characteristics for all organisms equally, with some organisms remaining unidentified due to insufficient database expansion. For one large reference laboratory in the United States, the most common anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods not identifiable by MALDI-TOF MS included<emphasis>A. schaalii, W. neuii, C. hongkongensis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>A. israelii</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0386">386</link>). Misidentifications can still occur despite database expansions; <emphasis>Mogibacterium</emphasis> species were misidentified as <emphasis>Clostridium halophilum</emphasis> and <emphasis>Parvimonas micra</emphasis> was misidentified as <emphasis>S. exigua</emphasis> by the Bruker Biotyper (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0387">387</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0388">388</link>). Similarly, <emphasis>Schaalia georgiae</emphasis> was misidentified as <emphasis>Capnocytophaga gingivalis</emphasis> by the Vitek MS. In studies examining lactobacilli isolated from clinical sources, the Bruker Biotyper MS system provided 85 to 93% concordance at the species level with 16S rRNA gene PCR or sequence-based identification. Discordance was largely due to no MALDI-TOF MS identification or <emphasis>L. casei</emphasis> misidentified as <emphasis>L. paracasei</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0235">235</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0389">389</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0072s0000p0087">There is a paucity of published studies investigating the performance of the IVD-cleared databases for anaerobes, and within those studies, there is often very limited representation of non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods. The Vitek MS v2.0 database system correctly identified 91.5% of 265 Gram-positive anaerobes; however, only 66 to 86% of<emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> species tested were correctly identified to the species level (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0390">390</link>). The Bruker Biotyper MS system reported 98.5% correct species-level identifications for anaerobes, with a 0.8% misidentification rate (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0391">391</link>). Nevertheless, this study included only <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and alternatively named <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cutibacterium</emphasis> species and did not include details on the specific performance of the system for these individual genera. Importantly, despite the successful application of “early MALDI” to aerobic bacteria growing from positive blood cultures (i.e., MALDI performed after a few hours of subculture on agar plates), this method does not appear to work well for anaerobic bacteria (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0386">386</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0072s0000p0088">A direct comparison of the performance of the Biotyper and Vitek MS systems that are cleared for IVD use in Europe showed correct species-level identification rates of 58.2% and 60.7% for<emphasis>Actinomycetaceae</emphasis>, respectively (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0133">133</link>). Important differences appear to exist between the systems with respect to the identification of specific bacterial species: whereas the Bruker system correctly identified 81% of <emphasis>Actinotignum</emphasis> isolates to the species level, the Vitek MS produced no identification for 66.7% of isolates, with a 33.3% genus-level misidentification rate. Similar species-level identification rates were observed between the systems (approximately 60%), and neither system was able to identify <emphasis>Varibaculum.</emphasis> Genus-level misidentifications occurred more commonly with the Vitek MS system: a number of <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and alternatively named <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> isolates were misidentified as <emphasis>C. avidum</emphasis>, and the <emphasis>Actinotignum</emphasis> isolates were individually misidentified as a large array of organisms (e.g., <emphasis>Streptococcus agalactiae, Gemella morbillorum, Listeria grayi</emphasis>, and <emphasis>S. meyeri</emphasis>). These genus-level misidentifications occurred more frequently with on-target extraction than with direct deposit. However, reanalysis with an updated database (IVD 3.0) appeared to resolve this issue. One large study that specifically addressed the performance of the Vitek MS system for invasive <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and alternatively named <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> isolates found that Vitek MS identified only 50% of isolates tested to the genus and/or species level, with 37% of isolates unidentified and 13% discordant results with a reported “excellent ID” at a probability of 99% (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0111">111</link>). These discordant identifications included <emphasis>Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Kocuria kristinae, Kytococcus sedentarius, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, Streptococcus mitis, Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius, Paracoccus yeei, Staphylococcus warneri</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Cedecea neteri.</emphasis> 16S rRNA gene sequencing should therefore be used for <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and alternatively named <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> species identification until MALDI-TOF MS databases are sufficiently optimized for these organisms.</para>
      <para id="ch0072s0000p0089">Despite these limitations, the performance of MALDI-TOF MS has been shown overall to be superior to that of commercial phenotypic systems, with higher rates of correct species-level identifications and lower misidentification rates (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0392">392</link>–<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0394">394</link>). MALDI-TOF MS has enabled laboratories to rapidly and accurately identify several non-spore-forming anaerobic Gram-positive rods that previously could often be accurately identified only by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, including <emphasis>A. schaalii, Bifidobacterium, Alloscardovia, Atopobium, Slackia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Eggerthella</emphasis> species (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0195">195</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0218">218</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0381">381</link>). As the manufacturer databases are further developed and expanded, MALDI-TOF MS is likely to lead to an improved understanding of disease associations with this group of organisms. More recently, a large meta-analysis comparing the Vitek MS and Bruker Biotyper systems showed correct-identification rates of &gt;90% for both systems (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0388">388</link>). However, individual genus-level identification rates can be substantially lower. MALDI-TOF MS can also be used for organism identification directly from positive blood cultures; the Bruker Sepsityper system was shown to correctly identify 70.8% of Gram-positive anaerobes from Bactec and BacT/Alert blood culture bottles in one study (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0342">342</link>). A recent analysis of the performance of the Bruker Biotyper V6 database for approximately 1,400 anaerobic Gram-positive rods showed 95.8% being correctly identified to the species level, with only 2.6% of isolates producing an unreliable or no identification (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0395">395</link>). Users of MALDI-TOF MS should therefore be cognizant of what anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods are covered in the database used in their laboratory in addition to the possible limitations of MALDI-TOF MS for identification of this group of bacteria.</para>

        <para id="ch0072s0000p0091">Empiric antimicrobial therapy (e.g., metronidazole) is often administered by the treating physician when anaerobic bacteria are suspected to be the cause of a patient’s infection (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0396">396</link>). Anaerobic, non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods can frequently be isolated as part of a polymicrobial infection, and a large number of anaerobes (≥5) may be recovered in culture. Individual susceptibility testing in this scenario is likely to be unhelpful clinically and should be discouraged. Instead, susceptibility testing for these bacteria should be performed when a given organism is isolated in pure culture or is predominant. The source of the specimen (i.e., a specimen from a sterile site versus one likely to be contaminated with the normal microbiota) should also be factored into the decision to pursue susceptibility testing.</para>
        <para id="ch0072s0000p0092">Susceptibility testing methods and breakpoints for anaerobes have been defined by both the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0397">397</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0398">398</link>). There are several important differences between these organizations with respect to their guidance on anaerobic susceptibility testing as well as important technical differences between the two sets of guidelines. Firstly, CLSI has combined breakpoints for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes, whereas EUCAST has a limited number of anaerobic genus-specific breakpoints, with breakpoints available for <emphasis>C. acnes.</emphasis> EUCAST has also published a separate set of suggested interpretive criteria for anaerobes more generally which they state can be used for <emphasis>Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Eggerthella, Eubacterium</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> species. These suggested breakpoints are based on previously used anaerobic breakpoints and those for other species. Secondly, the breakpoints themselves vary between EUCAST and CLSI. For example, EUCAST does not have breakpoints for cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, while CLSI has breakpoints for several cephalosporins and moxifloxacin. Similarly, CLSI has breakpoints for tetracyclines, whereas EUCAST guidance indicates that while tetracyclines may have efficacy for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections, MICs do not appear to correlate with clinical outcome, and thus, no breakpoints have been defined. Readers should also be aware that even when breakpoints exist for a particular agent, they can differ by more than two dilutions between both organizations in some cases (e.g., ampicillin).</para>
        <para id="ch0072s0000p0093">EUCAST previously recommended that susceptibility testing for<emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> species be performed under anaerobic conditions, whereas CLSI has <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis>-specific breakpoints and recommends that susceptibility testing for this genus be performed in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with lysed horse blood (2.5 to 5% [vol/vol]) incubated under aerobic conditions (with 5% CO<subscript>2</subscript>) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0399">399</link>). For other anaerobes (including anaerobic, non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods), CLSI MIC breakpoints are defined using agar dilution with brucella agar supplemented with hemin, vitamin K1, and laked sheep blood (5% [vol/vol]). Microbroth dilution is recommended only for <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> and <emphasis>Parabacteroides</emphasis> species. EUCAST now recommends agar dilution but using fastidious anaerobe agar, with disk diffusion criteria published for selected genera. In reality, agar dilution is technically challenging, and thus, many laboratories instead use gradient diffusion strips (e.g., E-test or Liofilchem). Testing by gradient diffusion has been shown to be reliable for anaerobes; 98% of organisms tested had MICs within 2 doubling dilutions of the reference method, and a ≤2% very major/major error rate was observed (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0400">400</link>, <link linkend="ch0072s0000li0401">401</link>). However, there are reports of false resistance to metronidazole that appears to be medium and incubation condition dependent (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0402">402</link>). Finally, some novel antibacterial agents have been approved for clinical use in recent years. In some cases, they appear to be potent against anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods (e.g., eravacycline) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0403">403</link>); in other cases, they lack potency against these organisms and have high MICs (e.g., cefiderocol) (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0404">404</link>). In all cases, there are no CLSI or EUCAST breakpoints for anaerobes for these antibiotics.</para>
        <para id="ch0072s0000p0094">For the aforementioned reasons, antimicrobial susceptibility for a given anaerobic organism may often be inferred based on the bacterial identification, as susceptibility testing may be performed at a reference laboratory or, if performed in-house, requires incubation for up to 48 h. Published data regarding antimicrobial susceptibilities of anaerobic, non-spore-forming Gram-positive rods can be difficult to interpret and are complicated by changes in bacterial taxonomy (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0405">405</link>). Issues with the accuracy of identifications obtained by commercial identification systems should also be taken into account.</para>

Interpretation of the clinical significance of the isolation of individual members of this group in the context of a polymicrobial infection can be challenging, though isolation of these organisms from sterile sites is considered clinically significant. Because of the proximity of many infections to mucocutaneous surfaces, results should be interpreted in the context of whether contamination with commensal members of the microbiota was likely. Similarly, direct Gram stain results should be used to guide the extent of workup. Importantly, IDSA guidelines advise against performing identification and susceptibility testing of each isolate isolated from polymicrobial infections (<link linkend="ch0072s0000li0426">426</link>). Instead, the guidelines recommend that a general description of the culture results be provided (e.g., mixed aerobic and anaerobic intestinal microbiota) along with selective identification of certain organisms where resistance is known to occur. Furthermore, these guidelines specify that susceptibility testing should be performed on clinically significant isolates and not on all bacteria isolated in culture. However, laboratories should also be aware of not overlooking certain bacteria in the context of a polymicrobial process: current and alternatively named <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> genus members are generally isolated in conjunction with other bacterial species, yet their presence should be made known to the treating physician.</para>
