      <para id="ch0108s0000p0002">Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a member of the genus<emphasis>Orthopneumovirus</emphasis>, family <emphasis>Pneumoviridae</emphasis>, order <emphasis>Mononegavirales</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0002">2</link>). Other members of the genus include morphologically and biologically similar animal viruses, including the pneumonia virus of mice, bovine RSV, ovine RSV, and caprine RSV. RSV and other pneumoviruses differ from <emphasis>Paramyxoviridae</emphasis> viruses in their number and order of genes and the lack of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activity. RSV was first recovered from humans with pulmonary disease in 1957 by cell culture (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0003">3</link>). The virus derives its name from the characteristic formation of multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) in monolayer cell cultures of nonpolarized epithelial cells (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0005">5</link>). Only one serotype of RSV has been identified and further subdivided into two major antigenic types, designated RSV A and RSV B, and several genotypes (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0007">7</link>). These two types are based on variability in the G protein, with only one of six epitopes shared between the two types (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0006">6</link>). Some studies have suggested that RSV A is more virulent than RSV B and causes greater disease severity among hospitalized infants (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0009">9</link>). The overall higher prevalence of RSV A has also been associated with high number of RSV cases seen in preterm children (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0010">10</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0108s0000p0003">The enveloped RSV virion consists of a single-stranded, negative-sense, nonsegmented RNA genome with 10 genes that are transcribed into 11 monocistronic polyadenylated messenger RNAs, each of which encodes a major polypeptide chain (<anchor id="ch0108s0000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0108s0000a0009">Fig. 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0002">2</link>). The virus lipid envelope is derived from the host plasma membrane and contains three structural proteins: the F (fusion) protein, the G (glycosylated) protein, and the SH (short hydrophobic) protein. The F protein initiates viral penetration by fusing viral and cellular membranes and promotes viral spread by fusing the infected cells to adjacent uninfected cells. The G protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cells, and the SH protein accumulates within lipid raft structures of the Golgi complex during RSV infection. The six other structural proteins include the nucleoprotein (N), the phosphoprotein (P), the polymerase or large protein (L), a matrix protein (M), and two other proteins, M2-1 and M2-2. The N protein serves as the major structural protein for the nucleocapsid, while the P and the L proteins are involved in transcription and replication. The M protein is present in detergent-solubilized cores and inhibits viral replication in preparation for budding. The M2-1 protein is a transcription regulator that promotes the association of the M and N proteins, and the function of the M2-2 protein is unclear (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0002">2</link>). Two nonstructural proteins, NS1 and NS2, are unique to <emphasis>Pneumovirus</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="ch0108s0000p0004">There has recently been significant progress in the understanding of RSV entry, replication, and egress, particularly with regard to the role of the F protein (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0012">12</link>). The RSV F protein mediates the fusion reaction that causes mixing of the virus and host cell envelopes, leading to delivery of the virus capsid core contents into the cell. The conformation of the RSV F protein prior to fusion is termed prefusion F, and it exists as a trimer on the surface of the RSV virion (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0012">12</link>). RSV F has been found to be the predominant surface glycoprotein that interacts with insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). RSV gains entry to the cell through binding of the prefusion RSV F glycoprotein to the IGF1R on the cellular surface. This binding triggers the activation of protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ) and subsequent recruitment of the RSV entry coreceptor nucleolin from the cell nuclei to the plasma membrane to also bind RSV F (<anchor id="ch0108s0000a0006"/><link linkend="ch0108s0000a0013">Fig. 2</link>) (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0011">11</link>). On the other hand, the host factor chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 4 (CXCL4) has been identified as an RSV restriction factor that can block viral attachment by binding to the RSV receptor heparan sulfate (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0013">13</link>). Thus, RSV cell entry might be modulated by multiple factors including specific host factors.</para>
      <para id="ch0108s0000p0005">RSV is highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Only 10% of RSV remained infectious after exposure to 55°C for 5 min. At room temperature, 10% infectivity was present after 48 hours, and at 4°C, 1% of the infectivity remained after 7 days. The RSV infectivity titer fell by approximately 90% after each freeze-thaw cycle (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0015">15</link>). The virus is inactivated quickly by ether, chloroform, and a variety of detergents, such as 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and Triton X-100. The survival of RSV in the environment depends in part on drying time as well as humidity, with longer survival on nonporous surfaces (e.g., countertops) than on porous surfaces (e.g., cloth) (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0015">15</link>). Long-term storage of RSV can be enhanced by flash freezing in an alcohol-and-dry-ice bath and by adding stabilizing agents, such as glycerin or sucrose.</para>

      <para id="ch0108s0000p0006">Transmission of RSV occurs via droplets and direct or indirect contact with infected patients and/or contaminated surfaces (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0015">15</link>). RSV infections occur year-round worldwide. In the temperate Northern Hemisphere, RSV infections occur in the winter, with a peak between December and February. In the temperate Southern Hemisphere, RSV infections peak between May and July, and in a few tropical locations, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Colombia, semiannual RSV peaks have been identified (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0016">16</link>). Epidemiology data have established that both RSV A and RSV B can circulate in the same region concurrently during respiratory season, with one subtype, commonly RSV A, dominating. The pattern of dominance, however, can shift between seasons, with RSV genotype strains evolving and new strains emerging (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0018">18</link>). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a major impact on the seasonality of RSV, with especially low rates of RSV infection seen during the 2020-2021 respiratory season (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0020">20</link>). Some models also predict a possibility of more intense RSV outbreaks in coming seasons (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0021">21</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0108s0000p0007">In the United States, it is estimated that 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths are associated with RSV infection annually, with over 57,000 hospitalizations, 500,000 emergency department visits, and 1.5 million outpatient clinic visits in children less than 5 years of age alone (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0022">22</link>). Globally, RSV is a common cause of childhood acute lower respiratory infection and a major cause of hospital admissions in young children, resulting in a substantial burden on health care services (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0023">23</link>). The overall increased prevalence of RSV type A over B viruses may be due to a more transient nature of type A-specific immune protection (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0024">24</link>). Virtually all children are infected by the time they reach 3 years of age, and repeated infections with RSV are common throughout life. No age group appears to be completely protected against reinfection due to prior exposure (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0108s0000p0008">RSV is known to cause nosocomial infections and produces outbreaks and widespread infections each year in both children and adults, including medical personnel, who may present with mild illness (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0026">26</link>). In a classic experiment, volunteers in close physical contact with RSV-infected infants were more readily infected than those who remained 6 feet away, suggesting that small-particle aerosol is less important in the spread of RSV than direct contact with infectious secretions via fomites or large-particle aerosols (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0015">15</link>). A targeted infection control intervention has been demonstrated to be cost-effective in reducing the rate of RSV health care-related infections (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0028">28</link>).

      <para id="ch0108s0000p0009">RSV is recognized as the most serious cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract illnesses in young children and infants (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0023">23</link>). The incubation period ranges from 2 to 8 days, with a median of 4.4 days, based on a systematic review (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0015">15</link>). Common lower respiratory tract infections include bronchiolitis, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0023">23</link>). Most children with RSV infection are previously healthy children with no underlying conditions and experience recovery from illness after 8 to 15 days (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0023">23</link>), with some infants and immunosuppressed individuals showing the ability to spread the virus for as long as 4 weeks after symptom resolution. Caserta et al. reported the development of a global respiratory severity score based on nine clinical variables as an endpoint for investigation of disease pathogenesis and as an outcome measure for therapeutic interventions (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0029">29</link>). Risk factors for acquiring RSV include being under 2 years of age and residential crowding (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0023">23</link>). Premature infants and infants with chronic lung disease, major congenital heart diseases, or severe immunodeficiencies are at highest risk of hospital admission for RSV. Based on a meta-analysis of the incidence and mortality of severe RSV in children globally, a substantial proportion of RSV-associated morbidity occurs in the first year of life, especially in children born prematurely. These data affirm the importance of RSV disease as a cause of hospitalization and as a significant contributor to pediatric mortality and further demonstrate gestational age as a critical determinant of disease severity. However, an important limitation of case fatality ratios is the absence of individual patient characteristics of nonsurviving patients. Moreover, case fatality ratios cannot be translated to population-based mortality (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0021">21</link>).</para>

Adult populations at increased risk for severe RSV infections include residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, adults with underlying heart and lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and chronic cardiac diseases, asthmatic patients, and immunocompromised patients, including cancer and transplant patients (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0030">30</link>). The burden of RSV in adults has been determined in a combination of population-based prospective surveillance studies, analysis of acute illness in patients presenting for medical care, and modeling of large medical databases. One systematic literature review of published studies worldwide estimated that there were approximately 1.5 million (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3 to 6.9 million) episodes of RSV in adults 65 years of age and older in 2015 in industrialized countries, with 214,000 (~14.5%; CI, 100,000 to 459,000) of these cases requiring hospital admission (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0031">31</link>). In prospective surveillance studies in healthy elderly adults and high-risk adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, the annual wintertime RSV attack rate ranged from 3 to 7% and 2 to 10%, respectively (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0030">30</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0108s0000p0011">Immunocompromised adults have the highest morbidity and mortality from RSV. The incidence of RSV infection following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and solid organ transplantation ranges from 1 to 12%, with 18 to 55% progressing to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and death due to RSV in 7 to 33% (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0033">33</link>).

      <para id="ch0108s0000p0012">Treatment of RSV infections can be challenging. Current options include ribavirin and palivizumab (Synagis) for RSV treatment and prophylaxis, respectively (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0035">35</link>). Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at a neutralizing epitope on the postfusion F protein that functions by preventing RSV entry into host cells. It is administered as a monthly injection (five-dose program) in high-risk children during the respiratory-illness season for RSV prophylaxis (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0036">36</link>). Palivizumab administration is controversial because of its high cost. Several abbreviated dosing regimens of palivizumab are confirmed to match the protection for outcomes of RSV infection achieved by the regular five-dose program (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0037">37</link>). Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum nucleoside analogue that targets RNA viruses and can be administered orally, intravenously, or in aerosolized form (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0039">39</link>). Data from a large retrospective study of allo-HSCT recipients including both children and adults supported the early initiation of ribavirin therapy for RSV upper respiratory tract infections to prevent progression to LRTI and subsequent mortality from RSV lower respiratory tract infections (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0040">40</link>). Over the past 10 years, new antiviral drugs including monoclonal antibodies and nucleoside analogues have shown clinical promise against RSV (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0039">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0041">41</link>). In 2023, application for licensing of Nirsevimab was submitted for approval by the U.S. FDA. Nirsevimab is a single-dose long-acting antibody developed to protect infants and children up to 24 months of age against severe, lower RSV respiratory tract disease (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0042">42</link>). Although there is a worldwide need for a preventative vaccine in the pediatric population, an effective and safe RSV vaccine is not yet licensed.</para>
      <para id="ch0108s0000p0013">While RSV vaccine versions designed to elicit an immune response against the F protein have not been effective, more recent RSV vaccine candidates designed to incorporate stabilized versions of the prefusion F glycoprotein have been rapidly advancing and show great promise (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0043">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0044">44</link>). Initial work showed this form eliciting a potent neutralizing antibody response against RSV 10- to 100-fold more potent than palivizumab (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0045">45</link>).

        <para id="ch0108s0000p0015">Most general viral specimen collection principles also apply to specimen collection for RSV detection and culture, such as collecting specimens during the acute phase of illness, maintaining recovered cells in intact form, delivering specimens promptly to the diagnostic laboratory, refrigerating specimens if stored temporarily, and sealing them well in O-ring-sealed cryovials if stored on dry ice (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0015">15</link>). Heating or freezing the specimen will result in a decreased number of infectious virions in the sample. If a delay of more than 2 hours between collection and receipt of the sample is expected, specimen containers should be kept at 4°C, including during transport to the laboratory, for optimal detection of RSV. Differences in the recovery of RSV from various specimen types due to transport or storage temperatures are less pronounced with the use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0015">15</link>), which are more sensitive than viral culture. If culture is being considered, a sample should ideally be transported to the laboratory and processed for culture within 4 hours of collection, because RSV is labile and viral titers can significantly decrease with prolonged storage at 4°C. Alternatively, specimens may be snap frozen to prevent viral degradation (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0048">48</link>).</para>

While some studies have demonstrated that nasopharyngeal aspirates are more sensitive than specimens collected with flocked swabs, other studies have demonstrated similar diagnostic performance (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0049">49</link>–<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0051">51</link>). Similarly, for rapid antigen testing, nasopharyngeal aspirates or washes had slightly higher sensitivity than nasopharyngeal swabs and nasal aspirates or washes, but no statistical differences were revealed by a systematic review and meta-analysis (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0052">52</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0108s0000p0017">Nasopharyngeal specimens collected by nylon flocked swabs have more epithelial cells, are easy to elute with the least discomfort, and have been widely used in both rapid antigen and NAATs (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0053">53</link>). Throat swab and saliva specimens are inferior but might be acceptable when it is impractical to obtain nasal or nasopharyngeal specimens. For lower respiratory tract infections, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, bronchial washings, sputa, and endotracheal aspirates can be used, with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid having the best recovery compared to nasal washes and nose and throat swabs (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0048">48</link>). Endotracheal tube aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collection is preferred in immunocompromised adults who are being mechanically ventilated (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0048">48</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0108s0000p0018">The likelihood of identifying RSV as the etiology of a patient’s infection is greatest when a specimen is obtained within the first several days of illness. Viral cultures or antigen tests usually become negative 1 week after onset of illness in about 50% of patients. However, shedding of live virus in immunocompromised infants has been documented up to 3 weeks after onset of illness (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0024">24</link>). The quantity of virus in the upper respiratory tract (nasal aspirates) is nearly equivalent to that found in the lower respiratory tract when tested by quantitative culture or real-time PCR methods, particularly in pediatric patients (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0054">54</link>). In healthy adult volunteers experimentally inoculated with RSV, the mean duration of RSV shedding was 7.4 (±2.5) days, while naturally infected older adults shed the virus on average for 10 to 13 days but for as long as ≥20 days (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0055">55</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0056">56</link>). Long-term RSV shedding longer than 30 days has also been documented in subsets of patients with hematological malignancies (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0057">57</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0108s0000p0020">RSV rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) can be performed in less than 30 minutes and do not require experienced technologists to perform and interpret test results (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0058">58</link>). Results are visualized as a color change or the appearance of a line or sign on a solid membrane as a result of antigen-antibody complex binding. Depending on the assay design, the result either is read visually by the individual performing the assay or is interpreted and reported by an automated reading device. Most RADTs have waived status and can be performed as point-of-care tests with minimal or no equipment needed (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0059">59</link>). They are generally also inexpensive and simple to perform, making them a valuable tool at the point of care. However, the sensitivity of these assays is relatively low and highly dependent on the prevalence of RSV in the community (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0052">52</link>). Hence, false-positive and false-negative results are a concern depending on the time of the year, and the performance of these tests is considerably reduced during the RSV off-season (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0061">61</link>). RSV RADT performance also varies with the patient population tested. In adult patients, these assays generally lack sensitivity, making their utility in this population limited, especially among the elderly and the immunocompromised (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0052">52</link>). In infants and very young children, RADT performance is higher than that found in adults, which is due to the higher viral load seen in this age group, making them more useful for testing in this population (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0062">62</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0063">63</link>). One systematic review and meta-analysis indicated a low RSV RADT sensitivity of 29% in adults in comparison to an overall pooled sensitivity of 81% in children (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0052">52</link>). It is therefore recommended that negative RADT results be followed up with NAATs for confirmation (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0064">64</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0065">65</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0108s0000p0021">RSV RADTs are commercially available in a variety of platforms and test formats (<anchor id="ch0108s0000a0024"/><link linkend="ch0108s0000a0029">Table 1</link>). Key factors that influence choice include test accuracy, turnaround time, acceptable specimen types, compatible transport media, and a reliable supply of reagents or kits. BD Veritor RSV (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and Quidel Sofia RSV (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA) are examples of two FDA-cleared RADTs that employ an instrument-based digital scan of the test strip to improve accuracy (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0053">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0066">66</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0067">67</link>).

      <para id="ch0108s0000p0022">Direct fluorescent-antibody assays (DFAs) are based on the detection of RSV antigens in respiratory specimens using fluorophore-labeled monoclonal mouse antibodies. The use of monoclonal antibodies in these assays has greatly improved the sensitivity and specificity of the test (<anchor id="ch0108s0000a0027"/><link linkend="ch0108s0000a0035">Fig. 3B</link> and C). DFA for RSV has reported sensitivities and specificities ranging from 84 to 100% and 86 to 100% compared to culture and NAATs, respectively (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0070">70</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0071">71</link>).

The sensitivity and specificity of DFA detection are comparable to those of cell culture (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0072">72</link>) but with faster test turnaround, with some studies showing DFA and cytospin preparations performing better than culture, presumably due to the labile nature of RSV (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0072">72</link>).

      <anchor id="ch0108s0000a0036"/>
      <para id="ch0108s0000p0027">Nucleic acid amplification-based methods are now the standard technique for detection of RSV in clinical laboratories. This change has been facilitated by both the widespread availability of more simplified sample-to-answer and cartridge-based commercial assays and the need to streamline workflows in the clinical laboratories due to widespread staffing shortages. The shift toward molecular testing has also been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, due to NAATs being the diagnostic methodology of choice (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0073">73</link>). In addition, NAATs have superior sensitivity in the detection of respiratory viruses compared to cell culture and DFA and have a shorter time to results (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0074">74</link>). While standalone NAATs for RSV are still available, most molecular assays are designed as multiplexed panels, including limited panels targeting RSV and influenza viruses, with or without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (<anchor id="ch0108s0000a0037"/><link linkend="ch0108s0000a0047">Table 3</link>), and larger multiplex panels adding targets for many other respiratory viruses (<anchor id="ch0108s0000a0038"/><link linkend="ch0108s0000a0057">Table 4</link>). The trend towards the use of diagnostic NAATs has also been observed in the point-of-care setting as CLIA-waived platforms increase in availability (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0075">75</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0108s0000p0028">Several multiplex molecular syndromic systems are commercially available (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0077">77</link>), with many assays now being cleared by the U.S. FDA for detection of a panel of respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens, including RSV (<link linkend="ch0108s0000a0057">Table 4</link>). The more recent FDA approved panels from BioMérieux (Salt Lake City, UT) include the pneumonia panel for lower respiratory tract specimens (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0077">77</link>) and the RP 2.1 respiratory panel, which is a modification of the RP2 respiratory panel (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0078">78</link>) that includes SARS-CoV-2 as a target (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0076">76</link>). The CLIA-waived version of the RP2, the RP2 EZ, has been adapted into a panel that now contains SARS-CoV-2 and received FDA emergency use authorization (EUA). Except in the case of the pneumonia panel, which is cleared for lower respiratory tract specimens such as induced sputum, expectorated sputum, endotracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, nasopharyngeal swabs are the only specimen type that is currently FDA cleared for all of other multiplex NAATs. While this is the case, published reports that pre-date the pneumonia panel included analysis of other respiratory specimen types, including nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, with sensitivity and specificity similar to those of nasopharyngeal swabs (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0079">79</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0080">80</link>). In addition to <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic (IVD) singleplex and multiplex NAATs, a wide range of research-use-only tests and analyte-specific reagents (ASRs) are available. Rapid turnaround time, simultaneous detection of an array of pathogens, and superior sensitivity of these multiplex syndromic panels have the potential to decrease emergency department length of stay, reduce diagnostic tests, and shorten the duration of intravenous antibiotic administration (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0081">81</link>–<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0084">84</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0108s0000p0031">Due to the labile nature of RSV, viral culture is no longer the most reliable method for diagnosis of RSV infections. Advantages that viral culture has over NAATs are that it is not affected by mutations in amplification targets, which may result in false-negative results (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0085">85</link>), and most specimen types are amenable to culture (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0065">65</link>). Viral culture also allows the propagation of virions, which can be useful if additional studies are desired.</para>
        <para id="ch0108s0000p0032">For primary isolation, human heteroploid cells, especially HEp-2, are usually preferred. Other cell lines that may be used but are usually less sensitive include human kidney, amnion, and diploid fibroblastic cells and monkey kidney cells (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>). Cell line cultures show characteristic syncytial CPE after 3 to 7 days of incubation (<link linkend="ch0108s0000a0035">Fig. 3A</link>). However, the degree of syncytium formation depends on the type of cell culture, the confluence of the cell monolayer, the medium, the strain and type of virus, the multiplicity of infection, and whether the RSV strain is laboratory adapted. In HEp-2 cells, RSV plaque morphology appears unrelated to disease severity in RSV-infected children (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0005">5</link>). The reported sensitivities of conventional tube cell culture have ranged from 57 to 90%, in part due to compromise of virus viability, the technical expertise required, and the cell lines used in the laboratory (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0108s0000p0033">The shell vial assay combines centrifugation and immunofluorescence to detect expression of viral antigens on infected cells before development of CPEs, which significantly shorten the length of time needed for detection of the virus to about 16 hours (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0065">65</link>). The use of R-Mix cultures (Diagnostic Hybrids/Quidel Corp, Inc., Athens, OH), which contain a mixture of human lung carcinoma A549 and mink lung Mv1Lu cells, has been shown to be a rapid and sensitive method for the detection and identification of respiratory viruses (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0087">87</link>). With significantly decreased costs compared to conventional culture, the use of R-Mix was slightly more sensitive than that of RMK, HEp-2, and MRC-5 cell lines used in conventional cultures, and it was several days faster (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0086">86</link>). Screening of R-Mix cells after overnight incubation was more sensitive and produced more timely results for RSV and other respiratory viruses and was more reliable than direct antigen testing (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0087">87</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0088">88</link>). In addition, R-Mix cell cultures had the major advantage of identifying viruses not detected by direct staining (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0064">64</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0086">86</link>).</para>

However, since other respiratory viruses such as parainfluenza virus 3 and measles virus can produce similar CPEs in certain cell lines, clinical virology laboratories confirm RSV detection by performing type-specific immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on infected cells from cell culture vials as a standard practice (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0065">65</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0108s0000p0053">Serology is primarily useful for epidemiologic studies rather than for clinical diagnosis of RSV infections. Most children have serologic evidence of RSV infection by 2 years of age. A significant proportion (10 to 30%) of young patients with documented RSV infections remain serologically negative, probably due to the immaturity of the infant immune response (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>). Assays that detect IgM antibody to RSV show low sensitivity, particularly for infants less than 6 months of age, precluding a definitive diagnosis in a clinically relevant time frame (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0092">92</link>). In contrast, serology is most useful in elderly adults, who curiously have the most vigorous antibody responses to RSV (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0014">14</link>). While IgG specific serology is available, the need for convalescent-phase plasma to confirm diagnosis in adults limits the utility of serology for the diagnosis of acute RSV, making serology primary utility as a research tool for epidemiology studies or outbreak investigations. Current means of serologic diagnosis for RSV infections include IFA, enzyme immunoassay, complement fixation, and neutralization assays.</para>

        <para id="ch0108s0000p0088">RSV infection among young children is usually diagnosed clinically in the setting of the community’s RSV season. Among adults, however, the findings are less specific, and RSV is commonly not suspected. Test results should be interpreted with knowledge of the natural history of RSV infections in the context of the patient’s clinical presentation and medical history. Serologic results have little clinical value, and NAAT-based molecular assays are the tests of choice for laboratory diagnosis. Culture and DFA for RSV detection are time-consuming and have a relatively long turnaround time; they are mainly used for specimen types that have not been validated or cleared by NAAT-based molecular assays, as a backup test for specimens yielding rapid negative antigen results, or when further characterization has been requested.</para>
        <para id="ch0108s0000p0089">The availability of rapid antigen assays with a turnaround time as short as 15 min makes it possible for clinicians to receive results in a timely fashion. However, due to their relatively low sensitivity, false-negative results can be expected and should not be interpreted as excluding the possibility of RSV infection. To improve detection, NAAT-based molecular assays should be used as backup tests. With the increased number of multiplexed molecular FDA-approved assays, simultaneous detection and identification of common viral pathogens, including RSV, is becoming the main tool for detection and typing of RSV. Rapid near-point-of-care testing has the potential to decrease emergency department stays, reduce diagnostic tests and patient charges, and improve patient care. Notably, the availability of several CLIA-waived NAAT-based molecular assays now on the market is likely to lead to more widespread adoption of this technology in the point-of-care setting. Whereas multiplex NAATs are currently qualitative, real-time NAATs can provide an estimate of viral load. Especially when more than one virus is detected, the viral load information may be helpful in identifying the predominant pathogen. Viral load estimates are also helpful in determining RSV severity, with higher viral loads being associated with worse disease and longer hospitalization stays and duration of symptoms (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0096">96</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0097">97</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0108s0000p0090">The positive and negative predictive values of these tests vary according to the prevalence of the disease in a particular population during certain seasons. The diagnosis of RSV infection is often made with reasonable accuracy in combination with clinical and epidemiologic findings in infants with lower respiratory tract disease during the epidemic season. Effective exchanges of relevant information between clinicians and the laboratory are essential to good patient care. RSV is extremely labile, and improper specimen collection, transport, and processing, even when sensitive methods such as RT-PCR are used, can lead to false-negative results. The importance of correct specimen collection and prompt specimen transport cannot be overemphasized. Prompt reporting of test results may assist clinicians in discontinuing unnecessary forms of therapy or in implementing infection control precautions, thereby preventing health care-related spread of infection.</para>

The HMPV genome ranges in length from 13,280 to 13,278 nucleotides and possesses 8 genes encoding 9 proteins: the nucleoprotein (N), the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix (M) protein, the M2-1 and M2-2 proteins, the fusion (F) protein, the small hydrophobic (SH) protein, the glycosylated attachment protein (G), and the large polymerase (L) protein (<link linkend="ch0108s0000a0009">Fig. 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0002">2</link>). The N, P, and L proteins are part of the helical ribonucleoprotein complex and are recruited to cytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies in HMPV-infected cells.

The signs and symptoms of HMPV infection are nonspecific and indistinguishable from those of respiratory tract infections from other viral causes. Detection of HMPV is strongly associated with symptoms in infected patients, with shedding of the virus occurring up to 4 weeks after primary infection (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0116">116</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0117">117</link>).

About half of the cases of LRTI in children occur in the first 6 months of life, suggesting that young age is a major risk factor for severe disease (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0105">105</link>). Progression to LRTI is also a complication of HMPV infections in older adults and immunocompromised patients. In one cohort of immunocompromised pediatric patients, 29% developed LRTI, 23% were admitted to the intensive care unit or required supplemental oxygen, and 5% died from HMPV pneumonia (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0126">126</link>). A similar study found that LRTI developed in up to 51% of patients, with respiratory failure and death occurring in 15% and 10%, respectively.

Other specimen types used for the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection caused by HMPV include nasal washes and nasopharyngeal aspirates, primarily for infants.

HMPV replicated poorly or not at all in various cell lines commonly used for conventional cell cultures for respiratory virus diagnosis, such as HEK, HEp-2, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Primary isolation is facilitated by the presence of a low concentration of trypsin, which is not used routinely in diagnostic virology cultures in many laboratories. In one study, rhesus monkey kidney epithelial cells (LLC-MK2 and Vero) and a human airway epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) were most permissive for HMPV growth. LLC-MK2 cells were tolerant of trypsin and thus remain an ideal cell line for HMPV cultivation (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0147">147</link>). In another study, human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cells were more sensitive than LLC-MK2 cells for isolation of HMPV, detecting HMPV in 88% of samples that tested positive for HMPV by PCR compared to 24% detection using LLC-MK2 cells (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0148">148</link>). Centrifugation cultures significantly increased the infectivity of HMPV for cells in monolayer culture (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0147">147</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0155">155</link>). HMPV growth in LLC-MK2 cell or Vero cell monolayer cultures is slow, requiring between 10 and 22 days and often several blind passages before CPE appears, especially following primary isolation. The observed CPE is not particularly striking, often appearing only as focal areas of rounding of cells and minor patches of cell-cell fusion (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0098">98</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0148">148</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0156">156</link>). A shell vial culture method using R-Mix cells with a mixed monolayer of human adenocarcinoma cells (A549 cells) and mink lung cells (Mv1Lu cells) (Diagnostic Hybrids Inc./Quidel Corp, Athens, OH) and an HMPV-specific monoclonal antibody had a sensitivity of 100% compared with tube culture in one study (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0157">157</link>) (<link linkend="ch0108s0000a0035">Fig. 3C</link>).</para>

HMPV is suspected when a virus is isolated during the epidemic season in HEp-2, Vero, or LLC-MK2 cells and other possible viruses have been excluded.

      <para id="ch0108s0000p0116">Sequence analysis uses the fusion (F) gene and the glycoprotein (G) gene as the two main targets to distinguish between the two genotypes, HMPV-A and HMPV-B, with sequence analysis of the nucleocapsid gene being additionally used to further delineate the five subtypes, A1, A2a, A2b, B1, and B2 (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0109">109</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0158">158</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0159">159</link>). The HMPV G glycoprotein gene exhibits the greatest diversity, with nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities ranging from 52 to 58% and 31 to 35%, respectively, between the two genotypes (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0099">99</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0160">160</link>). Reverse transcription nucleic acid amplification followed by bidirectional amplicon sequencing is a common approach used for genotyping of HMPV and has been performed directly from clinical samples (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0109">109</link>) or viral culture isolates (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0145">145</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0146">146</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0158">158</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0159">159</link>). Whole-genome sequencing protocols using an amplicon-based strategy have shown equal sensitivity and good coverage for strain typing of HMPV lineages with increased detection of genetic diversity in individual genes (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0161">161</link>, <link linkend="ch0108s0000li0162">162</link>). A few studies investigating the correlation between HMPV genotypes and disease severity have yielded varied results, from those showing no differences in disease severity to those indicating that either genotype A or B causes more severe diseases (<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0163">163</link>–<link linkend="ch0108s0000li0166">166</link>).

      <para id="ch0108s0000p0118">Rapid diagnosis of HMPV infections has greatly improved since its discovery in 2001. Multiple assays are now commercially available, primarily for detection in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Commercial syndromic panels are now also available for the detection of HMPV in lower respiratory tract specimens, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and tracheal aspirates. The availability of multiplex PCR assays offers laboratories the ability to provide rapid diagnosis in a time frame that allows better management of patients with respiratory tract infections.</para>
      <para id="ch0108s0000p0119">A positive test for HMPV must be interpreted in the right clinical context. In general, the diagnosis of HMPV infection is most likely when a positive test, particularly a nucleic acid test, occurs during late winter or early spring in temperate climates from a patient with acute respiratory illness. However, HMPV seasonality might have shifted a bit during the COVID-19 pandemic. NAATs should not be used as tests of cure, because the duration of HMPV shedding is still not well defined and might be prolonged in immunocompromised hosts. Furthermore, interpretation of a positive nucleic acid test in the presence of nucleic acids from another virus may also be challenging, because the clinical impact of coinfections remains unclear. Real-time PCR-based quantitative molecular test results including threshold cycle values may be useful to determine the significance of positive findings as well as to differentiate acute and resolved infections. Inversely correlated to the HMPV loads in clinical specimens, higher threshold cycle values would be more consistent with a resolved infection. However, the value of quantitative HMPV PCR remains to be clearly established. Serology and typing are mostly useful in studies of epidemiology at this time.</para>
