        <para id="ch0116s0001s0001p0001">There are numerous etiologic agents in the genus<emphasis>Lyssavirus</emphasis> that result in an acute, fatal viral encephalomyelitis known as rabies in both humans and animals.

In addition to the classified lyssaviruses, a related unclassified novel (proposed) lyssavirus was detected in the brain tissues of a <emphasis>Myotis brandtii</emphasis> (Brandt’s bat) found in the village of Kotalahti in Eastern Finland (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0005">5</link>).</para>

More recently, differences have been defined by nucleotide sequence analysis, and lyssaviruses are grouped as different genotypes or species. Current commercial human and animal vaccines are based on the prototype species, RABV, and provide adequate cross protection against lyssaviruses in phylogroup 1 (Aravan virus<emphasis>,</emphasis> Australian bat lyssavirus<emphasis>,</emphasis> Bokeloh bat lyssavirus<emphasis>,</emphasis> Duvenhage lyssavirus<emphasis>,</emphasis> European bat lyssavirus 1<emphasis>,</emphasis> European bat lyssavirus 2<emphasis>,</emphasis> Irkut virus<emphasis>,</emphasis> Khujand virus, Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus, and Taiwan bat lyssavirus); however, they are less effective against the highly divergent lyssaviruses found in phylogroup 2 (Lagos bat virus, Mokola virus, and Shimoni bat virus) and phylogroup 3 (West Caucasian bat virus, Ikoma lyssavirus, and Lleida bat virus). Due to the rarity of phylogroup 2 and 3 lyssavirus cases in animals and the lack of cases in humans, the decreased efficacy of current biologics has been recognized in the <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> and <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> experiments used to characterize these viruses. Hopefully, vaccines will be developed to target these rare lyssaviruses (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0007">7</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0116s0001s0002p0001">Lyssavirus virions are bullet-shaped, measure approximately 180 by 75 nm, and consist of five structural proteins: the glycoprotein (G), matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and large polymerase protein (L) (<anchor id="ch0116s0001s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0116s0001s0003a0005">Fig. 2</link>). The virus is contained in an envelope bilayer derived from the host cell cytoplasmic membrane during viral budding. Peplomers, G protein trimeric spike inserts of approximately 10 nm, are found within the surface of the virus envelope. The rabies virus G protein binds with host cell surface receptors (adsorption), initiating a cascade in the infectious cycle and replication. Virus-neutralizing antibodies to the G protein produced after vaccination or natural infection may inhibit this process. The inner surface lining of the envelope is formed by the M protein, which binds with the G protein envelope and the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core.</para>
        <para id="ch0116s0001s0002p0002">The RNP is composed of tightly wound viral RNA, encapsulated by the phosphorylated N protein and associated with the P and L proteins. All lyssaviruses contain nonsegmented genomes (RNA) of approximately 12 kb. The RNA-nucleoprotein complex is responsible for transcription of genomic RNA into five polyadenylated mRNAs, which are translated into the structural proteins, and for viral replication by providing a template to synthesize complementary full-length (negative-sense) genomic RNA. During assembly, the coiling RNP-M protein binds with the G protein as the completed virus buds from the plasma membrane (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0009">9</link>). From a diagnostic viewpoint, the N and G proteins and viral RNA have been the focus of most laboratory research evaluations. Rabies diagnosis in postmortem brain tissues is based on the detection of intracellular viral inclusions, which are collections of RNP. Because the RABV G protein and host cell receptor interactions initiate the infection cycle, the G protein is directly involved in pathogenesis and virulence, induction of immune responses, and binding of neutralizing antibodies. Vaccines prepared from whole virions, purified RABV G proteins, and recombinant viral vaccines encoding RABV G proteins have been used to successfully immunize and protect animals from RABV infections (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0010">10</link>–<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0012">12</link>). In addition, detection of antibody to the G protein has been used as a method to evaluate vaccine potency (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0012">12</link>). More detailed reviews of virus replication and virus pathogenesis have been published (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0013">13</link>–<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0015">15</link>).

        <para id="ch0116s0001s0003p0001">Rabies is a zoonotic disease (primarily an animal disease that may be transmitted to humans). All mammals are susceptible. Although RABV is endemic on five of the seven continents, the geographic distributions of the other lyssaviruses are more localized:<emphasis>Lagos bat virus, Shimoni bat virus, Mokola virus, Duvenhage virus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Ikoma virus</emphasis> have been detected only in Africa; <emphasis>European bat lyssaviruses, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Lleida bat virus</emphasis> have been detected only in Europe; <emphasis>Australian bat lyssavirus</emphasis> is found exclusively in Australia; and <emphasis>Aravan bat virus, Khujand bat virus, Irkut bat virus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>West Caucasian bat virus</emphasis> are restricted to Eurasia. At present, <emphasis>Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus</emphasis> has been found only on the island of Sri Lanka. The only lyssavirus detected in the Americas has been RABV. In the United States, more than 6,000 rabies cases are diagnosed annually in animals. The predominant terrestrial reservoir species are raccoons in the Eastern states, skunks in California and the north central and south central states, gray foxes in Arizona, Arctic and red foxes in Alaska, and mongooses in Puerto Rico. In addition, there are more than 16 distinct RABVs associated with unique species of insectivorous bats throughout their ranges in North America. Although dogs represent a major reservoir species in most developing nations, enzootic canine rabies virus variants were eradicated in the United States and other developed countries, primarily due to mandatory dog vaccination and stray animal control (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0017">17</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0116s0001s0003p0002">Human rabies cases are rare in developed countries where canine rabies is controlled and access to prophylactic biologics is ideal. Fewer than four cases are reported annually in the United States. Despite the relative ease of disease prevention in an exposed human, it is estimated that more than 60,000 preventable human deaths worldwide occur annually. Beyond avoiding contact with wild animals and unvaccinated animals, stray animals, or domestic animals with unknown immunization histories, access to appropriate human rabies postexposure prophylaxis remains an urgent global public health need to avert this preventable human mortality.</para>
        <para id="ch0116s0001s0003p0003">The main route of transmission is introduction of saliva containing RABV into a wound via the bite of a rabid animal. Virus may be shed via saliva in high quantities. Human rabies cases due to nonbite exposures are extremely rare. Nonbite exposures include scratches, open wounds, and mucous membranes contaminated with a source of RABV, such as infected saliva or central nervous system (CNS) tissues from a rabid animal. Nosocomial infection (inhalation of accidentally aerosolized RABV) and subsequent mucous membrane contact is a potential source of nonbite exposure. Infection by this route, though rare, has been documented (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0019">19</link>). No human rabies cases have been associated with fomite (surface contamination) exposures, most likely because the virus is readily inactivated by drying and by agents such as detergents. In the event of an exposure, immediate wound cleansing with soap and water is essential, followed by appropriate urgent medical care; delays in initiation of human rabies postexposure prophylaxis may result in death.</para>
        <para id="ch0116s0001s0003p0004">Lyssaviruses are susceptible to a number of common laboratory disinfectants, such as 1:256 quaternary ammonium compound, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (10% bleach), iodophors, 70% isopropanol, and 70% ethanol. Chemical disinfectants are less effective when used on items contaminated with brain tissues, heavy suspensions of brain tissue, or even virus suspensions in cell culture media with protein supplements. Decontamination of instruments, laboratory glassware, and disposable waste is best achieved by autoclaving at a minimum of 121°C at 15 lb/in<superscript>2</superscript> for 60 min (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0021">21</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0116s0001s0004p0001">The initial clinical presentation of rabies in humans and animals may be rather unremarkable and nonspecific. The majority of incubation periods range from several weeks to several months after exposure. Following the prodromal period, an acute neurological phase develops. The majority of rabies cases manifest as an encephalitic form, and less than 20% are observed as a paralytic presentation. Among patients exhibiting classical encephalitic symptoms, generalized arousal or hyperexcitability, including periods of confusion, hallucinations, agitation, or aggressive behavior, may occur, with intermittent lucid periods. Clinical progression may be characterized by difficulty swallowing, hypersalivation, lacrimation, sweating, dilated pupils, and autonomic dysfunction. Cranial nerve dysfunction may include anisocoria and facial or tongue paralysis. Hydrophobic and aerophobic spasms can be severe. In the end stage, multiple systems may be unstable, leading often to coma and invariably to death. Rabies continues to have one of the highest case fatality rates of all known illnesses caused by infectious agents.</para>
        <para id="ch0116s0001s0004p0002">The paralytic form of presentation includes flaccid muscle weakness, frequently spreading in an ascending pattern to the extremities. In some cases, laryngeal and facial muscle weakness or bilateral deafness occur. These cases may resemble Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other symptoms include urinary incontinence and priapism. Hydrophobia is less common with the paralytic form, but mild inspiratory spasms may be present. Cardiopulmonary complications and instability usually result in cardiac arrest and death (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0022">22</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0116s0001s0004p0003">There is no definitive treatment for rabies after clinical signs are apparent. Management of a patient with rabies is supportive, requiring respiratory protection through sedation and intubation, as well as other complex medical management attempts to stabilize cardiopulmonary and other major organ system functions as the disease rapidly progresses. Despite the successful outcome of intensive medical management of a high school student from Wisconsin in 2004, specific rabies antiviral treatment does not exist, and the prognosis remains inexorably grim in most cases. The latest information on experimental management of rabies cases may be found on the Medical College of Wisconsin website:<ulink url="http://www.mcw.edu/Pediatrics/InfectiousDiseases/PatientCare/rabies.html">http://www.mcw.edu/Pediatrics/InfectiousDiseases/PatientCare/rabies.html</ulink>.</para>

Increased morbidity and “early death” were also demonstrated in animals clinically ill with rabies (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0023">23</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0116s0001s0004p0005">All potential RABV exposures need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. True human exposures (bite or mucous membrane) to suspect animals or animals proven rabid should receive prompt medical intervention and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) as outlined in the recent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0024">24</link>), as follows.</para>
        <para id="ch0116s0001s0004p0006">Unvaccinated individuals exposed to a rabid animal should receive HRIG at a dose of 20 IU/kg of body weight. The HRIG should be infiltrated around the wound, and any remaining volume should be given at a site distant from where the vaccine was administered. In addition, four doses of a human RABV vaccine licensed for use in the United States should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid area (for children, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is acceptable but not the gluteal region) on days 0, 3, 7, and 14, and if indicated, a fifth dose should be given at day 28 following exposure. Individuals who previously received immunization against rabies require only two doses of vaccine on days 0 and 3, regardless of the current rabies virus-neutralizing antibody (VNA) titer (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0025">25</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0116s0001s0004p0007">Individuals at high risk for RABV exposure (laboratorians, field biologists, and veterinarians) are recommended to receive pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis (PrEP). According to the current ACIP guidelines for prevention of rabies in humans, a pre-exposure series of two doses of modern cell culture RABV (licensed for use in the United States) should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid on days 0 and 7. For all individuals receiving PrEP, a risk assessment for rabies exposure should be performed and risk classified at levels 1 to 5 (1 representing the highest-risk group and 5 the lowest-risk group). The ACIP post-PrEP follow-up recommendations are determined by the risk group (see the table in reference<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0024">24</link>). Individuals working under conditions with the highest risk for rabies exposure, such as in vaccine production, research, or diagnostic laboratories, typically have their VNA levels monitored more frequently, such as every 6 months. Pre-exposure vaccination and monitoring of detectable neutralizing antibodies at acceptable level (≥0.5 IU/mL) does not ensure protection from a particular exposure. Upon exposure, previously vaccinated individuals require cleansing of the wound and postexposure rabies vaccine doses on days 0 and 3 to prevent clinical disease.</para>

Diagnosis of rabies in animals requires postmortem examination of the brain. An adequate sample consists of a full cross section of the brain stem (pons, medulla, or midbrain areas) and cerebellum (vermis and right and left lateral lobes inclusive). Removal of CNS tissues should be performed by trained, vaccinated personnel wearing personal protective equipment (at a minimum, a closed-front gown or a lab coat with sleeves, double latex and nitrile or heavy rubber gloves, an N95 respirator, a face shield, safety glasses, and shoe covers).

The antemortem diagnosis of rabies in humans requires the collection of fresh saliva (no preservatives or transport media), a 5- to 6-mm-diameter full-thickness skin biopsy specimen (nuchal) from the nape of the neck at the hairline, including a minimum of 10 hair follicles (placed in a sterile container with no preservatives or transport media), and serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The saliva is tested by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The skin sample is also tested by real-time RT-PCR, and cryostat sections are tested for RABV antigen by a direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) test. The serum and CSF samples are analyzed by several methods, including rabies virus neutralization using the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), and for rabies virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies that bind to rabies antigens (proteins) in rabies-infected cells by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. Other samples, such as brain biopsy specimens for RABV antigen detection by the DFA test and real-time RT-PCR and cornea impressions, may be useful in diagnosis of rabies, but these samples are not routinely recommended because of the invasiveness of the collection methods and potential harmful sequelae. For the optimal sensitivity and specificity of antemortem diagnosis, all four samples (serum, CSF, saliva, and skin biopsy samples) should be tested. In some cases, repeated sequential sets of samples may be required to rule out or confirm a diagnosis.

        <para id="ch0116s0001s0005p0003">For postmortem diagnosis of rabies in humans, brain samples consisting of a cross section of brain stem and cerebellum, vermis, and right and left lobes are necessary. These samples are tested for RABV antigen, and if it is present, further antigenic and genetic characterization is performed. Formalin-fixed tissues can be analyzed for histopathology and antigen detection. However, these samples are not recommended for primary diagnosis of rabies unless fresh brain tissues are unavailable. Formalin-fixed samples require lengthy preparation for processing, embedding in paraffin, and sectioning prior to high-complexity experimental diagnostic techniques, which can delay a diagnosis. Postmortem or retained antemortem serum and CSF may be quite useful in confirming a postmortem diagnosis.</para>
        <para id="ch0116s0001s0005p0004">The shipment of samples to a testing laboratory for rabies diagnosis should follow the U.S. Department of Transportation’s guide to safe transport of infectious substances (<ulink url="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/transporting-infectious-substances/transporting-infectious-substances-safely">https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/transporting-infectious-substances/transporting-infectious-substances-safely</ulink>). Packaging of clinical samples for rabies diagnosis should fulfill International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations for shipment of biological substances, category B, UN 3373. Cell culture isolates and stock virus suspensions carry a higher infection risk, and their packaging should fulfill the IATA regulations for category A, UN 2814 (infectious substance affecting humans) and UN 2900 (affecting animals). Fresh-frozen samples for rabies testing should be sent with sufficient dry ice to maintain a storage temperature of ≤20°C (or with multiple ice packs to keep storage temperature in the range of 2 to 8°C for same-day delivery) to the diagnostic laboratory by the most expedient transport or courier method. Paraffin-embedded tissues and tissue sections (slides) should be shipped at ambient temperatures and never frozen.</para>
        <para id="ch0116s0001s0005p0005">The validity of laboratory diagnostic tests depends on optimal collection and storage of the samples. The ideal storage temperature for fresh brain tissues for RABV antigen detection, virus isolation, and real-time RT-PCR is −80°C. Storage for short intervals, such as 48 h or less at 4°C or 4 weeks or less at ≤−20°C, may be adequate for samples that are to be analyzed for RABV antigen. Tissues placed in 10% buffered formalin should remain in the fixative a minimum of 24 to 48 h at ambient temperature. Formalin-fixed brain tissues should be stored in 70% ethanol at room temperature for long-term storage and never frozen. Paraffin-embedded tissues and tissue sections (slides) should be stored at ambient temperatures and never frozen.</para>

Skin biopsy samples for real-time RT-PCR and antigen detection should also be stored at −80°C and shipped at −20°C or below. Samples for antigen detection may be stored for short intervals at −20°C before testing. Serum and CSF samples for rabies serologic testing should be stored at −20°C or below but may be stored for short intervals prior to testing at 4°C. Whole-blood samples should be centrifuged, and only the serum portion should be submitted for testing. Whole blood should never be shipped in the same container with samples on dry ice, because there is a risk of freezing and hemolysis regardless of packing insulation. Serum samples that demonstrate visible signs of hemolysis or appear chylous are unsatisfactory for testing. Other biological fluids (e.g., vitreous fluids, tracheal washings, and tears) for real-time RT-PCR or virus isolation require storage at −80°C or below and require shipping at −20°C or below.</para>

      <para id="ch0116s0002p0001">Microscopic examination methods may utilize routine stains (e.g., hematoxylin and eosin) to examine abnormal histopathology consistent with encephalomyelitis, or more specialized stains (e.g., Sellers, Mann’s, and Giemsa stains) to observe typical viral eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions, such as classical Negri bodies within neurons (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0026">26</link>). Historically, Sellers stain (2:1 methylene blue and basic fuchsin) was most often used for Negri body detection. In contrast with more advanced, sensitive antigen detection methods, this staining procedure is most successfully performed on brain tissues (hippocampi, cerebral cortex pyramidal cells, and the cerebellum Purkinje cells) during the later stages of disease, when inclusions are most abundant and more easily detected. Brain impression slides are stained for 2 to 10 min in Sellers stain (the time needed varies depending on the thickness of the impression) and then rinsed with tap water. Typically, intracytoplasmic magenta inclusions that are oval or round with dark blue basophilic granules appear within rabies virus-infected cells of the CNS. Although of historical importance, this method has limitations in specificity and sensitivity. For example, when properly performed, the Sellers staining technique may identify Negri bodies in 50 to 80% of rabid animals.</para>

        <para id="ch0116s0003s0001p0001">The standard test for RABV antigen detection in CNS tissues is the DFA test. This test is relatively easy to perform by highly trained personnel with specialized equipment, is highly specific, approximates 100% sensitivity, and can be completed in 3 or 4 h. The CDC’s protocol for postmortem diagnosis of rabies in animals by DFA testing may be obtained at<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/pdf/RabiesDFASPv2.pdf">https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/pdf/RabiesDFASPv2.pdf</ulink>. In contrast to the nonspecific staining of viral inclusions observed with histologic stains, the RABV diagnostic conjugates consist of antibodies to the whole virion or the RNP, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Within infected brain cells, there are abundant collections of RABV proteins (antigen), especially RNP. The conjugates may be hyperimmune, polyclonal, or monoclonal antibodies directed against highly conserved RABV epitopes.</para>
        <para id="ch0116s0003s0001p0002">Impression slides are prepared from a cross section of brain stem and cerebellum (right, left, and vermis) or hippocampi (right and left) if the cerebellum is not available and are fixed in acetone for a minimum of 1 h at −20°C. The brain impression slides are tested with two different anti-rabies virus conjugates to ensure antigen detection of the diverse RABV variants. When the conjugates are added to impressions of RABV-infected brain tissue and incubated for 30 min at 37°C, the labeled antibodies bind with the RABV proteins (antigens) and form specific antigen-antibody-FITC complexes. After the impression slides are washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice for 3 to 5 min, specific antigen-antibody complexes remain. These complexes fluoresce an intense sparkling apple-green color when observed with a fluorescence microscope equipped with an FITC filter combination. Morphologically, RABV antigen may appear as fluorescing large or small, oval or round inclusions, dust-like particles, or strands (<anchor id="ch0116s0003s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0116s0003s0002a0005">Fig. 3</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0116s0003s0002p0001">The direct rapid immunohistochemistry test (DRIT) is an alternative procedure for RABV antigen detection (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0028">28</link>). The DRIT uses a cocktail of purified biotinylated anti-rabies virus nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to detect RABV antigen. To date, the test has demonstrated sensitivity and specificity equal to that of the DFA test in detecting RABV antigen. The anticipated use for this test method includes confirmation for DFA testing and rapid rabies field tests as well as augmentation of passive public health surveillance, since, in contrast with fluorescence microscopy, light microscopy is adaptable to field use. In the United States, the test is currently applied to enhance rabies surveillance in samples from animals that have not exposed humans to the virus. The DRIT has been accepted by the World Health Organization and World Organization for Animal Health as an alternate test for rabies antigen detection when a fluorescence microscope is not available. Advantages of the procedure include rapidity of the procedure (1 h to completion), the inactivation of RABV in test brain impressions by fixation in formalin (in contrast to acetone fixation in the DFA test, which does not completely inactivate RABV), and the minimal equipment requirements (only a standard light microscope). The sample requirements for DRIT are the same as those for the DFA test and other antigen detection methods (see “Collection, Transport, and Storage of Specimens” above for detailed information). The DRIT is performed on brain touch impressions prepared as for the DFA test. Slides are fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 10 min, rinsed in PBS with 1% Tween 80 (TPBS), and then pretreated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min before primary antibodies are applied. The test is a multistep process involving biotinylated primary antibodies, streptavidin-peroxidase, and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC). First, there is an incubation with biotinylated anti-rabies virus MAbs for 10 min, followed by rinsing in TPBS; next is incubation with streptavidin-peroxidase for 10 min, followed by rinsing with TPBS; last is incubation with peroxidase substrate (AEC) for 10 min to initiate (red) color development, followed by rinsing with distilled water. Slides are counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin for 2 min, rinsed with water (and a cover glass is added with water-soluble mounting medium), and observed with a standard light microscope. RABV antigen appears as bright red, large or small, oval or round inclusions, dust-like particles, or strands against a contrasting blue background (<link linkend="ch0116s0003s0002a0005">Fig. 3</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0116s0003s0003p0001">Formalin-fixed CNS tissue samples cannot be tested by the standard DFA test. The fixation process causes chemical cross-linking of proteins. Formalin-fixed tissue samples that have been processed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned may be tested by a modification of the DFA test for formalin-fixed samples. RABV antigen detection, whether by standard DFA test, DRIT, or modified DFA test on formalin-fixed samples, requires the same tissue sampling of a complete cross section of brain stem and cerebellum. Modifications of the standard DFA test for formalin-fixed samples include heating the slides to 55 to 60°C to melt the paraffin, deparaffinization in xylene, and rehydration of tissue sections in graded alcohols. In addition, a proteinase K digestion for 30 min at 37°C is needed for detection of RABV epitopes. Incubation with anti-rabies virus FITC conjugate is longer than the standard DFA test incubation (i.e., 1 h instead of 30 min), and the wash times in PBS (twice at 15 min) are longer to clear unbound conjugate from tissue sections (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0029">29</link>). The reliability of this method depends on the availability of a high-affinity, highly concentrated polyclonal anti-rabies virus conjugate, because the modified standard DFA test for formalin-fixed tissues may require a working dilution of RABV conjugate as much as 5 to 10 times more concentrated for sensitive and specific detection of RABV antigen in these tissue samples.</para>

The IHC protocol also requires heating the slides to 55 to 60°C to melt the paraffin, deparaffinization of tissue sections in xylene, rehydration of tissue sections in graded alcohols, and enzyme digestion but with pronase instead of proteinase K. The remaining IHC test steps are similar to the multistep DRIT: 3% hydrogen peroxide is added for 10 min, and the mixture is incubated for 10 min to remove endogenous peroxidase activity. Then, normal goat serum is added, and slides are incubated for 15 min to block nonspecific binding of the primary antibody. The primary anti-rabies virus monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies are added and incubated for 60 min. The secondary antispecies biotinylated antibody is added and incubated for 15 min, followed by a rinse in TPBS and incubation with streptavidin-peroxidase for 15 min. After rinsing with TPBS, slides are incubated with peroxidase substrate, AEC, for 5 to 10 min to initiate (red) color development, followed by rinsing with distilled water. Finally, slides are counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin for 2 min and rinsed with water, and coverslips are added with water-soluble mounting medium. Slides are observed with a standard light microscope. RABV antigen appears as bright red, large or small, oval or round inclusions or dust-like particles within the cytoplasm of infected neurons against a light blue background of the hematoxylin-stained tissue. Advantages of the IHC test over the standard DFA test modified for formalin-fixed samples include the ability to test for RABV antigen and other etiologies simultaneously by including antibodies to the other agents, the ability to examine the histopathology of tissues, and the ability to observe slides with a standard light microscope rather than a fluorescence microscope. Disadvantages are the time required for the procedure (approximately 6 h) and the high complexity of the method, requiring optimization of multiple antibodies and reagents.</para>

The DFA test on tissue sections is performed exactly as the standard DFA test on CNS tissues. In its antemortem application, the method has optimized sensitivity but may be negative in early stages of the clinical disease or in later clinical stages if virus-neutralizing antibodies are present. On rare occasions, real-time or nested RT-PCR on a negative DFA test has confirmed a rabies diagnosis when antigen was not present in sufficient quantity to visualize by the DFA test on skin sections.</para>

      <para id="ch0116s0004p0001">RT-PCR methods are the most sensitive tests for RABV diagnosis. The sensitivity of RT-PCR depends in part on the sample (type and condition), the integrity of sample handling and storage to preclude contamination and degradation, the method of RNA extraction and RT-PCR, the primers selected for amplification, the quality of reagents, individual technical expertise, interpretation of the results, and confirmation methods. The usefulness of traditional RT-PCR as a routine diagnostic test on postmortem (fresh and fixed) CNS tissues is limited. Highly sensitive, broadly reactive, less expensive, and less time-consuming procedures for antigen detection by DFA testing and real-time RT-PCR are more efficient routine tests for rabies diagnosis and confirmatory testing. RT-PCR methods have been essential tools for molecular analysis for decades, but their greatest utility has been the detection of nucleic acid in non-CNS samples (e.g., antemortem saliva, skin, cornea impressions, tears, eye swabs, throat swabs, and postmortem vitreous fluid) when fresh CNS tissues may be unavailable. When all conditions are optimal, traditional RT-PCR can detect as little as 1 infectious unit of RABV. However, real-time or nested RT-PCR increases the sensitivity (10- to 100-fold) to below 1 infectious unit of virus (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0032">32</link>). RNA may be limited or degraded in non-CNS samples, and real-time RT-PCR is routinely used on these samples. Until recently, the diversity among lyssaviruses and the lack of specific nondegenerate universal primers have discouraged the use of real-time PCR for detection of rabies virus RNA in non-CNS samples when the rabies virus variant or lyssavirus species is unknown. Recently, broadly reactive rapid real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed for the detection of all lyssaviruses. A newly developed real-time RT-PCR assay named LN34, which uses a combination of degenerate primers and probes, has been developed and validated at the CDC for antemortem human and confirmatory postmortem animal testing covered under CLIA (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0034">34</link>). The testing has demonstrated sensitivity and specificity equal to that of the DFA test in evaluations to date. The primers and probes of the LN34 assay target the highly conserved noncoding leader region and part of the nucleoprotein coding sequence of the lyssavirus genome and have broad reactivity with all known lyssaviruses.</para>

Since there is a high potential for generation of aerosol or droplet production, virus isolation of phylogroup 1 lyssaviruses should be performed at the minimum recommended biosafety level, BSL-2 “with additional precautions, such inclusion of BSL-3 practices and procedures” (<link linkend="ch0116s0008s0003li0020">20</link>). However, virus isolation of phylogroup 2 and 3 lyssaviruses must be performed at full BSL-3. Classical isolation methods include <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> isolation in animals (usually intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice) and <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> virus isolation in cell cultures. For most routine diagnostic needs, the inoculation of cell cultures such as mouse neuroblastoma (MNA; Lonza Inc., Walkersville, MD) or a similar alternative cell culture line, Neuro-2a (CCL 131; ATCC, Rockville, MD), provides the same sensitivity as animal inoculation but with quicker results and without the maintenance required for the use of laboratory animals. For these purposes, 0.4 ml of supernatant from a 20% brain suspension prepared in tissue culture medium with 10% fetal calf serum (MEM10) is inoculated into a suspension of 4 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> MNA cells/2 ml and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. To maximize infection of the cells, gentle mixing of the suspension is performed every 15 min. The cell suspension is diluted to a volume of 10 ml with MEM10, 6 ml is transferred to one 25-ml cell culture flask, and the remaining suspension (4 ml) is transferred to 12 Teflon-coated 6-mm slides (or other cell culture slides). At least one slide should be acetone fixed daily and examined by DFA testing for RABV antigen. At least one additional passage of the cell culture (performed in 3 to 5 days) is required to rule out rabies.

Typing methods are useful under a variety of circumstances, such as determining the RABV variants in human cases with unclear or unknown exposure histories, discovering the emergence of new viruses, monitoring the epidemiologic spread or reemergence of virus in defined geographical areas, detecting spillover or host switching of variants from the predominant host species to another species, and monitoring the success of rabies vaccination programs through characterization of positive samples.</para>

Neutralization of RABV relies on the presence of antibodies directed to the outer glycoprotein rabies virus antigens; these are functional assays measuring performance, prevention of a known challenge dose of rabies virus to infect cells in culture. Historically, the test was performed in mice, but since the 1970s, it has been replaced by the RFFIT and a modification of it, the fluorescent-antibody virus neutralization test (FAVN) (performed in 96-well microtiter plates). Both of these test methods measure the ability of RABV antibodies in serum or CSF samples to neutralize a known standard challenge virus dose. The RFFIT and FAVN are most frequently used to determine the immunization status of vaccinated humans and animals, respectively.

All reagents for antigen detection should be optimized before use with known positive samples from two or more RABV variants endemic to the geographic region and known negative control samples. The accuracy and limitations of each diagnostic test should be understood before interpretation of the test results (<link linkend="ch0116s0001s0005a0006">Table 1</link>). The national standard protocol in the United States for rabies diagnosis in postmortem brain tissues is the DFA test. Procedural requirements of the standard DFA test, DRIT, real-time RT-PCR, and isolation methods maximize sensitivity by testing the CNS tissues most likely to be positive in rabid animals (brain stem and cerebellum). The problem of cross-contamination in direct detection and amplification methods can be avoided by processing necropsy samples separately, using separate containers for acetone fixation and rinse steps of DFA tests, and using different dedicated laboratory areas for processing RNA and cDNA samples for RT-PCR. Multiple readers are required to evaluate each of the diagnostic tests and provide quality assurance. Confirmatory DFA testing is required for all rabies diagnostic tests with weak reactions or unusual results (atypical morphology, atypical reactions patterns, and epidemiologic inconsistencies). Samples with nonspecific reactions and inconclusive results should be sent to a reference laboratory for confirmation and alternative testing methods. The incorporation of the CLIA-validated LN34 real-time RT-PCR assay as an additional confirmatory test increases confidence in resolution of indeterminate DFA tests. The timeliness of reporting results directly affects medical intervention in humans and management of exposed animals. Ideally, a primary rabies diagnosis from CNS tissues of suspect animals (or humans) should be made in 24 to 48 h so that potentially exposed humans and animals may be appropriately managed for the optimal prevention of human and animal rabies.</para>
