        <para id="ch0039s000000p0001">The genus<emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> includes microorganisms that have a historical connection with the genus <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis>, as they were initially considered a distinct branch within the genus <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis>, including most of the serological group D streptococci (see references <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0003">3</link> for a historical overview). Since the introduction of molecular methods, there have been considerable changes in taxonomy, which started with the splitting of the genus <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> and the recognition of <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> as a separate genus in 1984 (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0004">4</link>). Indeed, as phylogenetic analyses based on the comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences evolved, members of the genus <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> were found to be more closely related to certain other genera than to <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Lactococcus</emphasis>, another genus with which they have been phenotypically associated (1–3, 5). Such observations culminated in the proposal to assign the genus <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> to a newly designated family (<emphasis>Enterococcaceae</emphasis> fam. nov.) of the phylum <emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis>, class <emphasis>Bacilli</emphasis>, order <emphasis>Lactobacillales</emphasis>, along with the genera <emphasis>Melissococcus, Tetragenococcus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Vagococcus</emphasis>. Subsequently, three additional genera, <emphasis>Bavariicoccus, Catellicoccus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Pilibacter</emphasis>, were assigned to this family (<ulink url="https://lpsn.dsmz.de/family/enterococcaceae">https://lpsn.dsmz.de/family/enterococcaceae</ulink>) (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0006">6</link>). Our knowledge about the phylogenetic relationships among these microorganisms is still evolving, and the current taxonomic arrangements may undergo additional amendments as more robust phylogenetic tools are available and are more extensively applied.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0002">Like the other members of the family<emphasis>Enterococcaceae</emphasis>, the genus <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> is composed by Gram-positive, catalase-negative bacteria with DNA of low guanine-plus-cytosine content (G+C &lt; 50 mol%). The enterococci are the most clinically important members of the family, since they are more frequently found in clinical specimens and are widely distributed in nature. These properties may account, at least in part, for the relative heterogeneity among these microorganisms, leading to the concept that <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> is neither a phylogenetically nor a phenotypically coherent genus. The increasing use of molecular approaches in recent decades has led to the description of several new enterococcal species and engendered many nomenclatural changes, resulting in the present recognition of over 69 species assigned to the genus <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> (as of July 2022; for further details, see references <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link> and <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>, as well as the <emphasis>List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature</emphasis> [<ulink url="https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/enterococcus">https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/enterococcus</ulink>]). <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> is the type genus of the family <emphasis>Enterococcaceae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Enterococcus faecalis</emphasis> is the type species of the genus <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis>.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0003">Current criteria for inclusion in the genus<emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> and for the description of new enterococcal species encompass a polyphasic approach resulting from a combination of different molecular techniques (frequently involving whole-genome sequencing [WGS], 16S rRNA gene sequencing, DNA-DNA hybridization, determination of DNA G+C content, fatty acid methyl esters chromatographic analysis, and whole-cell protein [WCP] profiling analysis) and phenotypic testing. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is a practical and powerful tool in aiding the identification of enterococcal species, and it has been performed for all species of <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> recognized to date, although limitations for differentiating a few enterococcal species have been documented (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>). <anchor id="ch0039s000000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0039s000000a0006">Fig. 1</link> shows the phylogenetic relationships among the diverse species of <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> based on the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, which are available from the GenBank database (as of July 2022). Sequencing assays targeting other genetic determinants have increasingly been used as additional tools to assess the phylogenetic relationships among enterococcal species and to formulate the description of new species (for further details, see references <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0003">3</link>, and <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>, and “Identification” below). Housekeeping genes coding for proteins involved in basic cellular functions, such as the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase (<emphasis>pheS</emphasis> gene), the RNA polymerase α-subunit (<emphasis>rpoA</emphasis> gene), the RNA polymerase β-subunit (<emphasis>rpoB</emphasis> gene), and the ATP synthase α-subunit (<emphasis>atpA</emphasis> gene), are the most common targets for these sequencing approaches, based on the analysis of a single gene or multiple genes, under the format of multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of concatenated sequences (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>). Comparative analysis of spectra generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has also been incorporated into the array of methodologies used for taxonomic purposes in more recent times (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0007">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0009">9</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0039s000000p0004">The members of the genus<emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> are Gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci that occur singly or are arranged in pairs, short chains, or as small irregular clusters (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>). They do not form endospores. Cells are sometimes coccobacillary when Gram stains are prepared from growth on solid medium but tend to be ovoid and in chains when grown in liquid media, such as thioglycolate broth. After growth on blood agar media for 24 h, colonies are usually between 1 and 2 mm in diameter, although some variants may be smaller. About one-third of <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> isolates are β-hemolytic on agar containing rabbit, horse, or human blood but nonhemolytic on agar containing sheep blood. Some isolates of <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Enterococcus durans</emphasis> are β-hemolytic regardless of the type of blood used. The other species are usually α-hemolytic or nonhemolytic.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0005">Enterococci are facultative anaerobes with a homofermentative metabolism that results in the production of<phrase role="small">L</phrase>-(+)-lactic acid as the major end product of glucose fermentation. Because of their ability to ferment a wide range of carbohydrates to lactic acid, the enterococci are referred to as typical lactic acid bacteria. Gas is not produced. Most enterococci usually grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 45°C, with optimum growth at 35°C to 37°C. The majority of the species grow in broth containing 6.5% NaCl, hydrolyze esculin in the presence of bile salts (bile-esculin [BE] test), and they also hydrolyze leucine-β-naphthylamide by producing leucine aminopeptidase (LAPase). Apart from all or some isolates of certain infrequently reported species (including <emphasis>Enterococcus bulliens, Enterococcus canintestini, Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus columbae, Enterococcus devriesei, Enterococcus dongliensis, Enterococcus hulanensis, Enterococcus moraviensis, Enterococcus nangangensis, Enterococcus pallens, Enterococcus pingfangensis, Enterococcus saccharolyticus, Enterococcus termitis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Enterococcus viikkiensis</emphasis>), most enterococci hydrolyze <phrase role="small">L</phrase>-pyrrolidonyl-β-naphthylamide (PYR) by producing pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (pyrrolidonase [PYRase]). Results for both LAP and PYR testing, especially for some of the more recently described species, may vary according to the methodology, including the test format and medium used to grow the bacterial cells.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0006">A few species are motile (<emphasis>Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus gallinarum</emphasis>, and the more recently described species <emphasis>Enterococcus massiliensis</emphasis> and “<emphasis>Enterococcus timonensis</emphasis>”) by scanty flagella, and several are yellow pigmented (<emphasis>E. bulliens, E. casseliflavus, Enterococcus gilvus, Enterococcus innesii</emphasis>, “<emphasis>Enterococcus mediterraneensis</emphasis>,” <emphasis>Enterococcus mundtii, E. pallens, Enterococcus plantarum, Enterococcus rotai, Enterococcus sulfureus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Enterococcus ureilyticus</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>). Methods used for detection of enterococcal motility must be selected carefully, as differences in motility due to the composition of the medium have been demonstrated (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0010">10</link>). Enterococci are not able to synthesize porphyrins and, therefore, do not produce cytochrome enzymes (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0011">11</link>). However, cytochrome activity is sometimes expressed when certain strains of <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> are grown on blood-containing agar media, and it is observed as a weak effervescence in the catalase test. Positive catalase testing has also been reported for strains of <emphasis>Enterococcus haemoperoxidus, Enterococcus silesiacus, E. plantarum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. bulliens</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0007">7</link>) when cultivated on blood-containing agar media.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0007">Most enterococcal strains produce a cell wall-associated glycerol teichoic acid that is identified as Lancefield’s serological group D antigen. The DNA G+C contents range from about 32 to 45 mol%. The genome sizes are in the range of approximately 2.3 to 3.4 Mb (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0012">12</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0014">14</link>). WGS of <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> V583 (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0015">15</link>), the first vancomycin-resistant clinical isolate reported in the United States, was followed by WGS of several other strains of a variety of enterococcal species and has opened many lines of investigation to improve our understanding about the genus <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis>. The genomes of most species of <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> have been sequenced and are available at specialized sites and databases, such as the NCBI (<ulink url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome</ulink>), the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Genomes OnLine Database (JGI GOLD) (<ulink url="https://gold.jgi.doe.gov">https://gold.jgi.doe.gov</ulink>), and the Type (Strain) Genome Server (TYGS) (<ulink url="https://tygs.dsmz.de">https://tygs.dsmz.de</ulink>).</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0008">The other genera of catalase-negative Gram-positive cocci and the characteristics that distinguish them from the enterococci are discussed in<ulink url="ch0036#ch0036s0001s0001">chapters 20</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0038#ch0038s0001">22</ulink>. No phenotypic criteria are available for clearly distinguishing the genus <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> unequivocally from other genera, since there are no distinct characteristics that are common to all enterococci. Additionally, some characteristics have not yet been reported for the more recently identified and lesser-known species or have been tested by different methodologies, impairing the comparison of results and generating inconsistencies in identification.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0009">However, certain characteristics are usually found in the majority of the strains belonging to the most frequently isolated enterococcal species. Presumptive identification of a Gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus as an<emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> can be accomplished by demonstrating that the strain is positive for the BE, PYR, and LAP tests and grows in the presence of 6.5% NaCl and at 45°C. Because strains of <emphasis>Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Vagococcus</emphasis> with phenotypic similarities have been isolated from human infections (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0017">17</link>), the presumptive identification of enterococci based only on BE reaction and growth in 6.5% NaCl broth can be erroneous. Demonstrating the presence of group D antigen by serological reaction may be helpful in the identification, although this antigen is detected in only about 80% of the enterococcal strains. On the other hand, members of the <emphasis>Streptococcus bovis</emphasis>-<emphasis>Streptococcus equinus</emphasis> complex, as well as pediococci and leuconostocs (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0016">16</link>) and some vagococcal strains (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0017">17</link>), can also react with anti-group D serum. Since certain characteristics traditionally considered typical for the genus do not apply to some atypical strains and to several of the more recently described species, the criteria mentioned above may exclude several isolates or species. The use of molecular identification methods, such as a PCR-based test having the <emphasis>tuf</emphasis> gene as a genus-specific target and MALDI-TOF MS, may be helpful in circumventing these difficulties by correctly identifying both typical and unusual <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> isolates at the genus level (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0019">19</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0039s000000p0010">Several intrinsic characteristics of the enterococci allow them to grow and survive in harsh conditions and colonize diverse ecological niches. These microorganisms are widespread in nature and can be found in soil, plants, water, food, and animals, including mammals, birds, insects, and reptiles (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0021">21</link>). In humans, they are predominantly inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract and are less commonly found in other sites, such as in the genitourinary tract, the oral cavity, and skin, especially in the perineal area. Enterococci are usually considered among the most abundant Gram-positive cocci colonizing the gastrointestinal tract of humans, with <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> being one of the most common bacterial species recovered from this site (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0020">20</link>). Other species, such as <emphasis>Enterococcus faecium, E. casseliflavus, E. durans</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. gallinarum</emphasis>, are also found in variable proportions. The diversity of species and size of enterococcal populations in the intestinal microbiome of humans appear to be influenced by age, diet, and other factors that may be related to changes in physiologic conditions, such as underlying diseases and prior antimicrobial therapy (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0020">20</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0039s000000p0011">Since the enterococci are opportunistic pathogens, the incidence of each species found in human infections probably reflects the distribution of the different species of<emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> in the human gastrointestinal tract. This site is believed to represent the major reservoir for strains associated with disease; from this location they may spread to cause infections and can also disseminate to other hosts and to the environment (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0023">23</link>). The presence of high numbers of enterococci in the feces, as well as their ability to resist different chemical and physical conditions and to survive in the environment, implies that the enterococci can be used as indicators of fecal contamination and of the hygienic quality of food, milk, and drinking water (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0024">24</link>).

        <para id="ch0039s000000p0012">Transmission of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) represents a major public health concern. Hospitalized patients with intestinal carriage of VRE appear to be the main reservoir of the organism and, once colonized, the patients remain so for weeks or months. Thus, as colonized patients leave the hospital, the possibility that transmission might occur in the community cannot be discounted. VRE can be disseminated by direct patient-to-patient contact or indirectly via transient carriage on the hands of health care personnel; contaminated medical instruments, such as glucose meters, blood pressure cuffs, electronic thermometers, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors and wires; and environmental surfaces, such as patient gowns and linens, beds, bedside rails, overbed tables, floors, toilets, door knobs, and wash basins (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0023">23</link>). Besides surviving for long periods on environmental surfaces, these microorganisms are tolerant to heat, chlorine, and some alcohol preparations, enhancing the possibilities for transmission.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0013">As a response to the rising rates of VRE colonization and infection in U.S. hospitals, the CDC’s Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) had early on established guidelines with recommendations for preventing the spread of VRE (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0027">27</link>), which were later reinforced when guidelines on the management of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, including VRE, were released (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0028">28</link>). National guidelines have also been developed for use in different countries, and adherence has been reported to have a positive effect on VRE containment in hospital settings (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0029">29</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0032">32</link>). Overall, the recommendations include prudent vancomycin use, implementation of surveillance procedures for early detection of VRE, and infection control procedures to limit cross-contamination, such as isolation precautions, hand washing, and education about transmission of VRE.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0014">Although only a small percentage of colonized patients develop serious systemic enterococcal infections, intestinal colonization with VRE has been clearly associated with subsequent VRE infections. However, in certain specific clinical situations (i.e., liver transplant recipients, patients on chronic hemodialysis, and patients with hematological malignancies), VRE-colonized patients appear to be at increased risk for developing serious enterococcal infections (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0033">33</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0036">36</link>).

        <para id="ch0039s000000p0016">The enterococci are commensal microorganisms that act as opportunistic agents causing a variety of infections in humans. Many of these infections have been suggested to arise from translocation of the enterococcal cells from their major site of colonization in the gastrointestinal tract. They most commonly cause infections in the urinary tract, bloodstream, endocardium, burn and surgical-site wounds, abdomen, biliary tract, catheters and other implanted medical devices (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0033">33</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0042">42</link>). The ubiquitous presence of enterococci, however, requires caution in establishing the clinical significance of a particular isolate. Unnecessary work and potentially misleading laboratory reports should be avoided whenever possible, especially with respect to <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> susceptibility testing decisions (see “Antimicrobial Susceptibilities” below). Over the last decades, enterococci have emerged from being considered virtually harmless bacteria to medically important, multiple antibiotic-resistant health care-associated pathogens that contribute significantly to patient morbidity and mortality, as well as to increasing health care costs. Changes in the dynamics of the host-commensal relationship, such as those promoted by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, host injury, or diminished host immunity, could allow these bacteria to gain access to extraintestinal host sites and cause infection. Therefore, elderly patients with serious underlying diseases and other severely ill immunocompromised patients who have been hospitalized for prolonged periods, who have been treated with invasive devices, and/or who have received broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy are at higher risk for acquiring enterococcal infections (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0034">34</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0042">42</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0017">Several potential virulence factors have been identified in enterococcal isolates that may play a role in the pathogenesis of enterococcal infections, including the surface adhesins Esp (enterococcal surface protein) and aggregation substance (AS), secreted toxin cytolysin/hemolysin, secreted proteases gelatinase and serine protease, extracellular superoxide, MSCRAMM Ace (adhesin to collagen of<emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis>), <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> antigen A (EfaA), enterococcal capsule, and cell wall polysaccharides (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0043">43</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0046">46</link>). Nevertheless, none has been established as a major virulence factor in humans. One mechanism by which the enterococci can deviate from their commensal behavior is through the acquisition of new traits that allow the bacterium to overcome host defenses and colonize new niches, as suggested by the identification of the <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> pathogenicity island (PAI), which is more often present in strains causing infection than in commensal strains (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0047">47</link>). In this context, acquired antimicrobial resistance is considered one of the many traits that virulent enterococci possess more frequently than commensal isolates that allow members of this genus to survive for extended periods of time in the host or environment, leading to their persistence and role as prominent health care-associated pathogens (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0047">47</link>). In addition, enterococci can transfer resistance determinants to other bacteria, for example, staphylococci, which further increases the clinical importance of the enterococci.</para>

Early identification of infection or colonization by VRE is recommended to prevent the spread of these microorganisms (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0069">69</link>). Current recommendations for hospital infection control may include VRE fecal surveillance cultures. Different selective agar and/or broth medium formulations and several procedures have been employed for the isolation of VRE from sources containing normal microbiota, such as stool samples and rectal or perianal swab specimens. Most of them are variations of selective media that differ with regard to the antimicrobial agents or the antimicrobial concentrations used.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0036">Although no consensus for a VRE isolation protocol has been established, the use of a selective-enrichment broth seems highly effective for enhancing the recovery of VRE. For this purpose, BHI broth has been used with vancomycin concentrations from 3 μg/ml to 30 μg/ml (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0071">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0088">88</link>). Bile-esculin-azide (BEA) broth supplemented with vancomycin at concentrations of 4 μg/ml to 15 μg/ml (BEAV) (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0070">70</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0080">80</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0088">88</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0090">90</link>) and Enterococcosel broth medium supplemented with concentrations of vancomycin from 4 μg/ml to 64 μg/ml (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0070">70</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0088">88</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0090">90</link>) have also been used in a number of studies. One advantage that the bile-esculin based broth media have over BHI-based media is that media containing esculin turn black as the enterococci grow, and if the esculin-containing medium does not turn black, it can be assumed that no enterococci are present. Several studies report improved recovery of VRE from selective-enrichment broth over that of direct plating (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0088">88</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0089">89</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0091">91</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0093">93</link>). Among the different concentrations of vancomycin used, 6 μg/ml is the most commonly used. In some of the protocols, various concentrations of other antimicrobial agents, such as aztreonam, meropenem, and clindamycin, have been used in the enrichment broth. There are no studies reporting extensive comparison of recovery rates of VRE from different selective-enrichment broths.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0037">Media containing chromogenic substrates are available for the isolation and presumptive identification of enterococci (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0073">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0091">91</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0100">100</link>). <anchor id="ch0039s000000a0020"/><link linkend="ch0039s000000a0022">Table 1</link> lists chromogenic media that are commercially available, as well as the concentration of vancomycin in each. Most of these media allow for the identification of the two main vancomycin-resistant enterococcal species, <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis>. The chromogenic agars with FDA approval for use with human specimens are Brilliance VRE agar, ChromID VRE, CHROMagar VRE, Spectra VRE, and VRESelect medium (<link linkend="ch0039s000000a0022">Table 1</link>). Some chromogenic media that are selective for VRE have the advantage over the bile esculin-based selective media in that the colors of the colonies can help in the presumptive identification of VRE species. In some surveillance studies, selective enrichment was used prior to inoculation of the chromogenic agar, while in others, the clinical samples were directly inoculated onto the surface of the agar. It has been reported that in certain circumstances, some of these chromogenic agars may produce false-positive results. An investigation monitoring VRE in a neonatal intensive care unit using Spectra VRE showed that several vancomycin-susceptible enterococci grew on this medium (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0099">99</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0038">In some circumstances, it may be necessary to recover VRE from environmental surfaces for epidemiological studies. Isolation of the organisms from these surfaces can be accomplished by swabbing the surfaces with premoistened swabs and placing them either into a selective-enrichment broth or onto selective agar plates.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0039">Large-volume screening for VRE detection by using chromogenic culture media may take advantage of automation systems available in some diagnostic laboratories. For instance, the use of the WASPLab system (Copan, Brescia, Italy) has been evaluated for automated specimen processing and digital image reading analysis of chromogenic media for detection of VRE (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0098">98</link>). Among a total of 104,730 rectal swab samples examined, automation agreed with manual analysis for 90.1% of all samples tested, with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 89.5%, respectively (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0098">98</link>). The results indicate the robustness of the system, and studies are needed to more accurately address comparisons of cost estimates and time differences to manual processing.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0040">Culture-based screening methods for VRE may be especially demanding, can take several days to complete, and have variable degrees of sensitivity, all of which can impact the timely implementation of infection control procedures. Therefore, some microbiology laboratories have considered the introduction of molecular techniques to detect VRE to facilitate the rapid and accurate identification of these organisms and to improve sensitivity for detecting this pathogen in comparison with culture. However, many of the current approaches still depend on bacterial growth in culture prior to detection, requiring 24 h or more to complete. Consequently, the application of methods for a more rapid detection of VRE directly from clinical samples is still an area of significant interest for improvements (see “Direct Examination” above).</para>

      <para id="ch0039s000000p0051">Overall, a large proportion of enterococcal isolates recovered from human sources will be accurately identified by most of the commercial systems now available; however, the accuracy is dependent on the distribution of species found in each specific setting. For example, the Vitek 2 system was found to identify 99.2% and 91.7% of a set of<emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> isolates at the genus and species level, respectively, but only 76% of the <emphasis>E. casseliflavus</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. gallinarum</emphasis> isolates were correctly identified at the species level (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0102">102</link>). These figures are in general agreement with our observations by using the Vitek 2, indicating a lower efficiency in discriminating <emphasis>E. casseliflavus</emphasis> from <emphasis>E. gallinarum, E. avium</emphasis> from <emphasis>E. raffinosus</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. pseudoavium</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. durans</emphasis> from <emphasis>E. hirae</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis> (our unpublished data). Difficulties in the identification of a variety of enterococcal species, sometimes including <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis>, have been reported (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0102">102</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0104">104</link>). Strict adherence to the instructions provided by the manufacturer, including the media used to grow strains for testing, is of paramount importance. Our own unpublished experimental results indicate that differences in growth conditions can lead to variation in the results of some tests, interfering with the accuracy of the identification. Additionally, the discriminatory limits of each system, as usually specified in the instructions by the manufacturer, should always be taken into consideration. Identification of an unusual enterococcal species by a commercial system should be confirmed by a reference method before being reported.</para>

      <para id="ch0039s000000p0052">In the last few years, MALDI-TOF MS has been considered a revolutionary tool for bacterial identification in the clinical microbiology laboratory, by providing rapid, accurate and highly convenient identification of a wide range of microorganisms, including enterococcal species (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0102">102</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0104">104</link>). Two major MALDI-TOF MS platforms are available at this time: the Microflex LT Biotyper (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and the Vitek MS system (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Data on the evaluation of these platforms indicate that they are able to identify correctly most of the enterococcal isolates tested (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0102">102</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0105">105</link>). However, at this point, extensive evaluation of either system, including all the different enterococcal species, is still not available, and <emphasis>E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. casseliflavus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. gallinarum</emphasis> remain the species more extensively tested by this methodology. Although the numbers of studies and enterococcal species tested are still limited, the results indicate that the method constitutes an important tool to rapidly identify the major enterococcal species recovered from human sources and certainly deserves to be further evaluated for the identification of the diverse members of the genus <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis>, including isolates with a variety of biochemical profiles and obtained from different sources. In addition, MALDI-TOF MS has also been applied directly on positive blood cultures and urine cultures, providing more rapid results (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0106">106</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0107">107</link>), but these methodologic approaches may need to be further evaluated and improved before being adopted as routine procedures for the diagnosis of enterococcal infections.</para>

      <para id="ch0039s000000p0053">Molecular methods, such as DNA-DNA hybridization and sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes, have been primarily used for taxonomic purposes in reference or research laboratories. In recent decades, however, the application of molecular techniques for the rapid identification of<emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> species has also been expanded dramatically for use in clinical microbiology laboratories.</para>
      <para id="ch0039s000000p0054">A variety of molecular procedures have been proposed for the identification of enterococcal species, as previously reviewed and summarized (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0088">88</link>). Many of these molecular procedures have been performed in only a few laboratories and have not been evaluated for all species of <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis>. Most of them are potentially applicable to all enterococcal species, and others are species specific. Several of these methods deserve consideration for expanded testing and future improvements, as they represent promising adjunct tools for a more rapid and precise identification of enterococcal species.</para>
      <para id="ch0039s000000p0055">Most of the data presented in<link linkend="ch0039s000000a0029">Table 2</link>, which describes the phenotypic characteristics of the <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> species discussed in this chapter, are based on correlations between results of phenotypic tests and analysis of WCP profiles, in conjunction with DNA-DNA reassociation experiments and 16S RNA gene sequencing (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0108">108</link>). Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is currently the most frequently used among the nucleic acid-based methods for identification of enterococcal species. It has been performed for all species of enterococci, and the sequences are available for comparison purposes via public databases of nucleotide sequences, such as GenBank. Comparisons can be made by using one of the several sequence-comparing software packages, many of which are available for public access. <link linkend="ch0039s000000a0006">Figure 1</link> depicts a dendrogram generated by comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences of the type strains of the species included in the genus <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis>. Nevertheless, clear-cut differentiation is not always obtained for all enterococcal species, such as <emphasis>E. casseliflavus</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. gallinarum</emphasis>, since some of them differ by only 2 or 3 bases over the approximately 1,500-base span of the 16S rRNA gene. Therefore, this procedure should not be used alone, but, together with phenotypic characterization and other alternative molecular methods, it can be an important tool to establish enterococcal species identity. Several other housekeeping genes have been investigated as alternative tools to develop sequencing-based methods to identify enterococci, either alone or in association. They include the <emphasis>atpA, pheS, rpoA</emphasis>, and <emphasis>rpoB</emphasis> genes, as well as <emphasis>sodA</emphasis> (coding for the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase) and <emphasis>tufA</emphasis> (coding for the elongation factor Tu) (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0109">109</link>). Their use has mostly been restricted to taxonomic purposes, and none has been systematically applied to all the enterococcal species described to date. However, as genome sequence databases continue to grow and the costs of DNA sequencing decrease, genome-based methodologies may constitute useful tools to identify <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> isolates in diagnostic laboratories.</para>
      <para id="ch0039s000000p0056">PCR-based techniques have also been a focus of major interest for rapid and accurate enterococcal identification.

      <para id="ch0039s000000p0057">The use of molecular methods for the rapid identification of enterococci directly from positive blood culture bottles has also been investigated.

Other commercially available diagnostic systems based on nucleic acid technologies that have been cleared by the FDA include the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) nucleic acid test (Nanosphere, Inc., Northbrook, IL) (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0113">113</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0114">114</link>), the BioFire FilmArray blood culture identification (BCID) panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0115">115</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0117">117</link>), and the ePlex blood culture identification Gram-positive (BCID-GP) panels (GenMark Diagnostics, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0118">118</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0039s000000p0058">These multiplex tests are capable of detecting most leading causes of bloodstream infections due to Gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, as well as the genetic markers of vancomycin resistance<emphasis>vanA</emphasis> and <emphasis>vanB</emphasis>. Typically, only these two antimicrobial resistance-associated targets (<emphasis>vanA</emphasis> and <emphasis>vanB</emphasis>) are included on the molecular detection panels, and this constitutes a limitation of these systems due to their inability to detect vancomycin resistance genes other than <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> or <emphasis>vanB</emphasis>. Overall, they have been considered relatively easy to implement, leading to earlier identification of invasive infections caused by <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> species in comparison with conventional microbiological methods. Therefore, these technologies can also have a significant impact on clinical and economical outcome of patients with enterococcal bacteremia, by decreasing the time to antimicrobial therapy, the length of hospital stay, and health care costs.

Classic phenotypic methods used to investigate the diversity among isolates of a given enterococcal species have frequently failed to adequately discriminate among strains, and they have limited value in epidemiological studies. However, phenotypic information in association with molecular data can constitute valuable information (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0088">88</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0039s000000p0060">Several molecular methods to type enterococcal isolates have been proposed, as previously reviewed (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0088">88</link>). In addition to differences in complexity and costs, these methods vary in their reproducibility and discriminatory power. Overall, there is not a single definitive typing technique for enterococci, so a strong match among the results of different typing techniques, particularly those based on different genomic polymorphisms, should be interpreted as indicative of close relatedness. Use of these techniques has substantially improved the ability to distinguish enterococcal isolates from one another within a given species and provided critical insights into the epidemiology of the enterococci. By using molecular typing approaches, the exogenous acquisition of enterococcal strains by direct and indirect contact among patients was demonstrated, breaking the traditional conception that enterococcal infections were endogenous. Intrahospital transmission and interhospital spread have been extensively documented for antimicrobial-resistant enterococci, especially VRE (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0120">120</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0122">122</link>). In addition to epidemiological investigations, some molecular typing techniques are now used to trace the dissemination of enterococci in different environments and hosts and the evolution of multidrug-resistant strains, greatly expanding our understanding of enterococcal epidemiology, population structure, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence. Emergence and global dispersion of certain epidemic enterococcal lineages and clonal complexes have been identified (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0121">121</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0125">125</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0061">Among these techniques, analysis of chromosomal DNA restriction profiles by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been extensively evaluated for epidemiological characterization of enterococcal outbreaks, showing high discriminatory power and allowing the identification of clonal groups that predominate among multidrug-resistant enterococci, mainly isolates with high-level resistance (HLR) to aminoglycosides and VRE (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0061">61</link>–<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0063">63</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0120">120</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0123">123</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0124">124</link>). For a long time, PFGE was considered the gold standard for epidemiological analysis of enterococcal outbreaks, although the lack of standardized protocols for execution, interpretation, and nomenclature constituted difficulties for interlaboratory data exchange and comparisons. Additionally, the occurrence of genetic events can be associated with substantial changes in the PFGE profiles, leading to difficulties in clonality assessment (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0126">126</link>). Therefore, PFGE is recommended mostly for the purpose of evaluating the genetic relatedness and tracing transmission of strains that are associated in time and location, as its usefulness for long-term epidemiological studies may be limited. Use of PFGE in conjunction with at least one additional typing technique is recommended to help in clarifying epidemiological interpretation. General principles proposed for the interpretation of molecular typing data based on fragment differences are usually applied to interpret PFGE profiles obtained for enterococcal strains (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0127">127</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0062">Subsequently, two other molecular techniques were developed for typing enterococci and shown to be suitable for their assignment into distinct clonal complexes: multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). These techniques circumvent the difficulties in data exchange between different laboratories by generating information that is suitable for the development of web-based databases. Despite its overt advantages (being reproducible, portable, highly discriminatory, and unambiguous), MLST is time-consuming, expensive, and still limited to laboratories that have facilities for both PCR and sequencing, while MLVA requires PCR and basic electrophoresis facilities. Comparative studies indicated that both techniques can achieve high degrees of discrimination between isolates and have discriminatory power comparable to that of PFGE-based typing (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0120">120</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0128">128</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0129">129</link>), while in some other studies, MLVA was found to be less discriminatory than PFGE and MLST (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0130">130</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0063">Two simultaneously published studies described the development of MLVA typing schemes for<emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0131">131</link>) and <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0132">132</link>). MLVA is based on variation in variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci dispersed over the enterococcal genome. For each VNTR locus, the number of repeats is determined by PCR using primers based on the conserved flanking regions of the tandem repeats. PCR products are separated on agarose gels, and the band size determines the number of repeats. These numbers together result in an MLVA profile, and each profile is assigned an MLVA type (MT). Assignment to a given MT was performed by comparison with specific databases, which were discontinued a few years ago, making difficult the continuity of the MLVA nomenclature and the application of this technique.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0064">On the other hand, MLST quickly replaced PFGE as the gold standard for typing enterococcal isolates. MLST is based on identifying alleles after sequencing of internal fragments of a number of selected housekeeping genes, resulting in a numeric allelic profile. Each profile is assigned a sequence type (ST). One of the major advantages of MLST is the possibility of using standard protocols and nomenclature and the establishment of databases that are accessible online, which are fundamental for studying the global spread and long-term transmission of strains.

        <para id="ch0039s000000p0066">Comparisons of available genome sequences supported the concept of a hospital-associated clade that is genetically distinct from most commensal isolates (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0134">134</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0135">135</link>). However, the assumption that CC17 isolates emerged from a single “founder” ST was contested when the analyses of the genetic relatedness of <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis> MLST data was performed with Bayesian analysis of genetic population structure (BAPS) software instead of the eBURST algorithm initially used (see references <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0014">14</link> and <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0135">135</link> for details). According to this line of interpretation, <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis> isolates can be placed in two genomically distinguishable groups, descending from ST17, -18, and -78, referred to in the literature as “lineages” or “clades”: a hospital-associated lineage (clade A) and a community-associated lineage (clade B). Clade A is further split into clade A1, represented by human clinical isolates, and several non-A1 subclades that, together with clade B isolates, are rarely found in hospitalized patients. In a recent proposal, clade B isolates have been reassigned to the species <emphasis>Enterococcus lactis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0136">136</link>). In contrast to the pronounced clade structure of <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis>, the population structure of <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> was found to be less discrete (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0120">120</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0129">129</link>).

Enterococcal intrinsic resistance involves several antimicrobial agents, particularly two major groups: the aminoglycosides and the β-lactams. Because of the poor activity of several antimicrobial agents against enterococci due to intrinsic resistance, the recommended therapy for serious infections (i.e., endocarditis, meningitis, and other systemic infections), especially in immunocompromised patients, includes a combination of a cell wall-active agent, such as a β-lactam (usually penicillin or ampicillin) or vancomycin, and an aminoglycoside (usually gentamicin or streptomycin). These combinations overcome the intrinsic resistance exhibited by the enterococci, and a synergistic bactericidal effect is generally achieved, since the intracellular penetration of the aminoglycoside is facilitated by the cell wall-active agent.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0071">In addition to the intrinsic resistance traits, enterococci have acquired different genetic determinants that confer resistance to several classes of antimicrobial agents, including chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins, aminoglycosides, β-lactams, glycopeptides, quinolones, and even some of the more recently available drugs, such as linezolid, daptomycin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0151">151</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0152">152</link>). During the past several decades, the occurrence of acquired antimicrobial resistance among enterococci, especially HLR to aminoglycosides, β-lactams, and resistance to glycopeptides (especially vancomycin), has been increasingly reported. Isolates that are resistant to the cell wall-active agent or have HLR to aminoglycosides are resistant to the synergistic effects of combination therapy. Therefore, the detection of resistance to these groups of antimicrobial agents is critical in order to predict the likelihood of achieving synergy by using antimicrobial combinations as a therapeutic strategy. Enterococcal isolates exhibiting HLR to aminoglycosides are now present in large proportions in several geographic areas (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0051">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0151">151</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0152">152</link>). Such strains frequently have MICs of &gt;2,000 μg/ml and cannot be detected by diffusion tests with conventional disks. Special tests using high-content gentamicin and streptomycin disks, as well as a single dilution method, were developed to screen for this type of resistance (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0153">153</link>) (see <ulink url="ch0090#ch0090s0001">chapters 72</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0092#ch0092s0001">74</ulink>).</para>

Results of susceptibility testing with ampicillin may be used to predict susceptibility to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin, and piperacillin-tazobactam among non-β-lactamase-producing enterococci. Ampicillin susceptibility can also be used to predict imipenem susceptibility, provided that the species is <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0153">153</link>). However, enterococcal susceptibility to penicillin cannot be predicted on the basis of ampicillin testing results. If penicillin results are needed, testing of penicillin is required. On the other hand, enterococci susceptible to penicillin are predictably susceptible to ampicillin and the other β-lactams mentioned above. Penicillin and ampicillin resistance due to β-lactamase production is not reliably detected by routine disk or dilution methods but is detected by using a nitrocefin-based β-lactamase test (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0153">153</link>).</para>

Ten types of resistance to glycopeptides have been described to date among enterococci. Each type is associated with different genetic elements, some of which, in turn, can be divided into subtypes. Three of them are the most common: the VanA phenotype, with inducible high-level resistance to vancomycin as well as to teicoplanin, encoded by the <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> gene; the VanB phenotype, with variable (moderate to high) levels of inducible resistance to vancomycin only, encoded by the <emphasis>vanB</emphasis> genes; and the VanC phenotype, encoded by the <emphasis>vanC</emphasis> genes, conferring constitutive low-level resistance to vancomycin. VanA and VanB are considered the most clinically relevant phenotypes and are usually associated with <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> isolates, while VanC resistance is an intrinsic characteristic of <emphasis>E. gallinarum</emphasis> (<emphasis>vanC1</emphasis> genotype) and <emphasis>E. casseliflavus</emphasis> (<emphasis>vanC2</emphasis> to <emphasis>vanC4</emphasis> genotypes) (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0151">151</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0156">156</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0157">157</link>). The additional types of glycopeptide resistance, encoded by the <emphasis>vanD, vanE, vanG, vanL, vanM, vanN</emphasis>, and <emphasis>vanP</emphasis> genes (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0122">122</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0151">151</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0157">157</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0158">158</link>), seem to occur rarely among enterococci.

Resistance associated with <emphasis>vanC</emphasis> genotypes is not usually detected by disk diffusion, but VanC strains frequently grow on vancomycin agar screen tests. Because of the low clinical significance of VanC resistance, the implications of susceptibility testing for patient management may be unclear. However, the need to differentiate VanA or VanB strains, as well as strains displaying the other less commonly found types of acquired vancomycin resistance, from VanC strains is quite evident for therapeutic, infection control, and surveillance reasons. Because growth on vancomycin screening agar fails to help with this important distinction, species identification is necessary. For practical purposes, growth on the vancomycin screening agar test by <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> or <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis> is likely due to the presence of <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> or <emphasis>vanB</emphasis>. Although rare, the occurrence of the other kinds of vancomycin resistance may also be considered. Additionally, simultaneous occurrence of the <emphasis>vanA</emphasis> gene has been increasingly reported in <emphasis>vanC</emphasis>-carrying species, <emphasis>E. casseliflavus</emphasis> and especially <emphasis>E. gallinarum</emphasis>, so that identification of a species that usually harbors only VanC resistance does not completely rule out moderate to high levels of vancomycin resistance (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0062">62</link>). In this regard, determining vancomycin MICs is useful, as VanC resistance frequently results in MICs of &lt;32 μg/ml, whereas VanA and VanB usually result in MICs of &gt;32 μg/ml. In such cases, determination of the genetic elements associated with vancomycin resistance has important epidemiological and infection control implications. Also, resistance to other agents such as ampicillin and aminoglycosides is less common among VanC isolates.</para>

Furthermore, CLSI and EUCAST have different recommendations for a variety of parameters that impact the interpretation and impair comparison of results with regard to clinically relevant antimicrobials. Therefore, the need for harmonization of testing and reporting guidelines is of importance in an era of global antimicrobial resistance and is a growing public health concern.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0078">Some of these discrepancies among CLSI and EUCAST are related to differences in antimicrobial disk concentrations (for ampicillin, gentamicin, linezolid, nitrofurantoin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin, among others) and the availability of breakpoints for some antimicrobial agents by CLSI but not by EUCAST and vice versa. For example, breakpoints for daptomycin, fosfomycin, penicillin, and tetracycline have been proposed by CLSI but not by EUCAST, whereas imipenem and tigecycline breakpoints have been presented by EUCAST but not by CLSI.

        <para id="ch0039s000000p0079">The diversity and species specificity of acquired antimicrobial resistance traits among enterococcal isolates created an additional need for accurate identification at the species level and for<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> evaluation of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. The significance of a particular enterococcal isolate is a major factor in determining when antimicrobial testing should be done. Once the need to test a particular isolate has been established, selection of the appropriate antimicrobial agents for testing must be considered based on the site of infection. Testing of antimicrobial agents to which enterococci are intrinsically resistant is contraindicated. The drugs that should not be reported include aminoglycosides at standard concentrations, cephalosporins, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. They may appear active for enterococci <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> but are not effective clinically, and as such, they should not be reported as susceptible. Updated guidelines (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0153">153</link>) for the selection of antimicrobial agents should be followed for routine testing and reporting. The <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> methods for detecting antimicrobial resistance in enterococcal isolates are reviewed and summarized in references <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0001">1</link> and <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0152">152</link> and are also discussed in <ulink url="ch0090#ch0090s0001">chapters 72</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0092#ch0092s0001">74</ulink>.</para>
        <para id="ch0039s000000p0080">As already mentioned, testing for high-level aminoglycoside resistance as a predictor of synergy should be done with any enterococcal isolate implicated in infections for which combination therapy is indicated, e.g., from systemic infections. Enterococci are also frequently encountered in polymicrobial infections associated with the gastrointestinal tract or superficial wounds of hospitalized patients. Their pathogenic significance in such settings is uncertain, but susceptibility testing is warranted when predominant or heavy growth is observed. Testing of<emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> isolates from lower urinary tract infections is optional, as these infections usually respond to therapy with ampicillin or nitrofurantoin. However, many hospital infection control programs require routine testing as part of surveillance programs for VRE. For instances in which testing a urinary tract isolate is appropriate, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and tetracycline could be selected, in addition to nitrofurantoin and ampicillin (<link linkend="ch0039s000000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0039s000000li0153">153</link>). In cases of treatment failure, testing is always warranted.</para>
