      <para id="ch0178s0000p0002">Parasitic diseases rank among the most prevalent and severe diseases worldwide. While there are a number of tools used for control of parasitic diseases, such as diagnosis, surveillance, and active case management, one of the primary tools remains chemotherapy or prophylaxis. The danger of depending on drugs as one of the primary tools for control is compounded by the relatively limited number of antiparasitic agents available. Furthermore, those drugs that are available are sometimes of poor quality or counterfeit (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0001">1</link>), encouraging the selection of drug-resistant parasites (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0003">3</link>). It has also been argued that mass drug administration (MDA), endorsed by many control programs, may in fact encourage the emergence of resistant parasites, particularly where there is migration to and from other areas of high endemicity or poor adherence to the correct dosage regimes (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0004">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0178s0000p0003">The complex biologic interactions between parasites and their hosts (and, at times, their vectors) significantly influence the emergence and expression of drug resistance. In many cases the observed resistance is attributable to biologic characteristics of the parasites that enable them to survive drug concentrations that are lethal to susceptible members of the species. Mechanisms for such true resistance are varied; common mechanisms include decreases in drug accumulation within the parasite and modifications in parasite enzyme structure, metabolic pathways, or cellular targets. However, various host factors modulate the clinical and parasitological responses to drug treatment, and observed responses do not necessarily reflect true parasite resistance or susceptibility. For example, in populations with high rates of some parasitic infections, the resulting high rates of immunity might suffice to eliminate an infection even if the parasites are resistant to drugs or are treated with a poorly effective drug. Conversely, treatment with a drug to which the parasite is biologically susceptible will not necessarily result in therapeutic success if the patient takes an inadequate dose of the drug, absorbs it poorly, or lacks the immune response that might be needed for a successful antiparasitic synergism with the drug. Host factors may be especially important in the areas where most parasitic diseases prevail, where high rates of parasite transmission result in high rates of immunity in most of the population, or where, conversely, malnutrition and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection compromise the patient’s immune status.</para>

      <para id="ch0178s0000p0005">The development of resistance to all antimalarial drugs poses the greatest challenge for malaria control and prevention globally. The evolution of parasites resistant to antimalarial drugs is a common occurrence, and resistance to the latest artemisinin-based combination therapies is becoming more widespread globally, including on the African continent, which has the highest malaria burden (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0006">6</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0178s0000p0006">Sub-Saharan Africa contributes about 90% of the annual 229 million malaria cases worldwide, as well as the vast majority of the estimated 409,000 deaths (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0007">7</link>). Severe malaria affects mainly those in areas of endemicity without adequate acquired clinical immunity, such as young children under the age of 5 years and pregnant women. Since the beginning of the 21st century, expanded efforts to strengthen integrated malaria control have led to a reduction in malaria morbidity and mortality rates (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0007">7</link>). Critical elements of these programs have included widespread use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0008">8</link>) and the global establishment of diagnostic testing for malaria, followed by treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). These therapies combine a drug with a long elimination half-life paired with a rapidly active drug able to destroy a large but often incomplete parasite load in a few hours. Artemisinin, a substance extracted from sagebrush grown mainly in China, generates oxidative stress in the parasite. However, the parasite has evolved a mechanism by which it promotes “proteostasis” to mitigate artemisinin-induced death (due to oxidation and protein toxicity) (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0009">9</link>). In addition, recent evidence suggests that artemisinin-resistant parasites may also persist longer by utilizing different host niches and adapting to escape the host immune response (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0009">9</link>). While artemisinin molecular resistance is now established in various parts of the world, clinical failure to ACTs is developing more slowly. This is primarily due to the fact that the combination of multiple drugs in ACTs enhances clinical efficacy and delays the development of parasite resistance to all drugs. The longer-acting partner drugs currently include amodiaquine, lumefantrine, mefloquine, piperaquine, pyronaridine, or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.</para>

      <para id="ch0178s0000p0014">The 4-amino quinoline drug chloroquine was a cornerstone of antimalarial chemotherapy since the 1940s due to its low cost, safety, and rapid action. Following the simultaneous emergence of chloroquine resistance in Oceania, Southeast Asia, and South America in the 1950s and 1960s, resistance spread widely (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0010">10</link>). By the early 1980s, chloroquine against <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> was discontinued in India, with most African nations also discontinuing its use between the 1990s and 2000s as the frequency of chloroquine-resistant <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> strains increased (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0011">11</link>). From limited original foci in Southeast Asia, South America, and Papua New Guinea, resistance spread inexorably and is now found in most areas of endemicity, including Africa, the continent with the heaviest malaria burden. Chloroquine no longer constitutes an appropriate option for prompt and effective treatment (or prophylaxis) in most countries where <emphasis>Plasmodium falciparum</emphasis> malaria is the dominant endemic species. Although the level of resistance to chloroquine is decreasing in some areas since its use was officially ceased (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0011">11</link>), there are concerns that any reintroduction of chloroquine as a monotherapy might lead to a reemergence of resistance (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0012">12</link>). Chloroquine retains efficacy against <emphasis>Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Plasmodium knowlesi</emphasis> infections in most parts of the world, though chloroquine-resistant <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> is common in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Oceania (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0013">13</link>) and has also been reported from Madagascar and Ethiopia (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0010">10</link>). Low levels of chloroquine resistance in <emphasis>P. malariae</emphasis> have been reported from Sumatra, Indonesia (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0014">14</link>). Resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, the second most affordable, relatively safe, and easily administered drug after chloroquine, emerged in the late 1970s (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0015">15</link>). Nevertheless, specific groups of people (e.g., pregnant women) in areas of endemicity still rely on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for intermittent preventive treatment as the most effective way to prevent severe consequences of malaria (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0016">16</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0178s0000p0015">Chloroquine concentrates from nanomolar levels outside the parasite to millimolar levels within the digestive vacuole of the intraerythrocytic trophozoite, where it inhibits hemoglobin degradation (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0017">17</link>). Chloroquine forms complexes with hematin, a by-product of host-cell hemoglobin digestion by the parasite; this formation results in accumulation of ferriprotoporphyrin IX in large quantities that eventually kill the parasite. Resistant isolates possess a defect in chloroquine accumulation in the digestive vacuole (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0018">18</link>). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the altered chloroquine accumulation, such as changes in the pH gradient or altered membrane permeability leading to a decreased drug uptake or increased drug efflux (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0019">19</link>). Chloroquine accumulation is most prominent in the digestive vacuole, which suggests the involvement of either a specific transporter/permease or a molecule associated with hematin in the digestive vacuole (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0020">20</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0178s0000p0016">Following the initial demonstration that chloroquine resistance is reversible by verapamil, subsequent studies focused on the orthologue of the mammalian multidrug resistance (<emphasis>mdr</emphasis>) gene, whose products are overexpressed in cancer cells, where they expel cytotoxic drugs (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0021">21</link>). This led to the identification of the <emphasis>pfmdr1</emphasis> gene product (protein PfPGH-1), a transporter located in the membrane of the parasite digestive vacuole (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0022">22</link>). Chloroquine susceptibility is altered by PfPGH-1 mutated at specific amino acid residues and in specific parasite genetic backgrounds (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0023">23</link>). However, current evidence indicates that <emphasis>pfmdr1</emphasis> only plays a secondary role in chloroquine resistance, except in Madagascar, where it plays a major role in chloroquine treatment failures (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0024">24</link>). More recently, by use of a genetic cross between chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant parasites, inheritance data led to the key discovery of the <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> chloroquine resistance transporter gene <emphasis>pfcrt</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0026">26</link>).</para>

      <beginpage pagenum="3034"/>
      <para id="ch0178s0000p0017">The<emphasis>pfcrt</emphasis> gene encodes a transmembrane protein (PfCRT), similar to PfPGH-1, located in the membrane of the digestive vacuole (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0026">26</link>). A complex set of mutations (or haplotype) of this gene is found in most real-world chloroquine treatment failure isolates and in isolates with an <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>-induced chloroquine-resistant phenotype (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0026">26</link>–<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0028">28</link>). Furthermore, transfection of chloroquine-susceptible parasites with the mutant <emphasis>pfcrt</emphasis> genes found in resistant isolates confers chloroquine resistance (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0029">29</link>). Mutant PfCRT can excrete chloroquine from the digestive vacuole (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0030">30</link>) due to a positive charge loss at codon 76 (usually the K76T mutation) in the first transmembrane helix of the transporter (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0031">31</link>). The role of most other <emphasis>pfcrt</emphasis> mutations that systematically accompany K76T remains elusive (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0019">19</link>). A major setback in chloroquine resistance was the emergence on the Thai-Cambodian border in the 1950s of mutations in codons 72 through 76 of the <emphasis>pfcrt</emphasis> gene under drug-pressure selection; parasites with mutations in these codons are widespread in the Asian and African regions (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0032">32</link>). Nonetheless, the wild-type <emphasis>pfcrt</emphasis> parasites have not been totally replaced, and their prevalence increases when drug pressure is removed (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0033">33</link>). Its estimated prevalence may offer a useful predictor of the clinical efficacy of chloroquine in a given area, provided that appropriate adjustments are made for host factors, particularly immunity, that may result in parasite clearance despite treatment with an ineffective drug (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0034">34</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0178s0000p0018">Amodiaquine, piperaquine, and pyronaridine, which are long-acting partner drugs paired with an artemisinin in ACTs, share with chloroquine a quinoline scaffold, whereas mefloquine and lumefantrine, other long-acting partner drugs in ACTs, belong to amino-alcohols. Neither the mechanism of action of these drugs nor resistances to them are as clearly understood as for chloroquine. However, the<emphasis>pfmdr1</emphasis> gene appears to be involved in parasite response to diverse antimalarials because point mutations or amplification of the gene may alter parasite susceptibility to desethyl amodiaquine (the active metabolite of amodiaquine), quinine, mefloquine, lumefantrine, and artemisinins (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0035">35</link>–<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0038">38</link>). Similarly, wild-type and various mutant <emphasis>pfcrt</emphasis> alleles have been associated with altered susceptibility to various antimalarials (lumefantrine, amodiaquine, piperaquine, artemisinin derivatives) in addition to chloroquine (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0039">39</link>). Transporters other than PfCRT and PfPGH-1, such as PfMRP-1 and PfNHE-1, may be involved in resistance to mefloquine, lumefantrine, pyrimethamine (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0041">41</link>), and quinine. Gene amplification of <emphasis>plasmepsin 2</emphasis> and <emphasis>3</emphasis>, which encode vacuolar proteases, and specific <emphasis>pfcrt</emphasis> mutations, such as H97Y, F145I, M343L or G353V, have all been associated with piperaquine resistance (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0042">42</link>–<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0046">46</link>), suggesting a vacuolar target for piperaquine.</para>
      <para id="ch0178s0000p0019"><emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> resistance to artemisinins initially emerged in the mid-2000s in Cambodia (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0047">47</link>) and then spread to multiple Southeast Asian locations (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0048">48</link>). Specifically, <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> parasite clearance half-lives were substantially delayed in most patients from western Cambodia as compared to other countries (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0049">49</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0178s0000p0020">Extensive genetic studies identified specific regions of the parasite genome associated with delayed<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> parasite-clearance time (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0051">51</link>). Comparative genomics of laboratory-selected and Cambodian field-derived artemisinin-resistant parasites led to the identification of single amino acid changes in the <emphasis>kelch</emphasis> (or propeller) domain of the <emphasis>k13</emphasis> gene as a genetic marker of artemisinin resistance (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0052">52</link>). Gene editing of artemisinin-susceptible parasites demonstrated that the introduction of <emphasis>k13</emphasis> mutations found in resistant isolates may confer decreased susceptibility (partial resistance) to artemisinin (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0053">53</link>). Parasites carrying <emphasis>k13</emphasis> mutations exhibit a deceleration of cell development during the early intraerythrocytic stage and an altered proteostasis response (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0055">55</link>). At the biochemical level, the <emphasis>k13</emphasis> mutations alter the binding of K13 protein with the parasite’s phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, resulting in decreased ubiquitin-mediated degradation (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0056">56</link>). The exact mechanism, including the direct and indirect effects of the mutation on the malaria parasite, is undergoing further research. Whereas multiple <emphasis>k13</emphasis> resistance mutations originated when artemisinin partial resistance was first detected, a single <emphasis>k13</emphasis> C580Y mutant parasite lineage has now spread throughout the East Thailand-Cambodia-Lao PDR-Vietnam region, probably because of associated partner drug resistance and better fitness of the parasite (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0058">58</link>). Recently, clinically resistant <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> parasites with either an A675V or a C469Y mutation in <emphasis>k13</emphasis> were identified in Northern Uganda, confirming the independent emergence of artemisinin-resistant parasites in sub-Saharan Africa (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0059">59</link>).</para>

Mutations in the <emphasis>Flacipain 2a</emphasis> gene are believed to impact hemoglobin uptake and hence lessen artemisinin effects (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0060">60</link>). Another study, using <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> isolates from Senegal, identified a mutation in cronin (an F-actin binding protein) that also led decreased susceptibility to artemisinins (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0061">61</link>).

      <para id="ch0178s0000p0022">In drugs that antagonize a single enzyme, such as antifolates or inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, a single gene modification is often sufficient to generate high-grade resistance. Malaria parasites mostly rely on<emphasis>de novo</emphasis> synthesis for folate supply. Cycloguanil (produced by the prodrug proguanil) and its analogue, pyrimethamine, were the first satisfactory synthetic antifolate antimalarials on the market in the 1940s. Both inhibit the plasmodial dihydrofolate reductase (PfDHFR), a key enzyme in the folate synthesis pathway of the parasite. Unfortunately, resistance emerged almost instantaneously and independently from several areas where the drugs had been introduced, and these antimalarials were soon supplanted by chloroquine (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0063">63</link>). Resurgence in the use of PfDHFR inhibitors took place with the demonstration in 1967 that potentiation with other antifolates from the sulfone/sulfonamide group (such as sulfadoxine or dapsone) bypassed resistance, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine became the new frontrunner to counter chloroquine resistance in Southeast Asia (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0063">63</link>). However, resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine emerged soon after the increased use of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Thailand. Resistance to PfDHFR inhibitors is conferred by mutant PfDHFR enzymes, to which antifolate drugs bind less efficiently than to the wild-type version (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0064">64</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0065">65</link>). Stepwise acquisition of pyrimethamine and then sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> is mirrored by the stepwise acquisitions of PfDHFR mutations: first the key S108N mutation, then the additive N51I and C59R mutations, and finally the additive I164L mutation (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0066">66</link>). Other additive mutations can be found in specific areas such as in South America (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0067">67</link>). The quadruple mutation N51I-C59R-S108N in <emphasis>dhfr</emphasis> plus S437G in <emphasis>dhps</emphasis>, which associates with a high level of pyrimethamine resistance as well as with decreased susceptibility to chloproguanil-dapsone (an attempt to develop a new antifolate combination similar to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine), has been reported, mostly in Southeast Asia. However, the triple mutant N51I-C59R-S108N, widespread in Africa, is also associated with treatment failure to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0068">68</link>). This triple-mutant N51I-C59R-S108N <emphasis>pfdhfr</emphasis> gene emerged in Southeast Asia and then spread throughout Asia and Africa in subsequent years (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0070">70</link>).</para>

Resistance to sulfadoxine has been traced to a set of sequential mutations in the <emphasis>pfdhps</emphasis> gene. The likely initial event consisted of an A437G mutation, with subsequent additional mutations (K540E, A581G, A613S/T) conferring increasing degrees of resistance (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0072">72</link>). These resistance mutations have appeared independently multiple times and in multiple sites of endemicity (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0073">73</link>). Altogether, resistance to the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination appears to require three mutations in the <emphasis>pfdhfr</emphasis> gene (N51I-C59R-S108N), and the probability of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment failure increases with additional mutations in <emphasis>pfdhps.</emphasis> The clinical outcome of a sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment is subject to additional host factors such as the level of folates and of acquired immunity, drug absorption, and metabolism (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0068">68</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0074">74</link>).

      <para id="ch0178s0000p0024">The combination of atovaquone and proguanil was registered in 1996 in North America and Europe, where, within 10 years, it became a popular antimalarial for prophylaxis and a first-line treatment of non-severe<emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> malaria. It is now a second-line treatment after ACTs (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0076">76</link>).

In association with proguanil, the effective concentration at which it collapses the mitochondrial membrane potential is diminished (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0078">78</link>). In addition, proguanil is partially metabolized to the antifolate cycloguanil by human P450 cytochromes. The contribution of the resulting low cycloguanil blood concentrations to the therapeutic efficacy of atovaquone-proguanil remains to be substantiated. As with the antifolates, atovaquone resistance emerged almost immediately (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0079">79</link>). Resistance to atovaquone is conferred by mutant PfCytB, to which atovaquone binds less efficiently than to the wild-type version (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0080">80</link>). The substitution of tyrosine for serine, cysteine, or asparagine in codon 268 of PfCytB is associated with treatment failures and confers a high level of atovaquone resistance (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0081">81</link>) that proguanil could not thwart (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0082">82</link>).

Because of the risk of rapid development of resistance and high cost of the drug, the deployment of atovaquone-proguanil in malaria-endemic regions has not been prioritized.</para>

Due to this impaired oxygen scavenging, nitroimidazoles compete with oxygen for ferredoxin-bound electrons and are reduced at a slower rate.

        <para id="ch0178s0000p0037">Pentavalent antimonials are prodrugs that are reduced within the mammalian host cell or parasite to an active trivalent form that boosts the intracellular cytotoxic potential of macrophages and disrupts the parasite’s redox metabolism.

One mechanism by which this occurs is a decrease in aquaglyceroporin 1 (AQP1) on the parasite’s surface, resulting in decreased uptake of drug (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0147">147</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0148">148</link>). Higher expression of AQP1 by the species that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) than by those that cause VL confers greater sensitivity of CL to antimonial treatment.

In SSG-resistant clinical isolates from Bihar, increased copy numbers of the H locus of chromosome 23, which includes the MRPA gene, were observed (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0157">157</link>).

        <para id="ch0178s0000p0044">Praziquantel is the only drug currently being used for treatment of schistosomiasis. It is effective against all schistosome species that infect humans and makes up the backbone of schistosomiasis control programs through preventive chemotherapy (PC). Typically, a single drug widely administered to large numbers of people is a recipe for driving the development of drug resistance. However, although a few potential incidents of clinical praziquantel resistance have been described (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0181">181</link>), there is as yet no widespread resistance in schistosomiasis, even in areas with high-intensity treatment pressure for a prolonged time (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0182">182</link>–<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0184">184</link>). This fortuitous phenomenon may be aided by the fact that schistosomes do not asexually replicate within humans who receive treatment, although it does occur in the intermediate snail host. Thus, unlike protozoan parasites, selective drug pressure is absent during parasite multiplication, reducing the ease with which resistance could develop. Ironically, incomplete coverage of PC in control programs leaves ample refugia of untreated worms that may also deter emergence of widespread resistance to praziquantel (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0185">185</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0178s0000p0045">The mechanism of action of praziquantel is not definitively understood, making it more difficult to identify occurrence and mechanisms of developed resistance. The unique beta subunit of the schistosome calcium ion channel is a molecular target for praziquantel, with treatment rapidly inducing a calcium-dependent sustained muscle contraction in the worm’s tegument (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0186">186</link>). The praziquantel-induced damage to the tegument of adult schistosomes renders the worms susceptible to attack and killing by the host’s immune response. Resistant strains of parasites demonstrate less tegumental damage caused by praziquantel than do susceptible strains (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0187">187</link>). The addition of calcium channel blockers inhibits the effects of praziquantel <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0188">188</link>), supporting this proposed mechanism of action. However, experiments inducing complete praziquantel resistance using the actin-depolymerizing agent cytochalasin D demonstrated increased calcium influx, also seen in immature schistosomes exposed to praziquantel, which raises doubt about our assumptions about the mode of action (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0189">189</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0178s0000p0046">Reduced susceptibility of<emphasis>Schistosoma mansoni</emphasis> to praziquantel in the field has been reported from Egypt, Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and Kenya (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0190">190</link>–<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0194">194</link>). When investigating such treatment failures in schistosomiasis, it is important to distinguish characteristics leading to reduced drug efficacy from true drug resistance. For example, persons with very high levels of infection are less likely to cure with single-dose therapy than individuals with lower worm burdens (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0195">195</link>). The sensitivity of the method used in diagnosis used also will affect the findings of treatment efficacy studies. For example, the use of the point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) urine cassette test, which detects infection with both mature and immature schistosomes, will identify more residual infections following treatment than Kato-Katz fecal microscopy (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0196">196</link>). Both of these issues are in part related to the fact that praziquantel is only effective against the adult stage of the parasite and that, even under the best conditions, a single dose does not demonstrate complete efficacy (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0185">185</link>). Immature worms that may be present at the time of drug treatment, especially in areas of high transmission, are not susceptible to praziquantel and subsequently develop into patent infections that give the impression of treatment failure. As a result, two treatments spaced 4 to 6 weeks apart are more effective than a single treatment and should be attempted when drug resistance is suspected (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0197">197</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0198">198</link>). Rapid reinfection in areas of high transmission should also be considered as a possible explanation for suspected praziquantel treatment failure (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0199">199</link>, <link linkend="ch0178s0000li0200">200</link>). Furthermore, host immunity plays a role in the clearance of schistosome infections during praziquantel treatment, and reduced susceptibility in Senegal was observed in the context of a relatively immune naive local population (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0192">192</link>).</para>

The lethal effects on cell homeostasis are seen in adult helminths as well as eggs and larvae (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0225">225</link>). The exact binding site of benzimidazoles remains unclear, but three possible modes of action have been suggested.

        <para id="ch0178s0000p0056">An important concept in the population genetics of anthelmintic resistance development during PC campaigns is refugia. When an entire population of helminths in a given geographical area is mass treated with a single anthelmintic drug, only a very small number of individuals possessing a resistant genotype will remain. Should these selected resistant individuals reproduce, their larvae will likely inherit their mechanism of resistance, either as a homozygous or heterozygous trait (depending on the resistance genotype status of the mate). In the absence of a sizeable homozygous susceptible population due to eradication by widespread MDA, the resultant generations will have a large proportion of homozygous or heterozygous drug-resistant individuals (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0231">231</link>). This effect would be amplified by subsequent rounds of MDA. In the case where large numbers of homozygous susceptible individuals remain present in the overall STH population of an area (refugia), the selective pressure of PC is mitigated, as these susceptible-genotype individuals will dilute the prevalence of any resistant genotype in the overall population by mating with the few resistant individuals present. In the context of PC for the public health control of human STH infections, several factors allow such refugia to occur and decrease the chance of widescale anthelmintic resistance developing. These factors are: (i) the massive number of homozygous susceptible eggs or larvae still present in the environment at times when PC is performed; (ii) that PC is only given to women of reproductive age (except during the first trimester of pregnancy), pre-school-aged children, and school-aged children (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0215">215</link>), allowing refugia in the remaining untreated members of the community; and (iii) that PC is given annually or biannually (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0215">215</link>), allowing time for new susceptible-genotype nematode infections acquired from the environment to mature and produce many offspring.</para>

        <para id="ch0178s0000p0057">While widespread resistance to benzimidazole derivative drugs has not been reported in human soil-transmitted helminth populations at the time of writing, the mechanisms for this to emerge do exist. Programs to monitor for the emergence of anthelmintic resistance in STH globally are in place (<link linkend="ch0178s0000li0232">232</link>). To avoid this occurring, the population dynamics of helminth resistance, in particular the maintenance of refugia, must be considered when undertaking PC for the control of STH infections.</para>

        <para id="ch0178s0000p0058">Several factors contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant parasites. Those parasite species with short life cycles and high multiplication rates that occur in areas of intense transmission are most likely to develop resistant subpopulations. The selection of such populations is encouraged when the parasites are repeatedly exposed to suboptimal drug concentrations. This pattern can result from the use of drugs with long half-lives or, more typically, from the frequent, often unjustified, use of inadequate doses or the use of substandard-quality drugs, a common occurrence in countries where parasite infections are endemic. Public health interventions to correct these factors have not always been successful and would benefit from a better understanding of the drug resistance mechanisms used by parasites. These mechanisms are very diverse and have been difficult to study, but recent technological advances now provide long-awaited tools that will facilitate the task. Genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data may also be useful in the design of new chemotherapeutic agents, as they help researchers identify metabolic processes of parasites that are sufficiently distinct from those of their human hosts to allow development of effective treatments.</para>
