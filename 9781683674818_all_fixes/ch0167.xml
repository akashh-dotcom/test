      <para id="ch0167s0000p0002"><emphasis>Entamoeba histolytica</emphasis> and <emphasis>Giardia duodenalis</emphasis> infections are two of the most common protozoal infections seen worldwide and are of serious concern on a global scale due to their prevalence and the pathogenicity of these causative agents. <emphasis>Trichomonas vaginalis</emphasis> is also recognized as a very common sexually transmitted infection affecting millions of people around the world. Most of the other protozoa described in this chapter are nonpathogenic organisms. Nevertheless, detection and differentiation of nonpathogens from true pathogens in clinical specimens is useful in that their presence indicates exposure to fecal contamination, and further examination of additional specimens may reveal pathogenic protozoa. The pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms are categorized as indicated in <anchor id="ch0167s0000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0167s0000a0007">Table 1</link>; reports of disease in patients infected with organisms considered nonpathogenic are found in the literature but should be interpreted with extreme caution.</para>
      <para id="ch0167s0000p0003">Microscopic examination of stool specimens continues to be one of the main tools used in the laboratory diagnosis of intestinal amebic, flagellate, and ciliate infections. The goal of microscopy is to identify pathogenic protozoa, differentiate between these and nonpathogenic species, and properly discriminate among various artifacts that may be present. Antigen detection methods such as enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), immunochromatographic assays, and direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) assays are available for the detection of pathogens such as the<emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>/<emphasis>Entamoeba dispar</emphasis> group, <emphasis>E. histolytica, Cryptosporidium</emphasis> spp. (described in <ulink url="ch0166#ch0166s0001">chapter 143</ulink>) and <emphasis>G. duodenalis.</emphasis> Culture for the intestinal amebae is generally not feasible, readily available, or clinically relevant except in certain limited situations but is useful still in the diagnosis of <emphasis>T. vaginalis.</emphasis> Nucleic acid-based techniques have been developed, and reports in the literature for select pathogens are ever increasing. One of the most important developments related to the molecular detection of parasites is the advent of panels for detection of multiple agents of gastrointestinal disease, including combinations of bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0003">3</link>). More data are needed, particularly related to detection of intestinal parasites, to assess the performance of these systems and the potential impact they might have on outcomes; however, on the whole they appear more sensitive than conventional methods. With multiple multiplex molecular testing assays now widely available for organisms such as <emphasis>E. histolytica, G. duodenalis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> spp., their use is a viable alternative to other more conventional methods, particularly for laboratories with waning expertise in classical parasitology. Other commercial products in development or with Conformité Européenne (CE) labeling are available that can detect additional protozoa such as <emphasis>Dientamoeba fragilis, Cyclospora cayetanensis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Blastocystis.</emphasis> At least one product with CE-IVD status (Novodiag, Hologic, San Diego, CA) is designed to detect 26 stool parasites including 8 protozoa. These assays will be particularly useful to diagnose diseases such as amebiasis, where microscopy does not allow differentiation of pathogenic versus nonpathogenic <emphasis>Entamoeba</emphasis> spp. (albeit some assays may not distinguish <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> from <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> when <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> is present at very high concentrations).

The cyst is the infectious form (except for<emphasis>E. gingivalis</emphasis>, which does not produce a cyst and is likely spread by direct oral-oral contact) and is acquired by ingestion of contaminated material such as water and food or by direct fecal-oral transmission. Once the cyst reaches the intestinal tract, excystation occurs, releasing trophozoites. Encystment occurs in the colon, presumably when conditions become unfavorable for the trophozoites. Cysts are passed in the feces and remain viable in the environment for days to weeks in water and soil if protected from desiccation. Improvements in sanitary conditions are necessary to prevent infections in areas where the organisms are endemic.

      <para id="ch0167s0000p0009">For detection of amebae, laboratories predominantly receive stool specimens for examination. Both fresh and fixed specimens are useful for the diagnosis of infection, depending on the methodology employed and the circumstances of the laboratory. If fresh specimens are received for the detection of organism motility, they must be examined quickly; wet mounts for the detection of motility cannot be performed on fixed specimens. It is important to be aware that in most clinical and laboratory settings it is not feasible to examine fresh stool within the recommended time frame. The optimal solution is fixation of the specimen in a suitable fixative for stool parasites. Other sample types, such as aspirates and tissue samples, may be received and are appropriate for testing, depending on the organism suspected.

The cytoplasm of the trophozoites may contain granules and ingested material such as red blood cells (RBCs), bacteria, yeasts, and molds. It is important to note that it is very difficult to differentiate <emphasis>I. buetschlii</emphasis> trophozoites from <emphasis>E. nana</emphasis> trophozoites, although separation of these two species is not needed for patient management. This is true even on the permanent-stained smear (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0006">6</link>). The characteristics of cysts are less variable than those of trophozoites.

      <para id="ch0167s0000p0013">It is important to remember that identification may not be possible on the basis of one morphologic feature or the characteristics of a single organism in the preparation. Nuclear and cytoplasmic features can vary within species and may overlap between species, making identification a challenge. Mixed infections are not uncommon and can be missed in a cursory examination. A complete, overall assessment of the slide is necessary for correct identification. It is important to use an accurate micrometer to measure life cycle stages. Size is reliable only for the differentiation of<emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>/<emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> from <emphasis>E. hartmanni.</emphasis> Also, on permanent-stained smears, shrinkage may occur, affecting the apparent size of the organism. Results of microscopy should clearly indicate the full taxonomic name of the organisms detected along with the forms of the organisms seen (trophozoites versus cysts).

        <para id="ch0167s0000p0058">The development of axenic culture methods was a key step in confirming the existence of more than one species among organisms that had been identified as<emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> based solely on microscopic findings. Using organisms obtained by such cultures, Sargeaunt and Williams (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0007">7</link>) performed isoenzyme analysis of several glycolytic enzymes and identified electrophoretic banding patterns, or zymodemes. Two groups were identified on the basis of these patterns: pathogenic zymodemes (invasive isolates) and nonpathogenic zymodemes (noninvasive isolates). The zymodeme patterns represent stable genetic differences and do not interconvert (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0008">8</link>). Additional genetic, biochemical, and immunologic evidence has supported the existence of two distinct species. Diamond and Clark (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0009">9</link>) redescribed the two species as <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> Schaudinn 1903, which is the invasive human pathogen, and <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> Brumpt 1925, which is noninvasive and does not cause disease.</para>
        <para id="ch0167s0000p0059">Another species of<emphasis>Entamoeba, E. moshkovskii</emphasis>, has historically been considered a free-living amoeba, but is known to occasionally infect humans and other vertebrate animals. It is morphologically indistinguishable from <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>/<emphasis>E. dispar.</emphasis> The epidemiology of <emphasis>E. moshkovskii</emphasis> is not well understood. Its prevalence varies depending on the population studied, from relatively rare up to nearly 50% of the identified <emphasis>Entamoeba</emphasis> spp. found in stool (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0010">10</link>), and coinfections with <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> are not uncommon (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0011">11</link>).

        <para id="ch0167s0000p0060">Among the estimated 500 million people infected each year with<emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>, there are approximately 50 million cases of colitis and liver abscess and 100,000 deaths (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0019">19</link>). The discrepancy between the number of people infected with <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> and the morbidity and mortality rates is explained by the existence of multiple morphologically similar yet distinct species: one capable of producing disease (<emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>) and the others that are not (<emphasis>E. dispar,</emphasis> others). <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> appears to be at least 10 times more common than <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0020">20</link>).

        <para id="ch0167s0000p0061"><emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> can be found worldwide but is more prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. In areas where the organism is endemic, up to 50% of people may be infected. In temperate climates with poor sanitation, infection rates can approach those seen in tropical regions. Humans are the primary reservoir; infection occurs by ingestion of cysts from material contaminated with feces, such as water and food. Sexual transmission also occurs through oral-anal contact (e.g., analingus, fellatio post-anal sex).</para>
        <para id="ch0167s0000p0062">Asymptomatic<emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> infection is equally distributed between the sexes, while invasive amebiasis affects men predominantly. Groups with a higher incidence of amebiasis include immigrants from South and Central America and Southeast Asia (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0006">6</link>). In the United States, the prevalence of amebiasis is estimated to be approximately 4 to 5%, with residents of the southern United States and institutionalized individuals being more likely than others to be infected (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0006">6</link>). These data appear to be overestimates when compared to laboratory data from large reference labs in the United States which rarely encounter <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> by microscopy, antigen, or NAAT. In one study, short-term travelers to areas endemic for <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> were found to be at higher risk of infection with the pathogenic species, <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>, than were residents, who were more likely to harbor the nonpathogenic species, <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0022">22</link>). In homosexual males, the infection is often transmitted by sexual behavior, with up to 30% found to be infected with <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>/<emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> in some studies (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0024">24</link>).

Approximately 10% of infected individuals have clinical symptoms, presenting most commonly as watery diarrhea or bloody diarrhea. The incubation period varies from a few days to several months. Various molecules such as adhesins, amebapores, and proteases have been associated with lysis of the colonic mucosa in intestinal amebiasis (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0028">28</link>), and evidence supports the role of caspase-3-dependent apoptotic death as a major mechanism of host cell destruction (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0029">29</link>). The 260-kDa galactose- or <emphasis>N</emphasis>-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin of <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> is an important virulence factor, mediating the attachment of the ameba to the intestinal epithelium and contact-dependent cytolysis (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0030">30</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0167s0000p0065">Less frequently, patients will develop dysentery, colitis, or rarely, ameboma. Amebic dysentery is characterized by diarrhea with cramping, lower abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and the presence of blood and mucus in stool. The ulcers produced by intestinal invasion by trophozoites start as superficial localized lesions that deepen into the classic flask-shaped ulcers of amebic colitis. The ulcers are separated by segments of normal tissue but can coalesce. Amebae can be found at the advancing edges of the ulcer but usually not in the necrotic areas. Abdominal perforation and peritonitis are rare but serious complications. Rarely, a more chronic presentation-associated<emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> infection can occur that is characterized by intermittent diarrhea over a long period, weight loss, and abdominal pain which can be misdiagnosed as ulcerative colitis or irritable bowel syndrome. Ameboma is a mass of granulation tissue with peripheral fibrosis and a core of inflammation related to amebic chronic infection and is a relatively rare complication with amebic colitis. It resembles a tumor-like lesion and may be mistaken for malignancy.</para>
        <para id="ch0167s0000p0066">Extraintestinal disease occurs with the hematogenous spread of<emphasis>E. histolytica.</emphasis> It can occur with or without previous symptomatic intestinal infection. The liver is the most common site of extraintestinal disease, followed by the lungs, pericardium, brain, and other organs. Symptoms can be acute or gradual and may include low-grade fever, right-upper-quadrant pain, and weight loss. Up to 5% of individuals with intestinal symptoms develop liver abscess. However, up to 50% of individuals with liver abscess have no history of gastrointestinal disease. Cutaneous amebiasis, involving the skin and soft tissues in the perianal area, occurs usually in association with dysenteric diarrhea. It can arise by direct extension of <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> trophozoites from the colon and rectum to the perianal or genital regions. Other mechanisms of transmission include sexual transmission, direct inoculation by scratching, and following drainage from ruptured abscesses (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0032">32</link>).</para>

As mentioned previously, depending on the kit used, the group<emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>/<emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> or the individual species can be detected in the feces. Of the available kits, Abbott (formerly Alere/TechLab, Blacksburg, VA; FDA cleared) offers an <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>-specific EIA kit, <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> II, which detects the Gal- or GalNAc-binding lectin specific to the pathogenic species (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0038">38</link>).

Although some reports of the use of fixed stool have appeared (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0044">44</link>), more work is needed to identify additional antigens that withstand fixation before it would be practical to offer antigen tests in laboratories that receive only fixed stool specimens.

The BioFire FilmArray GI panel (bioMérieux, Salt Lake City, UT) is designed for testing on stool in Cary-Blair medium and detects 22 targets including the parasites <emphasis>G. duodenalis, Cryptosporidium</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Cyclospora cayetanensis.</emphasis> The platform is a sample-to-answer technology utilizing a nested real-time PCR (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0001">1</link>). The BD MAX enteric parasite panel (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) uses unpreserved or preserved stool samples in Cary-Blair medium. The assay uses automated extraction and multiplex real-time PCR for detection of <emphasis>G. duodenalis, Cryptosporidium</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0055">55</link>). The initial reports for all of these tests demonstrate their utility, but the numbers of parasite detections, particularly for <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>, are low. One critical publication including the FilmArray GI panel demonstrated the utility of panels to detect parasitic pathogens (<emphasis>C. cayetanensis</emphasis>) that are not initially suspected by the care provider (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0056">56</link>), demonstrating the advantage of the syndromic testing approach. More data are required to completely establish the role that multiplex molecular syndromic testing will have on the laboratory detection of gastrointestinal parasites.</para>
        <para id="ch0167s0000p0072">PCR on stool specimens using laboratory-developed assays has proven to be more sensitive and specific than microscopy and at least as sensitive as antigen detection, depending on the study (<link linkend="ch0167s0000a0057">Table 3</link>) (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0042">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0057">57</link>). For routine use in clinical laboratories, a PCR method would ideally involve a relatively simple sample preparation procedure and allow the use of fixed stool. Different extraction techniques, some of which are relatively simple, and the use of fresh and fixed material have been reported (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0058">58</link>–<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0060">60</link>). Stool can present challenges due to the presence of PCR inhibitors (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0061">61</link>), so the inclusion of an amplification control is required. Many commercial assays in <link linkend="ch0167s0000a0075">Table 4</link> require separate extraction and amplification steps; however, many are also “sample-to-answer” with little hands-on time required.</para>

        <para id="ch0167s0000p0073">Serologic testing is a valuable aid, in conjunction with antigen detection or PCR, for the diagnosis of symptomatic, invasive disease. Multiple serologic methods have been used, including indirect hemagglutination, complement fixation, latex agglutination, and EIA (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0035">35</link>). These methods are most useful in populations where <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> is not endemic. Of patients with biopsy-proven intestinal amebiasis, 85% have serum antibodies. For patients with extraintestinal disease, serologic tests have a sensitivity approaching 99%. For asymptomatic intestinal diseases, serology is generally not useful unless the patient has invasive infection. People infected with <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> do not produce detectable antibodies. After cure of invasive amebiasis, serum antibodies may persist for up to 10 years; this can complicate diagnosis in areas where infection is endemic (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0062">62</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0167s0000p0074">EIAs for the detection of IgM and IgG are widely used, and most are based on the detection of antilectin antibodies, which appear over 1 week after symptoms of<emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> infection (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0035">35</link>). Indirect hemagglutination is useful and highly specific but may lack sensitivity compared to EIAs (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0035">35</link>). Several investigators have reported the utility of IgA antibody testing and a link to partial immunity in individuals with detectable antilectin IgA (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0063">63</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0064">64</link>). There are several commercially available serologic kits for diagnosis of amebiasis, some of which are available in the United States. For a review of serologic testing, see the article by Fotedar et al. (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0020">20</link>) and also refer to <ulink url="ch0024#ch0024s0001">chapter 9</ulink> in this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>.</para>

Humans are infected by ingestion of the cyst form, with excystation occurring in the large intestine to release the granular form which is a precursor to the vacuolar form. It has also been proposed that there is an amoeboid form that occurs in the lumen of the host’s intestines and may play a role in its pathogenicity; however, it is unclear whether these “amoeboid” forms represent a distinct morphotype or are simply aberrant vacuolar forms (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0071">71</link>).

Both thin- and thick-walled vacuolar forms been observed in stool specimens.

Molecular approaches to organism detection are more sensitive but are only recently available to routine clinical labs (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0085">85</link>). Several multiplex syndromic panels (<link linkend="ch0167s0000a0075">Table 4</link>) include <emphasis>Blastocystis</emphasis> as a target (CE-IVD labeled only, to date). Detection of this target in a syndromic panel may prove problematic with its poorly defined pathogenic potential and possible specific subtype-level associations with disease.</para>

Trophozoites attach to the epithelium via a sucking disk located on the ventral side of the parasite. During the course of infection, the parasites remain attached to the epithelium and do not invade the mucosa. In the intestine, trophozoites divide by binary fission to produce two identical daughter trophozoites.

After an incubation period of approximately 12 to 20 days, patients can experience nausea, chills, low-grade fever, epigastric pain, and a sudden onset of watery diarrhea. Diarrhea is often explosive and presents as foul smelling without the presence of blood, cellular exudate, or mucus. Individuals can develop subacute or chronic infections with symptoms such as recurrent diarrhea, abdominal discomfort and distention, belching, and heartburn. In patients with chronic cases of giardiasis, diarrhea can lead to dehydration, malabsorption, and impairment of pancreatic function (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0105">105</link>).

The infection is primarily a sexually transmitted infection. Historically, transmission was believed to occur from the passing of the trophozoite stage during sexual contact. Recently, cyst-like structures were described for <emphasis>T. vaginalis.</emphasis> Formation of these structures appears to be initiated by stressors in the environment, such as a drop in vaginal pH. These cyst-like structures appear to be resistant outside the host and have been demonstrated to excyst in cell culture. The cyst-like structures have also been found in vaginal specimens and are able to revert to trophozoites in cell culture. Additional studies are needed to determine the role of these structures in the natural transmission of <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0161">161</link>). <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with estimated infections reaching 2.1 million a year, and is thought to be the most common curable sexually transmitted infection among sexually active young women. In the United States, women make up the majority of infections, particularly non-Hispanic Black women (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0162">162</link>).

It is hypothesized that hormones in women may play a large role in terms of infection and persistence of <emphasis>Trichomonas</emphasis> infections. The incidence of trichomoniasis differs depending on the population examined, varying from 5 to 60% in various studies. Factors such as lower socioeconomic status, multiple sex partners, and poor personal hygiene are linked to a higher incidence of infection. The prevalence of trichomoniasis appears to be higher in women of childbearing age and increases after age 40, as shown by several studies (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0165">165</link>–<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0167">167</link>). This is in contrast to the prevalence of other common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as <emphasis>Chlamydia</emphasis>, where prevalence is typically higher in younger women. One study screened male patients to assess the prevalence in that population. The percentage prevalence was approximately 6.6%, though the prevalence was higher in males who were an average age of 39.9 years old (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0165">165</link>).

The onset of symptoms, such as intense vaginal and vulvar pruritus and discharge, is often sudden and occurs during or after menstruation. The vaginal pH is usually elevated above the normal pH of 4.5, and dysuria occurs in 20% of women with <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> infection.

Up to 50% of infected women are asymptomatic carriers. In men, the most common symptomatic presentation is urethritis, though it is estimated that the majority of infections are asymptomatic.

          <para id="ch0167s0000p0217">The diagnosis of<emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> infection is commonly based on the examination of wet preparations of vaginal and urethral discharges, prostatic secretions, and urine sediments; however, this method is extremely insensitive and has been largely supplanted by NAAT tests. Permanent stains such as Papanicolaou and Giemsa stains can be used, but the organisms may be difficult to recognize (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0186">186</link>). For wet preparations, vaginal specimens are routinely collected during a speculum examination, but studies suggest that self-collected or tampon-collected specimens may be used successfully (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0187">187</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0188">188</link>). Specimens should be mixed with a drop of physiologic saline and examined microscopically within 1 h under low power (magnification, ×100) with reduced illumination. Specimens should never be refrigerated. The presence of actively motile organisms with jerky motility is diagnostic. The movement of the undulating membrane may be seen as the motility of the trophozoite diminishes. Polymorphonuclear cells are often present. The sensitivity of the wet preparation test with vaginal specimens is between 50 and 70%, depending on the skill of the microscopist and other factors. The sensitivity of microscopy in males is low, and additional testing, such as culture of urethral swab, urine, and semen, is required for optimal sensitivity. Perhaps the most important factor affecting the sensitivity of wet mount testing is the time between collection and examination of the specimen. Viability of the organism is essential for the detection of motility on the wet mount and drops off precipitously with time. Amies transport medium can maintain the viability for culture of <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> on swabs held at room temperature for 24 ± 6 h before inoculation of the specimen into a culture pouch (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0189">189</link>). Because the morphology of <emphasis>P. hominis</emphasis>, a nonpathogenic intestinal flagellate, is very similar to that of <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis>, care must be taken to ensure that specimens are not contaminated with fecal material.</para>

The choice of methodology depends on many factors, such as whether a point-of-care test is necessary for instances when the patient might not come back to the physician’s office (STD clinic), or other clinical settings where follow-up is not an issue and where a molecular test may be more suitable. The Affirm VPIII assay (Becton Dickinson and Co., Sparks, MD) is a direct DNA probe test (nonamplified) for the detection of organisms from vaginal swabs associated with vaginosis/vaginitis (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0203">203</link>–<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0205">205</link>).

According to the manufacturer’s package insert, the assay has a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 98%, respectively, compared with wet mount and culture for <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> (package insert, Affirm VPIII, version no. 670160JAAG; Becton Dickinson). In a clinical evaluation of vaginal swab specimens from both symptomatic and asymptomatic females, the Affirm assay detected more <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis>-positive samples than wet mount testing, although the difference was not statistically significant (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0206">206</link>). It is important to note that the Affirm VPIII assay (Becton Dickinson) is less sensitive than molecular testing (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0166">166</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0205">205</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0207">207</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0208">208</link>).

Most of these assays are CE marked as well. The Cepheid Xpert TV assay is a PCR-based assay that detects <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> by using PCR on the GeneXpert system. The total assay time is approximately 40 min. The Quidel Solana <emphasis>Trichomonas</emphasis> assay (performed on the Solana instrument) is a rapid point-of-care test approved for vaginal and urine specimens (symptomatic and asymptomatic patients), with results in less than 40 min. The assay uses helicase-dependent amplification and fluorescent-based probe detection (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0224">224</link>). The Hologic ATV assay (Hologic, San Diego, CA) can be performed on both the automated Panther and Tigris instruments, and studies have shown the performance of the assay to be superior to other standard methodologies (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0166">166</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0167">167</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0220">220</link>). The ATV assay detects rRNA by transcription-mediated amplification and is approved for testing of a wide variety of specimens such as clinician-collected vaginal specimens, endocervical swabs, ThinPrep liquid-based cytology samples, and urine samples (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0220">220</link>). In addition to testing on adults, molecular testing is being used for the detection of <emphasis>Trichomonas</emphasis> in specimens collected from children (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0225">225</link>).

Detection employs six pairs of dual priming oligonucleotide primers targeted to unique genes of the specific pathogen. It is not clear if this assay will be FDA approved in the United States. Similar to the Affirm VPIII, Becton Dickinson manufactures another vaginal panel on the BD MAX. The BD MAX vaginal panel is a qualitative PCR assay using fluorogenic target-specific hybridization probes that amplify specific DNA targets such as organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and other organisms such as certain <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>T. vaginalis.</emphasis> Specimen collection is achieved via the BD MAX UVE, which is part of the assay system. Gaydos et al. reported that the BD MAX vaginal panel had a sensitivity of ~93.1% and specificity of 99.3% for <emphasis>Trichomonas.</emphasis> Sensitivity and specificity were similar whether the specimen was collected by the physician or self-collected by the patient.

The cobas assay is a real-time PCR assay intended for use on the 6800/8800 systems. All specimens should be collected in Roche PCR Media for both male and female sources, while PreservCyt can also be used for cervical specimens. Early studies have shown excellent performance with sensitivity for female specimens ranging from 94% (PreservCyt) to 99% (vaginal).

Members of the phylum Ciliophora are protozoa that possess cilia in at least one stage of their life cycles. The species has a complicated taxonomic history. It was described in 1857 as a member of the genus <emphasis>Paramecium</emphasis> and was transferred to <emphasis>Balantidium</emphasis> in 1863. In 1931, the genus <emphasis>Balantioides</emphasis> was described to accommodate <emphasis>B. coli</emphasis>, but unfortunately that name went unnoticed for decades in the medical literature. In 2013 the genus <emphasis>Neobalantidium</emphasis> was described to accommodate <emphasis>B. coli</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0238">238</link>). In 2014, attention was brought to the original description of <emphasis>Balantioides</emphasis>, and in 2018 <emphasis>Neobalantidium coli</emphasis> was transferred back to <emphasis>Balantioides</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0239">239</link>).

        <para id="ch0167s0000p0232">This organism has both trophozoite and cyst forms as part of its life cycle (<anchor id="ch0167s0000a0178"/><link linkend="ch0167s0000a0180">Table 6</link>; <anchor id="ch0167s0000a0179"/><link linkend="ch0167s0000a0183">Fig. 12</link>). The cyst form is the infective stage. After ingestion of the cysts and excystation, trophozoites secrete hyaluronidase, which aids in the invasion of host tissue. The trophozoite, which is oval and covered with cilia, is easily seen in wet mount preparations under low-power magnification. The cytoplasm contains both a macronucleus and a micronucleus, in addition to two contractile vacuoles. Motile trophozoites can be observed in fresh wet preparations, but the specimen must be observed soon after collection. The trophozoite is somewhat pear shaped and also contains vacuoles that may harbor debris such as cell fragments and ingested bacteria. Cyst formation takes place as the trophozoite moves down the large intestine.</para>

        <para id="ch0167s0000p0244">Infection with<emphasis>B. coli</emphasis> is usually asymptomatic; however, symptomatic infection can occur, resulting in bouts of dysentery similar to amebiasis (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0244">244</link>). Infection with <emphasis>B. coli</emphasis> can be described in three ways: (i) asymptomatic colonized host; (ii) chronic infection, nonbloody diarrhea, including other symptoms such as cramping and abdominal pain; and (iii) fulminating disease consisting of mucoid and bloody stools (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0240">240</link>). In addition, colitis caused by <emphasis>B. coli</emphasis> is often indistinguishable from that caused by <emphasis>E. histolytica.</emphasis> Symptoms typically include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and anorexia. Fluid loss can be dramatic, as seen in some patients with cryptosporidiosis. The organism can invade the submucosa of the large bowel, and ulcerative abscesses and hemorrhagic lesions can occur. The shallow ulcers and submucosal lesions that result from invasion are prone to secondary infection by bacteria and can be problematic for the patient (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0245">245</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0246">246</link>). Death due to invasive <emphasis>B. coli</emphasis> infection has been reported (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0245">245</link>). Infections associated with extraintestinal sites have been described (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0245">245</link>–<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0247">247</link>). There have been several reports of <emphasis>B. coli</emphasis> spreading from the intestine to the lung. Most of these cases have occurred in patients who are either elderly or immunocompromised. The disease presents as a pneumonia-like illness. In these documented cases, <emphasis>B. coli</emphasis> has been recovered from specimens such as bronchial secretions and bronchial lavage specimens. It is hypothesized that extraintestinal colonization can occur between the lymphatic or circulatory system, perforation through the colon, or through aspiration of fluid from the oral cavity (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0240">240</link>). One case describes an individual with vertebral osteomyelitis and myelopathy, which is the first documented case of infection in the bone (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0248">248</link>). <emphasis>B. coli</emphasis> is very rare in the urinary tract but was documented in an elderly man with chronic kidney disease and in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0249">249</link>, <link linkend="ch0167s0000li0250">250</link>). The first liver abscess was reported in a patient in India (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0251">251</link>). Albeit rare, there have been documented cases of polymicrobial keratitis with <emphasis>B. coli</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0252">252</link>). One must consider that some reports of extraintestinal <emphasis>B. coli</emphasis> might actually represent ciliocytophthoria, and epithelial cells were misidentified as trophozoites of the parasite (<link linkend="ch0167s0000li0253">253</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0167s0000p0249">Clinical laboratories are now given more choices for testing in diagnostic parasitology, with assays including microscopy, culture, antigen detection, and nucleic acid amplification techniques for detection of the intestinal and urogenital amebae, flagellates, and ciliates. Molecular biology has the promise to deliver more sensitive and specific methods, with the availability of an FDA-cleared assay for detection of<emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> from genital specimens and multiplex assays for <emphasis>E. histolytica, G. duodenalis, Cryptosporidium</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Cyclospora cayetanensis, D. fragilis</emphasis>, and/or <emphasis>Blastocystis</emphasis> spp. detection from stool. As more multiplex assays become available for diagnosis of syndromes such as infectious gastroenteritis, their utility and impact on patient outcomes will become clearer, in addition to broadening the panel of target parasites. In addition to these amplification tests, rapid point-of-care tests are available for organisms such as <emphasis>T. vaginalis.</emphasis> Results can now be available in real time for the clinician to manage patients directly in the exam setting. While these new test modalities are exciting, clinical laboratories are still faced with using microscopy for routine workup for stool specimens, due to the lack of commercially available testing for all the relevant organisms. Some laboratories have switched to antigen-based methods, but many still rely on microscopy because antigen-based methods cannot detect all potential pathogens in a given stool specimen. Microscopy, as we know, cannot differentiate between pathogenic and nonpathogenic <emphasis>Entamoeba</emphasis> spp. and the different genotypes of <emphasis>Giardia.</emphasis> The diagnostic landscape continues to change, with an increase in the options available to the clinical parasitology laboratory for the diagnosis of intestinal and urogenital parasitic infections.</para>
