      <para id="ch0124s0002p0001">Human herpesvirus (HHV) 6A, HHV-6B, and HHV-7 are three distinct virus species that make up the<emphasis>Roseolovirus</emphasis> genus (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0001">1</link>). Although HHV-6A and HHV-6B were originally considered subtypes of the same viral species, they were officially classified as distinct viral species in 2012 (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0002">2</link>). Together with cytomegalovirus (CMV), which is discussed in a separate chapter in this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>, the roseoloviruses represent the four human viruses of the <emphasis>Betaherpesvirus</emphasis> subfamily. Roseoloviruses share many features of their genomic architecture and genetic content, the ability to replicate and establish latent infections in lymphocytes, associations with febrile rash in young children and with a variety of neurologic disorders, and the ability to act as opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients. HHV-6A and HHV-6B have the ability to genetically recombine with each other in the laboratory (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0003">3</link>). For convenience, we sometimes refer to HHV-6A and HHV-6B collectively as HHV-6 when there are no discriminating data.</para>

      <para id="ch0124s0003p0001">HHV-6 virions are about 200 nm in diameter and consist of four major components: a double-stranded DNA genome (160 to 170 kb) within the core of an icosahedral capsid surrounded by a proteinaceous tegument, all of which is surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope containing a variety of viral and cellular proteins. The viral genomes carry approximately 100 unique genes. HHV-6A and HHV-6B share approximately 95% nucleotide identity with each other, which is by far the highest similarity of any two species of human herpesvirus. By comparison, HHV-6A and B share approximately 60% nucleotide identity in alignable regions with HHV-7 and are essentially unalignable in nucleotide space with CMV (&lt;45% nucleotide identity in housekeeping genes).</para>
      <para id="ch0124s0003p0002">Actively replicating HHV-6B strains cluster by geographical origin and are highly similar to each other, with an average pairwise nucleotide identity of &gt;99.9% (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0004">4</link>). Comparatively few genome sequences from acute infections of HHV-6A are available, although the pairwise sequencing identity among HHV-6A strains suggests conservation similar to that seen in HHV-6B.</para>

        <para id="ch0124s0004s0001p0001">The seroprevalence of HHV-6A and HHV-6B together is high (&gt;90%) (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0005">5</link>), but as discussed later, extensive cross-reactivity has hindered large-scale assessment of the specific seroprevalence of each virus. Transmission is thought to occur mainly via saliva (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0006">6</link>). Most individuals become infected by the age of 2 or 3 years (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0007">7</link>). In the United States, Japan, and Europe, HHV-6B is typically acquired in early childhood and infects nearly all individuals, and HHV-6A prevalence in these areas may exceed 50% by adulthood. In Zambia, HHV-6A was reported in &gt;85% of asymptomatic infants, suggesting possible international differences in the epidemiology of the HHV-6 variants (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0008">8</link>). However, in Uganda, over 90% of newly acquired HHV-6 infections in infants were HHV-6B (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0009">9</link>). Further studies will be required to develop a full understanding of regional differences.</para>

        <para id="ch0124s0004s0002p0001">The cell surface receptor for HHV-6A is CD46, while the receptor for HHV-6B is CD134 (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0010">10</link>). As such, the tissue distribution of the two viruses appears to be distinct, although the differential detection of the two viruses is confounded by their differing prevalence. HHV-6B DNA has been detected in as many as 90% of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) specimens, &gt;80% of brains, &gt;90% of tonsils (in epithelial cells of tonsillar crypts), and 40 to 90% of oral fluid and nasal mucus specimens; it has been detected less frequently in skin, lungs, endomyocardial biopsy specimens, goblet cells and histiocytes of the large intestine, cervical fluids, and ocular aqueous humor. HHV-6B is commonly detected in the gastrointestinal tract of transplant patients (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0011">11</link>). The receptor tropism may be associated with delayed T-cell reconstitution in transplant patients with reactivated HHV-6 (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0012">12</link>). During primary infection in young children in the United States, HHV-6A was found by PCR in 2.5% of PBMC and 17% of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens, while HHV-6B was found in 99% of PBMC and 86% of CSF specimens (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0013">13</link>). The median salivary viral level of HHV-6B increases from approximately 10<superscript>3</superscript> copies of HHV-6/ml at 1 week postinfection to 10<superscript>5</superscript> copies of HHV-6/ml by 8 weeks postinfection (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0007">7</link>). Shedding may persist at substantial levels into adulthood (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0015">15</link>). HHV-6A DNA was reported to be present in over half of lung specimens, mostly in conjunction with HHV-6B (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0016">16</link>). In a study of adult brains from 40 consecutive autopsies, 28% were positive for HHV-6A and 75% for HHV-6B (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0017">17</link>). For bone marrow transplant recipients, HHV-6A and HHV-6B have both been detected in plasma, but HHV-6B was the species overwhelmingly detected in PBMC (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0019">19</link>). Interpreting HHV-6 detection by PCR in clinical specimens is complicated by both the ubiquity of subclinical reactivation and inherited chromosomally integrated forms (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0020">20</link>–<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0023">23</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0124s0004s0003p0001">Other than during the acute phase of roseola, HHV-6 can seldom be detected by culture. However, HHV-6 DNA can be detected in PBMC from 90% of children by PCR, and transcripts can occasionally be detected in asymptomatic children (~1% of specimens) (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0024">24</link>). This suggests that latent infection is established in PBMC. Latent HHV-6B has been detected in monocytes, PBMC-derived dendritic cells, and their CD34<superscript>+</superscript> bone marrow progenitors (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0025">25</link>). Unlike other human herpesviruses, HHV-6A and -6B appear to establish latency via integration into subtelomeric regions of host cells, rather than as episomes (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0026">26</link>). The cell tropism of HHV-6A latency is less well understood, although latency has been established in oligodendrocytes <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0027">27</link>). Both HHV-6B and HHV-7 are detected in high proportions of salivary glands, suggesting that this is a critical reservoir of persistent infection and shedding (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0029">29</link>). Primary infection with HHV-6 typically occurs with the waning of maternal antibody, with transmission likely occurring via saliva (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0006">6</link>). HHV-6 was not detected in breast milk, suggesting that this is not a significant vehicle for transmission (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0030">30</link>). Little is known of HHV-6A transmission.</para>
        <para id="ch0124s0004s0003p0002">Unique among the human herpesviruses, approximately 1% of the population harbors inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (iciHHV-6) genomes at a chromosomal telomere. This occurs via vertical transmission through the germ line, and as such, all cells in these individuals harbor viral DNA (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0031">31</link>). iciHHV-6 can result in persistence of high levels of HHV-6 DNA in CSF and blood, which is most commonly observed in posttransplant patients (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0032">32</link>). It is still unclear how frequently iciHHV-6 reactivates, although recent reports suggest it is possible (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0034">34</link>) and may explain some cases of congenital infection (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0036">36</link>). iciHHV-6 may express select RNA transcripts in the absence of reactivation (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0037">37</link>). While some iciHHV-6B strains genomically cluster with acute HHV-6B strains, many unrelated iciHHV-6 cases share identical iciHHV-6 sequences, suggesting a founder effect in inheritance of HHV-6 (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0039">39</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0124s0005s0001p0001">HHV-6 primary infection causes roseola (also called roseola infantum, sixth disease, and exanthem subitum) and accounts for 10 to 20% of febrile illness presenting to the emergency department in the 6- to 12-month-old population (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0040">40</link>). While HHV-6B is the predominant etiologic agent of roseola, rare cases of HHV-6A-associated roseola or febrile illness have been reported. About 94% of children are symptomatic at the time of primary infection, with specifically associated symptoms including fever (58%), fussiness (70%), rhinorrhea (66%), diarrhea (26%), rash (31%), and roseola (24%) (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0007">7</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0124s0005s0001p0002">Classic roseola symptoms include an abrupt rise in temperature (39 to 40°C), which persists for 3 to 5 days. Fever abatement coincides with onset of a blanching maculopapular rash (<anchor id="ch0124s0005s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0124s0005s0001a0006">Fig. 1</link>), which resolves within 3 days. Initial appearance of the rash is on the neck, behind the ears, and on the back, followed by spread to the rest of the body. The illness lasts 2 to 7 days, usually with no sequelae. Other clinical symptoms of roseola may include lymphadenopathy, erythematous tympanic membranes, and uvulopalatoglossal junctional papules (Nagayama spots) prior to rash onset.</para>
        <para id="ch0124s0005s0001p0003">Primary HHV-6 infection may also present as fever without rash or rash without fever, because three-quarters of cases do not meet clinical definitions of roseola. Less common but more severe forms of primary HHV-6 infection may include fever of &gt;40°C, respiratory tract distress, diarrhea, and convulsions. Although seizures are rare for HHV-6 primary infections, primary HHV-6 infections account for a significant portion of febrile seizures in young children (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0042">42</link>). Recent studies have also suggested a relationship between HHV-6, febrile seizures, and the subsequent development of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0043">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0044">44</link>). Other serious but rare complications reported with HHV-6 primary infections include hepatosplenomegaly, Gianatti syndrome (an acrodermatitis of childhood that has been associated with hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus infections), bulging fontanels, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis (perhaps 1% of meningitis and encephalitis cases) (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0041">41</link>), poor neurologic outcomes following congenital infection, and disseminated fatal infection.</para>

        <para id="ch0124s0005s0002p0001">HHV-6 reactivation generally occurs in the context of immune suppression. For example, HHV-6 can reactivate in AIDS patients and lead to disseminated infection (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0045">45</link>). The most common clinical setting for HHV-6 reactivation is transplantation, though routine surveillance is not recommended due to lack of actionable viral load thresholds and poor therapeutic efficacy (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0046">46</link>). Most cases are due to HHV-6B; less than 3% are thought to result from HHV-6A. In contrast, HHV-6B can be detected in plasma or serum in 30 to 50% of transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0047">47</link>–<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0049">49</link>). Reactivation typically occurs within the first 2 to 4 weeks posttransplant; the median time to HHV-6 reactivation was reported to be 20 days for HHV-6, compared to 27 days for HHV-7 and 36 days for CMV (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0005">5</link>). HHV-6 reactivation is associated with the receipt of fewer CD4<superscript>+</superscript> HHV-6-specific donor T cells (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0051">51</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0124s0005s0002p0002">Multiple disease manifestations have been associated with HHV-6 reactivation in transplant recipients. Of these, encephalitis is the best documented. HHV-6-associated encephalitis occurs in approximately 1% of hematopoietic cell transplants and can lead to damage of the limbic system, brain stem, and hippocampus, manifesting in seizures, cognitive problems, and abnormal electroencephalogram. The frequency of HHV-6 encephalitis varies by transplant type; it reaches approximately 10% in cord blood transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0049">49</link>), while it appears to be much less frequent in solid organ transplantation (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0048">48</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0052">52</link>). Interestingly, levels of HHV-6 DNA found in CSF during reactivation tend to be higher than during primary disease (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0053">53</link>). HHV-6 also appears to have effects on the central nervous system that are subtler than frank encephalitis, including delirium and cognitive decline after hematopoietic cell transplantation (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0054">54</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0124s0005s0002p0003">HHV-6 reactivation after transplant has also been associated with other clinical manifestations. Myelosuppression and delayed engraftment have been reported (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0055">55</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0056">56</link>). Several studies have also associated HHV-6 with the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0055">55</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0058">58</link>). Interestingly, one study suggests that either HHV-6 reactivation or acute graft-versus-host disease predisposes to the subsequent development of the other (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0059">59</link>); future studies should clarify the mechanisms and causality of this relationship. HHV-6 may contribute to allograft dysfunction and rejection; in one study of liver transplantation, some patients with graft hepatitis responded favorably to antiviral therapy (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0060">60</link>). Beyond allografts, HHV-6 has also been reported to affect organs in the context of hematopoietic cell transplantation, including liver (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0061">61</link>) and lung (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0062">62</link>). Detection of HHV-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage has been associated with idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, and reductions in HHV-6 levels and mortality have been associated with antiviral therapy (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0062">62</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0063">63</link>). Finally, HHV-6 has been associated with an increased risk of CMV reactivation, both in hematopoietic (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0064">64</link>) and solid organ transplants (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0066">66</link>). Coreactivation of HHV-6 and CMV is associated with a worse outcome in intensive care unit patients than either virus alone (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0067">67</link>). Similarly, several studies have demonstrated that HHV-6 reactivation is a predictor of increased mortality after hematopoietic cell transplantation (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0055">55</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0068">68</link>). Whether these relationships indicate a causal relationship or instead merely reflect the underlying immunosuppression remains to be established. Despite these associations, a randomized clinical trial of patients after liver transplant demonstrated no clinical benefit from routine monitoring for HHV-6 (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0069">69</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0124s0005s0002p0004">iciHHV-6 may affect clinical outcomes in immunocompromised patients, but further study is required (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0070">70</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0071">71</link>). Acute graft-versus-host disease grades 2 to 4 have been shown to be more frequent when recipients or donors had iciHHV-6. CMV viremia is also more frequent among recipients with iciHHV-6 (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0072">72</link>).</para>

Nevertheless, it is considered prudent to use antiviral therapy in the setting of HHV-6 reactivation in immunocompromised individuals (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0092">92</link>). It is important to distinguish iciHHV-6 from HHV-6 reactivation when considering antiviral therapy for patients with detectable HHV-6, and clinical symptoms should weigh heavily in treatment decisions (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0031">31</link>). Indeed, testing for iciHHV-6 is often used to justify stopping antiviral therapy in the setting of a positive HHV-6 PCR without clear symptoms. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that HHV-6 reactivation and disease can occur in the setting of iciHHV-6, and thus the presence of iciHHV-6 is by itself not enough to justify halting treatment if symptoms are compatible with HHV-6 disease.</para>

The most common method of detection by far is PCR. The sensitivity of PCR is of particular value for the detection of HHV-6, given that even during periods of viral activity, viral DNA can be at relatively low concentrations. A multitude of PCR strategies have been published that utilize numerous HHV-6 genomic targets and, in some instances, inclusion in multiplex assays (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0099">99</link>–<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0101">101</link>). HHV-6A and HHV-6B can readily be distinguished by appropriate choice of PCR primers and probes. Reverse transcription PCR for detection of HHV-6 mRNA can be useful for specific detection of active HHV-6 replication and may be useful to discriminate between latent virus and reactivation (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0102">102</link>), which may be particularly relevant in the setting of iciHHV-6.</para>
      <para id="ch0124s0007p0002">Quantitative PCR from whole blood or plasma is useful for the determination of baseline viral load levels in transplant patients, with significant increases above baseline indicating active infection and increased risk of clinical disease. Testing can be performed on plasma, serum, whole blood, or PBMC, and it is critical that same specimen type must be used for baseline and monitoring. We recommend the use of plasma for HHV-6 PCR. Detection of HHV-6 DNA in serum or plasma appears to correlate well with indicators of active replication (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0103">103</link>); in contrast, higher levels of HHV-6 in other sample types can result from the presence of latently infected cells or DNA released from them (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0104">104</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0105">105</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0124s0007p0003">As is the case for all quantitative real-time PCR assays, testing for HHV-6 should incorporate a coamplified internal positive control, and ideally the two HHV-6 species should be distinguished. Important variables that need to be carefully standardized and incorporated into the sensitivity calculation and interpretation are the amount of material initially lysed to prepare the template (e.g., volume of fluid or number of cells) and the amount of this material that is included in each reaction mixture (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0106">106</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0107">107</link>).</para>

Thorough evaluations of HHV-6 PCR assays are essential (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0100">100</link>), as are ongoing comparisons and proficiency testing to improve the standardization of quantitative assays (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0108">108</link>).

To address this, the World Health Organization has recently made a provisional international standard available for HHV-6, which consists of cultured Z29 type strain for HHV-6B and the GS type strain for HHV-6A. Both of these standards have been noted to have large tandem repeats in the origin of replication and the potential for large genomic rearrangements, similar to that seen in the JC and BK polyomaviruses (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0110">110</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0111">111</link>), and for this reason, diagnostic PCR assays should avoid these regions. HHV-6 has recently been included in an FDA-cleared multiplex PCR panel for meningitis/encephalitis, and it is likely that HHV-6 detection in the context of encephalitis will increase as more laboratories perform HHV-6 testing (<anchor id="ch0124s0007a0004"/><link linkend="ch0124s0010a0004">Table 2</link>) (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0112">112</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0124s0007p0005">Digital PCR quantitation is especially attractive for HHV-6, given the ability to accurately count copies of human and viral DNA. In digital PCR, a sample is divided into thousands of individual partitions, each of which undergoes PCR amplification to the endpoint. The proportion of partitions with positive amplification allows calculation of the starting concentration of analyte. Digital PCR is substantially more accurate and precise than traditional quantitative PCR (qPCR). The accuracy of digital PCR may also provide a solution to the poor commutability of quantitative testing discussed above.</para>

In many cases, differentiation of HHV-6A and HHV-6B is not essential for patient management, but assays that discriminate between HHV-6A and HHV-6B may be useful in the setting of coinfection or the presence of iciHHV-6 (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0117">117</link>) and may lead to a better understanding of the clinical manifestations of these viruses. Typing systems have typically been based on primer binding regions that are highly conserved between HHV-6A and HHV-6B, with an intervening region that can be targeted by probes specific for one or the other virus. However, the recent expansion of whole HHV-6 genomes available in GenBank allows other approaches to PCR assay design as well.</para>

      <para id="ch0124s0011p0001">Numerous serologic methods for detecting HHV-6 antibodies have been described, and commercial reagents are available. These serologic methods have limited utility for diagnosis of primary infections, are unable to reliably identify HHV-6 reactivations, and are rarely indicated clinically. Recent versus past infections have been discriminated through the use of immunofluorescence-based antibody avidity tests, though these are not available clinically (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0118">118</link>). Maturation from low- to high-avidity HHV-6 antibody following primary HHV-6 infection takes approximately 5 months. Antibody avidity testing can also be used to differentiate between HHV-6 and HHV-7 primary infections. Neutralizing antibodies typically become detectable 3 to 8 days following the onset of fever during primary infection.</para>
      <para id="ch0124s0011p0002">Due to their protein sequence homology, there is extensive serologic cross-reactivity between HHV-6A and HHV-6B and also substantial cross-reactivity with HHV-7 and CMV (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0118">118</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0119">119</link>). The simultaneous rise in antibodies to both HHV-6 and human CMV seen in some patients may be due to the combination of simultaneous activity of both viruses together with responses to cross-reactive antigens. One assay has been reported to distinguish between antibodies to HHV-6A and HHV-6B (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0102">102</link>), but this assay has not found widespread use. Despite some serologic cross-reactivity between HHV-6 and HHV-7, adsorption methods and antibody avidity tests can be used for differentiation, though they are not routinely available clinically (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0118">118</link>).</para>

Similar to human CMV, mutations in the HHV-6 U69-encoded protein kinase or the HHV-6 U38-encoded DNA polymerase gene can cause HHV-6 resistance to these drugs (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0120">120</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0121">121</link>).

      <para id="ch0124s0013p0001">The diagnosis of HHV-6 infection is complicated by the varying clinical manifestations, the ability of the virus to establish and later reactivate from latency, and the entity of iciHHV-6. Thus, the testing ordered and the interpretation of results should rely heavily on the clinical presentation.</para>
      <para id="ch0124s0013p0002">The most common presentation of HHV-6 is primary infection in young children. As described previously in this chapter, such presentation is usually quite typical; while the rash of exanthem subitum (roseola) can be visually dramatic, systemic symptoms and fever are comparatively mild. While primary infection with roseoloviruses leads to significant health care utilization (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0007">7</link>), in uncomplicated cases clinical diagnosis without confirmatory lab testing may suffice. On the other hand, testing in such circumstances may be justified if it is likely to provide other benefits such as preventing unnecessary hospitalization or excessive use of antibiotics. As a more severe presentation, roseoloviruses account for approximately one-third of cases of febrile status epilepticus (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0042">42</link>), and inclusion of HHV-6 in the differential diagnosis is warranted, along with PCR testing of CSF and plasma.</para>
      <para id="ch0124s0013p0003">The most usual setting for HHV-6 testing is in the context of immunosuppression, especially hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplantation. Again, HHV-6 can present with a variety of end-organ complications, but the most common is central nervous system alteration. The mainstay of laboratory diagnosis is PCR testing. While there are currently no FDA-cleared quantitative assays available for HHV-6, a wide variety of validated HHV-6 DNA load assays are available from reference and other laboratories (<link linkend="ch0124s0008a0004">Tables 1</link> and <link linkend="ch0124s0010a0004">2</link>). It is important to recognize that interlaboratory agreement for quantitative HHV-6 PCR testing is poor; thus, there are no widely accepted quantitative thresholds for therapy, and clinicians should avoid comparing viral load measurements from different laboratories. This situation may improve with the recent introduction of a WHO international standard, although previous experience with the CMV international standard suggests that this will not completely solve the issue of interlaboratory commutability (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0124">124</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0124s0013p0004">For most clinical presentations, we recommend PCR testing on plasma or serum, along with another specimen based on the clinical symptoms present (CSF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or tissue). Most laboratories interpret the detection of virus in such samples as suggestive of a pathogenic role for HHV-6; however, with improved standardization of assays it may be possible in the future to define viral load thresholds that can better guide clinical treatment decisions. The lack of detection of HHV-6 in plasma does not rule out localized active infection in a specific organ or tissue. On the other hand, it is important to recognize that detection of low-level HHV-6 in cellular specimens such as tissue or whole blood can also reflect the presence of latent virus rather than active viral replication. Finally, as with all PCR assays for a single analyte, it is important to note that the presence of HHV-6 does not rule out the possible presence of other copathogens. The recent development of simple-to-perform and highly multiplexed assays that include HHV-6, such as the BioFire FilmArray (bioMérieux), may be helpful in this regard; as always, the clinical context should drive test selection and result interpretation. One systematic study of BioFire HHV-6 positives in CSF found that 20% of cases resulted in diagnosis of HHV-6 meningitis/meningoencephalitis (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0023">23</link>). Certainly it is helpful to know an individual’s iciHHV-6 status when considering the role of HHV-6 in meningitis when detected by BioFire.</para>
      <para id="ch0124s0013p0005">The detection of HHV-6 DNA by PCR can be especially difficult to interpret in the context of iciHHV-6. Cellular specimens from such patients have high HHV-6 levels, but plasma and CSF from such patients are almost always PCR positive due to the release of cellular DNA (which by definition includes viral DNA in cases of iciHHV-6). Thus, it is often useful to rule out iciHHV-6 in patients with high-level HHV-6 in plasma, especially if such levels are not consistent with the clinical presentation. Previously, testing for iciHHV-6 required fluorescence<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization or quantitative PCR analysis of hair follicles or fingernail clippings, but the introduction of digital PCR has allowed the development of rapid and accessible testing for iciHHV-6. In the context of iciHHV-6, the precision of digital PCR is more important in that it allows the simultaneous quantitation of HHV-6 and a human reference gene (RPP30). Because people with iciHHV-6 have one copy of HHV-6 in each cell, iciHHV-6 is ruled out if the ratio of HHV-6 to cellular genome equivalents (two RPP30/cell) falls outside a range of 1 ± 0.07 (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0094">94</link>), with the exception of rare individuals with two or more copies of iciHHV-6, in whom the virus/genome ratio will still fall close to 2.0, 3.0, or higher integers. Some experts have suggested that testing for iciHHV-6 should be routine in the management of transplant patients (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0125">125</link>).</para>
      <anchor id="ch0124s0013a0003"/>
      <beginpage pagenum="2046"/>
      <para id="ch0124s0013p0006">Although iciHHV-6 can explain high viral loads in plasma, it is important to recognize that patients with iciHHV-6 can still have active HHV-6 replication with associated pathology. For patients with underlying iciHHV-6A, HHV-6B reactivation can be identified by a multiplexed type-specific digital PCR assay (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0117">117</link>); presumably the converse, although rare, would be true as well. For patients with iciHHV-6B, active replication cannot be diagnosed by qPCR or digital PCR because of the background reactivity. In this case, the detection of viral RNA transcripts by reverse transcription real-time qPCR appears very promising for distinguishing latent from active infections, although such assays are not yet widely available.</para>
      <para id="ch0124s0013p0007">Beyond PCR and its variants, other testing modalities for HHV-6 have extremely limited roles in clinical management. Culture has been considered the “gold standard” approach for direct detection, but it is labor-intensive, slow, and insensitive and thus is not suited for clinical use. Serologic testing is more valuable in population-based studies of viral acquisition and prevalence; the use of paired sera in primary infection is too slow to be clinically useful, and IgM testing is unable to reliably detect primary versus recurrent infection (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0126">126</link>).</para>

HHV-7 virions are approximately 170 nm in diameter and consist of four major components: a double-stranded DNA genome (145 kb) within the core of an icosahedral capsid surrounded by a proteinaceous tegument, all of which is surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope that is studded with a variety of viral and cellular proteins. Fewer sequence data are available for HHV-7 compared to the other roseoloviruses, but HHV-7 genomes carry approximately 100 unique genes and share approximately 60% nucleotide identity in alignable regions with HHV-6A and HHV-6B.</para>

As noted above, the typical age for primary infection with HHV-7 may be somewhat older (median 26 months) than for HHV-6 (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0128">128</link>). Among children with symptomatic primary disease there appears to be no difference between HHV-6 and HHV-7 in terms of degree of fever, rash, or gastrointestinal symptoms. However, children with primary HHV-7 infection may be at higher risk for seizures compared to those with primary HHV-6 infection (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0128">128</link>).</para>

The frequency of recurrence after solid organ transplantation has been estimated to be 0 to 45%, with most cases occurring in the first 2 to 4 weeks posttransplant (<link linkend="ch0124s0025s0001li0136">136</link>). In general, symptomatic disease associated with HHV-7 has not been well documented, although scattered case reports have been published.

Future work should focus on clarifying the roles of these viruses in disease pathogenesis and on distinguishing normal carriage of these viruses from virally induced pathogenesis. With the growing availability of rapid multiplex PCR testing and the inclusion of HHV-6 in these licensed panels, we expect a significant rise in the number of new HHV-6 detections and increased interest and insight into clinical disease associations with the roseoloviruses.</para>
