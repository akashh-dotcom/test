        <para id="ch0062s0001s0001p0001"><emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> is a large and complex genus of Gram-negative bacteria that is important because it includes species with both clinical and environmental implications. Many species are saprophytic or pathogenic for plants. The metabolic versatility of species within this genus allows many to degrade low-molecular-weight organic and aromatic compounds (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0001">1</link>) and environmental pollutants. The genus <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis>, first proposed by Migula in 1894 (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0002">2</link>), has undergone many taxonomic revisions since the seminal study of Stanier et al. in 1966 (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0003">3</link>) because methodologies for species identification continue to improve; it comprised five unrelated groups, as determined by rRNA-DNA hybridization studies by Palleroni et al. in the early 1970s (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0004">4</link>). The genus <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> (<emphasis>sensu stricto</emphasis>) is rRNA homology group I in the gamma subclass of the <emphasis>Proteobacteria.</emphasis> The other rRNA homology groups are II (<emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ralstonia</emphasis> spp.), III (<emphasis>Comamonas, Acidovorax, Delftia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Hydrogenophaga</emphasis> spp.), IV (<emphasis>Brevundimonas</emphasis> spp.), and V (<emphasis>Stenotrophomonas</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0001">1</link>). The genus <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> is reduced to include only those species belonging to RNA group I, and of the listed species, 12 are of clinical relevance to humans. These 12 clinically relevant species can be divided into two distinct groups based on their ability to produce fluorescent pigments (<anchor id="ch0062s0001s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0062s0001s0001a0005">Fig. 1</link>). The fluorescent group comprises <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas veronii, Pseudomonas monteilii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Pseudomonas mosselii</emphasis> and produces pyoverdin, a water-soluble yellow-green or yellow-brown pigment that fluoresces blue-green when exposed to UV light. Many <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> strains also produce the blue water-soluble phenazine pigment pyocyanin. When pyoverdin combines with the blue pigment pyocyanin, the bright green color characteristic of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> is created; this color can sometimes be seen in infected sites, such as chronic wounds. This characteristic separates <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> from other members of the fluorescent group. <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> can also produce other diffusible pigments, such as pyomelanin (brown-black) and pyorubin (red). The six nonfluorescent species are <emphasis>P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, P. alcaligenes, P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. luteola</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. oryzihabitans.</emphasis> Based on 16SrRNA gene sequences, the <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> genus is now divided into three main lineages represented by <emphasis>Pseudomonas pertucinogena, P. aeruginosa</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. fluorescens</emphasis>, and these lineages currently comprise 254 validated species (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0005">5</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0062s0001s0001p0002"><emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> spp. are extremely versatile, being able to survive in a broad range of habitats (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0007">7</link>) where most of the organism’s cells grow as biofilms attached to surfaces which become slimy, or as suspended aggregates (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0008">8</link>). Although the number of free-floating planktonic cells may be very low, the total number of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> cells (biofilms and planktonic cells) may be very high even with minimal nutrients. In health care settings, it can be found in sinks, showers, respirator equipment, and the water of dental water-cooled drilling equipment.</para>
        <para id="ch0062s0001s0001p0003">Several of the clinically relevant<emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> species demonstrate marked heterogeneity and have been subdivided into biovars and genomovars. Genomovars are genetically distinct groups that warrant species designation but lack phenotypically defining characteristics; they are determined by DNA-DNA reassociation experiments, 16S rRNA gene sequencing in combination with chemotaxonomic total fatty acid analysis, and total protein pattern analysis (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0009">9</link>). Much work in genomic sequencing is occurring, with more than 600 strains of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> completely sequenced (<ulink url="http://www.pseudomonas.com">www.pseudomonas.com</ulink>). Currently, network analysis of 10,035 available <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> genomes has shown that 25% of the genomes are misclassified (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0005">5</link>), and an annual average of 10 new <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> species have been described (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0007">7</link>), so taxonomy of the <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> genus will continue to develop. For identification of clinically relevant species, however, matrix-associated laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has been compared with platform-based phenotypic methods and has shown that it allows correct identification of <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> species, subspecies, genomovars, and strains and is an accurate tool in agreement with the gene sequence analysis, provided that the databases incorporate new species (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0007">7</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0062s0001s0001p0004">The highest level of genetic diversity of any known species, as established by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, is found in<emphasis>P. stutzeri</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0010">10</link>). <emphasis>P. stutzeri</emphasis> has at least nine genomovars, with clinical isolates being found in genomovars 1 and 2. There are currently no consistent phenotypic differences to justify splitting <emphasis>P. stutzeri</emphasis> into unique species (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0009">9</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0062s0001s0002p0001"><emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> spp. are conventionally described as aerobic species based on their growth in routine media used in the clinical microbiology laboratory, but several species are actually facultative aerobes. They are non-spore-forming, Gram-negative rods, which are straight or slightly curved and are 0.5 to 1.0 by 1.5 to 5.0 μm depending on the growth phase. They are usually motile, with one or several polar flagella. They possess an aerobic respiratory metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor; in some species, such as <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>, nitrate can be used as an alternative electron acceptor, allowing anaerobic growth, and some species can use arginine fermentation for anaerobic growth (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0013">13</link>). Pyruvate fermentation does not support growth but allows survival of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> under anaerobic conditions (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0014">14</link>); it has been shown to be important for microcolony formation (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0015">15</link>). This is of pathogenic relevance, since anaerobic conditions are found in sputum in the bronchi and in mucus in the paranasal sinuses in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with chronic infections in these two locations (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0016">16</link>–<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0018">18</link>).

This organism may also produce other water-soluble pigments such as pyorubrin (red) or pyomelanin (brown-black) (<link linkend="ch0062s0001s0001a0005">Fig. 1</link>). Conditions of iron limitation enhance pigment production, as these pigments act as siderophores in iron uptake systems of the bacteria. Non-dye-containing media enhance visualization of pigments.</para>

Mucoid isolates of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> from CF patients may undergo several phenotypic changes, including slow growth, loss of motility, and loss of pigment production.

Isolates from these patients often exhibit mixed morphotypes including mucoid and nonmucoid phenotypes and small-colony variants; the mucoid phenotypes are bacterial microcolonies growing as biofilms as in CF lungs. Susceptibility testing is complicated by several factors, including lack of correlation between susceptibility results and clinical response (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0224">224</link>), different susceptibility patterns within a morphotype (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0225">225</link>), lack of reproducibility of susceptibility tests, undercalling resistance, and presence of hypermutable strains (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0114">114</link>). Mucoid and nonmucoid phenotypes of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> are often coisolated from patients with CF. Mucoid isolates tend to be more susceptible and have lower β-lactamase activity than nonmucoid isolates (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0226">226</link>). One explanation may be that these isolates are protected from selective antibiotic pressure and from oxygen radicals released from polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Selective antibiotic pressure, notably from inhalational tobramycin or colistin therapy, gives rise to small-colony variants of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> with properties of increased antimicrobial resistance, autoaggregative growth behavior, and enhanced ability to form biofilms (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0112">112</link>, <link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0113">113</link>). In turn, bacterial cells in biofilms adapt into symbiotic bacterial communities in which the mucoid alginate-producing bacterial cells provide physical protection to the biofilm, while the highly antibiotic-resistant nonmucoid cells protect against antibiotic killing (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0226">226</link>). Increased ability of biofilm bacteria to acquire resistance phenotypes (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0227">227</link>) and selection of hypermutable strains following antimicrobial therapy (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0114">114</link>, <link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0228">228</link>) may further explain the lack of eradication of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> from chronically infected CF patients. Since bacteria found in biofilms exhibit higher MICs (or rather, minimal biofilm eradication concentrations [MBECs]) than free-living bacteria, routine susceptibility testing of planktonic bacteria (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0229">229</link>) may underestimate resistance and may contribute to treatment failures (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0098">98</link>). In a study of 597 CF isolates (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0210">210</link>), both disk diffusion and Etest were found to be generally acceptable as routine susceptibility testing methods. However, poor correlation was found with diffusion testing of mucoid isolates for piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem. Underreporting of resistance was more frequent with disk diffusion than with Etest, especially when testing ceftazidime, piperacillin, and piperacillin-tazobactam.</para>

Overestimating susceptibility may occur, as mucoid isolates often demonstrate insufficient growth at 24 h. Automated systems that allow for longer incubation may be preferable. On the other hand, overcalling resistance may result from the presence of large amounts of exopolysaccharide, resulting in turbidity without adequate bacterial growth. These limitations have led many microbiologists who routinely work with mucoid isolates of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> to avoid using automatic methods for testing mucoid isolates. Using phenotypically different colonies directly from sputum cultures, or from subcultures of isolated colonies, has been shown to correlate well with disk diffusion and MIC susceptibility methods and may provide clinically useful susceptibility data with significant time and cost savings.

        <para id="ch0062s0028s0004p0001"><emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> may be associated with colonization or clinically significant infections. Interpretation of the Gram stain often directs the further workup of this organism. The presence of small clusters of Gram-negative organisms surrounded by amorphous material is indicative of biofilm formation compatible with a chronic infection (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0047">47</link>). This finding might be reported to physicians, and incubation should be prolonged for 3 to 5 days, as these isolates usually exhibit slower growth characteristics. The presence of these organisms intracellularly in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (<link linkend="ch0062s0028s0005li0047">47</link>) is a strong indication of true infection rather than colonization. Isolation of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> from sterile body sites should be interpreted as indicative of probable infection. Isolation in mixed culture requires correlation with the direct smear, other organisms isolated, and clinical history. Isolates from sites of chronic infection, such as CF respiratory sites, often exhibit multiple morphotypes that can make identification difficult. Molecular methods are increasingly finding a role in the identification of this organism, especially for epidemiological studies, but—like culture—may require microscopy of Gram stain smears to differentiate between infection and colonization in some samples, e.g., especially respiratory tract samples. Susceptibility testing of this organism is difficult, especially for mucoid isolates, due to increasing resistance, lack of reproducibility of results, and lack of clinical correlation. Piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam results obtained from automated systems may be unreliable for <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> spp. and in particular for mucoid isolates, and results should be confirmed by disk diffusion or Etest systems. A basic understanding of the multiple mechanisms of resistance—intrinsic, acquired, and adaptive—is essential to interpret susceptibility testing results and give therapeutic recommendations to physicians. Other <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> species are infrequently isolated in the laboratory and are usually not clinically significant. Clinical correlation and correlation with the Gram stain smear and results of other tests are essential before further workup is undertaken.</para>
