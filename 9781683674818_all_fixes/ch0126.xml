      <para id="ch0126s0000p0002">In 1953, Rowe and colleagues described an “adenoid degeneration agent” that induced spontaneous deterioration of tissue cultures prepared from adenoids of children (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0001">1</link>). In 1954, Hilleman and Werner cultivated a similar agent from military recruits with respiratory illnesses and called it RI-67 (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0002">2</link>). The two viruses were subsequently shown to be related, and in 1956 the term “adenovirus” was proposed to acknowledge their initial source. Epidemiologic studies soon identified the virus as a major cause of acute respiratory, ocular, and gastrointestinal disease. In the mid-1960s, human adenoviruses were found to cause tumors in rodents, prompting studies that revealed fundamental processes of molecular biology but failed to link the virus convincingly to human cancer. More recently, adenoviruses have generated considerable interest as vectors for gene delivery, as opportunistic pathogens affecting immunocompromised patients, and even as emerging human pathogens.</para>

        <para id="ch0126s0000p0003">Human adenoviruses belong to the<emphasis>Adenoviridae</emphasis> family, <emphasis>Mastadenovirus</emphasis> genus. Seven species of human mastadenoviruses (A through G) have been recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) based on immunologic, biologic, and genetic properties (<anchor id="ch0126s0000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0126s0000a0005">Table 1</link>). However, the term “human mastadenovirus” is not commonly used in the field of medical microbiology, and therefore the widely accepted but vernacular term “human adenovirus” (HAdV) will be used in this chapter.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0004">The seven HAdV species comprise (currently) 104 types. These were originally defined by serology (cross-neutralization) up to (sero)type 51. In 2007, the genetic analysis of a HAdV isolate from stool specimens resulted in the description species HAdV-G with its single type 52 to accommodate the unique genomic characteristics of this virus (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0004">4</link>). The isolation of a serotype 22 strain from a case of disease (epidemic keratoconjunctivitis), not previously reported in association with this type, prompted the sequencing of the complete viral genome. This was found to have a multiple recombinant phylogeny, mostly originating from epidemic keratoconjunctivitis-associated types 8 and 37, with only the neutralization epitope sequence originating from type 22 (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0006">6</link>). This body of work resulted in the description of genotype 53 and in the proposal of an alternative means of classifying new strains as novel (geno)types by phylogenetic analysis of complete genomic sequences. Previously, recombinant isolates with a hexon sequence of one serotype (e.g., 7) and a fiber sequence of another serotype (e.g., 3) were sometimes detected by serological typing, but were designated “intermediate strains” (e.g., 7H3) because they give contradictory typing results in serological typing assays (neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition [HAI]). Contemporary isolates will likely be typed by genomic sequencing and, if novel, labeled as new genotypes according to the genotype definition (e.g., type 53). This option to define genotypes with recombinant genomes provoked an intensive taxonomic discussion among adenovirologists (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0007">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0011">11</link>). The Human Adenovirus Working Group (<ulink url="http://hadvwg.gmu.edu/">http://hadvwg.gmu.edu/</ulink>) was established to coordinate and standardize the process of assigning type numbers to HAdV strains that were identified as novel based on bioinformatics analysis of whole genome sequences. To date, 113 types have been accepted. While all newer types (from 52 to 113) were defined as genotypes, the option and opportunity to define new adenovirus serotypes (by serological criteria) remain open. Compared to the serotype definition, the genotype definition has the advantage of a better correlation of type identity with virulence or other characteristics of clinical importance.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0005">Because it is usually not significant in diagnostics to indicate how a certain adenovirus type was defined, it is advisable to use the term “type” (as in this chapter) except when it should be stressed that a certain adenovirus type has serotype or genotype properties (e.g., in studies of immunity or molecular evolution). Many of the newly recognized genotypes are recombinants of older serotypes of the same HAdV species and cross-neutralize with one of these, but a few of the new genotypes (e.g., type 54) also have novel sequences in regions of the hexon gene encoding neutralization epitopes and thus could also fulfill the definition of a new serotype (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0012">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0013">13</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0006">Within a given type, molecular variants can be defined by full-length genomic sequencing or by restriction enzyme analysis. These variants are called subtypes or “genome types” (not to be confused with genotypes) and result from variations in the genomic DNA sequence that can be detected by restriction enzyme analysis (and, of course, by genomic sequencing) but do not result in different serologic properties or justify designation as a novel genotype (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0014">14</link>). Genome types are designated with lowercase letters after the numbered type, with the reference prototype denoted by the letter “p,” e.g., adenovirus genome types 4p or 4a (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0016">16</link>); genome types 7p, 7a, 7b, 7c, etc. (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0018">18</link>); and genome types 21p, 21a, or 21b (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0020">20</link>). Alternatively, isolates can be assigned to lineages in molecular phylogeny studies based on complete genomic sequencing data (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0021">21</link>).</para>

Each particle consists of a single, linear, double-stranded DNA molecule of about 36 kb that encodes approximately 40 genes. The DNA is covalently attached to a terminal protein at both 5′ ends and is encased by core proteins. A viral protease is also present. Seven structural proteins form the capsid. The major capsid proteins are the hexon, penton base, and fiber (long and short fiber in species HAdV-F). The capsid is formed primarily by 252 capsomeres consisting of 240 trimeric hexons, which form 20 triangular faces, and 12 pentons, one at each of the 12 vertices. Each penton consists of a pentameric base and a trimeric fiber, a rodlike projection of variable length with a terminal knob which interacts with cellular receptors. The hexon has antigenic sites common to all HAdVs, but these sites reside within the capsid, so neutralizing antibodies are not induced. The hexon also contains on its outer surface the ɛ determinant, which induces serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies. The fiber has serotype-specific antigenic determinants and species-specific antigenic determinants. The knob region of the fiber includes the γ determinant, which is responsible for hemagglutination <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> and induces hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies.</para>

The specificity of this interaction is an important determinant of tissue tropism. Following secondary interaction of the penton base with integrins (species HAdV-F binds with the short fibre to the secondary receptor), particles are internalized by endocytosis after endosmoe escape and are transported to the nucleus, where viral transcription and DNA replication initiate. Viral structural proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm likewise migrate to the nucleus, where the particles assemble and aggregate, forming large crystalline arrays (<anchor id="ch0126s0000a0019"/><link linkend="ch0126s0000a0022">Fig. 2A</link>).

        <para id="ch0126s0000p0014">Adenovirus infections are common and ubiquitous. Adenoviruses are responsible for 1 to 5% of respiratory infections overall but induce 2 to 24% of all respiratory infections and 5 to 15% of all acute diarrheal illnesses in children and 30 to 70% of all respiratory illnesses in unvaccinated new military recruits. Most infections occur in the first few years of life, and about half are asymptomatic. By the age of 10, most children have been infected with one or more types. Coinfection with different types and different species is documented, especially when different body sites are sampled (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0024">24</link>). The incidence of infection is highest in crowded closed settings, such as day care centers, boarding schools, geriatric facilities, military training camps, and hospitals. Intrafamilial transmissions are common. There is no obvious difference in susceptibility by gender or ethnic group. Infections occur worldwide, with some differences in types associated with various syndromes in other parts of the world.</para>

        <para id="ch0126s0000p0016">Latent infection can follow acute adenovirus infection, but the biology of latent infection is still not well understood for adenoviruses. Early studies showed latency mostly associated with species HAdV-C types in the mucosal T lymphocytes of tonsils and adenoids of asymptomatic young children. More recent work has shown a wider spectrum of viral species and has demonstrated viral genomic material in gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid cells (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0025">25</link>–<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0027">27</link>). Similar reservoirs may exist elsewhere in the body. The highest quantities of viral DNA are detectable in the tissues of young children, suggesting that virus stores may decline with age (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0028">28</link>). Low levels of viral DNA (&lt;1,000 copies/ml) are occasionally detectable in peripheral blood (circulating white blood cells) of healthy individuals (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0029">29</link>–<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0031">31</link>). Clinical significant reactivation may occur during immunosuppression of the host (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0033">33</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0017">Respiratory infections are most often associated with species HAdV-B, HAdV-C, and HAdV-E, with types 1, 2, 5, and 6 causing endemic acute infections and subsequently establishing latency (most frequently in young children) (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0034">34</link>) and types 3, 4, 7, 14, and 21 causing small epidemics mostly in winter to early summer (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0035">35</link>–<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0037">37</link>). A survey of U.S. isolates conducted in 2004 to 2006 identified the most common types in civilians as 3, 2, 1, and 5, with an increasing amount of type 21, which can cause serious lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0038">38</link>). Epidemics of severe respiratory disease in U.S. military recruits typically occur in the winter and spring. Historically, types 4 and 7 were the most common causes and were controlled by a vaccination program. After termination of the vaccination program in 1999, type 4 predominated, with lesser amounts of species B types 7 and 21 detected. Reintroduction of vaccination in 2011 reduced the incidence of type 4 infections in the military and the clinical severity of respiratory infections (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0039">39</link>). An emerging variant of type 14 (14p1, previously labeled 14a) was also identified in outbreaks of acute respiratory illness in military training facilities (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0040">40</link>). Like types 4 and 7, this variant has also caused clusters of severe LRTI and fatalities among civilians in several states (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0041">41</link>). Recently, outbreaks of respiratory disease in the nonvaccinated Chinese military were reported to be caused by types 7 and 55 (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0042">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0043">43</link>) whereas in a nonvaccinated American military setting, type 4 was re-emergent (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0044">44</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0018">Large epidemics of keratoconjunctivitis (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0045">45</link>) are caused mostly by species HAdV-D types 8, 37, and 64 (previously subtype 19a) and less frequently by types 53 and 54; the latter seems to predominate in Asia. Smaller outbreaks of conjunctivitis caused by types 3, 4, and 7 (of species HAdV-B and -E) occur in the summertime and are associated with contaminated swimming pool water. In contrast to epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, these infections hardly ever affect the cornea.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0019">Adenovirus-associated gastroenteritis is caused primarily by types 40 and 41 of species HAdV-F, which are also known as the “enteric adenoviruses.” These infections are endemic globally and occur year round. Types 12, 18, 31, and 61 of species HAdV-A can cause small gastroenteritis outbreaks, and gastroenteritis can also be observed during respiratory infections with types 1, 2, and 5.</para>

        <para id="ch0126s0000p0020">Adenovirus infections in people with primary or acquired immunodeficiencies are frequently reported (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0046">46</link>). Infections are most frequent and severe in pediatric recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with an incidence of infection up to 30%. Risk factors for disease in this population include young age, allogeneic transplantation, T-cell depletion, graft mismatch, cord blood transplantation, and severe graft-versus-host disease (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0047">47</link>). Many infections in pediatric HSCT recipients are endogenous reactivations of latent infections with adenovirus types of species HAdV-C and perhaps other species, for example, HAdV-A (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0048">48</link>), but <emphasis>de novo</emphasis> infections can also be observed. Infections with types of species HAdV-C clearly predominate in all HSCT age groups. Type 31 of species HAdV-A is frequently found in pediatric HSCT recipients but not in adult recipients, where types of species HAdV-B and -D can be found occasionally (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0049">49</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0050">50</link>). Several health care-related outbreaks of type 31 and type 41 were observed on HSCT wards, but type 41 hardly ever caused severe disease (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0051">51</link>–<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0055">55</link>). Mixed or sequential infections with different types are also common in HSCT patients (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0056">56</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0021">Data for solid organ transplantation recipients are more limited (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0057">57</link>), but this group generally experiences fewer and milder infections than HSCT recipients. Adenovirus infections are frequently associated with increased immunosuppression for the treatment of organ rejection. The lowest incidence is for renal transplant patients, who tend to suffer from species HAdV-B adenoviruses (types 7, 11, 34, and 35), which usually cause hemorrhagic cystitis and occasionally transplant nephritis. Adenovirus infections can be observed more frequently in lung, small bowel, or liver transplant recipients and lead to graft dysfunction (or loss) and fatalities. Infections with species C viruses (types 1, 2, and 5) are the most common. Transplant patients can acquire adenovirus as a result of endogenous reactivation of the virus from recipient or donor tissue, as well as from the community or hospital.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0022">Adenoviruses once caused many serious infections in human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS patients, mostly by species D types rarely identified in other settings (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0058">58</link>). The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy has dramatically reduced the incidence of such infections in this population.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0023">Transmission occurs primarily by the respiratory or fecal-oral route. Airborne transmission occurs by small droplets and, to a lesser extent, large-droplet aerosols. Fecal-oral spread probably accounts for the majority of enteric adenovirus infections. Adenoviruses are also spread by contaminated fomites, fingers, and liquids, such as ophthalmic solutions and sewage. Eye trauma facilitates infection and the spread of keratoconjunctivitis in environments with high levels of airborne particulates. The infection’s spread among new military recruits may involve direct contact as well as exposure to contaminated fomites and aerosol exposure via ventilation systems. Physical stress and fatigue may be contributory host factors in this setting for infection and severe disease affecting the lower respiratory tract. The mean incubation period for most respiratory tract infections is 5.6 days, for eye infections about 1 week, and for gastroenteritis 3 to 10 days (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0059">59</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0024">Transmission is facilitated by adenoviral resistance to many disinfectants and physical treatments. The stability of particles in gastric secretions, bile, and pancreatic proteases also permits passage through the stomach, followed by replication in the intestine. The prolonged period of virus shedding from various body sites aids transmission as well. The duration of shedding varies by type, body site, patient age, and immune status. In general, nonenteric adenoviruses are shed for several days by adults with upper respiratory tract infections, for a few weeks in ocular infections, and for 3 to 6 weeks from the throat or stool of children with respiratory or generalized illness. Infected children may excrete the virus initially from the respiratory tract and later from the gastrointestinal tract. Excretion in stool can be intermittent and prolonged for 18 months or longer after recovery (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0060">60</link>), but virus loads can be so low that transmission is rather improbable. Although the possibility of serial reinfection cannot be ruled out in all cases, recent studies of adenovirus DNA detection in intestinal biopsies of children clearly supports the concept of adenovirus latency and persistent infections (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0027">27</link>). In contrast, enteric adenoviruses of species HAdV-F are shed for only a few days after recovery. Immunocompromised individuals shed adenovirus longer than immunocompetent individuals.</para>

Clinical manifestations also depend on the age and immune status of the infected person. Most infections affect the respiratory tract, eye, and gastrointestinal tract, with less involvement of the urinary tract, heart, central nervous system, liver, pancreas, and genital tract. Solid-organ involvement and disseminated disease are seen primarily in immunocompromised patients.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0026">Most respiratory tract infections occur early in life and are self-limited and mild. Usual signs and symptoms are fever, nasal congestion, coryza, pharyngitis, cervical adenopathy, and cough, with or without otitis media. An exudative tonsillitis clinically indistinguishable from infection with group A streptococcus has been described. Adenoviral lower respiratory tract infections, such as croup, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, can be severe and sometimes fatal, particularly in young children less than 2 years of age. Long-term sequelae (bronchitis obliterans, bronchiectasis, and chronic atelectasis) of these lower respiratory tract infections are frequent in some populations, but additional studies on this topic are needed (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0061">61</link>). Higher mortality is reported for types 4 (genome type 4a), 5, 14 (genome type 14p1), 21 (subtype 21a), 55 (most frequently in Asia), and 66 (previously labeled genome type 7h or intermediate strain 7H3) and when extrapulmonary manifestations occur (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0043">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0062">62</link>–<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0065">65</link>). Outbreaks of adenovirus-associated acute respiratory disease in young military recruits cause febrile coldlike illness, pharyngitis with tonsillitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Hospitalization rates were as high as 50%, and some fatalities occurred due to severe LRTI, which resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since reintroduction of the vaccine (against serotypes 4 and 7) to the military in 2011, respiratory disease is not as severe as in the prevaccine era and involves a broader array of types (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0039">39</link>).

Epidemics of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis similar to those caused by enterovirus are also described. Pharyngoconjunctival fever is a follicular conjunctivitis accompanied by upper respiratory tract symptoms, fever, and occasionally lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and malaise. All these infections do not affect the cornea and are frequently caused by types 3, 4, and 7 of species HAdV-B and HAdV-E, but also by many other types. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is a more serious infection that starts with conjunctivitis but progresses with corneal erosions and infiltrates, which impair vision, and painful edema of the eyelids. Inflammatory symptoms may resolve in 2 weeks, although reduced vision due to chronic infiltrates of the cornea (“numuli”), photophobia, and foreign-body sensation may persist for months to years. Most cases of epidemic conjunctivitis are caused by types 8, 37, 53, 54, and 64, which are all members of species HAdV-D.</para>

Diarrhea is usually watery and nonbloody, lacks fecal leukocytosis, and lasts a mean of 10 days, which is somewhat longer than diarrhea due to rotavirus (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0067">67</link>). Mild fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain can occur, and respiratory symptoms are sometimes present. Most immunocompetent patients recover uneventfully, although infants with ileostomies or colostomies can have prolonged symptoms, and rare fatalities have been reported for immunocompetent patients.

Disease can affect single organs (e.g., hemorrhagic cystitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, enteritis), but disseminated disease is frequently observed. This includes high-level viremia (usually detected as DNAemia by quantitative PCR) associated with sepsis-like symptoms and infection of multiple organs (e.g., hepatitis and pneumonia) resulting in high mortality rates (exceeding 80% in some studies) (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0074">74</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0075">75</link>).</para>

The role of adenoviruses in fetal demise remains unclear. Adenovirus type 36 has recently been linked to obesity (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0080">80</link>), although this association remains controversial.

Collection of cell-rich specimens usually results in the highest sensitivity. Flocked nylon swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) have shown excellent yield compared to that from cotton swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates for the detection of respiratory viruses, including adenovirus (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0086">86</link>–<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0088">88</link>).

Suitable viral transport media can be laboratory prepared or purchased from commercial sources. Some commercial formulations, such as MicroTest multimicrobe medium M4RT (Remel, Lenexa, KS) or universal transport medium UTM (Copan), preserve infectivity for prolonged periods at room temperature and are also suitable for detection of viral antigen or DNA (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0089">89</link>). If plasma or serum samples are being tested, they should be separated within several hours of collection. Specimens, virus isolates, or DNA extracts can be frozen at −70°C indefinitely, with minimal loss of activity. Storage of specimens for adenovirus DNA detection by PCR is also feasible in –20°C freezers. Long-term storage in self-defrosting freezers and repeated freeze-thaw cycles ultimately reduce infectivity and degrade adenovirus DNA. Such conditions are not recommended for storage of any clinical specimens.</para>

Type 4 is especially heat resistant. Alcohol-based hand gels can destroy infectivity, although several minutes of contact may be required for some products. Variable disinfection is achieved with povidone-iodine, formaldehyde, and UV light. Viral DNA can be detected long after loss of infectivity.</para>

Smudge cells are large late-stage-infected cells containing solitary, central, basophilic nuclear inclusions composed of adenoviral particles (<link linkend="ch0126s0000a0022">Fig. 2A</link>). Other types of inclusions have been described as well (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0090">90</link>).

Labeled MAbs directed solely against adenovirus, or pools of MAbs labeled with different fluorochromes directed against adenoviruses and other respiratory viruses, can be used. Pools may be most economical for laboratories with a low prevalence of adenovirus. The reported sensitivity of IF for adenovirus detection in respiratory specimens is 40 to 60% of that of culture, which is lower than the detection rate of most other respiratory viruses. A sensitivity higher (60 to 80%) than that of culture is achievable using cytocentrifugation (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0097">97</link>) and specimens from pediatric patients.

In fact, adenovirus has been detected by PCR or similar amplification methods in virtually all specimen types, so the appropriate specimen depends largely on the associated disease (<link linkend="ch0126s0000a0026">Table 2</link>). In almost all reports, irrespective of the specific method used, the sensitivity of PCR has usually exceeded that of antigen detection or culture (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0106">106</link>).

It is therefore incumbent on both the developer and the user of such tests to verify the sensitivity of a given assay for the whole range of adenoviral types of clinical importance in the population being tested. Where quantitative tests are used, colinearity should be assessed across detectable viral types to ensure accuracy when a non-type-specific calibration curve is used. Clinical specificity should also be determined whenever possible because adenovirus DNA can be found in healthy control subjects due to persistence of adenovirus DNA after symptomatic infections or due to asymptomatic adenovirus infections. On average, fewer than 2% of specimens from healthy individuals contain low concentrations of adenovirus DNA, although values can vary significantly depending on the patient population and the specimen type (e.g., whole blood versus plasma/serum) (29–31, 107). Somewhat higher detection rates have been reported for chronic conditions (such as asthma), for tonsil and adenoid tissue, and for gastrointestinal biopsy specimens with negative pathology (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0066">66</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0108">108</link>). Each laboratory should therefore define the clinical significance of positive PCR results in its patient population and sample types. For quantitative tests, threshold values can be established which indicate the clinical significance of a positive result. In the case of qualitative real-time PCRs, threshold cycle values may be helpful to discern clinically significant acute infections from persistence of adenovirus DNA, but threshold cycle values have to be validated carefully.</para>

        <para id="ch0126s0000p0059">Many transplant centers now assess DNAemia with such quantitative tests on a weekly basis for several months after transplantation and subsequently when symptoms appear. Routine screening has become especially commonplace for pediatric HSCT patients. Screening of asymptomatic patients can be used to trigger preemptive therapy (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0047">47</link>). A threshold value of 1 × 10<superscript>4</superscript> copies/ml was proposed for starting preemptive therapy because lower virus loads did not influence mortality (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0124">124</link>). However, there is no single threshold value of DNAemia that can be recommended in general, due to differences in assay characteristics and patient populations, although a calibration standard of the WHO (giving results in international units per milliliter) became available recently (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0125">125</link>). Some experts follow <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> dynamic changes by repeat testing 2 or 3 days after a single low viral load to identify patients with a rapid increase before initiating treatment. In patients with diagnosed adenoviral infection, viral loads can be used to assess the clinical response to antivirals and predict outcomes (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0126">126</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0126s0000p0060">Although historically considered the reference standard, viral isolation is now used with decreasing frequency. Viral culture is slower than antigen assays and less sensitive than PCR, yet it remains useful for specimens suspected to be false negative and it yields infectious progeny for further identification and typing. Most specimens are suitable for culture (<link linkend="ch0126s0000a0026">Table 2</link>). Exceptions are blood and cerebrospinal fluid, which may contain insufficient virus to be cultivated or may contain virus neutralized by antibodies. For these specimens, DNA amplification is typically preferred.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0061">Adenoviruses grow best in human epithelial cells. Primary human embryonic or neonatal kidney cells are the most sensitive but are rarely available, so human epithelial cell lines, such as A549, Hep2, or sometimes HeLa or KB, are used. Human fibroblasts and non-human cells, such as Vero and primary monkey kidney cells that contain endogenous simian virus 40, may support adenovirus replication, but the yield is low. Enteric adenoviruses (species HAdV-F) are often termed “fastidious” because they are noncultivable or grow slowly in routine cell lines. Cultivation of enteric adenoviruses is most successful in Graham 293 cells (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0067">67</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0062">Adenoviruses can be isolated by conventional tube culture or shell vial centrifugation culture (SVCC). These methods are detailed in earlier chapters. Although SVCC is popular because it produces rapid results, tube culture remains useful to detect low concentrations of virus or slow-growing types, particularly of species A or D, which may not be evident for 3 or 4 weeks. Holding tubes for 2 weeks is customary for routine diagnostic work. If tubes are held for longer periods, cells should be subpassaged at least once to maintain the health of the monolayer. Typical cytopathic effects (CPEs) consist of grape-like aggregates of swollen, refractile cells (<anchor id="ch0126s0000a0049"/><link linkend="ch0126s0000a0051">Fig. 4B</link>). Aggregates may not develop with species D, and a weblike flattening is described for serotypes 3 and 7 (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0127">127</link>). CPE is usually evident in 2 to 7 days in A549 cells but may be less characteristic and slower to appear in other cell types. As infection progresses, cells can become highly granular and detach completely from the surface. Most infectious virus remains cell associated so that high-titer preparations can be produced by several freeze-thaw cycles of harvested cells. CPE that develops within hours after inoculation with concentrated preparations is known as “lysis from without” or “early CPE” and is a toxic effect due to free penton base proteins in the inoculum. It can be prevented by using a lower concentration of the inoculum.</para>

Often the MAb preparations used to identify viral antigen in direct specimens can be used in SVCC. Maximum detection of fluorescent foci requires at least 30 min of centrifugation at 700 ×<emphasis>g</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0031">31</link>). The sensitivity of SVCC compared to that of tube culture under these conditions is approximately 50% at 24 h, increases somewhat at 2 days, and can approach 100% by 5 days (98, 128–131). Similar results can be achieved using 24-well microtiter plates. Lower detection rates are reported if human fibroblast or monkey cells are used (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0132">132</link>). Dexamethasone, which enhances the identification of some viruses in SVCC, does not improve adenovirus detection in SVCC (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0133">133</link>).

Most immunologic or molecular methods for direct detection of adenoviruses are suitable for this purpose. Identification by IF is most often used for culture isolates because the technique is simple and rapid. For IF, cells that appear to contain adenovirus should be harvested when at least 20% of the monolayer shows CPE. Other methods that can be used for identification are latex agglutination, IC, or PCR. On occasion, CPE-positive variants or new types that cannot be identified by these methods emerge.

        <para id="ch0126s0000p0065">Typing of adenoviruses into species or types is used primarily for epidemiology or studies of pathogenesis or to reveal the cause of an unusual or especially severe infection. Traditional and molecular typing methods are available. Traditional typing requires a viral isolate and detects serologically recognized differences in fiber and hexon epitopes. Molecular typing can be performed with isolates or directly on PCR-positive specimens. Typing by serology and molecular methods is usually in agreement for serotypes, but discrepant results can be obtained with many of the new genotypes. These require molecular typing if they share common neutralization epitopes with older serotypes.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0066">Molecular typing has increasingly replaced serology as the method of choice for routine strain typing and epidemiologic studies. Sequence-based typing is rapid and highly accurate. Some assays can be performed directly with clinical material if amplification is performed by generic or multiplex PCR, or sometimes by nested PCR, to obtain sufficient DNA for sequencing (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0136">136</link>). Alternative methods of analysis can include measurement of product length; restriction endonuclease analysis (REA); REA followed by DNA sequencing; mass spectrometry (111, 137–139); or probe-based methods including reverse line blotting, in-well hybridization, type- or species-specific real-time PCR, and solid-phase microarrays (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0140">140</link>–<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0142">142</link>). Many of these alternative methods cannot identify all adenovirus types or are limited to typing on a species level, whereas nucleic acid sequencing methods are more comprehensive (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0136">136</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0143">143</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0144">144</link>). Sequence analysis of polymorphisms in long nucleotide repeats (microsatellites) is proposed to track strains (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0145">145</link>). Sequencing of hypervariable regions 1 to 6 or 7 of the hexon gene (which code for the main neutralization epitope ɛ) yields results identical to the classical serotyping by neutralization testing (“imputed serology”) (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0136">136</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0146">146</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0147">147</link>). However, genotypes which share neutralization epitopes with other types cannot be identified by sequencing of the hexon gene, and additional sequencing of the fiber gene and the penton gene may be required (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0148">148</link>). This, and even sequencing of the complete genome, is also advisable if an unusual disease association is observed with the typing result based on the hexon gene sequence, because an already described or novel genotype can be suspected (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0149">149</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0150">150</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0067">Sequencing of complete adenovirus genomes by next-generation sequencing is required for definite identification of multiple recombinant genotypes and identification of novel genotypes (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0150">150</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0151">151</link>). Results of all other methods (REA, partial sequencing of the hexon gene) can be deduced from complete genomic sequencing, so it can be regarded as the reference method for molecular typing. Advances in sequencing technologies now allow direct sequencing of adenovirus genomes from diagnostic specimens (for example, eye swabs, feces, blood, nasopharyngeal swabs) with sufficient virus load (&gt;10<superscript>5</superscript> copies/ml) without the need for virus isolation. This is even possible for samples with low viral load (&lt;10<superscript>5</superscript> copies/ml) if a tentative typing result (for example, by partial sequencing of the hexon) is available and target enrichment with adenovirus species-specific RNA baits is utilized (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0152">152</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0153">153</link>). Assembly of directly sequenced adenovirus genomes requires some caution, however, as reference-guided assemblies might exclude recombinant sites and even superinfections with another type. <emphasis>De novo</emphasis> assembly approaches are thus preferred and, given the short genome without internal repeats, uncomplicated. Complete genomic sequencing can also be used for tracing of infection transmission chains or for addressing other epidemiological questions (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0053">53</link>). However, sequence identity may not be the ultimate proof of transmission because little is known about the sequence variability of most adenovirus types and about the regional circulation of the identified adenovirus strain (or sequence variant). For example, (almost) sequence-identical strains of types 2 and 5 circulated for decades (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0153">153</link>), and hence sequence identity of two clinical isolates does not prove a transmission event. On the other hand, considerable sequence variation was observed in a single epidemic of type 8 (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0045">45</link>), and thus the investigation of infection chains seems to be feasible. In any case, complete genomic sequencing is a powerful tool to rule out transmission events.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0068">Restriction endonuclease analysis does not require amplification of adenovirus DNA by PCR (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0154">154</link>), but highly positive specimens or culture isolates and interpretation of cleavage patterns can be challenging and sometimes even misleading (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0020">20</link>). REA is still used, however, in addition to classical serotyping, for identification of new genome types (not to be confused with genotypes) associated with severe disease. Single-stranded confirmation polymorphism and heteroduplex mobility assays are other direct approaches.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0069">Traditional serotyping is performed by provisionally determining the species of an isolate by hemagglutination (<link linkend="ch0126s0000a0005">Table 1</link>) or, if the isolate is from stools, by a species F (serotype 40/41)-specific EIA. Serotyping by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) or serum neutralization (SN) is then performed, utilizing specific antisera that define the serotypes of that species. HAI is the easier assay, but SN is the primary arbiter of serotype. However, SN may give misleading results with the novel genotypes. Modified SN procedures are preferred for speed and simplicity over the conventional 7-day test with human epithelial cells (or 293 cells for stool isolates). Intersecting pools of antibody mixtures reduce the number of individual reactions. Modified SN tests include a 3-day test with monkey kidney cells and a 5-day microneutralization test with Vero cells (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0003">3</link>). If HAI and SN give contradictory typing results on isolates, these were previously labeled as intermediate types, but nowadays complete genomic sequencing is advisable to identify the precise genotype. However, SN remains the “gold standard” to classify novel serotypes.</para>

Neutralizing antibodies can persist a decade or more in a relatively undiminished titer, probably maintained by periodic reinfection, reactivation, and heterotypic anamnestic antibody responses. The IgG response can be delayed in many children for months after infection and may not appear in immunocompromised individuals. An IgM response occasionally occurs when virus reactivates. Serologic tests are useful for epidemiologic investigations and to study the immune response.</para>

        <para id="ch0126s0000p0071">In recent years, serodiagnosis of adenovirus infections has largely been superseded by other methods of virus detection, e.g., antigen detection or PCR. The value of serology for patient care is limited due to the retrospective nature of demonstrating seroconversion, false-negative results due to the delay of the IgG response in children, the insensitivity of IgM assays, and the lack of antibody responses in immunocompromised individuals. False positives also occur due to heterotypic responses or late antibody increases in children unrelated to their current problem. Diagnostic serology is typically performed by documenting at least a 4-fold rise in virus-specific IgG (seroconversion) or by detecting an IgM response by a genus-specific EIA to detect IgG or IgM antibodies against the hexon protein. Formats with a viral antigen preparation or a “capture” immunoglobulin on the solid phase are commercially available and sensitive. Serotype-specific antibody tests are infrequently used for diagnosis but can pinpoint serotypes responsible for a cluster of infections when other specimens are unavailable. HAI and SN are the serotype-specific assays of choice. SN is the standard, with the 3-day monkey kidney test or microneutralization preferred, and may be required prior to gene therapy studies with adenovirus vectors. Complement fixation, indirect IF, latex agglutination, and radioimmunoassay are rarely used.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0072">Serologic tests are useful for epidemiologic investigations and to study the immune response.

      <para id="ch0126s0000p0073">Most adenovirus infections of immunocompetent patients are mild and self-limiting and do not require antiviral treatment, but LRTI can be severe and even fatal. A reduction of immunosuppressive therapy, if feasible, is essential in immunosuppressed patients because severe manifestations of adenovirus infections, e.g., disseminated disease, are clearly associated with immunosuppression.</para>
      <para id="ch0126s0000p0074">Several antivirals, including ganciclovir, ribavirin, and cidofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue and broad-spectrum antiviral agent, as well as the antiretroviral drugs zalcitabine, alovudine, and stavudine have<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> activities against adenovirus. Ribavirin was initially reported to have <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> activity only against species C types but is now said to be active against most isolates of species A, B, and D and all isolates of species C (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0156">156</link>). All adenovirus types are susceptible to cidofovir <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>, including the emerging adenovirus type 14p1, which is associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection, whereas this type is not susceptible to ribavirin (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0157">157</link>). Although cidofovir resistance can develop with serial passage <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>, little resistance has so far been detected in isolates from cidofovir-treated patients (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0156">156</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0126s0000p0075">Cidofovir is frequently used to treat a variety of clinical presentations, mostly in immunocompromised patients. Despite the significant side effects of cidofovir (nephrotoxicity, myelosuppression, and uveitis), regimens with acceptable levels of toxicity have been developed (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0158">158</link>). Prospective controlled clinical trials have never been published, but retrospective studies reported efficacies of up to 98% in HSCT patients and a reduction of mortality in comparison to previously published studies (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0158">158</link>). However, several cases of treatment failure were also reported, and these may be associated with a late start of therapy when symptoms and high virus loads (&gt;1 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> copies/ml) in peripheral blood are already present (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0126">126</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0159">159</link>). Therefore, guidelines from the European Conference on Infections in Leukemia include recommendations for preemptive therapy with cidofovir in high-risk patients (as defined by host factors, transplant type, and viremia, which is usually detected as DNAemia by quantitative PCR) (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0047">47</link>). Weekly surveillance of DNAemia for high-risk patients in the first few months posttransplantation is recommended, followed by preemptive cidofovir treatment if results are positive or rising. This strategy still does not completely eliminate adenovirus disease, however, and some pediatric patients clear their DNAemia spontaneously without treatment (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0158">158</link>). The use of a threshold value of virus loads (e.g., 1 × 10<superscript>4</superscript> copies/ml) for triggering cidofovir treatment is discussed, to avoid overtreatment and thus unnecessary side effects, because low virus loads do not influence mortality of HSCT patients (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0124">124</link>). However, quantification of adenovirus loads may differ significantly between laboratories. Quantitative detection of adenovirus shedding (&gt;10<superscript>6</superscript> copies/ml) by additional weekly monitoring of stool specimens is helpful for early detection of patients at a high risk for significant DNAemias (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0073">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0160">160</link>). However, gastrointestinal panel PCRs which only detect types 40 and 41 of species HAdV-F are not appropriate for this purpose, as detection of shedding of species HAdV-A, -B, and C is essential because these, but not species HAdV-F, are associated with significant mortality in HSCT patients (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0048">48</link>). Highly multiplexed PCR panels for respiratory viruses are also not appropriate because they can fail to detect types (e.g., 31) of nonrespiratory adenovirus species (e.g., A), which are significant pathogens in HSCT patients (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0119">119</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0126s0000p0076">A lipid conjugate of cidofovir, brincidofovir (CMX001; hexadecyloxypropyl cidofovir) has shown promise in early studies for the treatment of adenoviral infections (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0161">161</link>). Brincidofovir can be administered orally, with good absorption, and reaches higher intracellular concentrations than cidofovir, with lower toxicity. It has shown potent <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> antiviral activity against a wide range of double-stranded DNA viruses, and evidence points to less nephrotoxicity than that of cidofovir (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0162">162</link>). In a multicenter retrospective study comparing brincidofovir with cidofovir for preemptive treatment of HSCT patients, significantly more virological responses were observed with brincidofovir (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0163">163</link>). Diarrhea is the main side effect of brincidofovir. A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of brincidofovir for the preemptive treatment of asymptomatic HAdV DNAemia in HSCT patients did not show a significant effect on the primary endpoint, defined as the proportion of subjects experiencing treatment failure, either progression to probable or definitive adenovirus disease or increasing virus loads (DNAemia) (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0164">164</link>). However, a positive trend was observed for brincidofovir 100 mg (2 mg/kg if &lt;50 kg) twice weekly, but not for 200 mg once weekly. Perhaps the study was underpowered because of the three-arm design. Brincidofovir is FDA approved only for the treatment of variola, not adenovirus infections.</para>
      <para id="ch0126s0000p0077">Ganciclovir has only a questionable effect<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> and is no longer recommended for treatment of adenovirus infections. Ribavirin has been used with somewhat greater success, but many failures and fatalities were reported (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0028">28</link>).

        <para id="ch0126s0000p0080">The clinical spectrum of adenoviral disease is broad, so laboratory testing is usually required for accurate diagnosis. Selection of tests should be guided by the patient’s symptoms and immune status, the interval between disease onset and specimen collection, and laboratory expertise. The use of culture (centrifugation or tube culture) continues to diminish. Antigen testing has found limited application, and serologic testing rarely provides clinically actionable data. In the past few years, testing has shifted primarily toward molecular methods, such that most adenovirus infections can now be detected within hours when automated “sample-to-answer” systems are used or within 1 to 2 days when quantitative laboratory-developed test-based assays are used. Testing can be aimed at systemic detection in blood samples (primarily in immunocompromised patients) or at detection in sites of end-organ involvement. In the latter instance, histopathology and adjunctive immunohistochemical and<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization continue to play an important role.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0081">Interpretation of positive results can be challenging since many adenovirus infections are asymptomatic or because of adenovirus latency. Accurate interpretation should consider patient and specimen characteristics, test method, and, under some circumstances, the adenovirus type or quantity detected (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0170">170</link>). This requires close communication between the laboratory and the clinician. In general, detection of virus from the involved organ or in large quantities in a patient with an illness that is epidemiologically associated with adenovirus is evidence that adenovirus is the actual cause of the disease.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0082">PCR-based methodology has now displaced culture and antigen detection as the method of choice for rapid detection of adenoviral respiratory tract infection. These assays typically have a high degree of sensitivity. Higher rates of detection can be expected in samples from children, because virus is typically shed at higher titers and for longer periods in children than in adults. This can also coincide with a more recently acquired, clinically relevant infection with another respiratory pathogen. Caution is advised in the selection of test methods, because the complex phylogeny of adenoviruses can present a daunting assay design challenge. A given test, though claiming broad detection capabilities, may have significantly reduced sensitivity for specific adenoviral types or species. Nonetheless, both sensitivity and speed of detection have markedly improved over time, and the rapid reporting of such results can have a positive impact on patient and fiscal outcomes (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0171">171</link>, <link linkend="ch0126s0000li0172">172</link>). The sensitivity advantage of PCR over other methods is such that confirmatory reflex testing by PCR for samples testing negative by other methods should be considered in critically ill or high-risk populations.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0083">Although typically utilized for immunocompromised patients, assessment of DNAemia may be a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of severe adenoviral disease in immunocompetent children (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0108">108</link>). The exquisite sensitivity of PCR can also present challenges, however. Low viral DNA loads can be detected in specimens from asymptomatic subjects. Results of tissue PCR may be particularly hard to interpret in the absence of correlative viral inclusions that are positive by immunohistochemistry or <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization. Furthermore, the clinical significance of continued shedding of adenovirus after resolution of symptomatology is an unresolved issue (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0170">170</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0084">In contrast, ocular adenoviral detection by EIA, IC, culture, or PCR may be considered diagnostic. Adenovirus encephalitis and meningitis occur infrequently, so studies comparing traditional and newer methods of detection are lacking, although PCR of cerebrospinal fluid is likely to be the optimum approach.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0085">Adenovirus gastroenteritis in immunocompetent patients is best detected by a type 40/41-specific immunoassay or by a gastrointestinal panel PCR of stools. Interpretation is usually straightforward, because viral shedding is infrequent past the symptomatic period. In contrast, nonenteric adenoviruses can be detected in stools of asymptomatic immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients for prolonged periods. In the latter group, severe gastrointestinal disease can result, and detection in the stool can presage potentially fatal disseminated infection. High viral loads in excess of 10<superscript>6</superscript> genome copies/ml of stool have been shown to be predictive of subsequent DNAemia in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. Detection and quantification of nonenteric adenoviruses in stools of immunocompromised patients can be achieved by generic real-time PCR protocols but not by gastrointestinal panel PCRs designed to detect only enteric adenovirus (types 40/41). Detection of adenovirus in the stools of transplant recipients does not rule out graft-versus-host disease.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0086">Detection of adenovirus in urine has also been associated with hemorrhagic cystitis. Among immunocompetent patients, this picture is typically seen in pediatric patients, with a male predominance, in association with adenovirus types 11, 34, and 35. In HSCT patients, hemorrhagic cystitis may be severe and/or can disseminate (<link linkend="ch0126s0000li0074">74</link>). However, as in other organ systems, adenovirus may be shed asymptomatically in the urine, and the predictive value of routine testing for this sample type is unclear, with some investigators failing to show an association between adenoviruria and hemorrhagic cystitis in HSCT patients.</para>
        <para id="ch0126s0000p0087">Diagnosis of adenovirus disease in immunocompromised patients is challenging due to the many copathogens, the high rates of asymptomatic virus shedding, and the protean manifestations of adenovirus infections in this population. HSCT and solid organ transplantation recipients are at highest risk of severe disease and are the usual focus of testing. Some centers utilize surveillance cultures or PCR studies of multiple body sites to detect virus in temporal association with the onset of new symptoms. Involvement is then classified as infection, probable disease, or definite disease, depending on the number of virus-positive sites, symptoms, or histologic confirmation. DNAemia testing by quantitative PCR is an alternative strategy and is more frequently used nowadays. DNAemia is usually present during severe or fatal adenovirus infection and often precedes the development of disease, although not all PCR-positive patients become symptomatic. Therefore, many centers now monitor weekly DNAemia quantitatively in high-risk transplant patients, treat preemptively based on single high-positivity results or dynamic increases from low baselines, and reevaluate DNAemia to assess response to treatment. Similar approaches may be useful to assess the clinical effectiveness of new treatment modalities for adenoviral disease. However, caution is warranted in adapting universal or consensus breakpoints for institution of therapy. The wide variations in methodology and the potential for inaccuracies in quantification across different types for individual assays mean that treatment thresholds must continue to be verified based on the test in use and the population being assessed in any given institution.</para>
