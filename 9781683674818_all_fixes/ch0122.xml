      <para id="ch0122s0000p0002">Cytomegalovirus (CMV) belongs to a large family of herpesviruses that commonly infects humans of all ages. Although infections with this virus are normally asymptomatic in healthy children and adults, CMV is one of the most notable viral pathogens causing serious diseases in newborns and individuals with compromised immune systems. This chapter emphasizes the fundamental characteristics and clinical importance of CMV and focuses on the laboratory tests that can be used to identify the virus and to monitor and predict disease and susceptibility to antiviral therapy, and on the philosophy behind the interpretation and reporting of test results in various defined patient populations.</para>

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0003">Human CMV, formally designated human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, is a member of the family<emphasis>Herpesviridae</emphasis>, which includes herpes simplex virus types 1 (HHV-1) and 2 (HHV-2), varicella-zoster virus (HHV-3), Epstein-Barr virus (HHV-4), and HHV- 6, -7, and -8. It is classified in the subfamily <emphasis>Betaherpesvirinae</emphasis> with cytomegaloviruses of other animal species based on its tropism for salivary glands, slow growth in cell culture, and strict species specificity. Human CMV is the type species of the genus <emphasis>Cytomegalovirus</emphasis>, and its name is derived from the enlargement of cells (“cyto” = cell, “mega” = large) infected by the virus. Regions of genome sequence homology between CMV and herpesviruses 6 and 7 have been identified, and HHV-6 and HHV-7 are now classified with CMV among the betaherpesviruses (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0001">1</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0004">Complete CMV particles have a diameter of 120 to 200 nm and consist of a core containing a large (220- to 240-kb) linear double-stranded DNA genome, an icosahedral capsid with 162 capsomeres, an amorphous tegument or matrix, and a surrounding phospholipid-rich envelope. The CMV genome is the largest of the herpesviruses and comprises more than 170 nonoverlapping open reading frames that encode structural and regulatory proteins and proteins that function to modulate the immune system of the host. Electron-microscopic features of CMV include virions morphologically indistinguishable from those of other herpesviruses, a high ratio of defective viral particles, and the presence of spherical particles called dense bodies. Viral replication occurs in the nucleus of the host cell and involves the expression of immediate early (α), early (β), and late (γ) classes of genes. The viral envelope is formed as assembled nucleocapsids bud from the inner surface of the nuclear membrane.</para>

Although it has been shown that different strains of CMV are 95% homologous to the standard laboratory reference strains AD-169 and Towne, genetically distinct CMV genotypes that display polymorphisms in multiple coding and noncoding regions of the virus genome have been identified in various human hosts, including healthy adults and children, congenitally infected infants, transplant recipients, and AIDS patients (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0002">2</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0004">4</link>). Strain diversity has been observed within a single individual and between individuals and has been associated with specific differences in geographic distribution, transmission, tissue tropism, immunopathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of disease, but the exact role and importance of CMV genotypes in infection and disease are not well understood and remain largely unknown.</para>

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0007">CMV has a worldwide distribution and infects humans of all ages, with no seasonal or epidemic patterns of transmission. The global seroprevalence of CMV varies widely and tends to be highest in South America, Africa, and Asia and lowest in Western Europe and the United States, with ranges from 40% or less to over 90% (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0006">6</link>). The virus is acquired earlier in life, and the prevalence increases with age in all populations, being higher among non-White ethnic groups, female sex, lower socioeconomic groups in crowded living conditions, and people living with HIV/AIDS (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0008">8</link>). CMV can be transmitted vertically (from mother to child) and horizontally (from one person or group to another), and infections are classified as being acquired before birth (congenital), at the time of delivery (perinatal), or later in life (postnatal) (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0009">9</link>). Groups at increased risk for CMV infection and possible subsequent adverse outcomes include child care workers of childbearing age, pregnant women in general, infants infected <emphasis>in utero</emphasis>, very low-birth-weight and premature infants (born &lt;1,500 g and &lt;30 weeks gestational age), and individuals whose immune systems are compromised.</para>
        <anchor id="ch0122s0000a0005"/>
        <beginpage pagenum="1990"/>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0008">Most infections are acquired by direct close personal contact with individuals who are shedding virus. Since CMV has been detected in many body fluids, including saliva, urine, breast milk, tears, stool, vaginal and cervical secretions, blood, and semen, it is clear that transmission can occur in a variety of ways. Prolonged shedding of virus after congenital or acquired CMV infection contributes to the ease of virus spread; virus may be excreted for weeks, months, or even years following a primary infection.</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0009">Transplacental infection of the fetus can occur following primary or recurrent infection of a pregnant woman, but the risk of CMV transmission to the fetus and the rate of symptomatic fetal infection are much higher with primary maternal infection. The incidence of fetal damage is highest if infection occurs during the first 12 to 16 weeks of pregnancy. Maternal illness may be mild, with fever and nonspecific symptoms, but is not clinically apparent in most pregnant women. Newborns can also acquire infection at the time of delivery by contact with virus in the birth canal. Nearly 10% of women shed CMV in the genital tract at or near the time of delivery, and virus is transmitted to approximately 50% of the newborns. Such infants begin to excrete virus at 3 to 12 weeks of age but usually remain asymptomatic. Mother-to-infant transmission of CMV through breast milk is very common; very low-birth-weight preterm infants are at greatest risk for developing disease. Of children who attend child care centers and enter as toddlers, 20 to 70% experience CMV infection over a 1- to 2-year period. Infection is usually asymptomatic, but the children may transmit CMV to their parents and other caregivers, posing a risk to an unborn fetus if a woman is pregnant at the time. Susceptible health care workers and employees of child care centers are at risk of occupational exposure. In adolescents and adults, sexual transmission of CMV may occur and is an important route of CMV spread.</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0010">Similar to infections with other herpesviruses, primary infection with CMV results in the establishment of a lifelong persistent or latent infection. Reactivation of the virus can occur in response to different stimuli, particularly immunosuppression. The sites of latent infection are thought to include various tissues, endothelial cells, and leukocytes. Therefore, CMV can be transmitted through transfusion of blood products and by exposure to tissue and hematopoietic stem cells during transplantation and may lead to severe disease in infants with very low birth weights, pregnant women, transplant recipients and other immunocompromised hosts, and critically ill immunocompetent patients.</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0012">The vast majority of immunocompetent children and adults who acquire CMV infection postnatally remain asymptomatic. Cell-mediated immunity is most important in controlling infection, and CMV-specific CD4<superscript>+</superscript> and CD8<superscript>+</superscript> lymphocytes play a critical role.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0013">Symptoms in young adults can mimic the infectious mononucleosis syndrome caused by Epstein-Barr virus and include prolonged fever (persisting for 2 to 3 weeks), malaise, an atypical lymphocytosis, and mild hepatitis without the production of heterophile antibody. Exudative pharyngitis is frequently absent, and lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are less common with CMV-associated infectious mononucleosis. Organ-specific diseases, including colitis, hepatitis, encephalitis, pneumonia, anterior uveitis, and multisystem involvement with fever of unknown origin, have also been described in the immunocompetent host but are rare.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0014">A link between CMV infection in the immunocompetent host and other clinical conditions has been suggested, including for atherosclerosis, hypertension, malignancies such as glioblastoma and breast cancer, new-onset diabetes, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, and immunosenescence in the elderly. It is unclear whether CMV truly contributed to these diseases or was an innocent bystander. More recently, there has been an increase in the number of reports of severe CMV infection associated with poor outcomes in hospitalized, critically ill immunocompetent patients (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0012">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0013">13</link>). Reactivation of CMV is common in these patients and is linked to increased length of stay in the hospital and/or intensive care unit, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, severe sepsis, high disease severity, and mortality (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0014">14</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0015">In developed countries, CMV infection has been detected in 0.2 to 2.5% (average of 0.65%) of newborn infants and is the most common identified infectious cause of congenital disease (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0016">16</link>). Higher prevalence rates of 0.6 to 6.1% of live births have been reported in developing countries (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0017">17</link>). Approximately 10 to 15% of congenitally infected infants develop symptoms during the newborn period; possible manifestations range from severe disease—with any combination of intrauterine growth retardation, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, petechiae, thrombocytopenic purpura, myocarditis, pneumonitis, microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, periventricular calcifications, deafness, and chorioretinitis—to more limited involvement. Symptomatic infants may die of complications within the first months of life; more commonly, they survive but are neurologically damaged and will have long-term health problems such as sensorineural hearing loss (the most common chronic condition following congenital CMV infection), visual impairment, seizures, or psychomotor and/or intellectual disabilities. It is now recognized that even congenitally infected infants who are asymptomatic at birth may develop progressive hearing loss later in life.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0016">Perinatal or postnatal infection with CMV may occur in term and preterm infants as a result of exposure to maternal cervicovaginal secretions during delivery, ingestion of breast milk after delivery, and blood transfusions. In high-risk preterm newborns, morbidity and mortality can be significant, and hepatosplenomegaly, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, atypical lymphocytosis, hemolytic anemia, pneumonitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis have been described.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0017">Although a large proportion of congenital CMV infections are attributed to primary maternal infection in the developed world, studies in resource-poor settings have shown similar rates of sequelae, especially hearing loss, following primary or reactivated maternal infection (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0011">11</link>). Therefore, contrary to past beliefs, preexisting infection and development of CMV antibody in the mother may not eliminate the risk for significant infection in the infant. Thus far, it appears that perinatally or postnatally infected infants do not develop late neurologic sequelae of infection.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0122s0000a0010"/>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0018">CMV infections are frequent and occasionally severe in children or adults with congenital or acquired defects of cellular immunity, such as patients with AIDS, cancer patients (particularly those with leukemia and lymphoma receiving chemotherapy), and recipients of solid-organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Infections in these patients may be due to reactivation of latent virus or primary infection or reinfection with exogenous virus, which may be introduced by blood transfusions or by the grafted organ. Symptoms tend to be most severe after primary infection; however, reactivation infection or reinfection in a severely immunocompromised host may also cause serious illness.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0019">CMV is the most common viral infection in the setting of transplantation, with symptomatic infection developing in 20 to 60% of transplant recipients within the first year posttransplantation. The frequency and severity of CMV infection in stem cell and organ transplant recipients are variable and depend on the type of transplant, the source of the donated organ, the immune status of the recipient, and the duration of the immunosuppressive therapy (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0018">18</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0021">21</link>). In particular, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are at extremely high risk for opportunistic infections due to the degree and duration of immunosuppression administered just prior to and for months after transplantation, and CMV infection is one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality in these patients if not prevented (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0021">21</link>). The highest occurrence of CMV disease is seen in CMV-seronegative recipients receiving a transplanted organ from a CMV-seropositive donor. Active infection usually occurs between 1 and 4 months after transplantation, when patients are at the height of their immunosuppression. The widespread use of antiviral drugs for prophylaxis or preemptive therapy following transplantation has resulted in the emergence of late-onset (&gt;90 days posttransplant) CMV disease (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0022">22</link>). The major symptoms in solid-organ transplant patients represent a nonspecific “viral syndrome” and usually include fever, malaise, lethargy, myalgia or arthralgia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatitis. Tissue-invasive disease is associated with specific organ damage and may lead to pneumonitis in recipients of lung or heart-lung transplants; nephritis in kidney transplant recipients; the development of myocarditis, retinitis, or accelerated vascular damage and atherosclerosis after cardiac transplantation; hepatitis and pancreatitis in liver and pancreas transplant recipients, respectively; and gastrointestinal disease. The most common clinical manifestations in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are pneumonia and gastrointestinal disease. CMV infection in transplant recipients has also been associated with delayed or failed bone marrow engraftment, an increased incidence or severity of graft-versus-host disease, and an increased risk of graft rejection in solid-organ transplants. Death may occur as a result of various complications, including bacterial and fungal superinfections. Untreated CMV infection, particularly when associated with pneumonitis, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0020">In patients infected with HIV, active CMV infection usually occurs with advanced immunosuppression (e.g., CD4<superscript>+</superscript> lymphocyte counts drop below 50 to 100 cells/μl) and is primarily the result of reactivation of latent infection. Retinitis is the most common clinical presentation, with destruction of the retina and damage to the optic nerve without treatment or improvement in the immune system. CMV is also an important cause of fever; gastrointestinal infections including esophagitis, gastritis, enteritis, and ulcerative colitis; encephalitis; and polyradiculomyelopathy. CMV pneumonia is uncommon in the setting of HIV infection. There has been a significant decline in severe CMV disease in AIDS patients with the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0023">23</link>).</para>

      <anchor id="ch0122s0000a0011"/>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0021">Over the years, four antiviral drugs have been licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment and prevention of CMV infections; these include ganciclovir, its prodrug valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0024">24</link>). These drugs target the viral DNA polymerase and affect viral DNA replication. The initial drug of choice is ganciclovir, although valganciclovir is now also widely used as preemptive, curative, and maintenance therapy or for prophylaxis in transplant recipients due to its better bioavailability compared to ganciclovir (see reference <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0025">25</link> for a review). Both drugs can be administered orally or intravenously. Foscarnet and cidofovir are considered second-line therapeutic drugs, used primarily in AIDS patients with CMV retinitis; foscarnet is also used for treating ganciclovir-resistant CMV. All four drugs are associated with significant drug-related toxicities, and drug resistance has emerged over time. Newborns with congenital or perinatal CMV disease may benefit from treatment with ganciclovir or valganciclovir, but experience is limited and additional clinical trials are warranted. The use of antiviral drugs to treat CMV infections in immunocompetent adults is seldom indicated, and further studies are needed in hospitalized, critically ill immunocompetent patients with CMV to determine whether treatment is beneficial. CMV immune globulin is approved by the FDA and has been used in combination with antiviral drugs to treat and prevent disease after organ transplant.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0022">Prevention of CMV disease is preferred to the treatment of established disease in transplant recipients and includes prophylactic and preemptive therapeutic strategies. With prophylactic therapy, antiviral drugs are administered to all transplant recipients at risk for CMV infection and disease, whereas preemptive therapy involves initiating treatment based on the early detection and quantification of CMV in the blood of asymptomatic transplant recipients by using routine surveillance testing performed over time. Both methods are reported to be equally effective for preventing CMV disease in solid-organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0027">27</link>). Debate remains as to which strategy is best, and their use varies by transplant center and from one transplant population to another and depends on the medical approach taken to manage CMV infection and disease.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0023">Novel therapies have been developed, including letermovir (a CMV UL56 terminase inhibitor), maribavir (an oral inhibitor of the CMV UL97 kinase), and brincidofovir (an oral derivative of cidofovir), which have been shown to be more potent than current antiviral drugs against CMV with lesser toxicity (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0028">28</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0030">30</link>). Letermovir was recently FDA approved as an oral drug for the prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant; it has no reported major adverse effects (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0032">32</link>). Maribavir and brincidofovir have been successfully used to treat ganciclovir-resistant CMV infection, while neither drug has shown efficacy in phase III trials for prophylactic use in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Maribavir has been shown to have efficacy similar to that of valganciclovir for preemptive treatment of cytomegalovirus reactivation in recipients of hematopoietic cell or solid-organ transplants (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0033">33</link>). More recently, maribavir has received FDA approval for treatment of refractory CMV infection and disease for solid-organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with and without resistance to ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir in adults and children aged ≥12 years old who weigh ≥35 kg (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0035">35</link>).</para>

The efficacy of these drugs remains to be determined in clinical trials.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0025">Cellular adoptive immunotherapy involving the transfer of CMV-seropositive transplant donor-derived CMV-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes has matured as a novel therapeutic approach to restore immune competence and treat CMV infections that are unresponsive to therapy following solid-organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplants (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0036">36</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0040">40</link>). Adoptive transfer of CMV-specific T cells from third-party donors also has showed promise, resulting in the establishment of cryopreserved third-party donor T-cell banks for off-the-shelf treatment of refractory infections (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0041">41</link>). The efficacy of this treatment modality awaits clinical trials.</para>

These include preparations derived from attenuated or replication-defective viruses or noninfectious virus-like particles, recombinant subunit vaccines, DNA plasmid and mRNA vaccines, or viral-vector gene-based vaccines. The safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines have been demonstrated in phase I clinical trials, and phase II trials have shown promise for an adjuvanted recombinant surface glycoprotein B vaccine, gB/MF59; a DNA vaccine, ASP0113, consisting of plasmids encoding phosphoprotein 65 and glycoprotein B; and an mRNA vaccine, mRNA-1647. Phase III trials are now under way for the ASP0113 and mRNA-1647 vaccines. The mRNA-1647 vaccine combines six mRNAs in one preparation, which encode for subunits that form the membrane-bound pentamer complex (five mRNAs) and the full-length membrane-bound glycoprotein B (one mRNA).</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0027">Asymptomatic excretion with CMV is common, and standard precautions and good personal hygienic practices (e.g., careful hand washing) can help decrease the possibility of transmission. Common disinfectants containing alcohol, detergents, and chlorine are effective in inactivating the virus. Transmission of CMV by blood transfusion or through breast milk can be minimized by using leukoreduced and/or CMV-seronegative blood products or treating breast milk by pasteurization, freezing and thawing, or UV-C irradiation.</para>

EDTA is currently the preferred anticoagulant when using plasma or whole blood for molecular testing, since it is considered the most effective stabilizer of nucleic acids in blood. The optimal frequency of blood collection remains to be established for surveillance of different patient groups, although it is common practice to submit blood specimens once a week while monitoring viral loads during preemptive antiviral therapy (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0020">20</link>). The decision to initiate therapy is based on obtaining positive results during active surveillance. Testing also should be performed when therapy is started, to have an accurate baseline viral load, and viral loads should be followed while monitoring response to therapy, to document clearance of CMV from the blood while on therapy (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0045">45</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0031">There is considerable debate about which blood compartment is best suited for the detection of CMV DNA (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0046">46</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0048">48</link>). Although peripheral blood leukocytes were commonly used in the past, whole blood and plasma are now considered the specimens of choice (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0049">49</link>). Whole blood has been shown to yield the highest levels and most frequent and earliest detection of CMV DNA of all blood compartments examined (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0049">49</link>) and may represent the most practical specimen for laboratories to process for use in the diagnosis and monitoring of CMV disease, since it requires little processing prior to extraction of the DNA and both cell-associated and extracellular viruses can be detected. The choice of extraction platforms and chemistries should be considered when whole blood is processed, as CMV DNA yields may vary depending on the protocols used for isolation of nucleic acids. Also, delays in sample preparation can result in lysis of leukocytes after blood collection, which may result in inaccurate quantitation of CMV DNA if either purified leukocytes or plasma is used as a specimen source (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0050">50</link>). A potential limitation for the use of whole blood is the possibility of variation in leukocyte counts from patient to patient; this may lead to erroneous quantitative measurements if fluctuations in cell numbers are not taken into consideration. Also, detection of low levels of CMV DNA in whole blood may not always correlate with active CMV disease, and persistent DNAemia in whole blood may lead to overtreatment until results are negative or below a defined threshold predictive of a clinical response. Plasma may be preferable in neutropenic patients, who may have inadequate numbers of leukocytes for testing, and may be a better specimen source for predicting CMV disease. Plasma DNAemia also may be a better predictor of relapse at day 21 of treatment than DNAemia in whole blood (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0049">49</link>). When patients are monitored over time, the same specimen type should be used, to minimize the variations observed between different blood compartments.</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0035">As a general rule, blood specimens for molecular amplification should be stored at 4°C immediately after collection and then promptly transported to the laboratory for processing. CMV DNA has been shown to be stable in whole blood when stored for 14 days at 4°C and for up to 21 days at 4°C when plasma is separated from whole blood (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0051">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0052">52</link>). These findings were consistent over a wide range of CMV DNA concentrations. Single-use aliquots of processed specimens should be placed in multiple cryovials for testing and storage. When they are processed in this manner, specimens are not frozen and thawed repeatedly and are never returned to the original specimen cryovial, thereby avoiding possible degradation of the DNA and cross-contamination of specimens, respectively. If not tested immediately, specimens should be promptly frozen and stored at –70°C or colder.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0036">For prenatal diagnosis of congenital CMV infection, collection of amniotic fluid has largely replaced chorionic villus sampling or cordocentesis to collect fetal blood. Amniotic fluid should be collected after 21 to 23 weeks of fetal gestation and at least 6 to 8 weeks from the estimated onset of maternal infection for best sensitivity (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0053">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0054">54</link>). Neonatal blood collected at birth and dried on paper (e.g., Guthrie cards) as blood spots has been described for neonatal screening and for retrospective diagnosis in patients beyond the neonatal period with a clinical suspicion of congenital CMV infection (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0055">55</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0057">57</link>). However, dried blood spots and blood in general are not as sensitive as urine or saliva for newborn screening. Dried blood spots have also been used for rapid genotyping of CMV strains in congenitally infected newborns (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0058">58</link>) and for quantification of CMV DNA in solid-organ transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0059">59</link>). Both liquid- and dried-saliva specimens have proven useful for sensitive and specific detection of CMV DNA in newborns (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0060">60</link>). For diagnosis of congenital infection in the neonate, samples of saliva, urine, or both collected within the first 3 weeks of life should be used (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0054">54</link>). Saliva specimens (rather than urine) are now considered the most convenient sample type to collect and have been shown to be as reliable as urine for detection of CMV DNA for effective screening of neonates for congenital CMV infection and sensorineural hearing loss. The use of saliva pools of 10 to 20 samples for detection of congenital CMV infection by PCR may prove useful for screening on a larger scale (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0061">61</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0062">62</link>). CMV shed in the breast milk of CMV-seropositive women may contribute to false-positive results for PCR testing of saliva, although the false-positive rates are low at 0.03 to 0.14% (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0063">63</link>). Collect saliva specimens by swabbing the buccal mucosa (inner lining of cheeks and lips) and gingiva (gums) on both sides of the mouth; allow the swab to sit for 10 to 15 s between the cheek and gum to absorb additional saliva. Wait more than 1 h after the mother has breastfed to collect saliva samples, to decrease the likelihood of CMV contamination, and any positive results on saliva should be confirmed by CMV detection in urine (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0064">64</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0039">CMV can be isolated from a variety of body fluids and tissues; however, urine, respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, throat washings, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid), and anticoagulated whole blood (leukocytes) are most common for diagnostic purposes.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0040">Urine specimens should be clean-voided specimens. Because excretion of CMV in urine is intermittent, increased recovery of the virus is possible by processing more than one specimen. Adjustment of urine specimens to pH 7.0 with 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N HCl is recommended to reduce toxicity to cell cultures. Centrifuging urine specimens to obtain sediment-enriched samples has been advocated but is usually unnecessary and may produce toxicity more frequently than do uncentrifuged urine samples.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0041">Blood leukocyte cultures have been used in the evaluation of immunocompromised patients. Detection of CMV in leukocytes is often a better indicator of symptomatic CMV infection than is shedding of virus in urine or respiratory secretions, although the sensitivity of cultures from blood is inadequate in comparison to that of molecular methods or the antigenemia assay. Fresh blood collected in the presence of heparin, sodium citrate, acid citrate dextrose, or EDTA may be used. A number of procedures for obtaining peripheral blood leukocytes have been described. However, density gradient centrifugation with either Ficoll-Hypaque or a mixture of sodium metrizoate and dextran 500 is most suitable for a clinical laboratory. Both mononuclear cells and granulocytes are efficiently separated from erythrocytes in a single step. The procedure is rapid and easy to perform, and the reagents are commercially available. Compared with traditional sedimentation methods, the technique results in a greater number of virus isolates and an increased yield of infectious foci or plaques. Alternatively, a direct lysis procedure may be used (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0068">68</link>), although a reduced ability to culture CMV following direct erythrocyte lysis has been observed.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0042">Bronchial washings and tissue biopsy and autopsy specimens, particularly of lungs, kidneys, spleen, liver, brain, the gastrointestinal tract, and retinas, also can be processed for virus isolation. Recovery of CMV from tissues is strong evidence for organ involvement. All tissue specimens should be placed in a suitable viral transport medium immediately after collection.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0043">Since CMV loses infectivity when subjected to freezing and thawing, specimens for virus isolation should be kept at 4°C in an ice-water bath or refrigerator until they can be used to inoculate cultures, preferably within a few hours after collection. When prolonged transport times are unavoidable, infectivity is reasonably well preserved for at least 48 h at 4°C. In general, it is never a good idea to hold specimens for CMV isolation at room temperature, and specimens should be transported to the laboratory as quickly as possible after collection to maintain viability of the virus. If freezing the specimen is necessary, an equal volume of 0.4 M sucrose-phosphate added to the specimen helps preserve viral infectivity. All frozen specimens should be stored at –70°C or colder or in liquid nitrogen. Loss of virus infectivity occurs if specimens are stored at –20°C. All specimens are treated with antibiotics before inoculation of cell cultures.</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0044">Single serum specimens for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing are useful in screening for evidence of past infection with CMV and for identifying individuals at risk for CMV infection. This approach is especially helpful in testing sera from solid-organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant donors and recipients before transplantation to determine their baseline CMV immune status, as part of the pretransplant assessment, and from donors of blood products that are to be administered to premature infants or hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Also, knowing the immune status of women prior to conception may be helpful in identifying individuals who may be most susceptible to primary CMV infection following pregnancy. Serologic screening of collected sera for other pathogens that may cause similar infections<emphasis>in utero</emphasis> or during the birth process (e.g., other members of the TORCH complex such as <emphasis>Toxoplasma gondii, Treponema pallidum</emphasis>, hepatitis B virus, rubella virus, and herpes simplex virus) may be done together with CMV antibody testing. Testing for HIV, Zika virus, varicella-zoster virus, and parvovirus B19 also may be included depending on the clinical scenario.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0045">For serologic diagnosis of recent CMV infection, detection of IgM in a single serum specimen may be beneficial, or paired sera should be obtained at least 2 weeks apart for testing for IgG antibody. The acute-phase serum sample should be collected as soon as possible after onset of illness and tested simultaneously with the convalescent-phase serum sample. If congenital infection is suspected, specimens from mother, fetus, and newborn can be submitted for the evaluation of IgG and IgM antibodies for the detection of prenatal, natal, and postnatal CMV infections. When testing for IgM in the fetus, blood should be collected after 22 weeks of gestation, since fetal synthesis of antibodies starts at 20 weeks of gestation and may not reach detectable levels for 1 to 2 more weeks.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0046">Processed serum specimens may be stored at 2 to 8°C for several days pending the completion of testing or can be stored frozen at –20°C or colder for more extended periods of time. Repeat freezing and thawing should be avoided, and specimens should not be stored in frost-free freezers.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0047">Testing saliva or oral fluids for CMV-specific antibodies has been previously suggested as a noninvasive alternative to the collection of blood from children, although neither specimen is routinely used in this setting. In patients with CMV neurologic disease, CSF may be tested for viral antibody if paired with a serum specimen collected on or close to the same date. However, the yield of such testing is low and limited by delays in intrathecal production of virus-specific antibody and passive transfer of serum antibodies across a damaged blood-brain barrier. As a general rule, screening for CMV-specific IgG and/or IgM antibodies to diagnose congenital CMV infection and antibody testing of CSF for the diagnosis of CMV neurologic disease have limited utility and have been largely replaced by more direct methods, like PCR.</para>

The number of cells is adjusted to 2.0 to 2.5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> per reaction for use in the assay. For the QuantiFERON-CMV assay, a total of 1.0 ml of whole blood is collected into each of three tubes that contain either CMV antigens, phytohemagglutinin (a mitogen) as the positive control, or only heparin as the negative control, dried on the inner wall of the individual tubes. The blood is vigorously mixed by shaking for 5 s to ensure that the entire inner surface of each tube has been coated with blood, and the tubes are then immediately stored at 37°C for 16 to 24 h to stimulate cells before processing by centrifugation to obtain plasma for testing. For assays that use flow cytometry to measure functional analysis of immune cells using intracellular cytokine staining or staining of antigen-specific receptor-carrying T lymphocytes, either whole blood or purified PBMCs can be used. A total of 2 to 3 ml of whole blood is used for assays that measure intracellular synthesis of ATP in stimulated CD4<superscript>+</superscript> T cells.</para>

The nuclear inclusion has the appearance of an “owl’s eye” because it has marginated chromatin that is typically surrounded by a clear halo that extends to the nuclear membrane. The presence of characteristic cytologic changes seen by histopathologic testing suggests CMV infection and, while less sensitive than molecular methods like PCR, is more predictive of disease, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, and correlates with active disease in most cases. Overall, histopathologic diagnosis of CMV disease involves time and labor and is relatively insensitive, and since CMV can infect tissues without producing morphologic changes, failure to find typical cytomegalic cells does not exclude the possibility of CMV infection; additional virologic or serologic confirmation is suggested.</para>

For years, the detection of CMV in intestinal mucosal epithelium or lung tissue by immunohistochemistry has been considered an important part of the evaluation of solid-organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with gastrointestinal symptoms or pneumonia, particularly given that viral loads in blood may be undetectable or low in these clinical settings. A major obstacle to tissue diagnosis of CMV is the need to perform invasive procedures to obtain biopsy specimens for testing. Consequently, tissue biopsies are not always obtained, and finding CMV in blood by antigen or nucleic acid detection is often used as a substitute to support the clinical suspicion of tissue-invasive disease.</para>

The procedure has also been used to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral therapy, to predict treatment failure and the development of viral resistance, and to prompt the institution of preemptive therapy in these patient groups.

Also, in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of the CMV antigenemia assay was assessed and the test sensitivity was found to be low, as the assay missed 35% of PCR-proven CMV infections (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0074">74</link>).

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0054">Over the years, molecular amplification assays have progressively replaced the antigenemia assay and other nonmolecular direct detection tests for the diagnosis and monitoring of CMV infections. PCR is the most preferred and widely used molecular method for the detection of CMV DNA and mRNAs, and the sensitivity and specificity of PCR for diagnosis of active CMV infection have been evaluated (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0075">75</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0079">79</link>). Amplification has been performed with a variety of primer pairs from regions of genes encoding the immediate early antigen (UL122-123 locus), the major immediate early antigen (UL122-123 locus), DNA polymerase (UL54), glycoproteins B (UL55) and H (UL75), pp65 (UL83), pp67 (UL65), US17, HXFL4, the EcoRI D fragment, the HindIII X fragment, the pp150 tegument protein (UL32), and the major capsid protein (UL86) and the junction between glycoprotein B and major immediate early antigen genes. Based on published literature, the most common targets for CMV PCR include glycoprotein B, the immediate early antigen, the major immediate early antigen, and US17 genes, followed by the pp65 and polymerase genes. Not all primers are equally sensitive in amplifying CMV DNA, and in several studies, the sensitivity of the assay was increased by amplifying genomic regions from both the immediate early and the late CMV genes or by using nested primers specific to a single gene fragment. The use of both gene fragments enabled the detection of a variety of clinical isolates, indicating that strain variability is not a limiting factor for PCR diagnosis of CMV. PCR has been used successfully to detect CMV DNA in a variety of clinical specimens from transplant recipients, patients with AIDS, and infants with congenital infection. It also has been used for the continued surveillance of immunocompromised patients and for evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of antiviral drugs.</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0055">Of concern with PCR for CMV diagnosis is whether the test can distinguish between active disease and asymptomatic infection or latency. CMV DNAemia is considered to be the best predictor of CMV disease, and CMV DNA has been successfully detected in whole blood, purified peripheral blood leukocytes, plasma, and serum by PCR. However, PCR is extremely sensitive, and the qualitative detection of CMV DNA in these specimens has limited value in predicting symptomatic disease and in monitoring the success of antiviral therapy in immunocompromised patients. CMV DNA can be detected in blood by PCR in the absence of disease and can be found for weeks or months after successful therapy of symptomatic patients (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0080">80</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0082">82</link>). However, there are clinical settings in which qualitative PCR appears to be useful, including in the use of saliva, urine, tissue, amniotic fluid, or fetal blood for diagnosis of congenital CMV infection, for the detection of CMV in the CSF of HIV-infected patients with encephalitis and other neurologic manifestations, and for testing the aqueous or vitreous humor in patients with CMV retinitis. Also, a negative result from qualitative PCR of blood has a high negative predictive value for excluding systemic CMV disease and has been used over the years as an initial screen of blood specimens before quantifying CMV DNA from only those samples that are positive. However, the recent commercial availability of highly sensitive quantitative molecular assays most likely eliminates any need for qualitative testing of blood specimens.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0056">Qualitative PCR can also be used on fresh, unfixed tissue specimens from immunocompromised patients with suspected localized or compartmentalized tissue-invasive disease. However, careful consideration should be given to whether detection of CMV by highly sensitive molecular methods truly represents active infection of the organ or possible latent infection or contamination with virus from infected extracellular fluids that bathe the tissue. A negative qualitative PCR would suggest the absence of CMV tissue-invasive infection, although results should be interpreted with caution due to potential technical limitations of the quantity and quality of DNA extracted from tissue, depending on the procedures used. Positive qualitative results may not be significant and should be correlated with clinical and histopathologic findings and detection of CMV viremia, DNAemia, or antigenemia in blood. In this regard,<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization or immunohistochemical staining may be helpful in localizing the virus within the tissue. More recently, CMV PCR on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues was shown to be a useful adjunct to immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of tissue-invasive disease (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0083">83</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0084">84</link>) and can provide a more specific diagnosis than performing CMV PCR on fresh, unfixed tissue. Likewise, negative results on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues would not exclude CMV, due to the added challenges of extracting nucleic acids from this sample type.</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0057">Similar to the antigenemia assay, measuring the level of CMV DNA (e.g., CMV viral load) in blood appears to be necessary to predict and diagnose CMV disease in immunocompromised hosts (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0072">72</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0073">73</link>). Consequently, a number of quantitative molecular assays have been developed over the years and have included target and signal amplification methods. Most laboratories now use quantitative real-time PCR (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0085">85</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0091">91</link>) because it allows detection of amplified nucleic acids as they accumulate, and technological advances have provided rapid and accurate quantification over a dynamic range of orders of magnitude, using a variety of different chemistries and platforms. Also, quantitative assays for CMV can be multiplexed with tests for other herpesviruses for simultaneous monitoring following transplantation (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0092">92</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0093">93</link>). It has been shown that transplant recipients and AIDS patients with active CMV disease have higher levels of CMV DNA and that a rapid rise in the CMV DNA copy number correlates with the presence of symptoms and drug failure during treatment (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0094">94</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0097">97</link>). Also, Rasmussen et al. (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0098">98</link>) have determined that quantitation of CMV DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes can be used to identify HIV-infected patients at risk for development of symptomatic CMV retinitis. It has also been determined that immunocompromised patients with CMV disease have more CMV DNA in either whole blood, plasma, or leukocyte fractions than do patients without disease, but that the level of CMV DNA in whole blood or leukocytes is higher than that in plasma (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0094">94</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0099">99</link>). Quantitation of CMV in plasma, therefore, may be less sensitive for monitoring CMV infection, although a positive result may correlate better with active disease.</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0058">As in the antigenemia assay, absolute CMV DNA levels or threshold values for predicting symptomatic disease and initiating preemptive therapy have not been fully elucidated and may differ by specimen type and testing platform selected and from one laboratory and patient population to another. It is currently more important to monitor the relative changes in DNA levels from serial blood specimens collected over time and tested using the same assay and specimen type. If desired, specific cutoff levels should be prospectively determined based on the assay and specimen used and the type of patients being monitored. Because of the high sensitivity of PCR and depending upon the cutoff value selected, the positive predictive value for symptomatic CMV disease may vary and may affect clinical decision-making and the initiation and length of antiviral therapy.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0059">Quantitative PCR methods have been used for the estimation of CMV DNA levels in urine, saliva, amniotic fluid, dried blood spots, and CSF of CMV-infected patients (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0053">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0059">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0100">100</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0101">101</link>), but more research is needed to assess the clinical relevance of quantitating CMV DNA from these specimens. It has been shown that the prognosis of congenital CMV infection may be directly related to the amount of CMV in the urine and/or saliva of an infected neonate, that measurements of CMV DNA in the blood and urine of a pregnant woman may be predictive of transmission to the fetus, that quantitating CMV DNA in the CSF of AIDS patients may help determine if disorders of the central nervous system are attributable more to CMV than to the direct effects of HIV or other opportunistic pathogens, and that measuring the CMV viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens may be an appropriate and less invasive way to diagnose CMV pneumonia in immunocompromised patients (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0067">67</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0060">In general, real-time PCR assays for the detection and quantification of CMV DNA are sensitive, specific, and reproducible and significantly reduce the time necessary to report results that may have an impact on the care and management of patients. The method offers the distinct advantages of being less technically demanding and less expensive to perform than more conventional assays, and quality reagents and automated instruments for nucleic acid extraction and amplification and detection are readily available and greatly improve the potential for standardization and increased accuracy of results. The assays also require a lower specimen volume for testing and can be easily performed on neutropenic patients with low leukocyte counts. The DNA is stable during extended specimen transport and storage times, and large numbers of specimens can be efficiently processed. Furthermore, the overall risk of amplicon contamination has been greatly minimized, as real-time platforms are closed systems.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0061">Various commercial real-time qualitative and quantitative PCR assays are now available as either analyte-specific reagents or packaged as complete kits (<anchor id="ch0122s0000a0035"/><link linkend="ch0122s0000a0036">Table 2</link>). However, many real-time PCR assays for CMV have been developed in the laboratory by the end user and differ in many parameters, including the types and volumes of specimens used; the collection, transport, processing, and storage of the specimens; the nucleic acid target selected; the choice and design of suitable oligonucleotide primers and probes; optimization of specimen extraction and PCR amplification conditions; the controls and calibration standards used; the method chosen to detect and/or quantify the amplified product; the upper and lower limits of detection and quantification; the accuracy and precision; and the quantitative units of measure and viral loads reported from one laboratory and method to another. Many of the assays require additional validation, and there is a definite need for traceable and commutable international reference materials that include both standards and controls for institutional comparison of results, since significant variability in CMV quantification has been observed between laboratories (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0102">102</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0105">105</link>). To this end, the first international CMV standard was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010 and is available from the National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls in the United Kingdom as NIBSC code 09/162. The standard is whole virus prepared from the CMV Merlin strain, and the material was initially evaluated in a worldwide collaborative study involving 32 laboratories performing a range of molecular amplification assays for CMV (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0106">106</link>). Secondary reference materials calibrated against this standard now can be purchased from commercial manufacturers, and a second standard reference material (SRM 2366a) has been made available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0107">107</link>). This reference standard is composed of a bacterial artificial chromosome carrying the complete virus genome of the Towne strain of CMV. Use of these standard reference materials and the recommended reporting of viral loads in international units per milliliter have allowed improved interassay agreement among different laboratories using different quantitative molecular assays (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0108">108</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0111">111</link>) and should facilitate the establishment of defined testing algorithms and cutoff values that predict clinical disease and improve management and outcomes in CMV-infected patients (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0112">112</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0115">115</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0062">Several commercial quantitative assays have been developed using these international standards and have been licensed by the FDA, including the Abbott RealT<emphasis>ime</emphasis> CMV assay, QIAGEN <emphasis>artus</emphasis> CMV RGQ MDx and <emphasis>artus</emphasis> CMV QS-RGQ MDx kits, Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan CMV Test, and Roche COBAS CMV test for use on the COBAS 4800 and 6800/8800 automated systems (<link linkend="ch0122s0000a0036">Table 2</link>). The tests are performed on automated platforms, and results are expressed in international units per milliliter. The level of agreement between assays has been shown to be high across different laboratories during evaluations of these systems. Although the development of international standards and the greater availability of commercial assays have definitely helped harmonize CMV viral load testing and reporting, the interlaboratory variability has not been completely eliminated and is thought to be due to assay design and to various analytical factors apart from universal standards that are traceable and commutable (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0105">105</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0108">108</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0116">116</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0120">120</link>). These include a possible matrix effect on the commutability of the CMV WHO international standard when it is diluted and processed in plasma or whole blood as the specimen type (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0120">120</link>) for use in quantitative measurements; the size and extraction efficiency of the CMV DNA target amplified (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0117">117</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0121">121</link>); and the appropriate calibration and processing of secondary reference calibrators traceable to the WHO international standard (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0106">106</link>). In plasma specimens, for instance, accurate quantification of CMV DNA has been reported to be affected by the size of the specific target amplified in different quantitative assays, with smaller DNA targets (≤86 base pairs) yielding higher quantities than larger targets (≥105 base pairs) (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0117">117</link>). This is likely due to the fact that most CMV DNA in plasma is in a biological form that is exclusively free from infected host cells and virus particles and primarily consists of small fragments (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0122">122</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0123">123</link>). Also, depending on the extraction method, quantitative assays have varied extraction efficiencies for small DNA fragments that can contribute to the variability in viral load determinations (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0121">121</link>). These observations have significant implications for the design and development of harmonized assays for accurate CMV quantification across all testing centers. The agreement between laboratories should continue to improve as individual laboratories move away from laboratory-developed quantitative assays that use varied methods and instruments, and adopt commercially available kits and platforms that use the same specimen type and standard procedures and controls with improved assay designs.</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0068">Digital PCR has been developed as a quantitative method, and the clinical utility of this assay for the accurate quantification of CMV from plasma specimens has been demonstrated in several studies (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0124">124</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0127">127</link>). Digital PCR is similar to quantitative real-time PCR in that the same reaction components and amplification conditions are used, but they differ in how the amplified target is measured. The assay is performed by partitioning a sample reaction mixture into thousands of smaller picoliter- or nanoliter-scale individual PCRs and is based on the assumption that partitioning of the sample will follow a Poisson distribution, resulting in individual reactions with either a single target molecule or no target at all. Reaction mixtures that contain a target molecule will amplify and show positive fluorescence during PCR, while reactions with no target will be negative. Following PCR, the negative and positive reactions are counted, and the results are used to calculate the number of copies of target in the sample based on Poisson statistical analysis. Digital PCR has the major advantages of offering absolute quantification of CMV DNA without the requirement for well-characterized and highly calibrated reference standards or the need for a calibration curve to facilitate measurements of viral load. The assay is accurate and has improved inter- and intralaboratory precision over that of current quantitative methods (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0128">128</link>). It is less affected by poor amplification efficiency and interfering substances that may be present in clinical specimens (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0125">125</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0129">129</link>) and can be readily multiplexed by varying the concentrations of primers and probes or the type of fluorophores used for different viral targets. Digital PCR has been applied to the quantification of various DNA and RNA viruses, particularly those with no available reference standards; to the accurate quantification of viral targets with high sequence variability and on specimens containing inhibitors; and for the verification and accurate calibration of secondary reference standards used in quantitative assays, such as those for CMV (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0128">128</link>). However, digital PCR does not appear to be as sensitive as real-time PCR for quantitative detection of CMV, and further optimization is required (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0125">125</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0069">Several digital PCR platforms are commercially available and differ primarily in how individual reactions are partitioned, using either water-oil emulsion droplets or microchip-based arrays. They include the QX ONE, QX200 AutoDG, and QX200 Droplet digital PCR systems (Bio-Rad); Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3D and Absolute Q Digital PCR systems (ThermoFisher Scientific); QIAcuity One, Four, and Eight digital PCR systems (QIAGEN); and the BioMark HD System (Fluidigm Corporation). None of the commercial systems has been approved by the FDA to date for quantification of CMV. Limited data currently exist in support of digital PCR for CMV viral load testing, and studies comparing digital PCR to the existing FDA-approved quantitative real-time PCR systems for measurements of CMV viral load are needed to better understand the applicability and use of this newer technology in clinical laboratories. Thus, despite advances in the methods and instruments for digital PCR over the years, the practical advantages of using digital PCR over quantitative PCR for measurements of CMV viral load remain unclear.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0070">More recently, quantitative metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has been developed and evaluated for its ability to detect and longitudinally monitor viral loads of CMV and other DNA viruses in transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0130">130</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0132">132</link>). The Galileo Pathogen Solution assay developed by Arc Bio, LLC, Cambridge, MA, is a combination of integrated reagents and bioinformatics pipeline that appears promising for the simultaneous detection and quantification of 10 common and opportunistic transplant-related DNA viruses from plasma, including CMV, adenovirus, BK virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesviruses 6A and 6B, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, JC virus, and varicella-zoster virus. It is a kit-based approach to create a sample-to-result mNGS workflow which includes reagents needed for DNA extraction, full library construction, and removal of host nucleic acid; internal and external process controls and calibration controls to generate calibration curves; and cloud-based software for bioinformatics analysis and reporting of results. Although targeted quantitative PCR assays are generally considered to be more sensitive than mNGS and are preferred for CMV detection and monitoring, the limits of detection and quantification and the precision, linearity, and technical performance of the Galileo Pathogen Solution mNGS test have been shown to be equivalent to those of quantitative PCR (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0131">131</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0132">132</link>). It has also been demonstrated that the Galileo Viral Panel Solution mNGS has an analytical and clinical performance comparable to that of current quantitative PCR-based assays with respect to trends in viral load over time and clinical thresholds for initiation of treatment (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0130">130</link>). A major advantage of this method is its comprehensive approach to the simultaneous detection and quantification of all coinfecting transplantation-related viruses that may cause primary or reactivated infections in an immunosuppressed transplant recipient. Therefore, it eliminates the need to query individual transplant pathogens independently using multiple single-target quantitative PCR assays. The assay format also has a simplified design for user-friendly implementation and performance in clinical laboratories. Disadvantages include additional costs, time, labor, and technical and computational expertise for mNGS compared to quantitative PCR. Also, the assay is currently available for research use only, and the method takes 48 h to complete from start to finish. Competing mNGS technologies are currently available as an orderable service in select commercial reference laboratories to detect and quantify CMV and other pathogens from plasma cell-free DNA (e.g., Karius, Redwood City, CA) and respiratory secretions (e.g., IDbyDNA, San Francisco, CA).</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0071">mNGS of maternal cell-free DNA in plasma has also recently been used for the detection and quantification of CMV DNA during pregnancy as part of noninvasive prenatal screening (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0133">133</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0134">134</link>). Interestingly, in the study by Peddu and colleagues (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0133">133</link>), use of mNGS highlighted the fragmented nature of cell-free CMV DNA in plasma and illustrated the promise of plasma cell-free DNA sequencing for quantifying viral loads through accurate detection of short fragment lengths of CMV DNA that might otherwise go unrecognized by different quantitative PCR assays.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0072">Ultimately, the clinical utility of these assays depends on their accuracy, reproducibility, precision, ease of use, cost, availability, and predictive value. Molecular methods, however, are now considered to be invaluable additions to the analytical tools already being used to provide a rapid diagnosis of established CMV disease, identify patients at risk of developing disease, assess the progression of disease and the risk of relapse, direct the initiation of preemptive therapy, monitor the response to therapy, predict viral resistance and treatment failure, and define when antiviral susceptibility testing should be performed to identify emerging CMV resistance.</para>

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0073">Culture systems for the isolation of CMV from clinical specimens include conventional tube cultures and spin-amplification shell vial assays. Although cultures are still performed in some large academic medical centers, public health laboratories, and research facilities, their clinical utility for CMV is limited, owing to the much better overall performance and ease of use of newer and more efficient molecular detection methods. Isolation of CMV in cell culture may have importance for specific circumstances such as antiviral drug and vaccine development, detection and analysis of drug-resistant isolates, and to better understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the virus. Otherwise, most clinical laboratories no longer routinely perform CMV cultures for diagnostic testing.</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0074">Human fibroblasts best support the growth of CMV and therefore are used for diagnostic purposes. Acceptable fibroblast cultures include those prepared from human embryonic tissues or foreskins and serially passaged diploid human fetal lung strains, such as MRC-5, WI-38, or IMR-90. Diploid fibroblast cells should be used at a low passage number, since they may become less susceptible to CMV infection with increasing cell generations. Several of these fibroblast cell lines are commercially available.</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0075">Isolation of CMV in conventional tube cultures is traditionally performed by inoculating clinical specimens into prepared monolayers of fibroblast cells adhered to the inside of glass or plastic test tubes. Following inoculation, the cells are incubated at 37°C and observed for viral growth. Replication of CMV is usually recognized solely on the basis of its characteristic cytopathic effect (CPE) in the inoculated cells. Tubes are examined for CPE for at least 4 weeks for most specimens (6 weeks for peripheral blood leukocyte specimens).</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0076">The time of appearance and the extent of CPE depend on the amounts of virus present in specimens. In cultures inoculated with urine from a congenitally infected newborn, CPE may develop by 24 h and progress rapidly to involve most of the monolayer if the virus titer in the urine is extremely high. More commonly, foci of CPE, consisting of enlarged, rounded, refractile cells, appear during the first week, and progression of CPE to surrounding cells proceeds slowly and usually appears within 2 weeks for inoculated specimens obtained from older children and adults (<anchor id="ch0122s0000a0047"/><link linkend="ch0122s0000a0046">Fig. 2</link>). Leukocyte cultures may not become positive until after 3 to 6 weeks. Suspected CMV isolates are best confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that are available from various commercial sources. The appearance of typical nuclear fluorescence of infected cells indicates the presence of CMV. PCR or other molecular amplification methods also can be used for confirmation of suspected isolates.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0077">Major limitations of conventional tube cell cultures include the slow growth and lack of sensitivity for the isolation of CMV, particularly when culturing leukocytes purified from whole blood. The method also requires considerable time, resources, and skilled labor and special facilities to complete. Positive cultures for CMV are highly specific for infection but are not always predictive of disease. Negative cultures do not rule out the possibility of CMV infection.</para>

The technique is based on the amplification of virus in fibroblast cell cultures after low-speed centrifugation at 700 ×<emphasis>g</emphasis> for 40 min at 25°C, followed by incubation at 37°C for 16 to 24 h, and detects viral antigens produced early in the replication of CMV, before the development of CPE. Cell monolayers are seeded on 12-mm-diameter round coverslips inside 3.7-ml (1-dram) flat-bottomed shell vials or in individual wells of multiwell cell culture plates. Even low titers of virus present in specimens are easily amplified and rapidly detected within 24 h. Fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies are commercially available and are used for the detection of CMV early antigens. Stained coverslips are viewed by immunofluorescence microscopy; positive cells contain yellow to apple-green, fluorescent nuclei against a red cytoplasmic background (<anchor id="ch0122s0000a0050"/><link linkend="ch0122s0000a0052">Fig. 3</link> A and B).</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0079">The spin amplification shell vial assay has the important features of being rapid, sensitive, and specific, but requires time, resources, skilled technical personnel, and specialized culture facilities to complete. Close attention to the quality of specimens, monolayers, and reagents is also required for optimum performance. Similar to conventional tube cultures, negative spin amplification shell vial cultures do not rule out CMV infection, and positive cultures, although specific for CMV infection, are not always predictive of disease.</para>

In deciding which test to perform, one should consider such factors as the number of specimens to be tested, the patient population, cost, turnaround time, equipment needs, and ease of performance. The method that is chosen depends on the needs of individual laboratories and whether the assays are being used for screening or diagnosis of CMV infection. For small-volume laboratories, IFA may be more cost-effective and practical, while enzyme immunoassays (EIA) may be more suitable for laboratories with higher volumes of specimens. Overall, detection of CMV-specific IgM or determination of a seroconversion from a negative to a positive IgG antibody response can be useful for the diagnosis of primary CMV infection in certain clinical settings, and the screening of blood and organ donors and recipients plays an important role in accessing the risk of transmission of latent CMV to patients at high risk for severe CMV disease and guiding preventive strategies. General descriptions of various immunoassays used for the detection and differentiation of antibody responses can be found in <ulink url="ch0024#ch0024s0001">chapter 9</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>.</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0081">Over the years, solid-phase EIAs have largely replaced other traditional methods for detecting antibodies to CMV. The assay format is versatile and easy to use and can be readily automated. The main advantages of the EIA are that it is rapid, sensitive, and specific and the method provides an objective readout and interpretation of results. In addition, multiple specimens can be handled daily at a relatively low cost. Kits that detect CMV IgG are available from a number of commercial sources (<anchor id="ch0122s0000a0055"/><link linkend="ch0122s0000a0058">Table 3</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0083">Indirect and anticomplement IFAs are commonly used methods for detecting CMV antibodies. Virus-infected cells that have been fixed to a glass microscope slide are used to capture CMV-specific antibodies from test serum. Antibody-antigen complexes are then detected using either a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-human immunoglobulin antibody or an exogenous source of complement and anticomplement antibody conjugated with fluorescein and fluorescence microscopy. Anticomplement IFA amplifies the fluorescent signal above what can be seen using an indirect IFA, allowing the detection of small amounts of virus-specific antibody or antibodies of low avidity. IFAs are useful and inexpensive methods that offer the advantages of speed and simplicity for the qualitative and quantitative detection of CMV antibodies. Commercial kits are readily available, or antigen-coated slides and labeled secondary antibodies can be purchased separately (<link linkend="ch0122s0000a0058">Table 3</link>). The major disadvantages of IFA systems are that they require a fluorescence microscope and darkroom for examining slides and that extensive training is needed to read and interpret the test results.</para>

The procedures are essentially the same as those used to detect IgG antibodies, except that anti-human IgM antibodies labeled with suitable markers are used to detect CMV-specific IgM bound to viral antigens on the solid phase. A recognized pitfall of CMV IgM assays is the occurrence of false-positive and false-negative reactions. False-positive reactions occur when sera contain unusually high levels of rheumatoid factor in the presence of specific CMV IgG. Rheumatoid factor is an immunoglobulin, usually of the IgM class, that reacts with IgG. It is produced in some rheumatologic, vasculitic, and viral diseases, including CMV infection. IgM rheumatoid factor forms a complex with IgG that may contain CMV-specific IgG. The CMV IgG binds to CMV antigen, carrying nonviral IgM with it; in this setting, a test designed to detect IgM will produce a false-positive result. False-negative reactions occur if high levels of specific IgG antibodies competitively block the binding of IgM to CMV antigen. Therefore, it is highly recommended to separate IgM and IgG fractions before testing to decrease the incidence of both false-positive and false-negative IgM test results. Rapid and simple methods for the removal of interfering rheumatoid factor and IgG molecules from serum have been developed and incorporated into the procedures of commercially available IFA and EIA kits, which has resulted in more reliable CMV IgM tests. The development and use of recombinant-derived CMV proteins as a source of antigenic substrate also have greatly improved the performance of IgM assays.</para>

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0088">Although the detection of CMV-specific IgM may be beneficial in the determination of recent or active infection, the results should be interpreted with caution. Because IgM does not cross the placenta, a positive result from a single serum specimen from an infected newborn is diagnostic. However, there may be a lack of or delay in production of IgM in the newborn. Testing for the presence of CMV-specific IgM antibody beyond the newborn period is usually not recommended, since IgM antibody can appear in both primary and reactivated CMV infections and can persist for extended periods after a primary infection. This complicates the interpretation of test results, particularly for pregnant women or immunocompromised patients, and may not be indicative of recent or active infection. The detection of CMV-specific IgM in maternal serum is not indicative of virus transmission to the fetus, since fewer than 10% of pregnant women who are positive for CMV IgM actually give birth to a congenitally infected infant. Like newborns, immunocompromised individuals also may have a delay in IgM production or may be unable to mount a significant IgM antibody response. Lastly, false-positive CMV IgM results may occur due to the production of cross-reactive heterologous antibody responses to other herpesviruses (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0137">137</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0139">139</link>), depending on the specificity of the assay selected for testing. Therefore, the diagnosis of acute CMV infection should not be based primarily on the reactivity of an IgM test, and the accuracy of the result should be confirmed using additional methods.</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0090">Commercial CMV-specific IgG avidity assays are available (<link linkend="ch0122s0000a0058">Table 3</link>), and the tests are performed primarily by making simple modifications to conventional EIA protocols (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0140">140</link>). In the assays, separate aliquots of a serum sample are reacted in parallel with CMV-specific antigens bound to a solid phase, and either urea (preferred), potassium thiocyanate, or guanidine chloride is used as a denaturant on one of the sample aliquots to preferentially dissociate and differentiate the weaker binding strength of low-avidity antibody-antigen reactions from the more strongly bound high-avidity antibody-antigen reactions. The avidity of CMV-specific IgG in the sample is determined based on the differences in optical density values measured between the two sample aliquots tested and is expressed as an avidity index. Most of the available IgG avidity kits are formatted as EIAs, although one has been designed as an immunoblot assay (Mikrogen Diagnostik, Neuried, Germany). Some of the reagent kits can be purchased in the United States, but none are FDA approved for clinical use, and none of the IgG avidity assays on automated platforms are available in the United States.</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0091">Various studies (53, 140–142) have provided convincing evidence that in a pregnant woman suspected of having a CMV infection, finding low-avidity CMV-specific IgG antibody in combination with a positive CMV IgM result is reliable evidence for primary infection and an increased risk of<emphasis>in utero</emphasis> transmission to the fetus, whereas detection of high-avidity CMV IgG in the presence of a positive CMV IgM result most likely indicates reactivation or a past infection (<anchor id="ch0122s0000a0064"/><link linkend="ch0122s0000a0066">Table 4</link>). The maturation of IgG avidity has been shown to progress gradually from low avidity for the first 3 to 4 months following infection to high avidity by 5 to 6 months after infection, with a transition period of 1 to 2 months between, in which intermediate avidity index values may be observed. Therefore, finding high-avidity CMV IgG in a pregnant woman during the first trimester would strongly indicate infection prior to conception and a low risk of giving birth to a CMV-infected infant, whereas detection of low-avidity CMV IgG at any time during pregnancy would indicate infection after conception and the possible need for invasive procedures to determine whether the fetus is infected. Although an intermediate CMV IgG avidity is concerning for result interpretation, intermediate results have been shown to be more comparable to high-avidity results and most suggestive of reactivation or past infection. With respect to the kinetics of maturation of CMV-specific IgG avidity, it has been shown that pregnant women with positive CMV IgM results and low IgG avidity indexes who display a rapid increase in IgG avidity over time have a higher risk of transmitting the virus to the unborn fetus (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0143">143</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0122s0000p0093">CMV-specific CD4<superscript>+</superscript> and CD8<superscript>+</superscript> T-cell responses are critical to the control of CMV replication and the onset of symptomatic infections. Over the years, a number of methods have been developed to assess the CMV-specific cell-mediated immune response (69–71, 144–147). These include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0148">148</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0152">152</link>) and ELISPOT assays (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0153">153</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0157">157</link>), multicolored flow cytometry (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0158">158</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0162">162</link>), and the use of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and II tetramers (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0163">163</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0165">165</link>). The assays are procedurally different, but the basic principle is essentially the same. ELISA and ELISPOT assays measure the release of gamma interferon following stimulation of whole blood or PBMCs with CMV-specific antigens or peptides. Multicolored flow cytometry is used to stain for the intracellular accumulation of gamma interferon and other cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 2, and interleukin 6) in response to CMV-specific antigen stimulation. Lastly, CMV-specific antigen-associated MHC class I and II tetramers are used to bind to T-cell receptors on the surface of CD8<superscript>+</superscript> and CD4<superscript>+</superscript> T cells, respectively, to quantify the T cells that are specific for given CMV antigens and their matched MHC alleles (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0163">163</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0165">165</link>). Assays like the QuantiFERON-CMV (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), T-SPOT.CMV ELISPOT (Oxford Immunotec Ltd., Milton, United Kingdom), and T-Track CMV ELISPOT (Lophius Biosciences, Regensburg, Germany) have been commercialized and formulated into complete kits and have received CE marking in Europe (<anchor id="ch0122s0000a0068"/><link linkend="ch0122s0000a0071">Table 5</link>). Also, individual CMV-specific proteins and peptides (primarily pp65 and IE-1 antigens) and individual reagents and ready-to-use reagent kits are available from a number of manufacturers for the development of user-defined gamma interferon release assays and flow cytometric T-cell enumeration tests. The ImmuKnow assay (Eurofins Viracor-IBT Laboratories, Lee’s Summit, MO), which measures the intracellular concentration of ATP from stimulated CD4<superscript>+</superscript> T cells, is the only FDA-approved test and detects overall immune function rather than specific cell-mediated immune responses against CMV; testing is available only through the Eurofins Viracor-IBT Laboratories (<link linkend="ch0122s0000a0071">Table 5</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0122s0000p0094">A number of studies have demonstrated the clinical application of these assays to assess immune reconstitution and identify transplant recipients at increased risk for CMV viremia and a higher incidence of disease following transplantation; to guide decision-making regarding prophylaxis and preemptive therapies; and for risk stratification of patients before and after transplantation (69–71, 144, 147, 166–170). Therefore, in combination with quantitative monitoring of viral load in blood, the use of tests for immune monitoring has been recommended in the most recent updated international CMV consensus guidelines on the management of CMV in transplant patients (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0026">26</link>). A low or declining viral load in the presence of a robust or increasing CMV-specific cell-mediated immune response in a transplant recipient may indicate a low risk for disease and a possible opportunity to stop antiviral therapy and adjust immunosuppressive treatment. This would be in contrast to detecting high or increasing viral loads with low or declining CMV-specific cellular immune function, which may indicate a high risk for CMV complications and the need to start or continue antiviral therapy, begin cellular adoptive immunotherapy, or adjust the immunosuppressive drugs. Recently, CMV-specific cell-mediated immune responses also have been assessed in pregnant women, and studies have revealed that the maternal CMV-specific cell-mediated immune response is a predictor of CMV transmission to the fetus (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0154">154</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0155">155</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0095">The resistance of CMV to antiviral drugs used to treat and prevent CMV infection and disease has emerged as a growing problem in immunocompromised hosts (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0171">171</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0173">173</link>). Prolonged and repeated use of these drugs in transplant recipients and patients with AIDS has been associated with the development of antiviral resistance and progressive or recurrent CMV disease. CMV resistance is the result of specific genetic mutations in the catalytic domain of the UL97 phosphotransferase gene, leading to a deficiency in drug phosphorylation, and alterations in the UL54 viral DNA polymerase gene (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0171">171</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0172">172</link>). Mutations in the UL97 gene confer resistance to ganciclovir and valganciclovir, whereas mutations in the UL54 gene confer resistance to ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet. Resistance to the newer antiviral agents also has been described and is mediated by alterations in the UL56 gene for letermovir, the UL54 gene for brincidofovir, and the UL97 gene for maribavir (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0029">29</link>). CMV isolates resistant to ganciclovir remain susceptible to maribavir and vice versa, since the resistance mutation for maribavir is in a different location on the UL97 gene.</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0096">The described emergence of antiviral drug resistance has led to a definite need for antiviral susceptibility testing. Laboratory confirmation of drug resistance in the setting of rising, rebounding, or persistently high viral loads during prolonged therapy (median of 5 months) is essential for defining the mechanisms of antiviral resistance, for determining the frequency with which drug-resistant CMV mutants emerge in clinical practice, for predicting treatment failure and identifying cross-resistance to other antiviral agents, for instituting the most appropriate alternative therapy, and for the evaluation of new antiviral agents. Testing for suspected drug resistance generally should be considered when there is new or worsening CMV disease following a minimum of 6 or more weeks of cumulative antiviral drug exposure, including more than 2 weeks of ongoing therapy that has been appropriately dosed and delivered (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0029">29</link>).

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0098">Phenotypic assays, and more specifically plaque reduction assays, have been considered the principal reference methods for many years. These assays measure the ability of CMV to grow in cell culture in the presence of various concentrations of antiviral drug. They offer the distinct advantage of being a direct measure of CMV susceptibility to any antiviral drug and can provide data on the concentration of drug needed to inhibit viral replication. The effective dose is normally defined as the dose resulting in a 50% reduction in plaque formation. Phenotypic assays generally require isolation and passage of the virus to high titer in cell culture before testing begins, which can be quite difficult to do for wild-type CMV isolates, and thus these tests are rarely used in clinical practice today. The assays are cumbersome, labor-intensive, and expensive and have turnaround times that are far too long to permit the results to be clinically relevant, owing to the very slow growth of CMV in culture. Also, the assays are subjective and not well standardized, which may result in significant variability within and between different laboratories.</para>

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0099">Genotypic assays are currently the method of choice for measuring susceptibility of CMV to antiviral drugs. They offer speed, objectivity, sensitivity, and efficiency in direct screening and analysis of clinical specimens, usually whole blood or plasma, but may include other body fluids and tissue, or testing of CMV isolates, and they allow for an earlier detection of the emergence of drug resistance than phenotypic assays. The assays are designed to identify mutations that are known to confer resistance, and current genotypic testing typically includes identification of mutations in the CMV UL97 phosphotransferase (kinase) gene and the UL54 DNA polymerase gene that confer resistance to ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and/or cidofovir. These assays normally involve using PCR for amplification of specific viral genes and sequencing of the amplified products to identify polymorphisms; some assays use specific probes to detect selected mutations or use restriction endonuclease digestion of amplified products to identify alterations in the viral genome known to be associated with viral resistance to a given viral agent. Information on the phenotypes associated with specific resistance gene mutations has been published and can be beneficial to support the use of specific treatment options where drug resistance is suspected or proven (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0171">171</link>).

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0100">Newer genotypic assays have been developed and involve automated sequencing methods performed directly from clinical specimens without the need for PCR amplification (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0175">175</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0176">176</link>); they usually require a minimum quantity of 1,000 copies/ml of CMV DNA for the most reliable results, and mutant strains that comprise &lt;20 to 30% of the viral population may not be detected. Next-generation sequencing and deep sequencing methods are now being used to overcome these limitations, and offer more sensitive detection and higher resolution of minor variants and emerging mutant subpopulations as well as screening of additional gene regions for resistance markers for newer drugs (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0177">177</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0182">182</link>). Current next-generation sequencing methods also offer higher throughput capability at a lower cost, a more comprehensive coverage across the genome, and greater capability of multiplexing than more traditional genotypic Sanger sequencing methods for detection of CMV drug resistance mutations. Benchtop instruments are also now more accessible and affordable for sample processing and sequencing. Disadvantages include a turnaround time of approximately 5 days, the requirement for sophisticated bioinformatics systems, and the need for fast data processing, large data storage capabilities, and skilled staff to analyze and interpret the results. Also, testing is primarily available from commercial reference laboratories. More recently, a portable, real-time sequencing device (MinION, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, United Kingdom) was demonstrated to have utility for CMV antiviral drug resistance testing (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0181">181</link>), which may allow clinical laboratories to more readily implement the technology. When combined with an online cloud-based bioinformatics pipeline, the platform can substantially improve the speed of sequencing with turnaround times of less than 2 days. Additionally, a Web-based search tool called Mutation Resistance Analyzer that is agnostic to the sequencing method used has been developed for faster interpretation of sequence data from CMV genotypic resistance testing; this tool links the sequence to a database containing all published mutations in the UL97 kinase, UL54 polymerase, and UL56-UL89 terminase genes and the corresponding antiviral drug susceptibility phenotypes (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0183">183</link>). The timely and sensitive detection of drug resistance by using next-generation sequencing may allow for more prompt and effective changes in therapy, with faster viral clearance and a subsequent decrease in treatment failure and morbidity and an increase in graft survival in transplant recipients. More recently, the potential to use digital PCR as an alternative method for genotyping and quantification of the most prevalent mutations that cause resistance to ganciclovir has been demonstrated (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0184">184</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0101">A major disadvantage of current genotypic assays is that they detect only known drug-resistant mutations, and the results may be confounded by the presence of mutations that have no bearing on drug resistance and unrecognized resistance variants that may exist. In this regard, phenotypic assays are still required to identify drug-resistant viruses with novel mutations for antiviral resistance, but now involve genetic transfer of the mutation sequences to a laboratory-adapted reference CMV strain or artificial cloning system for rapid recombinant phenotyping (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0174">174</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0102">The overall complexities of phenotypic and genotypic assays make both methods less than routine for most clinical laboratories, and these assays are primarily available in specialized reference laboratories. Also, the continued development of novel antiviral agents with efficacy against CMV, and the emergence of resistance to these drugs when used clinically, will make it necessary to continuously update antiviral susceptibility assays.</para>

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0103">There are a number of points to consider when choosing which tests to perform for the detection of CMV. Conventional tube cultures are highly specific and can detect unexpected viruses, but are generally too slow and insensitive to have an impact on clinical decision-making when CMV is being considered as the primary pathogen. Shell vial cultures decrease the time required for detecting CMV in culture, but the sensitivity varies by specimen type and from laboratory to laboratory. Cultures also are often positive in the absence of true CMV disease; this is particularly true when urine or respiratory specimens are screened for CMV, in which shedding of CMV is common during asymptomatic infection and is usually not suggestive of more severe illness. Isolation of CMV in culture may be useful for postpartum and<emphasis>in utero</emphasis> diagnosis of congenital CMV infection and tissue invasive disease, and CMV isolates may be needed for select phenotypic antiviral susceptibility assays.</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0104">In the immunocompromised host, the use of direct detection methods to diagnose CMV disease is most beneficial for patient care. However, virologic or serologic detection of CMV indicates infection but does not establish whether the infection is responsible for symptomatic illness. CMV is ubiquitous, and asymptomatic excretion is high in patients who never progress to disease. Reactivation of latent virus is also common, and other pathogens may be simultaneously present in patients with overt disease. To implicate CMV as the cause of an illness, laboratory confirmation of active disease in an appropriate clinical setting is required. In this regard, most clinical virology laboratories have largely replaced their conventional tube and shell vial culture systems with CMV pp65 antigen assays or, to a much greater extent, with molecular methods for accurate CMV detection and/or quantification from blood. Quantitative measures of CMV antigenemia or CMV DNAemia can provide a rapid diagnosis of established disease, identify patients at risk of developing new or relapsing disease, and assess the progression of disease and the resolution of symptoms. They are also useful for directing the initiation of preemptive therapy, monitoring the response to antiviral drugs during prophylaxis and preemptive therapy, and predicting treatment failure and the emergence of drug-resistant virus.</para>

        <para id="ch0122s0000p0105">Evaluating longitudinal trends in viral loads and measuring the rate of elevation in the viral load over time are currently more useful than interpreting a single test result in relation to a defined cutoff value, since the initial viral load, the rate at which it rises, and its persistence with time may predict the risk of CMV disease and possible relapse and aid in establishing treatment failure (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0073">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0185">185</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0186">186</link>). Serial monitoring of high-risk patients also may be beneficial with respect to aiding in the decreased use of and exposure to antivirals, leading to a more cost-effective and focused use of such agents. However, significant variations in approaches to measuring viral loads and using the results among transplant centers that monitor and manage CMV infections have been reported (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0187">187</link>), and practices need further optimization among institutions. The availability of licensed commercial quantitative molecular CMV tests calibrated to the WHO international CMV standard has improved the agreement of viral load values and has allowed comparisons across laboratories using these assays.</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0106">Interpretation should be done with caution, as not all changes in quantitative CMV DNA levels may reflect a substantial biological or clinical difference, especially if the changes are small and fall within the expected range of variability for the assay used. Threefold changes (&gt;0.5 log<subscript>10</subscript>) usually cannot be explained by inherent biological or assay variability and likely reflect a biologically and clinically relevant change in the level of CMV DNAemia. However, molecular quantitative CMV DNA assays can have greater variability at the lower limit of sensitivity, and 5-fold (&gt;0.7 log<subscript>10</subscript>) differences between measurements nearer the lower limit may be more reflective of a substantial biological or clinical change (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0045">45</link>). Also, an isolated positive result for CMV DNAemia may not be indicative of disease and the need for immediate antiviral treatment, particularly in asymptomatic patients. Lastly, negative viral load results do not always exclude CMV disease in symptomatic patients; end-organ involvement, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, may occur in the absence of detectable levels of CMV DNAemia. Histopathologic examination and/or PCR can be useful in immunocompromised hosts for the diagnosis of specific organ-invasive diseases. However, CMV is widely distributed in various tissues at low amounts, and simply finding the virus in tissue specimens must be interpreted with caution, particularly when infections with more than one organism are documented, as the relative importance of each pathogen in producing clinical illness may be difficult to determine. Lower cycle threshold (CT) values (e.g., indicating higher viral loads) in tissue samples tested by qualitative PCR may be more suggestive of dense infiltration of the tissue with CMV and invasive disease, while higher CT values (e.g., indicating lower viral loads) may reflect detection of latent infection or contamination from fluids bathing the tissue. The degree of histological involvement may correlate better in determining the role and severity of CMV in causing disease, although the sensitivity of histopathologic testing is low. More recently, for CMV gastrointestinal disease, viral loads in tissue have been measured by quantitative real-time PCR, and optimal cutoff values were examined to better support and improve the diagnosis and treatment of tissue-invasive disease (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0188">188</link>–<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0190">190</link>). There is a particular need to differentiate CMV infection from graft rejection in transplant patients, since the administration of potent immunosuppressive antirejection drugs during active CMV infection can result in life-threatening disease.</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0107">The isolation of CMV from urine, respiratory secretions, or other body fluids within the first 3 weeks of life is the traditional means of confirming the diagnosis of congenital infection in newborns. Urine is the preferred specimen because it contains greater amounts of virus, and the virus therefore grows quickly in culture. PCR has also been used effectively to find CMV DNA in urine and saliva of congenitally infected infants (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0191">191</link>), and CMV has been detected in blood of infants with congenital infection by the antigenemia assay and PCR. Real-time PCR of saliva obtained at birth is now considered a highly sensitive and specific approach for detection of CMV-associated sensorineural hearing loss in asymptomatic infants who fail a newborn hearing test prior to hospital discharge (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0191">191</link>). Similar to urine specimens, high titers of CMV are shed in saliva of infected newborns, and saliva is an easier sample to collect for newborn screening by PCR. Attempts to isolate or detect virus from maternal blood leukocytes and from amniotic fluid and fetal blood and tissue by molecular and/or antigen-based tests may provide useful information for prenatal diagnosis of congenital CMV infection (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0053">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0192">192</link>). While such prenatal testing is a sensitive indicator of maternal or fetal CMV infection, positive results do not predict which infants will have disease. In this regard, quantitative measures of viral load in congenital CMV infection may prove beneficial for predicting symptomatic outcome and for guiding patient management. It has been demonstrated that elevated levels of CMV DNA in blood during early infancy are associated with hearing loss in newborns with symptomatic and asymptomatic congenital CMV infection (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0193">193</link>, <link linkend="ch0122s0000li0194">194</link>). Also, quantitative real-time PCR has been used to quantify CMV DNA from amniotic fluid samples to predict fetal and neonatal outcomes (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0195">195</link>) and to test umbilical cord blood to screen for neonatal CMV infection at delivery (<link linkend="ch0122s0000li0196">196</link>). Infants not previously tested but found to be excreting virus after 3 weeks of age may have either congenital or acquired infection. Standard serologic or virologic tests do not differentiate between these possibilities.</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0108">In general, serologic tests for CMV-specific IgG antibody have limited value for the diagnosis of acute infection, since the results are obtained retrospectively and are not predictive of disease. Also, the transplacental passage of maternal IgG antibody begins at 18 weeks of gestation and confounds the diagnosis of CMV infection in the neonate, and immunocompromised hosts may not mount a normal immune response or may have been given blood transfusions or intravenous immunoglobulins that contain detectable CMV IgG antibodies. Nonetheless, a history of seroconversion from a negative to a positive IgG antibody response to CMV is diagnostic of primary infection and may be beneficial in evaluating a pregnant woman with symptoms of viral disease. For pregnant women with preexisting CMV-specific IgG and/or IgM antibody, however, IgG avidity testing may be more helpful in distinguishing primary from nonprimary infections and for predicting CMV transmission to the fetus. Whenever possible, serologic diagnoses of CMV infection should be confirmed by other virologic methods. CMV-specific IgG serologic assays play a more important role as a screening tool in the determination of an individual’s immune status to CMV. Detection of CMV-specific IgG in a single serum specimen indicates exposure to CMV at some time in the past. Negative serum antibody titers may exclude CMV infection. In the evaluation of an organ donor and recipient, a seronegative recipient who receives an organ or blood products from a seropositive donor is at increased risk for developing primary CMV infection and serious disease. Knowing the serostatus of the donor and recipient is therefore important in determining the treatment or prophylaxis to be used and in considering the type of donor to be selected and blood products to be given. Otherwise, serologic tests for CMV-specific IgG and IgM are not useful for the diagnosis of CMV disease after transplantation.</para>

With the commercial development and continued standardization of immune monitoring assays, clinical laboratories should be poised to broadly adopt this technology.</para>
        <para id="ch0122s0000p0110">The application of virologic methods, including conventional and shell vial cultures, rapid direct-detection assays, and immunologic testing, should be combined with clinical assessment of the patient to provide an accurate, reliable diagnosis of CMV infection and disease and to allow subsequent prompt, appropriate patient management and timely intervention with specific antiviral therapy. It is imperative that health care providers and laboratorians alike know which tests for CMV are most appropriate for different patient populations, and that they have a complete understanding of the advantages and limitations of each test and the meaning of the test results.</para>
