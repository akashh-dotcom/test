        <para id="ch0118s0001s0001p0001">The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) reorganized the order<emphasis>Bunyavirales</emphasis> in 2016, with the genus <emphasis>Hantavirus</emphasis> being elevated to the family rank <emphasis>Hantaviridae</emphasis>; <emphasis>Mammantavirinae</emphasis>, one of the four subfamilies within the <emphasis>Hantaviridae</emphasis>, is the home of the genus <emphasis>Orthohantavirus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0001">1</link>), the genus containing all hantavirids pathogenic to humans. The ICTV currently recognizes 38 species in the genus <emphasis>Orthohantavirus</emphasis> (<emphasis>Bunyavirales</emphasis>: <emphasis>Hantaviridae</emphasis>) (<ulink url="https://ictvonline.org/taxonomy/">https://ictvonline.org/taxonomy/</ulink>). Unlike other <emphasis>Bunyavirales</emphasis> members, hantaviruses are not transmitted by arthropods (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0002">2</link>), although the recent discovery of Jiāngxià mosquito virus 2 opens up the possibility of arthropod transmission. The ICTV lists four criteria that must be fulfilled for a virus to be classified as a hantavirid species: (i) a hantavirus species is found in a unique ecological niche, i.e. in a different primary rodent reservoir species or subspecies; (ii) a hantavirus species exhibits at least 7% difference in amino acid identity when S and M segment sequences are compared; (iii) a hantavirus species shows at least a fourfold difference in two-way cross-neutralization tests; and (iv) hantavirus species do not naturally form reassortants with other species (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0003">3</link>). Rule 2 was refined to take into account the length and composition of the sequences in addition to amino acid sequence differences (“a 10% difference in S segment similarity and 12% difference in M segment similarity based on complete amino acid sequences”) (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0005">5</link>). In 2016, the ICTV Executive Committee endorsed a consensus statement allowing virus classification based solely on metagenomic data (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0006">6</link>). Consequentially, the numbers of identified hantavirids, from numerous diverse animal and insect reservoirs, has greatly expanded (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0007">7</link>). Pathogenic strains within these species have been identified in the Americas (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0008">8</link>–<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0010">10</link>), Asia (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0011">11</link>), and Europe (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0012">12</link>); in Africa, only serological evidence of human infection has been presented until now (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0014">14</link>) (<anchor id="ch0118s0001s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0118s0001s0001a0004">Table 1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0118s0001s0001p0002">Hantaviruses were first isolated from Rodentia (e.g., mice, rats and voles) species; additional reservoirs have been identified in Soricomorphs (e.g., shrews and moles) and Chiroptera (e.g., bats) (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0015">15</link>), and the list of host species has greatly expanded to include arthropods, fish, and reptiles (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0016">16</link>). The use of molecular techniques and metagenomics has demonstrated the presence of hantaviruses in new animals and has expanded the list of organisms that appear to be reservoirs (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0018">18</link>). However, any given hantavirus species is almost exclusively restricted to a single mammalian reservoir; thus, the geographic distribution of its associated disease is restricted to the range and distribution of its reservoir. In addition, the severity of disease in humans is influenced by the species and strain of hantavirus, ranging from noninfectious to a reported case fatality rate of 50% (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0017">17</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0118s0001s0001p0003">Old World hantavirus species are found primarily in Asia and Europe, with Hantaan virus as the prototype species of the genus. Old World hantaviruses have been detected in major port cities globally (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0019">19</link>), and in 2017 to 2018 there was an outbreak of Seoul virus in the United States (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0020">20</link>). Pathogenic species of Old World hantavirus are known to cause HFRS. In contrast, pathogenic New World hantavirus species are known to cause HPS in the Americas, but cases outside the Americas have been documented in travelers (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0022">22</link>). African hantaviruses have yet to be associated with a disease syndrome in humans. It is interesting that the majority of identified African hantaviruses are genetically more diverse than the Old or New World hantaviruses; in part, this has led to their slow discovery and suggests that new diagnostic tools need to be developed to capture potentially human-pathogenic species.</para>

The S segment (1.7 to 2.1 kb) encodes the hantavirus nucleocapsid protein, and in some hantavirus species, an open reading frame overlapping the nucleoprotein gene and encoding a nonstructural protein has been observed. The M segment (3.6 to 3.7 kb) encodes the glycoprotein precursor, which is cotranslationally cleaved to yield the envelope glycoproteins G1 and G2. The L segment (6.5 to 6.6 kb) encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and is the most conserved of three genomic segments (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0004">4</link>).

Globally, 150,000 to 200,000 HFRS cases are reported annually, with China contributing the largest proportion of cases (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0027">27</link>). The two most reported hantaviruses in Asia are Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV). The reservoir for HTNV is <emphasis>Apodemus agrarius</emphasis> (striped field mouse), and HTNV causes moderate to severe HFRS in South Korea, China, and eastern Russia. An analysis of field and epidemiological data from China (1960 to 2013) supports the idea that Hantaan infections are more pronounced when climatic changes favor rodent population growth and viral transmission (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0028">28</link>). The reservoir for SEOV, in contrast, is primarily <emphasis>Rattus norvegicus</emphasis> (brown rat), and the virus causes moderate HFRS, though case fatality rates as high as 15% have been reported (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0029">29</link>). Because of the widespread distribution of the brown rat, SEOV infections are known to occur globally (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0030">30</link>). SEOV in pet rats led to human infections in the United Kingdom in 2012 (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0031">31</link>), Sweden in 2013 (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0032">32</link>), and the United States in 2017 (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0033">33</link>).</para>

As of the end of 2020, 833 cases of hantavirus disease in the United States were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since surveillance began in 1993.

The mechanism of tissue injury appears immunopathological, with characteristic deterioration of endothelial cell function and compromised barrier functions of the vasculature. A major difference between the two syndromes is that in HFRS, the primarily affected vascular beds are renal medullary capillaries and the retroperitoneum is the major site of the vascular leakage, whereas in HPS, the pulmonary capillaries are the affected vascular beds and the lungs and thoracic cavity are the major sites of the vascular leakage. Based on more recent studies, HFRS and HPS are believed to be interconnected syndromes frequently involving the kidneys (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0051">51</link>).</para>

The clinical course of HFRS can be divided into five phases: prodrome (typically 3 to 7 days), hypotensive (several hours to 4 days), oliguric (4 to 5 days), diuretic (7 to 11 days), and convalescent (weeks to months). Similarly, the clinical course of HPS can be divided into four phases: prodrome (3 to 6 days), cardiopulmonary (7 to 10 days), diuretic (1 to 3 days), and convalescent (weeks to months). Death in HFRS is usually due to shock in the hypotensive or diuretic phase. Death in HPS is usually attributed to hypoxia (pulmonary edema) or shock in the cardiopulmonary phase.</para>
        <para id="ch0118s0001s0004p0003">Disease severity in HFRS usually ranges from mild, e.g., Puumala virus-associated nephropathia epidemica, to moderate, e.g., Hantaan or Dobrava virus infections. In severe HFRS caused by Hantaan virus or Dobrava-Belgrade virus, the prodrome usually begins with an abrupt onset of high fever, chills, headache, blurred vision, malaise, and anorexia and then includes severe abdominal or lumbar pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, facial flushing, petechiae, and an erythematous rash or conjunctival hemorrhage. The hypotensive phase begins with a characteristic decrease in platelet number followed by defervescence and abrupt onset of hypotension, which may progress to shock and more apparent hemorrhagic manifestations. Other abnormalities may include elevated serum levels of aspartate transaminase (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0052">52</link>). In the oliguric phase, blood pressure returns to normal or becomes high, urinary output falls dramatically, concentrations of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen increase, and severe hemorrhage may occur. Spontaneous diuresis, with polyuria greater than 3 liters per day, heralds the onset of recovery. Distinct clinical phases are less obvious in HFRS caused by Seoul virus and nephropathia epidemica, and visible superficial hemorrhages usually do not occur in nephropathia epidemica (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0053">53</link>).

The prodrome in HPS is characterized by fever, myalgia, and malaise. Other symptoms that may occur during the prodrome include headache, dizziness, anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Nonproductive cough and tachypnea usually mark the onset of pulmonary edema. Fully developed HPS is characterized by rapidly progressive (time span of 4 to 24 h) noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, large volumes of pleural effusion, and cardiogenic shock. Hypotension and oliguria are the result of shock. Myocardial depression may occur and contribute to shock (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0060">60</link>).

In addition to confirming hantavirus infection by detecting viral RNA, the resulting PCR product may be sequenced to identify the virus through phylogenetic analysis. Hantavirus RNA can be detected by RT-PCR in human samples 3 to 10 days after symptom onset. Prior knowledge of the circulating species of hantavirus in a geographic location supports the use of primers specific for hantavirus S and M segments targeted to that species (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0143">143</link>). Concurrent circulation of several hantavirus types in a region complicates such identification.

A similar nested RT-PCR targeting the L segment was also used to discover a novel hantavirus in an African wood mouse sample (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0037">37</link>). Additionally, researchers used primers against conserved regions of the M segment of HTNV/SEOV or PUUV/Prospect Hill virus (PHV) in nested RT-PCR and sequenced the products to identify what is now known as SNV (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0146">146</link>).</para>

However, high sequence diversity among the known hantaviruses has prevented the design of a robust set of primers and probes for an efficient pan-hantavirus real-time RT-PCR. Therefore, application of real-time RT-PCR is restricted to detection of genetically closely related hantaviruses cocirculating in a region and to following up contacts of patients with known cases of hantavirus infection (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0142">142</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0148">148</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0149">149</link>).</para>

In addition to nucleic acid detection methods such as RT-PCR (discussed above), several serologic tests are used for hantavirus diagnosis.</para>
      <para id="ch0118s0009p0002">Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is considered one of the earliest serologic tests developed for hantavirus diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0150">150</link>). IFA uses hantavirus-infected cells fixed as an antigen on glass plates. Diluted serum samples are added to the plates to detect the viral antigens. However, low virus yield in preparations of certain hantavirus antigens and high levels of background signal from nonspecific antibody binding can affect the quality and interpretation of IFA results. Multiparametric IFAs have been developed and are commercially available in Europe. Matrices on biochips are coated with HTNV-, PUUV-, SEOV-, SAAV-, DOBV-, SNV-, and ANDV-infected cells to react with serum samples.

Similar to RT-PCR, NGS can detect the presence of viral RNA only when the patient or animal is acutely infected. For human clinical specimens, SNV RNA in the blood or serum is most frequently detected within 4 days after symptom onset but has been detected within 1 to 18 days after symptom onset by RT-PCR (Whitmer SLM, Talundzic E, Mobley M, Whitesell A, Shedroff E, Cossaboom C, Messenger S, Bhatnagar J, Estetter L, Zufan S, Cannon D, Chiang C, Gibbons A, Krapiunaya I, Morales-Betoulle M, Choi M, Knust B, Amman B, Montgomery J, Shoemaker T, and Klena JD, unpublished data). Thus, the window for detection of high viral load is relatively short and can be challenging to catch with limited human clinical material and collection time points. Within this “Goldilocks window,” complete hantavirus genomes can be generated from human peripheral blood or serum using NGS (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0171">171</link>–<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0174">174</link>). When comparing paired blood and lung specimens from the same individual, Whitmer SLM, Talundzic E, Mobley M, Whitesell A, Shedroff E, Cossaboom C, Messenger S, Bhatnagar J, Estetter L, Zufan S, Cannon D, Chiang C, Gibbons A, Krapiunaya I, Morales-Betoulle M, Choi M, Knust B, Amman B, Montgomery J, Shoemaker T, and Klena JD (unpublished data) had better success at generating complete SNV genomes from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung specimens, and in a single instance, Hecht G et al. were able to generate a complete SNV genome from a kidney biopsy specimen and blood specimen from the same individual (Hecht G, Dale AP, Ruberto I, Adame G, Close R, Snyder S, Pink K, Lemmon N, Madsen M, Wiens AL, Cossaboom C, Shoemaker T, Choi MJ, Cannon D, Krapiunaya I, Whitmer S, Mobley M, Klena JD, Venkat H, unpublished data). In limited cases, Old World hantavirus genomes have also been generated from urine and CSF (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0175">175</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0176">176</link>). For endemically infected rodent, shrew, and mole populations, viral RNA is most frequently detected from kidney, liver, lung, and urine, and NGS is usually performed using RNA extracted from lung tissue (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0177">177</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0178">178</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0118s0010p0002">Similar to RT-PCR, success at generating a whole viral genome by NGS is influenced by primer specificity. Several groups have developed or are developing an amplicon-based approach to target specific hantavirus strains (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0172">172</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0175">175</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0178">178</link>–<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0180">180</link>). Sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has demonstrated that amplicon-based NGS approaches exhibit sensitivity up to a cycle threshold (<emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>T</emphasis></subscript>) value of 30 to 32 and in some instances up to a <emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>T</emphasis></subscript>value of 35+ (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0181">181</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0182">182</link>). The sensitivity of amplicon-based sequencing is balanced by the targeted specificity of this approach. Prior knowledge of circulating hantavirus strains is required to design specific amplicon primers. To overcome this type of limitation, the use of pan-viral genus and species enrichment probe sets (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0174">174</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0183">183</link>) has shown promising results. A similar approach was used by Hiltbrunner and Heckel to explore hantavirid diversity in natural host samples (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0184">184</link>). An added benefit of metagenomic NGS and pan-hantaviral enrichment NGS (consisting of both enriched and nonenriched fractions) is the ability to monitor the specificity of diagnostic RT-PCR and ensure that diverse hantavirus strains are not missed in hantavirus-negative specimens.</para>

      <para id="ch0118s0011p0001">Isolation of hantavirus from natural hosts is difficult yet necessary for analyzing biological properties of these viruses. It is most common to use blood, serum, urine, or tissue homogenate samples of infected individuals or animals to inoculate cultured cells. Vero-E6 is the cell line of choice for virus isolation due to its genetic defect in interferon production. About 2 weeks after inoculation, hantavirus-infected cells can be identified by immunofluorescence assays (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0185">185</link>–<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0188">188</link>). Repeated passaging of inoculated cells may be needed to achieve successful virus isolation (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0185">185</link>). However, hantaviruses passaged in cell culture often adapt to the cells, altering their properties. Reports have shown that PUUV isolated from Vero-E6 cells contain mutations in S and L segments compared to the wild-type virus isolated from bank voles, the virus’s natural host; moreover, the cell culture isolate could no longer infect bank voles (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0189">189</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0190">190</link>). In addition, some hantaviruses have been shown to infect cultured cells more efficiently than others (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0191">191</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0118s0011p0002">Several studies have shown that hantaviruses can be successfully isolated from laboratory animals.

However, early diagnosis is challenging, because the prodromal phase of hantavirus infection is nonspecific, with thrombocytopenia being the only abnormal and significant laboratory finding during this phase (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0195">195</link>). If health care providers in regions of hantaviral disease endemicity are presented with patients who develop thrombocytopenia combined with additional symptoms including fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, hantavirus infection should be suspected. As previously mentioned, ANDV can be transmitted from person to person; therefore, the importance of a rapid diagnosis not only increases the likelihood of successful patient management but also is necessary for implementation of appropriate isolation procedures to prevent virus transmission to health care providers and to limit possible spread to other persons who may have been in contact with the case patient (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0042">42</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0118s0011s0001p0003">The gold standard for hantavirus diagnosis is serology, and in the majority of cases, antibodies of IgM and IgG classes can be detected during the prodrome phase (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0196">196</link>, <link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0197">197</link>). Controls for IgM capture ELISA and IgG ELISA (e.g., sera from laboratory-confirmed HPS cases) and immunohistochemistry assays are essential for correct interpretation of the assay results. Most local laboratories do not have direct access to these materials. Thus, diagnostic testing is often limited to federal laboratories, research institutions that have a specific interest in HFRS or HPS, and a small number of commercial laboratories. In addition, because of the lack of standardized methods, the overall quality of laboratory testing is highly variable. For example, a 2010 external quality control study for serological diagnosis of hantavirus infections involving 18 laboratories in Europe and Canada revealed that only 53 and 76% of IgM- and IgG-positive samples, respectively, were diagnosed correctly (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0198">198</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0118s0011s0001p0004">RT-PCR assays can be used to provide additional information, and subsequent sequence analysis of amplified orthohantavirus segments can be used to identify the virus responsible for infection to the species level. Similar to serologic methods, assays must be properly controlled using known positive references and negative controls.</para>
        <para id="ch0118s0011s0001p0005">As previously stated by Fulhorst and Bowen (<link linkend="ch0118s0011s0002li0048">48</link>), the “requirement for reporting HFRS and HPS varies among local health agencies and from country to country. In the United States, reporting of HPS cases is mandated at the state level, and HPS is listed as a notifiable disease in the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), although reporting is not compulsory.” The CDC has the capacity to perform diagnostic and confirmatory laboratory tests (including the IgM heavy chain-capture ELISA for antihantavirus IgM, ELISA for antihantavirus IgG, RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR assays for hantavirus-specific RNA, and next-generation sequencing). Confirmatory ELISAs and RT-PCR assays are normally completed within 24 to 48 h after receipt of diagnostic specimens at the Viral Special Pathogens Branch (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mail Stop 070, 1600 Clifton Rd., Atlanta, GA 30333; phone, 404-639-0114; fax, 404-718-2175).</para>
