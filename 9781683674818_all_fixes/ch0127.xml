        <para id="ch0127s0001s0001p0001">Papillomaviruses (PVs) are in the family<emphasis>Papillomaviridae.</emphasis> PV virions (~55-nm diameter) are nonenveloped with an icosahedral capsid composed of 72 capsomers enclosing a single double-stranded DNA circular genome (~8 kb). The genome is organized into early and late genes with an upstream (noncoding) regulatory region. The two late genes code for the structural capsid proteins (L1, major; L2, minor). Systematic classification of PVs is based on the nucleic acid sequence of the L1 open reading frame (ORF). The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognizes 49 genera within the family, each given a name using a Greek letter (e.g., <emphasis>Alphapapillomavirus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Betapapillomavirus</emphasis>). Human papillomaviruses (HPVs), PVs that infect humans, are found in five of these genera (<anchor id="ch0127s0001s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0127s0001s0002a0005">Fig. 1</link>). The genus name with a number (e.g., <emphasis>Alphapapillomavirus 9</emphasis>) is used to designate a species, and within species, “strains” are designated as types, numbered in order of their recognition; particularly in the epidemiological and clinical context, HPVs are generally described at the level of type or genotype. Designation of a new type requires a full genome sequence and a &gt;10% difference in the L1 ORF sequence compared to the closest known type. Sequence variation of less than 10% is recognized, but there is currently no agreement on a systematic nomenclature. Commonly, viruses with differences between 10 and 2% are called subtypes, and those with less than 2% are called variants. Currently, more than 200 HPV types are recognized. The International HPV Reference Center at the Karolinska Institute confirms sequences of novel types and assigns HPV type numbers. The Papillomavirus Episteme (PaVE; <ulink url="https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/">https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/</ulink>) is a curated database of PV genomic sequences along with sequence analysis tools (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0001">1</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0127s0001s0002p0001">The closely related members of the large PV family are host species specific and are restricted to infecting epithelial surfaces. Replication occurs in the host cell nucleus, and both replication and transcription rely on host cell machinery. Transcription occurs from only one strand and in one direction, using different promoters for early and late proteins. ORFs of proteins frequently overlap, and transcriptional regulation is complex and regulated by poorly understood methods of processing and splicing polycistronic messages. The productive viral infection is completed as fully differentiated cells are shed from the epithelial surface; thus, infection is nonlytic. Viral restriction to the epithelial compartment, the limited presence of immune effector cells in this compartment, and the lack of host cell necrosis contribute to the evasion of the host immune response. All known HPVs require terminal epithelial differentiation for completion of the viral life cycle, and therefore, conventional cell culture methods cannot be used to isolate or propagate HPV (see reviews of the biology of HPV in references<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0001">1</link> and <link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0002">2</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0001s0002p0002">The genomic organization of HPV-16 is shown as an example, because all HPVs share some homology (<anchor id="ch0127s0001s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0127s0001s0002a0009">Fig. 2</link>). The noncoding upstream regulatory region (URR; also called the long control region) includes binding sites for cellular transcription factors and viral proteins that regulate replication and gene expression. The core genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, L1, and L2) have important functions in genome replication and packaging in all HPV types. E1 is an essential origin recognition protein for replication. E2 interacts with E1 to enhance the specificity of E1 binding and exerts a key influence on the regulation of other early proteins. E4 plays a role in late phases of the viral life cycle, binding to cytokeratin and helping to disrupt cell structure and release virions as cells are shed. The major capsid protein, L1, generally forms pentameric capsids which in turn form the viral protein shell. When produced in protein expression systems <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>, recombinant L1 proteins self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) that retain type-specific neutralizing epitopes and have an electron-microscopic appearance very similar to that of native virions. The minor capsid protein, L2, plays key roles in encapsidating the viral genome and in viral uncoating during infection. It may also facilitate viral entry.</para>

The mucosal high-risk types found in anogenital precancers and cancers (red shading) are in this genus, as are low-risk types found in genital warts, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, and focal epithelial hyperplasia. Cutaneous types in this genus are associated with benign common warts, flat warts, plantar warts, and filiform warts. Hand warts are particularly common, often near the nail. The other genera include HPV types with tropism for cutaneous epithelia. Infections with <emphasis>Betapapillomavirus</emphasis> species are usually subclinical but can cause cutaneous lesions in those with immune disorders, such as epidermodysplasia verruciformis, or with immune suppression. They have been implicated in nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, particularly in association with sunlight. Infections with HPV types in <emphasis>Gammapapillomavirus, Mupapillomavirus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Nupapillomavirus</emphasis> species are usually subclinical, but these types have been associated with skin lesions, most notably <emphasis>Mupapillomavirus</emphasis> types HPV-1 and -63 in hand and foot warts. <emphasis>Mupapillomavirus</emphasis> species have not been reported in cancers, while types in the genera <emphasis>Gammapapillomavirus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Nupapillomavirus</emphasis> have been occasionally detected in skin cancer.

        <para id="ch0127s0001s0002p0003">The other genes (E5, E6, and E7) also are essential for replication and completion of the productive life cycle, but their properties differ between genera, and for the genus<emphasis>Alphapapillomavirus</emphasis> also by species. The properties of E5, E6, and E7 influence the propensity of the virus to persist, transition into a deregulated or abortive life cycle, and introduce oncogenesis (see “Clinical Significance,” below). The functions of these proteins also influence the particular epithelial environment characteristic of viral types. For example, <emphasis>Alphapapillomavirus</emphasis> favors nonkeratinizing mucosa, whereas <emphasis>Betapapillomavirus, Gammapapillomavirus, Mupapillomavirus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Nupapillomavirus</emphasis> favor keratinizing or cutaneous epithelia.</para>

        <para id="ch0127s0001s0002p0004">HPV infection requires the viral particle to move from the cell surface through the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where the viral genome is replicated. The details of the steps in this process are still being characterized and appear to differ between<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> studies using quasivirions (i.e., VLPs encapsidating HPV genomes expressed from packaging plasmids) and those using <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> native HPV virions. The current model (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0003">3</link>) is that <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> virions bind to the basement membrane and then secondarily to the cell surface, largely mediated by L1 interactions. Neutralizing antibodies to L1 can block this binding. While binding may occur through a variety of extracellular matrix proteins, heparan sulfate appears to be required for transfer to the cell surface. Coreceptors may be involved in binding and entry steps that involve conformation changes in the viral protein surface exposing L2 to furin cleavage. This step appears to be essential, because antibodies to L2 block viral entry (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0004">4</link>). The virus is internalized through endocytosis, a slow process that occurs over several hours.</para>

        <para id="ch0127s0001s0002p0005">HPV initiates infection in primitive basal-like epithelial cells, accessed through minor trauma or at specialized sites of epithelial transition, particularly the squamocolumnar junction. Productive infection commonly results in expansion of the infected basal and differentiating cells, recognized as a wart or papilloma. Most infections are transient and clear spontaneously or are no longer detectable (are latent). Latent infection in basal epithelial cells is well documented in animal PVs and is suspected to occur in humans (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0005">5</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0001s0002p0006">HPV infections that are not cleared may persist as a productive or latent infection, and some types (see below) may eventually be involved in oncogenesis. The interval between acquisition of HPV and development of cancer is generally quite long, at least 10 years. The HPV oncogenic pathway can be considered a nonproductive infection or abortive infection, i.e., one in which daughter viruses are not produced, which is consistent with other viruses that cause cancer (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0007">7</link>). The E6 and E7 proteins that are essential for promoting viral production by extending the cellular replication cycle can contribute to genomic instability and the accumulation of cellular mutations within proliferating cells. Integration of HPV may occur, often disrupting E1 and E2 expression, contributing to further overexpression of E6 and E7 through release from transcriptional control, and adding to stepwise neoplastic progression. Integration is not part of the normal life cycle but can be detected in some precancers. The episomal viral genome may integrate as either a single copy or multitandem copies. HPV integration is frequent in HPV-associated cancers but is not absolutely required. HPV-associated cancers may have integrated HPV DNA, extrachromosomal episomal HPV, or a mixture of these. In most cancers with only extrachromosomal HPV, the viral genome has been methylated or mutated to allow overexpression of HPV E6 and E7.</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0001s0002p0007">Of the approximately 40<emphasis>Alphapapillomavirus</emphasis> types frequently detected in anogenital samples, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has designated 12 HPV types as oncogenic or high-risk based on their association with cancers (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0008">8</link>). The 14 high-risk types detected in all clinically validated HPV assays to date include the 12 types considered oncogenic by the IARC (HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, and -59), an additional type designated by the IARC as probably oncogenic (HPV-68), and a type formerly considered oncogenic (HPV-66) and now considered possibly oncogenic. These high-risk types are <emphasis>Alphapapillomavirus</emphasis> types, mostly in alpha-9 and alpha-7 species (<link linkend="ch0127s0001s0002a0005">Fig. 1</link>). Although some <emphasis>Betapapillomavirus</emphasis> species are thought to interact with UV light to result in nonmelanoma skin cancer, the natural history and biology are not well understood (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0009">9</link>). Currently, there is no justification or indication for clinical testing of types other than a subset of <emphasis>Alphapapillomavirus</emphasis>.</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0001s0002p0008">As natural infection with HPV is not highly immunogenic for reasons described above, a measurable host antibody response is not always detected. The lack of a consistent humoral immune response explains the need to rely on genomic differences for taxonomy (i.e., HPV genotypes, not serotypes), as well as the limitation of serology in natural history studies and the inappropriateness of HPV serology for clinical testing and screening. Serum antibodies to a variety of HPV proteins have been detected, but those directed against type-specific conformational epitopes in L1 VLPs have been most studied in the response to natural infection and HPV vaccines. Animal and<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> systems demonstrate that these antibodies are neutralizing; i.e., they protect against infection (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0010">10</link>). The immune response to natural infection is stronger in females than males; there is evidence for modest protection against type-specific reinfection in females but not males (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0012">12</link>).

        <para id="ch0127s0001s0003p0001">Due to its strong species specificity, there are no animal reservoirs or vectors for HPV. In most situations, transmission requires close epithelial contact. The epidemiology and transmission of genital and nongenital infections differ significantly. Nongenital infections manifesting as hand and foot warts are most common in children and adolescents. Spread is by direct contact, although environmental transmission is suggested by the increased risk among those who walk barefoot in pool or shower areas and for hand warts as an occupational risk for butchers and meat handlers (see “Cutaneous Warts,” below).</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0001s0003p0002">The epidemiology and natural history of genital or mucosal HPV differ by anatomic site, by sex, and by age (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0014">14</link>). In addition, the methods of sampling and assay (discussed below) also influence study results. In general, sexual contact, not confined to penetrative sex, is the dominant mode of transmission, with peak incidence and prevalence closely following age of sexual debut and number of sexual partners. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, and estimates suggest that nearly every sexually active person is likely exposed over their lifetime. Vertical transmission and nonsexual horizontal transmission are rare but can occur particularly in the first 2 years of life (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0015">15</link>), with the former thought to be the mechanism for juvenile onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (see “Clinical Significance,” below). Fomite transmission is considered a possibility because of the stability of the virus, but the frequency and likelihood of nonsexual transmission are unclear (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0016">16</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0001s0003p0003">The natural history of cervical HPV infection has been studied most intensively. Cervical cancer was the first malignancy linked to HPV (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0017">17</link>). Cervical cancer screening on the basis of exfoliated cervical cytology (the Pap test) resulted in a good understanding of the progression of cervical neoplasia, established the importance of sampling the cervical transformation zone, and provided reliable methods for sampling the relatively accessible cervix. It is now clear that cervical HPV is usually acquired around the time of sexual debut, and the peak population prevalence is in late adolescence/early adulthood. Infection with one of the oncogenic types is required but not sufficient for neoplastic progression. The peak population prevalence of high-grade cervical precancers follows 5 to 10 years after HPV acquisition, indicating the need for persistent infection and additional behavioral and environmental factors, such as smoking and chronic inflammation. If precancers do not regress and are not detected and removed, invasion may occur with time, generally several years. Thus, the rare invasive cancer arises slowly, decades after initial infection.</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0001s0003p0004">As noted above, most HPV infections, even those with oncogenic types, clear spontaneously. However, persistent infection with one of the oncogenic types is associated with risk for cervical cancer, and high-risk HPV is necessary but not sufficient for cervical cancer. The long delay between infection and cancer made cervical cancer screening with cytology feasible. The requirement of HPV for cervical cancer means that preventing infection can prevent cancer, thus providing the basis of the prophylactic HPV vaccines (see “Prophylactic HPV Vaccines: Primary Cancer Prevention,” below). Further, detection of HPV nucleic acid can be used as a risk marker for cervical disease either as an adjunct to cytology or as a primary screening test (see “Typing,” below).</para>

        <para id="ch0127s0001s0004p0001">HPV infections can induce proliferation beyond that which would be naturally programmed by the cell, and this can have subclinical or clinical consequences—and, with regard to the latter, a benign or a malignant trajectory. HPV types in the genera<emphasis>Alphapapillomavirus, Betapapillomavirus, Gammapapillomavirus, Mupapillomavirus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Nupapillomavirus</emphasis> can give rise to infections that have clinical sequelae (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0018">18</link>). Species groups which unite a group of phylogenetically related types often confer similar risks/manifestations, although there are exceptions, so a clinical “phenotype” cannot be reliably predicted based on knowledge of a species group. Interestingly, advances in the resolving power of sequencing technologies have revealed that differential clinical risks and tropisms can exist even at the level of variant. For example, certain variants of HPV-16 are more likely to be associated with glandular abnormalities, and HPV-16 variants which have a high degree of E7 conservation (compared to the canonical type) confer a worse prognosis than variants with a greater number of nucleotide polymorphisms (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0019">19</link>).

      <para id="ch0127s0002p0001">Cutaneous warts are the most common manifestations of HPV infection, with an estimated prevalence of around 7 to 12% in the general population. The common wart (verruca vulgaris) is frequently caused by HPV-2 and -4 and appears as individual lesions or clusters, most frequently on the hands, particularly near the nail beds. Common warts are particularly prevalent in childhood. Inherently benign lesions, they represent a cosmetic issue and are rarely painful. Plantar warts (verruca plantaris) are caused most frequently by HPV-1; these are often referred to in lay terms as “verrucas” and frequently appear as hyperkeratotic lesions on the soles of the feet, which may be painful, particularly with pressure. Acquisition of plantar warts is associated with swimming pools, where wet skin is more vulnerable to microabrasions, allowing entry of the viral particle to the basement epithelium. Other types of cutaneous warts include periungual warts, associated with nail biting, and the flat wart (verruca plana), which can occur as multiple flesh-colored protrusions often on the face but also on the neck, hands, wrists, and knees. The rarer filiform warts present as elongated lesions on the outer edge of lips or the rims of eyelids. Histologically, warts are associated with hypertrophy of all dermal layers and hyperkeratosis of the horny layer. Regression of warts can occur without intervention, although the key immune drivers of resolution are not well known and recurrence is, unfortunately, common.</para>

They can be found anywhere on the anogenital epithelium, including the vulva, perineum, and penile and perianal areas. The majority of AGWs are caused by HPV-6 and -11. The management and treatment of AGWs represent a significant clinical burden. In a large United Kingdom-based assessment, AGWs accounted for 16 of 100 referrals to genitourinary medicine clinics (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0020">20</link>). While HPV immunization strategies have already reduced the incidence of AGW and this impact can be expected to increase, AGW will remain a significant clinical issue in those not vaccinated (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0021">21</link>). Recurrence of AGWs is common, and another episode is experienced within a year of clearance in about 50% of patients. Symptoms include burning sensation, pruritis, discharge, and bleeding. Genital warts are straightforward to diagnose clinically, so HPV testing to confirm clinical suspicion of warts is not recommended, particularly as knowledge of the HPV type would not inform any management or treatment decisions. Anogenital warts rarely develop into cancer. The rare Buschke-Löwenstein tumor is a slow-progressing tumor that is locally aggressive, similar to verrucous carcinoma. The most common location is on the glans penis, and these lesions are more common in males than females.</para>

The rare autosomal recessive hereditary skin disorder epidermodysplasia verruciformis is a chronic immune disorder that results in high susceptibility to HPV infection at least partially due to impairment of T cell cytotoxicity against HPV-infected cells. Extensive flat and papillomatous warts appearing on the hands, face, trunk, and extremities are characteristic, and malignancies arise in 30 to 70% of patients, particularly in sun-exposed skin. Many HPV types are found in epidermodysplasia verruciformis lesions, including HPV-4, -5, -8, -9, -12, and -15, and concurrent infection with multiple types is common.</para>

The onset may be in childhood (juvenile onset) or in adulthood. Patients usually present with hoarseness, voice changes, or other airway dysfunction such as chronic shortness of breath. Definitive diagnosis of RRP is based on characteristic appearance on endoscopy and histopathology of biopsy. Nearly all RRP lesions are caused by HPV-6 and -11. HPV testing does not have a role in diagnosis or management, although some studies suggest that HPV-11 may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes than HPV-6. Despite the benign histology, significant morbidity occurs due to the frequent need for surgeries, potential damage to vocal cords, and possibility of respiratory obstruction.

Anogenital cancers with an evidence-based HPV etiology are cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and penile cancer, although the attributable fraction of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV)-driven disease varies according to anatomical site (as described below). In addition, certain squamous cell cancers of the oropharynx (the area of the pharynx between the soft palate and the epiglottis) are associated with HR-HPV, most notably the tonsil and the base of the tongue.</para>
      <para id="ch0127s0006p0002">A precursor or preinvasive phase to anogenital squamous cancers exists, called intraepithelial neoplasia, graded 1 to 3 via histopathology, where 3 indicates the greatest degree of abnormality.

Cancer precursors of glandular lesions are rarer than squamous precancers and are designated as adenocarcinoma <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> without grading. The natural history of HPV infection, preinvasive lesions, and cancer is understood most fully for the cervix, and this has informed comprehensive screening options.

        <para id="ch0127s0006s0001p0001">Globally, cervical cancer is the most common HPV-driven cancer, with around 530,000 incident cases per year; however, in the United States, the burden of noncervical HPV-associated cancer surpassed the burden of cervical cancers in 2013 (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0027">27</link>). Around 80% of cancers arise in low- and middle-income countries, where the provision of primary and secondary prevention strategies via vaccination and screening are scarce, as are treatment options. The most common histologic type of cervical cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, arising in the squamous or metaplastic epithelium (70 to 75%). Adenocarcinomas, of glandular origin, are rarer (~20%), and other rare types account for around 5% of cervical cancer. Persistent infection with HR-HPV is the principal risk factor for the development of cervical cancer, and around 95% of such cancers are HR-HPV positive, with HPV-16 and -18 accounting for 70%. Explanations for the absence of HR-HPV in cervical cancer include technical challenges in detecting highly fragmented viral genomes and a “hit-and-run” theory according to which, in some tumors, the virus exerts a malignant phenotype in the earlier stages of lesion development but is no longer present in the cancer. Certainly, there are rare cervical histological subtypes (such as clear cell adenocarcinoma) that are associated with a low prevalence of HPV (&lt;30%) (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0028">28</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0006s0001p0002">With respect to preinvasive lesions, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN 1) is considered a low-grade lesion, characteristic of a productive HPV infection, and is often managed conservatively given the high rate of natural clearance. CIN 2 and CIN 3 are generally considered high-grade lesions (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions). While CIN 3 is less heterogeneous and is a more robust diagnostic entity for significant precancerous disease, CIN 2 is usually the threshold for treatment in countries that have screening programs. Treatment of CIN is via surgical or ablative techniques to remove the affected area, and women who have had high-grade cervical lesions are at a significantly greater risk of recurrence of cervical disease than the general population (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0029">29</link>). While clearance of CIN without intervention does occur, precise data on the rates of clearance, particularly high-grade CIN, are imperfect given the ethical issues pertaining to observational natural history studies. However, as noted earlier, the process from HPV infection to invasive cancer usually takes decades.</para>

Similar to cervical cancer, most anal cancers have an HPV etiology, with the majority caused by HPV-16. The incidence of anal cancer is rising in both women and men for reasons that are not well understood but may be influenced by changing sexual practices. In addition, men who have sex with men are at significantly greater risk of anal cancer, as are people infected with HIV, and this has informed recommendations for targeted vaccination in these groups (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0030">30</link>). Knowledge gaps exist with respect to the natural history and progression rate of preinvasive anal disease to cancer, and while anal cancer screening options (using cytology and referral for high-resolution anoscopy) exist in certain settings, the traction and success of these approaches are behind those for cervical cancer, particularly because interventions to remove anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) can result in significant morbidity (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0031">31</link>). The efficacy of treating high-grade AIN to prevent progression has been demonstrated in a large multicenter randomized controlled trial, the ANCHOR Study (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0032">32</link>).

However, a consistent observation is that 90% of HR-HPV-positive OPSCC is attributable to HPV-16. The incidence of OPSCC has risen dramatically in the last 2 decades, and in some countries, particularly those with cervical screening programs, the incidence of OPSCC may exceed that of cervical cancer. The reasons for the increase in OPSCC have included temporal changes in sexual behaviors, particularly around oral sex practices, although a rise in non-HPV-associated OPSCC—associated with alcohol consumption and tobacco—has also been observed. HR-HPV-positive OPSCC has a better prognosis than its HPV-negative counterpart in terms of disease progression and survival.

They differ in the protein expression system used for production, the adjuvant, and the number of types targeted. Currently, four vaccines are prequalified by WHO, and all target HPV-16 and -18. Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline) and Cecolin (Xiamen Innovax) target those two types (2vHPV); Gardasil (Merck) also targets HPV-6 and -11, the types that cause genital warts (4vHPV); Gardasil 9 (Merck) additionally targets HPV-31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 (9vHPV) (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0037">37</link>).

All four vaccines were originally approved with a three-dose schedule, following a prime-boost system (i.e., an initial dose to prime antibodies, with titers further raised by subsequent doses). Dosing regimens vary somewhat according to country-specific settings, but the WHO recommends two doses for 9- to 20-year-olds and at least two and, where possible, three doses for those who are HIV positive (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0040">40</link>).

        <para id="ch0127s0007s0001p0002">Because HPV cannot be cultured and is cell associated, HPV infection is studied indirectly based on detection and typing of nucleic acid extracts from a particular cellular sample. Samples from one anatomic site give no information about the possibility of infection at a different site. Tissue samples can be used, but for screening and natural history/epidemiology studies, samples collected noninvasively are required. The sample collection methods need to match requirements of the molecular assay, which may vary based on assay format and sensitivity. Requirements for transport and storage depend on the collection medium and the time interval to testing. The main requirement is sufficient preservation of the nucleic acids to allow the HPV assay to be valid. For clinical tests, sample requirements vary, and manufacturer instructions on collection methods, media, transport, and storage must be followed.</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0007s0001p0003">Cervical sampling methods were established following approaches that had been used to optimize collection of exfoliated cells for the Pap test. After visualization of the cervix at the time of speculum examination, cells are collected from the epithelial surface of the transformation zone and endocervix using a variety of collection devices, such as swabs, brushes, or brooms. The collection device is turned a specified number of turns to ensure cellular yield. The cellular sample can be placed in a variety of collections fluids such as STM (Qiagen), PreservCyt (Hologic), or SurePath (Becton Dickinson). While this approach remains the standard for samples used in cervical cancer screening, the development and application of vaginal self-collection methods as a means to reach nonparticipants in cervical screening has accelerated dramatically in recent years (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0047">47</link>).

In most formats, women collect the sample by inserting the collection device into the vagina, similar to the method of inserting a tampon. The collection device can be a simple swab or more complicated specialized device. In addition, first-void urine samples are a means to collect cells from the vaginal pool that represent the cervix, and tailored collection devices designed to enrich and preserve urine for HPV testing show promise, although they add to the overall cost (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0049">49</link>, <link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0050">50</link>). It is likely that innovation and development around self-sampling will continue; however, despite data supporting reliable clinical performance of self-samples, regulatory approval for implementation is lagging, as few HPV tests for clinical use have established a formal claim for use with self-samples. The clinical performance of assays developed and validated for clinician-collected samples will need to be reestablished for self-collected samples. There is evidence suggesting that self-collected samples require target-based amplification tests to achieve clinical sensitivity comparable to that obtained with a clinician-taken sample (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0046">46</link>).</para>

Self-collection methods have been successfully used in epidemiological studies.</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0007s0001p0005">Epidemiological studies of HPV in male genital samples were originally hindered by difficulties in sampling the keratinized penile and scrotal areas.

Methods of nucleic acid extraction need to be optimized (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0051">51</link>). Histologic sectioning must be adapted to avoid PCR contamination (use of disposable fresh blade for each block, the use of gloves, and no water bath). A “sandwich” method of sectioning is recommended which involves cutting the first and last sections for hematoxylin and eosin staining, permitting verification of the lesion in the intervening section used for testing.</para>

In contrast, clinical assays need to evaluate sensitivity and specificity with respect to disease detection (discussed further in “Validation Metrics and Quality Monitoring,” below). This chapter focuses on HPV tests that are used clinically. Current indications for clinical HPV testing are summarized in <anchor id="ch0127s0007s0004a0003"/><link linkend="ch0127s0007s0004a0007">Table 1</link>.</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0007s0004p0002">Nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAATs) are the mainstay of clinical HPV tests, particularly those designed to inform screening and management of cervical disease. In this regard, HPV is no different from other targets in clinical virology laboratories inasmuch as culture and<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> technologies have made way for molecular approaches due to advantages in sensitivity, consistency, and automation. The increase in the number of commercially available HPV tests in the last 15 years has been dramatic, and there is an almost overwhelming choice of assays which vary in their chemistry, level of automation, platform, genotype range, and, importantly, the amount of performance data associated with their application.</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0007s0004p0003">The most recent review of HPV assays that were commercially available in 2020 detailed 254 separate assays (and 425 variants/derivatives thereof) (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0056">56</link>). The vast majority of those assays lacked peer-reviewed publications on analytical and/or clinical performance relative to cervical disease. Given the high prevalence of subclinical HPV infection relative to cervical disease, high analytical sensitivity, while prized for other viruses and in research, is not necessarily an advantage for HPV tests used for cervical screening. The strength of HR-HPV assays for cervical cancer screening rests on their high sensitivity and negative predictive value. Increasing analytic sensitivity can erode clinical specificity, resulting in too many unnecessary referrals for further evaluation. To mitigate against the use of assays that are not fit for the purpose, validation metrics for assays used in cervical screening have been proposed (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0057">57</link>). As described in “Validation Metrics and Quality Monitoring,” below, these require that assays meet a minimum level of technical and clinical performance before they can be endorsed for clinical use. The importance of ongoing validation and verification of HPV assays must be emphasized.</para>
        <para id="ch0127s0007s0004p0004">Broadly speaking, HPV NAATs may be separated by (i) the method of amplification (signal or target), (ii) whether they are DNA or RNA based, and (iii) the level of genotyping they offer (limited, extended, or broad spectrum).<anchor id="ch0127s0007s0004a0004"/><link linkend="ch0127s0008a0005">Table 2</link> shows some examples of assays and their key characteristics, including those listed above. Another conceptual but important category is whether assays have been clinically validated and have regulatory approval for use in cervical screening. Decisions regarding test selection include considerations similar to those for other analytes (<anchor id="ch0127s0007s0004a0005"/><link linkend="ch0127s0008a0014">Table 3</link>). There are currently no commercial assays which offer strict viral load (VL) quantification for HPV. It is difficult to normalize HPV copy number accurately and reproducibly because it is unevenly distributed within lesional and nonlesional tissue. Observed copy numbers could change depending on how well the exfoliated cellular sample represents the lesion. In addition, infections with multiple HPV types are common, and it is not clear whether the cumulative viral copy number or type-specific copy number is more important. Finally, while most studies support an association between increasing HPV-16 VL and the likelihood of CIN 3, it has not been possible to establish a clinically meaningful threshold for risk, for example (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0058">58</link>). Productive infections can actually have higher copy numbers than nonproductive infections, in which HPV may integrate. Recent work indicates that VL at a single time point is less helpful than sequential VL measurement, where the crucial output is not an absolute value but rather the slope between two points (with an exponential, log-type increase being associated with an adverse outcome) (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0059">59</link>). Certainly, most commercially available assays, particularly those used for cervical screening, are validated at the qualitative level, and any semiquantitative measure that can be derived from the data is used according to the particular interest/objective of the user rather than the manufacturer’s stated purpose.</para>

      <para id="ch0127s0008p0001">The majority of NAATs are based on target amplification, frequently PCR but also including transcription-mediated amplification or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification for RNA targets. While a variety of HPV genomic regions may be targeted, assays which amplify L1 are the most common, followed by those that target E6. Furthermore, primer/probe selection may be generic for multiple<emphasis>Alphapapillomavirus</emphasis> species encompassing multiple types or be type specific.</para>
      <para id="ch0127s0008p0002">Assay-reporting strategies vary greatly. They range from visual interpretation of colorimetric hybridization of amplicons to an immobilized array of probes on a strip, to entirely automated real-time PCR systems which automatically convert a cycle threshold (<emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>T</emphasis></subscript>) value to a positive or negative result. Ideally, assays also include concurrent amplification of a human housekeeping or endogenous gene produced in every cell (such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or beta-globin) as a control for sample adequacy. This endogenous control also gives an indication that inhibitors of the reaction are not present. For both indications, the positive-control probe is not a substitute for careful standardized sample collection, and it cannot fully exclude problems.</para>
      <para id="ch0127s0008p0003">Compared to target amplification assays, fewer tests use signal amplification. However, of note, the first HPV test to receive FDA approval for use in cervical screening—the Digene Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA test (HC2; Qiagen)—is based on signal amplification. The HC2 assay is associated with significant longitudinal data on clinical performance and has been used as a comparator against which emerging assays are assessed (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0060">60</link>). As with any assay developed and validated for clinician-collected samples, use with self-collected samples requires reestablishing clinical performance. There is evidence suggesting that self-collected samples (see “Collection, Transport, and Storage of Specimens,” above) require target-based amplification tests to achieve clinical sensitivity comparable to that obtained with a clinician-taken sample (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0046">46</link>).</para>

There is some evidence to indicate that detection of mRNA of oncogenes as opposed to detection of DNA of a structural gene (L1) may reduce detection of transient HPV infection, conferring greater clinical specificity.

These range from large analyzers which can process hundreds of samples per day and incorporate preanalytic solutions for uncapping primary vials to near-patient (point-of-care) tests that can be performed in primary care or the field. Physical separation of high-throughput analyzers into an extraction and amplification platform is increasingly being replaced by single units that incorporate both. In addition, batch processing/testing in a classic 96-well format has made way for random access options with continual loading. Moreover, a number of the higher-throughput assays are delivered on platforms that accommodate other molecular microbial targets, such as<emphasis>Chlamydia trachomatis</emphasis> and blood-borne viruses.</para>

These are important elements when one is considering what may be applicable in low- and middle-income countries. Indeed, certain assays lend themselves to this context more readily, including an assay based on the chemical principles of HC2 but with lower complexity and demands on electricity (Care HPV; Qiagen) and an assay which requires simple addition of 1 mL of sample to a cartridge (Xpert HPV; Cepheid).

Methods that bar code and sequence consensus amplicons of the L1 region provide less information on the virus, but the shorter reads allow increased multiplexing. Improved methods and refinements in bioinformatics pipelines could significantly increase the reliability and decrease the cost of such methods for epidemiological studies. In addition, NGS methods can provide detailed information on HPV variants and integration status.

Therefore, HPV serology is not used clinically, and there are no commercially available assays for detecting HPV antibodies. However, HPV serology is an important research tool and is increasingly important, such as in HPV vaccine trials. The approval of reduced dosing schedules and next-generation biosimilar vaccines may need to rely on the noninferiority of antibody titers (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0075">75</link>). The efficacy of current vaccines makes placebo-controlled trials unethical and is reducing the population burden of targeted types, making disease endpoints and even HPV DNA endpoints infeasible.</para>

Neutralization assays are considered the best correlate of antibody function. These use pseudovirions, L1 VLPs with a signaling plasmid, as a model for infection and require <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> mammalian cell culture. Neutralizing antibodies block pseudovirions from binding and releasing their signaling plasmid into the cells. After washing and evaluation of the signal, the extent of signal reduction induced by the sample compared with a blank provides a semiquantitative measure of neutralizing antibodies. However, neutralizing assays are time-consuming, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) of some form are more often used. Prior to using an ELISA, verification of the correlation between ELISA and neutralization assay results is required. ELISAs can be direct binding assays (generally targeting IgG) or can be competitive, in which case a type-specific monoclonal antibody directed against one neutralizing epitope competes with serum immunoglobulins of any class. Increasingly, immunoassays need to be multiplexed (using multianalyte wells or bead-based methods) to allow monitoring of a response to the nine types targeted by Gardasil 9. Interassay variation can be expected because of differences in the assay design (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0077">77</link>). Use of the parallel-line method of assay interpretation improves interlaboratory comparability. International standards allow results to be reported in international units, the only approach that allows direct comparison between assay formats.

      <para id="ch0127s0009p0001">HPV screening is now a reality in many settings, either as a primary screen or as a cotest with cervical cytology. The high negative predictive value of an HPV test allows screening intervals to be extended, but the high sensitivity comes with a lower specificity, risking overreferral of women for follow-up. Because HPV prevalence is highest in young women (below 25 to 30 years of age), in whom the risk for cervical disease is low, primary screening with HPV testing is generally reserved for women over age 25. This avoids detection of clinically insignificant HPV and improves the specificity for detection of cervical disease. Even with age restriction, additional testing is needed to improve the efficiency of clinical management. Between countries, there is some heterogeneity of practice with regard to how HPV-positive women are triaged (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0078">78</link>). Specific identification of HPV-16 and -18 is one of the more evidence-based indications for referral to colposcopy because of the established higher risk of cervical disease in women with HPV-16 and -18 (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0079">79</link>). There is also some evidence that the HR-HPV group could be further divided into additional categories with discrete risk and associated management guidelines. This would warrant the use of assays with more extensive typing. One natural history study in a large managed care organization in the United States identified four risk groups based on detection of CIN 3+ at seven years (from greatest to least 3-year risk of CIN 3+): (i) HPV-16; (ii) HPV-18 and -45; (iii) HPV-31, -33, -35, -58, and -52; and (iv) HPV-39, -51, -56, -59, and 68 (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0080">80</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0127s0009p0002">Most of the clinically validated, high-throughput HPV assays that have appeared on the market in the last 5 years incorporate a level of typing that includes HPV-16 and -18, with HPV-18 sometimes being indistinguishable from HPV-45 (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0082">82</link>). There is between-assay variation as to whether the typing element is provided concurrently or as a reflex after a positive result. Assays that provide broad-spectrum typing capability (whether confined to high-risk types or not) tend to be less automated/high throughput. FDA-approved assays that offer extended typing beyond HPV-16 and -18, which reconcile with service laboratory demands on throughput, are available. For example, one such assay, the Onclarity HPV test (Becton Dickinson), provides an output that delineates six HPV types individually (HPV-16, -18, -31, -45, -51, and -52) and three groups of HPV types: HPV-33 and -58, HPV-56, -59, and -66, and HPV-35, -39, and -68.</para>

Identification of types that are considered “possibly carcinogenic” does not inform a clear clinical management strategy. Although possibly carcinogenic types may, by definition, be associated with cancer, the frequency of this is so low that they are excluded from the scope of assays approved by regulatory agencies (such as the FDA) for HPV primary cervical cancer screening. The incremental increase in sensitivity achieved by including these additional types does not offset a substantial loss in specificity (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0084">84</link>).

      <para id="ch0127s0010p0001">There is a clear demand to develop assays that can risk-stratify, or “triage,” clinically significant HPV infections from trivial ones that will clear. With the increasing move to molecular HPV testing as a primary screen, this demand becomes particularly apposite. Triage tests are clearly important because they help determine whether a female requires examination at a colposcopy clinic or can be managed more conservatively (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0085">85</link>). Arguably, the triage tests that are the most evidence based for the risk stratification of HPV infection are cytology and limited genotyping (using HPV-16 and -18 typing, as described above in “Typing”). The greater risk of cancer associated with HPV-16 and -18 infection (compared to other HR-HPV types) has justified this triage approach; however, because not all cancers are associated with HPV-16 and -18, women who are HPV positive but HPV-16 and -18 negative still require a level of monitoring. In a similar fashion, while HPV-positive cytology-abnormal women are generally referred for colposcopy, the level of risk in HPV-positive, cytology-normal women is not so low as to recommend discharge to routine recall (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0086">86</link>). So far, the identification of a triage test which offers a binary outcome of referral to colposcopy versus return to routine screening has proved elusive, and this is evidenced in the internationally varied approaches to triage (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0078">78</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0127s0011p0001">The nature of assay validation depends on the application. If the goal is investigative and relies on the discrimination of very low levels of viral target in the sample, then assays with a high analytical sensitivity are required. When the investigative focus relies on longitudinal trends in type-specific prevalence in the population, such as monitoring HPV vaccine impact, long-term assay stability is another important consideration. Use of the same assay with strict monitoring of quality control is required to avoid assay-driven differences confounding real-life changes.</para>
      <para id="ch0127s0011p0002">Regarding assays that are suitable for cervical screening contexts, it is essential that their performance be calibrated to disease endpoints to minimize detection of clinically irrelevant infection. A framework devised in 2009 by Meijer and colleagues set out a pathway for the validation of HPV assays for primary cervical screening in women aged 30 and above, and this process has been adopted widely in the HPV community (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0060">60</link>). In this framework, performance of the candidate assay is assessed relative to that of a gold standard assay with a well-established, acceptable detection capability for CIN 2+. With this framework, which also incorporates a minimum requirement for inter- and intralab reproducibility, samples used for the validation should be derived from a cervical screening context. This is an important element, because although the initial clinical performance data of emerging assays are frequently derived from colposcopy referral populations (given their disease-enriched nature), such referral populations do not resemble primary screening populations with respect to the amount and nature of disease and the relevant demands of the tests thereof. HPV assays that have FDA approval have, so far, particular applications (which include primary screening and triage of low-grade abnormality) paired with particular sample collection and processing methods. As with any assay used for patient management, ongoing validation is multifaceted and dynamic, and while demonstration and verification of performance via FDA approval and/or Conformité Européenne (CE) Mark of European standards are important, so is independent evaluation using the validation frameworks described above. Also as indicated above, relatively few HPV assays (including those validated to the 2009 criteria of Meijer et al. [60]) have a formal claim for self-sampling in the instructions for use – emphasizing the need for local robust validation if a self-sampling approach is introduced for routine use. A consensus approach to the validation of self-samples that incorporates “target” agreement relative to a clinician-taken sample has been proposed (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0088">88</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0127s0011p0003">Demonstration of technical competence in the setting where the assay will be delivered, as well as ongoing quality monitoring and assessment—which include, but are by no means confined to, participation in external quality assessment schemes—is essential (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0089">89</link>). Furthermore, laboratories which perform diagnostic testing are obliged to meet the standards of their external accreditation body; such standards include a sizable component for verification and ongoing quality monitoring, and HPV testing is no exception to such scrutiny. Proficiency testing programs are available for some assays through accrediting groups such as the College of American Pathologists. Usually, these programs use defined samples (cloned DNA) and do not fully evaluate all steps of the assay. The International HPV Center offers a proficiency testing panel for HPV DNA typing that is appropriate for laboratories involved in epidemiology and HPV vaccine monitoring (<link linkend="ch0127s0011s0001li0090">90</link>). Interlaboratory exchange of samples and quality control repeats are also methods to help laboratories ensure the reliability of their results. International standards for HPV DNA and HPV antibodies are available from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls. In addition, plasmid constructs are available from the International HPV Reference Center.</para>
