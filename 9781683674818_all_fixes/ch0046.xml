      <para id="ch0046s0000p0001">The genus<emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> encompasses several prominent pathogenic species, most notably the members of the <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> complex, <emphasis>Mycobacterium leprae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Mycobacterium ulcerans</emphasis>. To date, there are 204 validly published species within the genus, including 13 synonyms (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0006">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0007">2</link>). Most of these are species of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) found in the environment, which exert varying degrees of pathogenicity and virulence.</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0002">Tuberculosis remains one of the world’s largest and most persistent public health challenges and, until the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, held the grim distinction of the greatest global killer due to a single infectious agent. Recent mathematical models estimate that just under a quarter of the global population is latently infected with tuberculosis (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0008">3</link>). According to survey data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Tuberculosis Report from the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era, 10 million new cases of tuberculosis were reported in 2019, half of which were from eight countries: India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0009">4</link>). Although the absolute number of new diagnoses had been increasing globally due to population expansion, the incidence had been declining very slowly over the prior several years by 1 to 2% per year. In 2019, 1.2 million HIV-negative people and 208,000 HIV-positive people died of tuberculosis, a decrease from 1.3 million HIV-negative tuberculosis deaths in 2016. The most recent WHO Report details how the COVID-19 pandemic has reversed recent progress in reducing the global TB disease burden. This regression is attributed to decreased access to TB diagnosis and treatment, with increased TB-related deaths and a halt to prior declines in TB incidence (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0009">4</link>). Drug resistance continues to threaten our ability to successfully treat both latent and active tuberculosis infection. In 2019, about 500,000 new rifampin-resistant tuberculosis infections were detected, of which 390,000 (78%) were multidrug resistant (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0009">4</link>). In this context, the clinical mycobacteriology laboratory plays a pivotal role in helping to achieve the worldwide goal of tuberculosis eradication.</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0003">Apart from the members of the<emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex, the number of described NTM species is increasing, as is the incidence of human infections caused by a subset of them (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0010">5</link>). These infections are often indolent and progressive and predominantly involve the respiratory tract, although localized infections involving skin and soft tissue, joints, or lymph nodes also occur. Thus, rapid and reliable identification of NTM is essential. Overall, the level of service and the choice of methods applied in clinical mycobacteriology laboratories should be determined by the patient population served and by the resources available.</para>

        <para id="ch0046s0000p0004">Traditionally, the genus<emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> has been the only genus in the family <emphasis>Mycobacteriaceae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0011">6</link>) and is related to other mycolic acid-containing genera termed mycolata. However, advances in molecular techniques such as whole-genome and next-generation sequencing have provided greater discriminatory power between closely related species, versus more commonly used methods involving sequencing of a single or limited number of targeted genes. As a result, new sequence-based phylogeny, in conjunction with average amino acid identity, conserved signature indels, and proteins, led to the suggestion in 2018 that the genus <emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> be separated into five distinct genera. The first of these, <emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis>, would contain members of the <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex. The other four genera—<emphasis>Mycobacteroides, Mycolicibacter, Mycolicibacterium</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Mycolicibacillus</emphasis>—would contain other closely related clades of NTM (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0012">7</link>). However, this proposed change was reexamined in 2021 by combining multiple approaches typically used for evaluation of traditional genus boundaries. By examining a combination of 16S rRNA gene similarity, amino acid identity index, average nucleotide identity, and the alignment fraction and percentage of conserved proteins, it was determined that the original genus <emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis>, which is known to contain several clades, should be maintained (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0013">8</link>). Continued use of the single genus <emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis>, versus the proposed division, is also preferable from a clinical perspective, where such changes would present significant challenges in clinical medicine (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0006">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0014">9</link>). In particular, the role of many NTM in human disease has been well characterized, and reassignment to a new genus would create confusion among laboratorians as well as clinicians, with few benefits for patient care. Should the proposed taxonomic division occur, it would result in the following educational and financial requirements to prevent errors: retraining of all laboratory personnel and clinicians, revision of all standard operating procedures and testing algorithms, reconfiguration and modification of all electronic laboratory information systems and electronic medical record systems, and software alteration and revalidation of all related instrumentation used for mycobacterial identification. Given the breadth of systems that would be impacted, the constraints of laboratory budgets and staffing, and other significant costs, such changes would not only have questionable benefit but also be prohibitive to unnecessary implementation.</para>

For these reasons, this chapter will adhere to the description of the single genus,<emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis>, throughout the following sections.</para>

      <para id="ch0046s0000p0006">Members of the genus<emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> are known to contain mycolic acids in their cell wall as do other related genera, varying only by chain length and the presence or absence of different chemical functional groups. Mycobacterial mycolates are α-alkyl, β-hydroxy fatty acids ranging from C70 to C90 and are among the longest of those found in mycolic acid-containing genera. Most of the other mycolata have shorter mycolic acids (<emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis>, C22 to C36; <emphasis>Rhodococcus</emphasis>, C34 to C54; <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis>, C50 to C62; <emphasis>Gordonia</emphasis>, C54 to C66), with the exception of <emphasis>Segniliparus</emphasis>, which has been found to have mycolates ranging from C58 to C100 (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0015">10</link>). Similarly, the G+C content of the DNA of <emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> species ranges from 61 to 71 mol%, except in <emphasis>M. leprae</emphasis>, which is 55 mol%. This range is within that found in other mycolic acid-containing genera such as <emphasis>Gordonia</emphasis> (63 to 69 mol%), <emphasis>Tsukamurella</emphasis> (68 to 74 mol%), <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> (64 to 72 mol%), <emphasis>Rhodococcus</emphasis> (63 to 73 mol%), and <emphasis>Segniliparus</emphasis> (68 to 72 mol%) (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0016">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0017">12</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0007">Mycobacteria are mainly aerobic, nonmotile, slightly curved or straight rods (0.2 to 0.6 μm by 1.0 to 10 μm) that may branch. Controversy exists as to whether members of the genus are capable of forming spores or “spore-like” structures (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0018">13</link>–<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0020">15</link>). Studies to date using <emphasis>M. marinum</emphasis> have demonstrated conflicting results regarding the presence of true endospores and heat resistance (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0018">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0019">14</link>). Additionally, some investigators have questioned the limited number of sporulation-related genes in <emphasis>M. marinum</emphasis> versus those known to exist in other spore-forming organisms. Another species, <emphasis>M. avium</emphasis> subsp. <emphasis>paratuberculosis</emphasis>, was found to produce a mixture of vegetative cells and a previously undescribed morphotype with “spore-like” characteristics after 1 year of incubation. This morphotype was resistant to heat, lysozyme, and proteinase K and positive for <emphasis>M. avium</emphasis> subsp. <emphasis>paratuberculosis</emphasis>-specific sequences (16S rRNA and IS<emphasis>900</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0020">15</link>). Some species, such as <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis>, are known to persist in tissues for months to years without replicating, while retaining the ability to reactivate should immune surveillance wane (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0021">16</link>). This nonreplicating, persistent state has been modeled <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> and demonstrates the ability of <emphasis>M. tuberculosis, M. bovis</emphasis> BCG, and more recently <emphasis>M. avium</emphasis> subsp. <emphasis>paratuberculosis</emphasis> to adapt to anaerobiosis in response to the gradual removal of oxygen from actively growing cultures (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0021">16</link>–<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0023">18</link>). It remains to be discovered whether other species within the genus are capable of anaerobic adaptation.</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0008">Colony morphology varies among the species, ranging from smooth to rough and from nonpigmented to pigmented. Pigmented colonies are regularly or variably yellow, orange, or, rarely, pink, usually due to carotenoid pigments. Some species require light to form pigment (photochromogens), while other species form pigment in either the light or the dark (scotochromogens). Aerial filaments are very rarely formed and never visible without magnification. Filamentous or mycelium-like growth may sometimes occur, but upon slight disturbance, the organism easily fragments into rods or coccoid elements.</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0009">The cell wall peptidoglycolipid contains<emphasis>meso</emphasis>-diaminopimelic acid, alanine, glutamic acid, glucosamine, muramic acid, arabinose, and galactose. Mycolic acids, together with free lipids which intercalate the outer portions of the mycolate layer (e.g., trehalose-6,6′-dimycolate), provide for a hydrophobic permeability barrier (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0024">19</link>). Other important fatty acids are waxes, phospholipids, and mycoserosic and phthienoic acids. Various patterns of cellular fatty acids (whose numbers of carbon atoms range from 10 to 20) are found as well, among which is tuberculostearic (10-<emphasis>R</emphasis>-methyloctadecanoic) acid, a unique cell component for a number of aerobic actinomycetes (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0024">19</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0010">The high content of complex lipids of the cell wall prevents the access of common aniline dyes. Not readily stained by Gram’s method, mycobacteria are stained with special procedures, some of which require the application of heat (e.g., Ziehl-Neelsen staining). They are not easily decolorized, even with acid-alcohol, and they are, therefore, acid fast. However, acid fastness can be partly or completely lost at some stage of growth by a proportion of the cells of some species, particularly the rapidly growing ones.</para>

      <para id="ch0046s0000p0011">Compared to other bacteria, the growth of most mycobacterial species is slow, with generation times ranging from 6 h for<emphasis>M. smegmatis</emphasis>, considered a rapidly growing species, to 24 h for <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex or 36 h for <emphasis>M. ulcerans</emphasis>, both considered slow-growing species (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0025">20</link>). By convention, slow-growing mycobacteria require more than 7 days to produce colonies on solid media from a dilute inoculum under ideal culture conditions, whereas rapid growers, by definition, require less than 7 days to grow in subculture. However, exceptions do occur where a slow-growing species may be recovered in culture in less than 7 days due to a very high burden of organism. Likewise, a rapid grower may take more than 7 days to grow in culture, in particular when the inoculum is low or following exposure to antibiotic therapy. Most mycobacterial species adapt readily to growth on relatively simple substrates, using ammonia or amino acids as nitrogen sources and glycerol as a carbon source in the presence of mineral salts. A few species (e.g., <emphasis>M. avium</emphasis> subsp. <emphasis>paratuberculosis, M. haemophilum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>M. genavense</emphasis>) are fastidious and require supplements such as mycobactin, hemin, or other compounds. Even then, growth may not occur. To date, <emphasis>M. leprae</emphasis> has not been cultured outside living cells. Growth of mycobacteria is stimulated by carbon dioxide and by fatty acids, which may be provided in the form of egg yolk or oleic acid, even though the latter is toxic in high concentrations (≥1%) and has to be neutralized by albumin. Optimum temperatures for growth vary widely among species (from &lt;30 to 45°C).</para>

Mycobacteria are not easily killed by freezing or desiccation but can be killed by heat (for <emphasis>M. avium</emphasis>, for instance, the time necessary to kill 90% of the cells at 60°C is 4 min, but for <emphasis>M. xenopi</emphasis>, it is 33 min) and by UV (sun) light (NTM, for instance, are 2- to 10-fold more resistant to UV irradiation than <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis> [27]). Mycobacteria are more resistant to acids, alkali, and some chemical disinfectants than most other non-spore-forming bacteria. Quaternary ammonium compounds, hexachlorophene, and chlorhexidine are bacteriostatic at best. Proprietary disinfectants recommended as suitable for use in tuberculosis laboratories are those containing phenols, chlorine, or alcohol (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0033">28</link>–<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0035">30</link>). Other commonly used agents, such as ethylene oxide and formaldehyde vapor, as well as disinfectants, such as 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde, 2% peracetic acid, and stabilized hydrogen peroxide, are effective in killing <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex as well. With iodophors, the bactericidal effect depends on the content of available iodine as well as on the presence of organic matter. In their guidelines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggest intermediate-level disinfectants (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0034">29</link>) (see also <ulink url="ch0030#ch0030s0001">chapter 15</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>).</para>

Because <emphasis>M. leprae</emphasis> and <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex organisms are incapable of replication in an inanimate environment, the major ecological niche for them is tissues of humans and warm-blooded animals.</para>
        <para id="ch0046s0000p0015"><emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex is carried in airborne particles (droplet nuclei) generated when patients with pulmonary tuberculosis cough. These particles, 1 to 5 μm in size, can be kept suspended by normal air currents for up to several hours (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0036">31</link>). Infection occurs when a susceptible person inhales the droplet nuclei. The infective dose of <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex for humans is very low (50% infective dose [ID<subscript>50</subscript>], &lt;10 acid-fast bacilli [AFB]). Due to these characteristics of transmission and infectivity, health care-related transmission of members of the <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex from patients or specimens is of major concern to health care workers and laboratory personnel. Specimens from suspected or known cases of tuberculosis must be considered potentially infectious and handled with appropriate precautions (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0034">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0035">30</link>).</para>

Prolonged exposure via sharing close quarters with a leprosy patient increases risk of transmission. Animal reservoirs such as the nine-banded armadillo, the red squirrel, and nonhuman primates have been documented with potential for zoonotic transmission. In addition, several possible environmental reservoirs have been described, but their role in human transmission needs further study.</para>
        <para id="ch0046s0000p0017">The NTM other than<emphasis>M. leprae</emphasis> are free-living mycobacteria usually found in association with water and soil (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0023">18</link>).

For others, such as <emphasis>M. avium</emphasis> complex (MAC) organisms, <emphasis>M. genavense, M. gordonae, M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, M. simiae, M. xenopi</emphasis>, and some rapidly growing mycobacteria (<emphasis>M. abscessus, M. fortuitum, M. mucogenicum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>M. chelonae</emphasis>), tap water, showerheads, ice machines, and associated biofilms have been identified as reservoirs (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0039">34</link>–<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0043">38</link>). The major route of inoculation leading to NTM pulmonary disease is via aerosols. Supporting this hypothesis that pulmonary infection results from at-risk patients inhaling aerosolized NTM organisms in their natural and built environment, patients’ isolates have been found to be genetically identical to those found in their shower heads, potting soil, etc. (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0044">39</link>). Additionally, recent evidence points to possible person-to-person transmission of <emphasis>M. abscessus</emphasis> in the cystic fibrosis patient population (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0045">40</link>).

Such practices require that laboratory access be restricted, that directional airflow be used to maintain the laboratory under negative pressure, that the negative pressure be monitored and recorded, that exhausted air be HEPA filtered, and that workers wear special laboratory clothing, such as impermeable, disposable gowns, double gloves, and respiratory protection (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0034">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0056">51</link>). The stringent biosafety measures may, in the future, induce more laboratories to abandon mycobacterial culture if BSL-3 facilities cannot be afforded.</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0022">All respiratory protective devices (respirators) used in the workplace should be certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0057">52</link>). Respirators that contain a NIOSH-certified N-series filter (not resistant to solids and liquids that contain oil) with a 95% efficiency rating (N-95) are appropriate for use. They meet the recommendations from the CDC for selection of respirators for protection against <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex. Surgical masks are not NIOSH-certified respirators and must not be worn to provide respiratory protection.</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0023">The decision when and if to use respiratory protective devices in the laboratory should be based on risk assessment. A respirator program should be implemented by the laboratory and should include a written protocol describing when respirator use is necessary and the procedures addressing (i) selection of the appropriate respirator, (ii) how to conduct fit testing, and (iii) training of personnel in the use, fit-checking, and storage of the respirator.</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0024">All work involving specimens or cultures, such as preparing smears, inoculating media, adding reagents, opening centrifuge cups, sonication, and setting up molecular tests, must be performed in a BSC. The handling of all specimens suspected of containing mycobacteria (including specimens processed for other microorganisms), with the exception of centrifugation for concentration purposes, must be done within the BSC. Specimens that are to be taken out of the BSC should be covered/contained before transport. All work surfaces, including benchtops and inside the BSC, should be cleaned with an appropriate disinfectant before and after work. Effective disinfectants include Amphyl (Reckitt Benckiser North America, Wayne, NJ) or other phenol-soap mixtures, as well as non-phenol-surfactant mixtures (e.g., Cavicide; Metrex, Orange, CA) and 0.05 to 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (concentrations vary according to the nature of the contaminated surface). Five percent phenol is no longer recommended as a surface disinfectant due to the documented toxicity of this compound to personnel. UV light is a useful adjunct for surface decontamination and may be used to irradiate the work area when it is not in use. Centrifuges should be used with aerosol-free safety carriers, using meticulous processing and analytical techniques to contain debris and infectious aerosols in the event that a tube leaks or breaks. When working in a BSC, use of sterile, disposable loops or electric incinerators is recommended. Use of open flames in a BSC is strongly discouraged. The excess inoculum from inoculating loops, wire, or spades may be removed by dipping the tool into a container of 95% ethanol in washed sand prior to insertion in an incinerator. Disposable inoculating loops are recommended, as are syringes with permanently attached needles if needles are required. An autoclave should be available in an easily accessible area, preferably as a pass-through unit in a BSL-3 laboratory, and used to decontaminate infectious waste before its removal to disposal areas.</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0025">Personnel should be monitored at least annually with either the tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and even more often if a conversion in the laboratory/institution has been documented. Some laboratories require testing at 6-month intervals. Personnel with a positive TST or positive IGRA should be evaluated for active tuberculosis with a chest radiograph and clinical evaluation. Physical examinations should be obtained when necessary. New converters should be referred to the employee health and the infection control departments for epidemiological evaluation. Laboratories should have written protocols describing procedures for handling laboratory accidents. In case of a laboratory accident with possible formation of aerosols, personnel should hold their breath as much as possible, make sure that biological safety cabinets are on and centrifuges are turned off, and then leave the area to get protection as soon as possible, with the door closed for at least 30 min (the amount of time depends on the type of accident, the amount of risk, and the number of air exchanges in the room per hour). Using appropriate respiratory protection devices, personnel can return to the accident area to clean the spill. After such an incident, TST/IGRA-negative personnel should be monitored and retested, preferably using the same method longitudinally. Individuals with reduced immunity, such as those who are pregnant, HIV-infected, or taking immunosuppressive medications, should consult with an occupational health care provider about possible increased risk of laboratory-acquired infection when working directly with<emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex isolates (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0033">28</link>).</para>

The majority originate from the respiratory tract, including sputum, tracheal and bronchial aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. In general, all sputum specimens are processed for mycobacterial smear and culture, including those which appear to be more consistent with saliva, which is counter to procedures routinely followed for bacteriology. Despite its being a suboptimal specimen type, saliva has been demonstrated in previous studies to have clinical utility as a diagnostic tool for detection of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, where positive fluorochrome smears were 76% and 100% for saliva versus sputum and culture positivity was even more comparable (saliva 70%; sputum, 76%) (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0067">62</link>). Other commonly submitted specimen types include urine, gastric aspirates, tissues, biopsy specimens, and normally sterile body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and pleural and pericardial aspirates.

        <para id="ch0046s0000p0029">Specimens should always be collected and submitted in sterile, leakproof, disposable, appropriately labeled, laboratory-approved containers without any fixatives. Generally, transport media or preservatives are not necessary, owing to the robust nature of mycobacteria. Minute biopsy material (e.g., fine-needle aspirates) may be immersed in a small amount of sterile physiological saline. Collection should bypass areas of possible contamination as much as possible, i.e., tap water, since the presence of environmental mycobacteria may result in false-positive smear and/or culture results (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0071">66</link>). In general, swabs are not optimal for the recovery of AFB since they provide limited material, and the hydrophobicity of the mycobacterial cell envelope compromises the transfer of organisms from the swab surface to solid or broth media. If transport to the laboratory is delayed more than 1 h, specimens (except blood) should be refrigerated at 4°C. Likewise, upon arrival in the laboratory, specimens should be refrigerated until processed (see <ulink url="ch0028#ch0028s0001">chapters 13</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0035#ch0035s0001">19</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> for additional information on specimen collection). Processing of inappropriate clinical specimens for mycobacteria is a waste of both financial and personnel resources. There are quite a few reasons why a specimen should not be accepted (and the clinician should be notified), e.g., (i) too small an amount was submitted; (ii) the specimen was submitted on a swab; (iii) the sputum or urine is pooled; (iv) sample containers are broken or leaking; and (v) the interval between specimen collection and processing is too long (&gt;7 days) (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0056">51</link>).

Strict adherence to specimen processing protocols is mandatory to ensure the survival of the maximal number of mycobacteria. No one method of digestion and decontamination is ideal for all clinical specimens, all laboratories, and all circumstances. The laboratorian must be aware of the inherent limitations of the various methods used. Even under the best of conditions, all currently available procedures are toxic for mycobacteria to some extent.</para>

The stronger the alkali, the higher its temperature during the time that it acts on the specimen, and the longer it is allowed to act, the greater will be the killing action on both contaminants and mycobacteria. Harsh decontamination can kill 20 to 90% of the mycobacteria in a clinical specimen (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0056">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0065">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0066">61</link>). Homogenization should occur by centrifugal swirling, and this swirling should not be vigorous enough to allow material to rise to the cap. After agitation, there should be at least a 15-min delay before opening the tube to allow any fine aerosol droplets formed during the mixing to settle.

These agents have no direct inhibitory effect on bacterial cells; however, their use permits treatment with lower concentrations of NaOH, thereby indirectly improving the recovery of mycobacteria. The appropriate concentration of NaOH is dependent on the observed contamination rate for the individual laboratory. If specimens are heavily contaminated, NaOH may be increased (but ideally should not exceed 4%). The most widely used digestion-decontamination method is the NALC–2% NaOH method (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0056">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0065">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0066">61</link>) (see also the appendix).

      <para id="ch0046s0000p0049">Smear microscopy, the most rapid and inexpensive way to diagnose tuberculosis, is preferentially done from digested/decontaminated specimens. As such, smear microscopy is useful as a means of identifying the most contagious patients (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0085">80</link>). Current recommendations in the United States, Canada, and Europe support a 3-smear approach (one of which should be collected in the early morning) when screening patients suspected of having an <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex infection for isolation purposes. In a large retrospective study involving 3 smears/patient, 89% of patients were identified as being AFB smear positive by the first specimen, 7.8% were identified by the second smear, and 3.2% by further smears. This suggests that 2 smears, or more recently, the use of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay (Cepheid) in place of 1 or 2 of the smears, is a more practical approach for discontinuation of respiratory isolation, resulting in reduced hospital expenditures (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0086">81</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0050">The common Gram stain is not suitable for mycobacteria. The organisms may be Gram invisible, may appear as clear zones or “ghosts,” or may appear as beaded Gram-positive rods, particularly with rapidly growing mycobacteria (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0087">82</link>). Special acid-fast staining procedures are necessary to promote the uptake of dyes. Although the exact nature of the acid-fast staining reaction is not completely understood, phenol allows penetration of the stain through the hydrophobic cell wall, which is further facilitated by high temperatures such as those applied, for instance, with Ziehl-Neelsen staining (<anchor id="ch0046s0000a0027"/><link linkend="ch0046s0000a0030">Fig. 1</link>). Mycobacteria are able to form stable complexes with certain arylmethane dyes, such as fuchsin. The cell wall mycolic acid residues retain the primary stain even after exposure to acid-alcohol or strong mineral acids. This resistance to decolorization is required for an organism to be termed acid fast. Certain staining protocols include a counterstain to highlight the stained organisms for easier microscopic recognition. A modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain involving cytospin slides with Triton processing has improved the detection rate of extracellular <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex in CSF and also identified intracellular <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> in neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0088">83</link>).</para>

Unlike with carbol fuchsin, auramine O fluorescence is enhanced upon binding to both DNA and RNA. The advantages of fluorescence microscopy over conventional light microscopy outweigh the higher cost for the microscope for the following reasons: (i) there is a much shorter observation time than with Ziehl-Neelsen staining, (ii) there is no requirement to heat the smear, (iii) the fluorochrome protocol is no more complex than that for carbol fuchsin staining, and (iv) a rapid 2-min stain has been developed which is beneficial to high-volume laboratories (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0089">84</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0046s0000p0052">Because acid-fast artifacts may be present in a smear, it is necessary to view the cell morphology carefully. AFB are approximately 1 to 10 μm long and typically slender rods, 0.2 to 0.6 μm wide, that may appear curved or bent. Individual bacilli may display heavily stained areas and areas of alternating stain, producing a beaded appearance. Assessing AFB morphology for presumptive identification of mycobacterial species has to be done with caution and requires the laboratory personnel to have ample training and experience. In liquid medium,<emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex often exhibits serpentine cording, but cords may occasionally be seen with some NTM species, such as <emphasis>M. gordonae, M. chelonae, M. abscessus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>M. marinum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0090">85</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0091">86</link>). NTM may appear pleomorphic, i.e., as long filaments or coccoid forms, with uniform staining properties. <emphasis>M. kansasii</emphasis> organisms can often be suspected in stained sputum smears by their large size and cross-banding appearance (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0092">87</link>). Less than 10% of cells of rapidly growing mycobacteria may be acid fast and may not stain with the fluorochrome stain (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0093">88</link>). If the presence of a rapid grower is suspected and the results of acid-fast stains, in particular fluorochrome stains, are negative, it may be worthwhile to stain the smear with carbol fuchsin and to use a weaker decolorizing process. Organisms that are truly acid fast are difficult to overdecolorize. The laboratory must be aware that there are nonmycobacterial organisms with various degrees of acid fastness, such as <emphasis>Rhodococcus</emphasis> species, <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> species, and <emphasis>Legionella micdadei</emphasis>, as well as the cysts of <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Cystoisospora belli</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Cyclospora cayetanensis</emphasis> and microsporidia spores.

Since the Kinyoun stain does not require application of heat as does the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, many laboratories use it due to safety considerations.</para>

      <para id="ch0046s0000p0053">Each slide made from a clinical specimen should be thoroughly examined for the presence of AFB.

This prompted the WHO to recommend in 2010 that LED fluorescence microscopy should replace Ziehl-Neelsen stain microscopy for tuberculosis diagnosis.

In a multicountry cross-sectional evaluation, LED fluorescence microscopy and Ziehl-Neelsen smears were compared (three slides for LED fluorescence microscopy versus three Ziehl-Neelsen slides per patient). Sensitivity was 77% for LED fluorescence microscopy and 70% for Ziehl-Neelsen-stained smears, whereas specificity attained 88.1% and 96.5% for the two methods (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0099">94</link>).

If only one or two organisms are seen on an entire smear, this should be noted but not reported. Confirmation of this finding should be attempted by preparation of additional smears from the same specimen or, if possible, smears prepared from a new specimen. Observations made with the fluorochrome smears should be converted to a format that equates these observations with those made with a 100× oil immersion objective. The reliability of smear microscopy is highly dependent not only on the experience of the laboratory personnel but also on the number of AFB present in the specimen. While 10<superscript>6</superscript> AFB/ml of specimen usually result in a positive smear, only 60% of the smears are positive if 10<superscript>4</superscript> AFB/ml are present (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0102">97</link>). The overall sensitivity of the smear has been reported to range from 22 to 80% (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0085">80</link>). An important factor influencing sensitivity is the minimum amount of sputum submitted to the laboratory. In a long-term study, the sensitivity of a concentrated smear from &gt;5 ml of sputum was significantly greater than the sensitivity of a smear processed regardless of volume (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0103">98</link>). Other factors influencing smear sensitivity include the type of specimens examined, staining techniques, the experience of the reader, the patient population being evaluated, and whether the smear has been done with or without pretreatment (indirect versus direct smear). Respiratory specimens yield the highest smear positivity rate (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0085">80</link>).

      <para id="ch0046s0000p0057">The specificity of the smear for the detection of mycobacteria is very high due to the composition of the cell wall mycolic acids, which result in the acid-fast staining characteristics observed for most species within the genus. Ideally, &lt;1% of smear positive results should be culture negative.

A variety of techniques have been used to concentrate mycobacteria from CSF and other body fluids, but comparative data are lacking. Centrifugation is not an effective way to concentrate mycobacteria in body fluids since mycobacteria have a buoyant density of approximately 1; therefore, many organisms remain in the supernatant.

These media have a good buffer capacity and a long shelf life (several months, when refrigerated) and support good growth of most mycobacteria. Also, materials in the inoculum or medium toxic to mycobacteria are neutralized. Disadvantages of these media include variations from batch to batch depending on the quality of the eggs used, difficulties in discerning colonies from debris, and the inability to achieve accurate and consistent drug concentrations for susceptibility testing. When egg-based media become contaminated, they may liquefy.</para>

Petragnani medium contains about twice as much malachite green as does L-J medium and is most commonly used for recovery of mycobacteria from heavily contaminated specimens. American Trudeau Society medium contains a lower concentration of malachite green than L-J medium and is, therefore, more easily overgrown by contaminants, but the growth of mycobacteria is less inhibited, resulting in earlier growth of larger colonies.</para>

          <para id="ch0046s0000p0064">Compared to egg-containing media, agar-based media are chemically better defined. They do not readily support the growth of contaminants; however, the plates are expensive to prepare and their shelf life is relatively short (1 month in the refrigerator). Care should be exercised in the preparation, incubation, and storage of the media, because excessive heat or light exposure may result in deterioration and in the release of formaldehyde, which is toxic to mycobacteria. Agar-based media are transparent and provide a ready means of detecting the early growth of microscopic colonies easily distinguished from inoculum debris. Colonies may be observed in 10 to 12 days, in contrast to 18 to 24 days with egg-based media. Microscopic examination can be performed by simply turning over the plate and examining it by focusing on the agar surface through the bottom of the plate at a ×10 to ×100 magnification. This may provide both earlier detection of growth than unaided visual examination and presumptive identification of the species of mycobacteria present. The use of thinly poured 7H11 agar plates (10 by 90 mm; Remel, Lenexa, KS) facilitates this process, as microcolonies are visible after 11 days (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0107">102</link>). Agar-based media can also be used for susceptibility testing (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0108">103</link>). In the quest for more rapid and affordable growth techniques, microcolony-based culture methods have been developed.

The large amount of oxygen initially present in the medium quenches the fluorescence of the sensor. Growth of mycobacteria or other microorganisms in the broth depletes the oxygen, and the indicator fluoresces brightly when the tubes are illuminated with UV light at 365 nm. For the manual version, a Wood’s lamp or a transilluminator can be used as the UV light source, while in the automated BACTEC MGIT 960 system (see below), tubes are continuously monitored by the instrument.

The MGIT system uses a fluorescence quenching-based oxygen sensor to detect growth. The technology used in the VersaTREK culture system is based on the detection in a sealed bottle of pressure changes in the headspace above the broth medium that result from gas production or consumption due to the growth of microorganisms. The MB/BacT Alert 3D system employs a colorimetric carbon dioxide sensor in each bottle to detect the growth of mycobacteria.

In a meta-analysis of 10 published studies encompassing 1,381 strains from 14,745 clinical specimens, the BACTEC MGIT 960 system revealed sensitivities/specificities in detecting mycobacteria of 81.5%/99.6%. Parrish et al.

Since these systems are monitored continuously, tubes/bottles are incubated on the instruments for the entire duration in the laboratory. As a consequence, these systems are both instrument and space intensive. Some automated systems also lack versatility in that inoculation of blood is not possible, and therefore, additional instruments (e.g., the BACTEC 9050 apparatus with BACTEC Myco/F Lytic medium or the BACTEC 9240 or FX system) are required for this purpose. Myco/F Lytic culture medium consists of Middlebrook 7H9 broth modified with brain heart infusion, specifically designed for the recovery of mycobacteria from blood specimens. Myco/F Lytic medium also supports recovery of yeast and fungi from blood and sterile body fluids. Specific modifications to the medium include the addition of ferric ammonium citrate as an iron source, saponin as a blood lysing agent, and specific proteins and sugars as nutritional supplements. The medium is not selective and thus will support the growth of other aerobic organisms, including bacteria that may interfere with mycobacterial recovery (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0121">116</link>).

Regardless of the system used, the acid fastness of the organism must be confirmed by smear staining. Also, it is highly advisable to subculture the broth onto a sheep blood or chocolate agar plate to rule out contaminants. Once growth of AFB is detected and confirmed by smear microscopy, subculture of the broth to a mycobacterial specific medium (e.g., Middlebrook 7H11 agar) should be done to determine the presence of mixed mycobacterial cultures, to provide agar-based colony morphology to aid in identification, and to provide pure growth for other assays such as susceptibility testing.</para>

Control slides are also commercially available (BBL AFB QC slides; Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD). An increase in the percentage of smear-positive but culture-negative specimens of &gt;2% that cannot be attributed to a response to mycobacterial therapy or the presence of AFB in the negative controls suggests that water or reagents used in the pretreatment or staining procedures were contaminated with NTM.<emphasis>M. gordonae</emphasis>, the <emphasis>M. terrae</emphasis> complex, and <emphasis>M. fortuitum</emphasis> are most often involved. The sensitivity of the AFB smear is directly related to the relative centrifugal force (RCF) (<emphasis>g</emphasis> force) attained during centrifugation.

      <para id="ch0046s0000p0095">Laboratories should also monitor contamination rates (percentage of specimens producing contaminating growth on culture media) for decontaminated specimens. Acceptable contamination rates for solid and broth-based media are detailed above. Rates below 2% usually indicate that the decontamination procedure is too harsh and that the procedure needs to be modified to minimize the lethal effect on mycobacteria. Contamination rates above 5% or 8% for solid and broth-based media, respectively, often indicate a too-weak decontamination, which could compromise mycobacterial cultures due to overgrowth of contaminants. It should be emphasized that the widespread use of liquid media increases the generation of aerosols; as a consequence, the risk of contamination between samples also increases. Laboratories that handle large numbers of isolates of MAC,<emphasis>M. abscessus</emphasis>, or specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis will probably have much higher contamination rates due to the high incidence of colonization of the sputum with Gram-negative bacteria, especially <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="ch0046s0000p0096">Culturing mycobacteria is naturally prone to errors because of the multiple steps involved in processing cultures, the viability of mycobacteria for long periods in a laboratory environment, and the large number of mycobacteria present in some specimens (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0081">76</link>). False-positive cultures may result from mislabeling, specimen switching during handling, specimen carryover (including proficiency testing specimens), contaminated reagents, or cross-contamination between culture tubes or vials (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0056">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0000li0081">76</link>). Inclusion of a positive control (e.g., a suspension of <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex) in the processing of patient specimens is discouraged due to the risk of cross-contamination. Standardized laboratory procedures that minimize the potential for errors leading to false-positive cultures should be followed, and mechanisms should be in place to rapidly recognize their occurrence. Transfers or inoculation of cultures must be accomplished by using individual transfer pipettes, single-delivery diluent tubes, or disposable labware. The order in which specimens are processed and media are inoculated should be recorded. The number of specimens processed at a given time should be restricted to no more than 8 to reduce the risk of cross-contamination and to guarantee that there is appropriate decontamination time. A negative-control specimen following processing of patient specimens with the same digestion or decontamination solution can be used for detecting possible specimen contamination of the solutions. Alternatively, processing solutions may be cultured directly. Laboratories should prospectively track positivity rates. The significance of an isolate may be determined by reviewing the order in which specimens were handled for all manipulations (e.g., initial processing, liquid-medium readings, subculturing), the direct-smear results, the time to positivity, and the clinical history. Since the introduction of molecular fingerprinting of <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex strains, false-positive cultures have been demonstrated to occur more frequently than previously assumed. False-positive cultures were identified in a number of studies that evaluated ≥100 patients, with a median false-positivity rate of 3.1%. Remarkably, of the 236 patients with false-positive cultures, 67% were treated and underwent unnecessary hospitalization (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0081">76</link>). The deleterious impact of these undesirable events may be minimized if the evidence of false positivity is established in a timely manner and a rapid molecular method of fingerprinting is available. Single positive cultures of <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex strains grown from AFB smear-negative specimens in the absence of clinical signs of tuberculosis should be analyzed by a PCR-derived or whole-genome sequencing typing technique to rule out laboratory contamination (<link linkend="ch0046s0000li0056">51</link>).
