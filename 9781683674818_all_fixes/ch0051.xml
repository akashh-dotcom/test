        <para id="ch0051s0001s0001p0001">Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria encompass some of the most frequently encountered bacteria in the clinical microbiology laboratory, and approximately one-third of the chapters in the Bacteriology section of this<emphasis>Manual</emphasis> are assigned to these bacteria. Medically important pathogens include the <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> (notably <emphasis>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> spp.), glucose nonfermenters (e.g., <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii</emphasis>), fastidious organisms (e.g., <emphasis>Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> spp.), and remarkable zoonoses (<emphasis>Bartonella henselae, Francisella tularensis</emphasis>). Most of these bacteria are rod-shaped, but <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Moraxella catarrhalis</emphasis> are diplococci, and some organisms, in particular fastidious organisms, are coccobacilli (<emphasis>H. influenzae</emphasis>). The description of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria is long established, based on culture conditions and the failure to retain crystal violet-iodine complex by Gram’s staining method. Cellular morphology is of less importance in this context, as curved or spiral-shaped rods are excluded from the group and discussed in <ulink url="ch0076#ch0076s0001">chapters 59</ulink> through <ulink url="ch0080#ch0080s0001">63</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis> In addition to categorical characteristics, the delineation of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria has been influenced by clinical significance and, more recently, taxonomic scrutiny based on DNA sequencing. It is helpful to recapitulate the characteristics of the group in the context of laboratory practice and nomenclatural changes.</para>

The principles aim at stability of names, and avoid the useless creation of names. Names of all taxa are Latin or latinized words treated as Latin regardless of their origin. The name of a taxon should not be changed without sufficient reason, and a taxon can bear only one correct name, based upon valid publication, legitimacy, and priority of publication. The ICNP distinguishes five categories of names: legitimate, illegitimate, effectively published, validly published, and correct. Legitimate names are formed according to the rules of the code; validly published means registered either in the Approved Lists, or by subsequent original publication in the <emphasis>International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</emphasis> (IJSEM) or its Validation Lists. Correct names will be discussed below. To comply with the principles, names that are effectively, but not validly, published will be provided between quotation marks. Whenever possible, the type of a species is a designated strain. The type strain is made up of living cultures of an organism, descended from a strain designated as the nomenclatural type.</para>

        <para id="ch0051s0001s0003p0001">In contrast to the regulation of names by the ICNP, there is no official taxonomic classification of prokaryotes. Among a set of validly published names for a taxon, the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN;<ulink url="https://lpsn.dsmz.de/">https://lpsn.dsmz.de/</ulink>) selects a certain name as the correct name. The correct name is usually, but not always, the most recent of the validly published names. There are three validly published names based on the same type (i.e., homotypic synonyms) for a species known as <emphasis>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0002">2</link>), <emphasis>Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0010">10</link>), and <emphasis>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0011">11</link>), in addition to the effectively published description from 1912, “<emphasis>Bacterium actinomycetemcomitans</emphasis>” (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0012">12</link>). The most recent name, <emphasis>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</emphasis>, is the correct name according to LPSN, with the kind note that one of the other validly published names is the correct name if this species is regarded as a separate species within the genus <emphasis>Actinobacillus</emphasis> or <emphasis>Haemophilus</emphasis>, respectively.</para>

In contrast, members of the genus <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> are detailed in a separate chapter because of high pathogenicity, laboratory safety considerations, and notification to public health authorities (<ulink url="ch0067#ch0067s0001">chapter 50</ulink>). Reporting of <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> species may elicit serious clinical concerns, and it is questionable whether reclassification of <emphasis>Ochrobactrum</emphasis> is helpful. Additionally, the scientific argument for renaming of <emphasis>Ochrobactrum</emphasis> as <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> has been disputed (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0015">15</link>). While the two taxa have similar core genomes, their accessory genomes are unrelated. <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> species contain a closed pangenome of ≤3.4 Mb, whereas <emphasis>Ochrobactrum</emphasis> species contain an open pangenome involved in lateral transfer, with genome sizes of ≥4.7 Mb. Moreover, the organisms have different habitats and belong to different risk groups. Similar concerns may be raised regarding reassignment of <emphasis>Enterobacter aerogenes</emphasis> (with chromosomally encoded, inducible AmpC) as <emphasis>Klebsiella aerogenes</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0016">16</link>). The risk that this may trigger an increased but objectionable prescription of cephalosporins, because of anamnestic success with treatment of other <emphasis>Klebsiella</emphasis> species that do not harbor an inducible <emphasis>ampC</emphasis> gene on their chromosome (see <ulink url="ch0090#ch0090s0001">chapter 72</ulink>), must be addressed by close consultation with prescribers, antimicrobial stewardship teams, and infection control committees.</para>
        <para id="ch0051s0001s0003p0003">The lack of an official classification obliges the bacteriologist to choose between names according to scientific judgment. According to the College of American Pathologists (MIC.11375 Taxonomy Changes Phase I), the laboratory is required to review taxonomic changes that potentially affect the choice and/or the interpretative breakpoints of appropriate antimicrobials. Pending recommendations from national or international societies, or from health authorities, it is advisable to introduce nomenclatural changes in a thoughtful way.

        <para id="ch0051s0001s0004p0001">The Gram stain is the first step in the preliminary identification of a cultured bacterium. The method separates Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, although not all bacteria are classified by the technique. The classical relevance of the staining method is demonstrated by the suggestion of bacterial “divisions” (“<emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis>,” “<emphasis>Gracilicutes</emphasis>,” and <emphasis>Mollicutes</emphasis>) in 1978, when cell wall structures were identified as the biologic basis of Gram stain reactivity (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0017">17</link>). Gram-positive bacteria belong to bacterial phyla “<emphasis>Actinobacteria</emphasis>” and “<emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis>,” which were recently renamed and validated as <emphasis>Actinomycetota</emphasis> and <emphasis>Bacillota</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0019">19</link>). The biological significance of the cell envelope has prompted alternative designations, such as monoderm and diderm, to herald the presence of single or two membranes in Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, respectively. Whether the monoderm or the diderm phenotype is ancestral is disputed (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0021">21</link>). Several true Gram-negative genera belong to the classically Gram-positive phylum “<emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis>” (class <emphasis>Negativicutes</emphasis>).

        <para id="ch0051s0001s0005p0001">It is a truism that oxygen is an oxidant, but coexistence with this chemical element varies between organisms. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen in order to create ATP, but obligate aerobic bacteria can multiply in the absence of oxygen if an alternative electron acceptor is provided in the medium. Fermentation produces enzymatic changes in organic substrates, and the metabolic process is common to prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Louis Pasteur conceptualized fermented beverages to be the result of the action of microorganisms, and defined the process as respiration in the absence of air (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0023">23</link>). Fermentation and anaerobic metabolism have been considered synonymous since Pasteur demonstrated that acids and alcohols are major end products of carbohydrate degradation when oxygen is excluded from the system. Obligate anaerobic bacteria will not grow in the presence of oxygen, but loss of viability at ambient air varies considerably between anaerobic bacteria. Finally, microaerophilic organisms require environments with reduced levels of dioxygen (typically 2 to 10% O<subscript>2</subscript>) for optimal growth. Thus, microbial categorization is linked to practical conditions for optimal or achievable bacterial growth on standardized media, rather than bacterial use of oxygen for production of energy. Obligate aerobic bacteria (or nonfermenters) grow in the presence, but not absence, of atmospheric oxygen; obligate anaerobic bacteria grow in the absence, but not presence, of atmospheric oxygen; aerobic fermenters (or facultative anaerobes) can be cultured in both the presence and absence of atmospheric oxygen; and microaerophiles have optimal growth at reduced levels of oxygen. The designation “aerobic bacteria” excludes obligate anaerobes while encompassing the three other types.</para>

It is widely used as a selective agar because the content of bile salts and crystal violet dye suppresses growth of most Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., <emphasis>Pasteurella multocida</emphasis> or other more fastidious Gram-negative organisms; see section below). Furthermore, the medium is differential by indicating whether or not an organism is a lactose fermenter and can aid in initial identification and workup of a Gram-negative organism. For example, as part of the workup, if a lactose fermenter is detected, that would sufficiently rule out the glucose nonfermenters, and further identification should focus on distinguishing the type of fermenter present (e.g., indole to distinguish between the lactose-fermenting <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>), whereas the lack of lactose fermentation may focus on distinguishing <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> that are non-lactose fermenters from the glucose nonfermenters with an oxidase test.</para>

        <para id="ch0051s0001s0007p0002">Nonfermenters are usually referred to as strict aerobes, although some nonfermenters, such as all denitrifiers (producing nitrogen gas from nitrite), can grow anaerobically when nitrate and/or nitrite is available as an alternative electron acceptor in oxidative respiration, instead of gaseous oxygen. Based on the presence of oxidase and pyoverdin, plus four biochemical tests (production of H<subscript>2</subscript>S, indole, trypsin, and pyrrolidonyl aminopeptidase), the dichotomous identification algorithm for aerobically growing nonfermenters provided in the 11th edition of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> discriminates eight groups of Gram-negative nonfermenters (<anchor id="ch0051s0001s0007a0003"/><link linkend="ch0051s0001s0007a0006">Table 1</link>). Production of pyoverdins is a strong characteristic of <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> spp.; the yellow-green, water-soluble, fluorescent pigment is a powerful Fe<superscript>3+</superscript> scavenger and transporter.

The 16S rRNA gene is present in all prokaryotic cells and is rarely subject to horizontal gene transfer. The gene is relatively large (~1,500 bp) and contains both conserved and variable regions. The variable regions evolve at a different rate from the conserved regions, allowing the distinction of different taxa. Sequences flanking the variable regions are well conserved, facilitating design of universal primers. These characteristics allow the use of 16S rRNA gene sequences for bacterial phylogeny and identification (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0049">49</link>–<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0051">51</link>).</para>

The level of variation within the variable regions differs, with hot spots which display larger numbers of mutations. These areas differ among bacterial species, and different regions provide varying phylogenetic resolution for different groups of bacteria (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0049">49</link>). Determination of the full-length sequence of the 16S rRNA gene has been limited by either cost or sequencing technology, and thus often only partial sequences are analyzed. Due to the variation in informative nucleotide positions within the regions of the 16S rRNA gene, careful selection of an optimal 16S rRNA gene region is critical for studying bacterial phylogeny or assigning correct identity to an isolate. Usually the first 500 bp of 16S rRNA (spanning variable regions V1 to V2) are most commonly used for in-house PCR amplification (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0053">53</link>), while primers spanning V4 to V6 were developed to examine bacterial communities in the Baltic Sea (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0054">54</link>) and were subsequently introduced into the Illumina 16S metagenomic sequencing protocol.

        <para id="ch0051s0001s0009p0003">The choice of 16S rRNA gene region also depends on the available sequencing technology. While traditional Sanger sequencing produces reads longer than 500 bases, it is low throughput. Next-generation sequencing technologies handle a much larger throughput, but often generate shorter reads. Currently, short-read sequencing technologies are becoming widely used for comparison with 16S rRNA gene databases, particularly for study of microbial communities. However, for some species-level resolution, a full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence may be needed. Novel alternatives to traditional sequencing for obtaining full-length sequences include single-molecule real-time sequencing (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0058">58</link>) and Nanopore sequencing (<link linkend="ch0051s0001s0012s0003li0059">59</link>).

Amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene will expand the scope of the laboratory, from detection of specific pathogens to assessment of the complete microbiota of samples. PCR analyses have replaced culture in clinical virology, and certain PCR tests—such as the rapid detection of common meningitis pathogens—have become indispensable. However, classical culture of clinically important bacteria appears invulnerable in the foreseeable future. When a bacterium is cultured, it can be formally named and fully characterized with the generation of phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility profiles to guide therapy. Bacterial culture is crucial for elucidation of outbreaks and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, but molecular methods have potential for rapid delivery of relevant information to clinicians.</para>
