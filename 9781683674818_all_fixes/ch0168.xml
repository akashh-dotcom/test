        <para id="ch0168s0002s0001p0001">The<emphasis>C. belli</emphasis> life cycle is direct (monoxenous), but evidence exists that it can be facultatively heteroxenous (use two hosts). <emphasis>C. belli</emphasis> oocysts are passed in the feces unsporulated or partially sporulated (<link linkend="ch0168s0002s0001a0006">Fig. 1C</link> and <link linkend="ch0168s0001a0004">D</link>, <anchor id="ch0168s0002s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0168s0002s0003a0003">2B</link>, <anchor id="ch0168s0002s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0168s0002s0004a0003">3G</link> and <link linkend="ch0168s0002s0001a0004">H</link>). Oocysts generally complete sporulation within 72 h, although sporulation time varies between 24 h and more than 5 days, depending on temperature and humidity. Sporulated oocysts typically contain two sporocysts, each with four sporozoites. However, oocysts of <emphasis>C. belli</emphasis> containing a single sporocyst with eight sporozoites have been reported to comprise up to 5% of the sporulated oocysts in a sample (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0003">3</link>). The prepatent period, the time it takes for unsporulated oocysts to appear in the feces after sporulated oocysts are ingested, is 9 to 17 days (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0004">4</link>). The patent period, the time from when oocysts are first excreted in the feces until they can no longer be observed in the feces, is quite variable and depends on the immune status of the infected individual. Oocysts can usually be found for 30 to 50 days in immunocompetent patients, while immunosuppressed patients may continue to shed oocysts for 6 months or more (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0005">5</link>). Recurrence of oocyst shedding is common. This prolonged oocyst shedding in immunosuppressed patients is presumably due to recycling of one or more schizogenous stages or activation of dormant extraintestinal monozoic tissue cysts (<anchor id="ch0168s0002s0001a0005"/><link linkend="ch0168s0002s0006a0003">Fig. 4</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0168s0002s0001p0002">Developmental stages of<emphasis>C. belli</emphasis> have been reported in intestinal biopsy specimens of the duodenum, jejunum, and occasionally ileum, and oocysts can be aspirated directly from the duodenal contents. Intestinal development occurs predominantly in epithelial cells, although schizonts (meronts) are occasionally reported from the lamina propria or submucosa (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0006">6</link>). At least two generations of schizonts, as well as macrogametocytes (female sexual stage), microgametocytes (male sexual stage), and unsporulated oocysts, have been observed.</para>
        <para id="ch0168s0002s0001p0003"><emphasis>C. belli</emphasis> sporozoites/merozoites can travel extraintestinally, becoming dormant as single-organism-containing tissue cysts (<link linkend="ch0168s0002s0006a0003">Fig. 4</link>) in a variety of tissues, including lamina propria, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0007">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0009">9</link>). These cysts are commonly termed monozoic tissue cysts (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0007">7</link>). Monozoic tissue cysts in histological sections are thick walled and measure 12 to 22 by 8 to 10 μm, and each contains a single dormant sporozoite or merozoite of about 8 to 10 by 5 μm (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0008">8</link>). Presumably, the monozoic tissue cysts are capable of reactivating patent infections once immunity wanes. Monozoic tissue cysts can be present in the lamina propria in the absence of oocysts in stool samples (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0009">9</link>). <emphasis>C. belli</emphasis> zoites were observed in blood smears from an HIV-infected patient who had chronic diarrhea and disseminated monozoic tissue cysts (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0009">9</link>).</para>

The precise prepatent period is not yet known. However, the onset of clinical signs following infection generally averages 7 to 8 days postinfection and lasts 2 to 3 weeks, but this may range from 1 to more than 100 days. The length of time that oocysts are shed in the feces is highly variable. Oocysts may be shed in the feces for anywhere from 7 days to several months. Relapse of diarrhea can occur in up to 25% of infected individuals (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0013">13</link>). Indigenous infections are confined primarily to tropical, subtropical, or warm temperate regions of the world.

Infection occurs when raw or undercooked meat containing sarcocysts is ingested. Known intermediate hosts include cattle (<emphasis>Bos taurus</emphasis>), American bison (<emphasis>Bison bison</emphasis>), water buffaloes (<emphasis>Bubalus bubalis</emphasis>), and wisents (European bison; <emphasis>Bison bonasus</emphasis>). These intermediate hosts harbor sarcocysts (muscle cysts) that are infective when ingested by humans. Infective bradyzoites (dormant merozoite-like stages) are present in the sarcocysts. The bradyzoites penetrate the human intestinal epithelium and develop as sexual stages (macrogametocytes and microgametocytes) in cells in the lamina propria of the intestine. Fertilization occurs, and the oocysts sporulate in the lamina propria. The oocysts are <emphasis>Cystoisospora</emphasis>-like and contain two sporocysts, each with four sporozoites. The oocyst wall often ruptures as the oocyst makes its way to the intestinal lumen. This results in the shedding of individual sporocysts in the feces (<link linkend="ch0168s0002s0004a0003">Fig. 3A</link> through <link linkend="ch0168s0002s0001a0004">C</link>).

In addition, a few muscular biopsies from symptomatic patients associated with outbreaks of muscular sarcocystosis in Malaysia have been examined morphologically. Humans become infected after ingesting<emphasis>Sarcocystis</emphasis> species sporocysts in contaminated food or water. One to two generations of precystic schizogony presumably occur in endothelial cells in capillaries throughout the body. The final generation of merozoites penetrates striated muscle cells and transforms into metrocytes. Metrocytes divide by endodyogeny to produce bradyzoites within the sarcocyst. Clinical signs probably arise from schizogony occurring in endothelial cells of capillaries and the host reaction to developing sarcocysts in muscles (i.e., eosinophilic myositis). There are several distinct structural types of sarcocysts present in human muscles (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0018">18</link>), suggesting that as many definitive hosts may be able to produce sporocysts infective for humans. Many of these sarcocysts appear similar to sarcocysts found in non-human primates, for example, <emphasis>Sarcocystis nesbitti</emphasis> found in rhesus monkeys (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0019">19</link>). <emphasis>S. nesbitti</emphasis>-like DNA has been demonstrated in muscle biopsies from individuals who have traveled to Malaysia and developed muscular sarcocystosis (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0020">20</link>).

Most cases of infection in temperate areas involve foreign travel or anal sexual contact. Transmission is via ingestion of sporulated oocysts and possibly the ingestion of raw or undercooked tissues from unknown paratenic hosts. An outbreak of <emphasis>C. belli</emphasis> infections involving approximately 90 patients was reported in the city of Antofagasta, Chile, in 1977 (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0022">22</link>).

      <para id="ch0168s0004p0001"><emphasis>C. cayetanensis</emphasis> is endemic in Central and South America, the Caribbean, Mexico, Indonesia, Asia, Nepal, Africa, India, southern Europe, and the Middle East. In areas of endemicity, there is an increased risk of <emphasis>C. cayetanensis</emphasis> infection with contact with soil (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0023">23</link>) and water (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0025">25</link>). Infections in most temperate areas are correlated with the consumption of imported, contaminated fruits and vegetables, such as basil, raspberries, lettuce, mesclun, and snow peas. In the United States, cyclosporiasis is a nationally notifiable disease, and health care providers should report suspected and confirmed cases of infection to public health authorities. The number of cyclosporiasis cases reported in the United States has increased notably since 2012, partly due to the introduction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared BioFire FilmArray gastrointestinal multiplex panel (bioMérieux, Salt Lake City, UT), which simultaneously detects 22 different pathogens, including <emphasis>C. cayetanensis.</emphasis> Before the availability of this test, health care providers had to specifically order testing for <emphasis>C. cayetanensis</emphasis> because testing for <emphasis>C. cayetanensis</emphasis> was not routinely done in most U.S. laboratories, even when stool was tested for parasites. The use of the FilmArray test contributed to the early detection of a large multistate outbreak in 2013, concentrated in Iowa (153 cases) and Nebraska (86 cases) and linked to a restaurant-associated salad mix that contained iceberg lettuce, romaine lettuce, red cabbage, and carrots (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0026">26</link>). Another outbreak that same year was linked to fresh cilantro (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0026">26</link>) and was associated with a Mexican-style restaurant (22 of 30 patrons) in Texas (278 cases). In 2018, two major multistate outbreaks were investigated, the first associated with fresh veggie trays and the second with a prepackaged salad (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0027">27</link>). Large multistate outbreaks were also identified the following years, linked to basil in 2019 and another type of prepackaged salads in 2020 (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0029">29</link>). However, many domestically acquired cases and smaller clusters are never resolved, and the source of the contaminated food item is rarely identified. Recent laboratory testing of food using NAAT has detected <emphasis>C. cayetanensis</emphasis> DNA in leafy greens and herbs harvested in the United States (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0030">30</link>–<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0032">32</link>). This has raised suspicion that some of the cyclosporiasis cases detected in the United States could be linked to domestically grown produce. However, as of now, there is no definitive link between contaminated domestic food items and cases of cyclosporiasis detected in the United States.</para>

Universal precautions should be followed when fresh stool samples are handled. If samples are to be sent to another laboratory for diagnosis, they should be fixed in an appropriate fixative. A 5% or 10% formalin solution is an appropriate fixative for morphologic identification of intestinal coccidia in stools, as oocyst and sporocyst structure is stable for several months when stools are stored at 4°C in formalin fixatives. However, formalin-containing fixatives are not suitable for molecular detection and genotyping. Thus, it is recommended to use either a two-vial collection system with formalin plus polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), or a one-tube fixative such as any of several “eco-friendly” alcohol-based preservatives suitable for NAAT assays. Stool collected in Cary-Blair or other transport media intended for bacterial culture are likewise appropriate for NAAT analysis. For commercial NAAT assays, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for compatible specimen types and submission conditions.</para>

Few laboratories employ sucrose concentration, and fortunately, direct wet smears can be very useful: their utility approaches that of sucrose centrifugal flotation when coupled with autofluorescence examination (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0064">64</link>). Staining procedures may adversely affect the autofluorescence of oocysts and sporocysts; in particular, the use of iodine in wet mounts should be avoided (iodine can mask or inhibit autofluorescence of oocysts under UV illumination). Likewise, for stools stored or submitted in 2.5% aqueous potassium dichromate (sometimes used during sporulation attempts), dichromate should be removed by washing (via centrifugation) with saline, water, or other appropriate buffers or it will suppress autofluorescence under UV illumination.</para>

Elevations in liver function tests and nausea are potential side effects of orally administered nitazoxanide.</para>

Another alternative agent is ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone that inhibits topoisomerase. In a randomized study of 20 patients with cyclosporiasis, all of the 9 patients who received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had a cessation of diarrhea within 3 days, and 10 of 11 who received ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) had a cessation of diarrhea within 4 days; however, only 7 of 11 patients treated with ciprofloxacin cleared the organism from the stool (<link linkend="ch0168s0017s0002li0118">118</link>).

Quantitation of the number of organisms found per high-power field is not required. Stool examinations by microscopy that are reported as negative should indicate that at least three stool examinations are needed to detect organisms in 95% of infected individuals and that a single specimen may miss as many as 30% of infected patients. If acid-fast or similar stains are done on the stool examination and are positive, then this should be indicated in the report. Computer report notes can indicate that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice for treatment of these parasites. PCR can be used for the identification of these organisms but is not commercially available for <emphasis>Sarcocystis</emphasis> spp. and should be indicated as an experimental test. Commercially available and forthcoming NAAT assays can identify <emphasis>C. cayetanensis</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. belli</emphasis> in stool. Of the coccidia discussed here, only <emphasis>C. cayetanensis</emphasis> is nationally notifiable to state health departments and the CDC, as it has been associated with outbreaks and the contamination of human food sources.
