        <para id="ch0130s000000p0003">Virions are large and brick shaped (OPXVs, yatapoxviruses, and molluscipoxvirus) or ovoid (parapoxviruses). Virions range in length from 220 to 450 nm and in width and depth from 140 to 260 nm. The appearances of virions under an electron microscope vary somewhat with sample preparation. By cryo-electron microscopy, in unstained, unfixed vitrified specimens, vaccinia virus (VACV) appears as smooth, rounded rectangles and has a uniform core surrounded by a 30-nm-thick membrane. In conventional negatively stained thin sections, the core appears dumbbell shaped and is surrounded by a complex series of membranes. Lateral bodies occupy the space between the outer membrane and the bar of the dumbbell and may play a role in immunomodulation (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0001">1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0130s000000p0004">Virus particles contain about half of the approximately 200 proteins encoded by the viral genome. Virions consist of structural proteins and enzymes, including a virtually complete RNA polymerase system for primary transcription of viral genes (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0002">2</link>). The genome is a 130- to 375-kbp (depending upon the genus) double-stranded DNA molecule that is encapsidated in a nucleoprotein complex inside the core. The genome is covalently closed at each end, and its ends are hairpin-like telomeres. Complete genome DNA sequences have been reported for several different poxviruses. GenBank entries are compiled at a dedicated website (<ulink url="https://4virology.net">https://4virology.net</ulink>).</para>
        <para id="ch0130s000000p0005">During virus replication (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0002">2</link>), virion morphogenesis begins in the cytoplasm in areas known as cytoplasmic viral factories, where cellular organelles are largely absent. Thin-section electron microscopy observations of cells early after infection show crescent-shaped membrane structures, which progress to ovoid structures, called immature virions, which enclose a dense nucleoprotein complex. Primary transcription precedes the production of the crescents (cup shaped in three dimensions) and the immature virions. Brick-shaped, membrane-covered mature virions (MVs; also known as intracellular MVs) form as the viral core condenses. These features aid the electron microscopist in the identification of poxviruses in clinical materials (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0003">3</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0130s000000p0006">A small portion of MVs may be further transported on microtubules from the viral factory and processed to acquire a bilayer tegument (envelope) of Golgi or endosomal membrane that contains specific viral proteins. The intracellular enveloped MV then moves along cellular microtubules to the cell surface, where the outermost membrane fuses with the cellular membrane to reveal a cell-associated enveloped virus (EV) on the cell surface (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0002">2</link>). The cell-associated EV can prompt actin polymerization behind the virion, which may facilitate cell-to-cell infection with virus. EVs can also exit the cell to spread more distantly.</para>
        <para id="ch0130s000000p0007">To date, cellular proteins that function as a poxvirus receptor have not been identified. EV and MV forms of VACV attach to cells differently; however, the MV membrane possesses an entry-fusion complex required for entry into the host cell. The common result of entry is uncoating of the particle, release of viral contents into the cell, and initiation of virus-controlled transcription of early-class proteins. Reviews of virion entry, morphogenesis, and exiting processes have been published (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0004">4</link>–<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0007">7</link>).</para>

The virus was most often transmitted between humans by large-droplet respiratory particles inhaled by susceptible persons who had close, face-to-face contact with an infectious person. It was spread less commonly by aerosol, by direct contact with the rash lesion, or by sloughed crust material from the scab (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0012">12</link>). Smallpox is no longer found in nature after a coordinated global vaccination campaign, and the known stocks of VARV are held at two World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centers.</para>

        <para id="ch0130s000000p0011">Human monkeypox was first reported in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Since 1970, the disease has been seen in Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and Gabon, but most cases have been in the DRC. In the 1980s, serosurveys and virologic investigations in the DRC by the WHO indicated that (i) monkeys are sporadically infected, as are humans; (ii) three-fourths of cases, mainly those in children under 15 years of age, were from animal contact; (iii) the protective efficacy of smallpox vaccination is about 85%; (iv) MPXV has a broad host range, including squirrels (<emphasis>Funisciurus</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Heliosciurus</emphasis> spp.); and (v) human monkeypox has a secondary attack rate of 8% among unvaccinated contacts within households (i.e., it is much less transmissible than smallpox). In an outbreak in the DRC, about 250 serosubstantiated cases of monkeypox occurred among 0.5 million people in 78 villages from February 1996 to October 1997. Unlike those in the earlier investigations, about three-fourths of the cases appeared to result from secondary human-to-human transmission; within households, the transmission rate appeared to be about the same as that found in the 1981-to-1986 surveillance (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0013">13</link>–<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0016">16</link>). More recent case series have been reported from the DRC (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0018">18</link>), and disease with a sustained chain of human-to-human transmission was reported in the Republic of Congo in 2003 (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0019">19</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0130s000000p0012">The emergence of monkeypox in the United States during an outbreak in 2003 provides another example of the ability of this zoonotic disease to exploit new ecologic niches. North American prairie dogs, being sold as part of the pet trade industry, became diseased after exposure to an infected West African rodent(s) and subsequently infected and caused illness in the U.S. human population (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0021">21</link>). The characterization of human disease in the United States caused by this imported West African MPXV variant, and its comparison with disease classically described in the Congo Basin in the 1980s, enabled clinical and epidemiologic descriptions of distinct monkeypox diseases now characterized as being caused by clade I and clade II viruses (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0023">23</link>). In August 2022, the WHO convened a group of experts to establish new names for monkeypox variants following established best practices. A consensus was reached to rename the Congo Basin (Central Africa) clade as clade I and the West African clade as clade II, with two additional subvariants (clade IIa and clade IIb) (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0024">24</link>). In recent years, monkeypox was confirmed in several West African countries, including a major outbreak in Nigeria (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0026">26</link>). Several travel-related exportations of monkeypox cases from Nigeria to other countries (i.e., the United Kingdom, Israel, Singapore, and the United States) have been reported since 2018 (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0027">27</link>). These cases demonstrate the potential spread of this disease outside its region of endemicity (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0029">29</link>). In 2022, a new clinical and epidemiologic form of MPXV (West African clade) was recognized in multiple countries where MPXV was not endemic. In May 2022, the WHO alerted the world to an international outbreak, and on 23 July 2022, they declared a public health emergency of international concern. As of 19 October 2022, the WHO had documented 73,437 laboratory-confirmed cases with 29 deaths from 109 countries (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0030">30</link>). Over 98% of these confirmed cases were from the European and the American regions, with the United States being the most affected country, having over 14,000 cases. The male gender constituted 98.2% of this global demographic, and 95.8% of all cases were among men who have sex with men (MSM). About a quarter of all cases reported HIV status, of which 45% were persons living with HIV.</para>

        <para id="ch0130s000000p0013">Certain strains of VACV were used for human vaccination to globally eradicate smallpox (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0012">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0031">31</link>). Since the early 1980s, vaccinia and certain other poxviruses have served as recombinant vectors for the expression of a variety of proteins, including vaccine immunogens. Infection can be transmitted to laboratory workers by accidental exposure, and significant pathology has been observed in unvaccinated individuals (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0032">32</link>). Vaccination is therefore currently recommended for personnel working with live, replicative orthopoxviruses, including VACV.</para>

VACV infections are not generally regarded as naturally occurring, although vaccinee-to-cattle and cattle-to-human transmissions occurred on farms during the smallpox eradication campaign. Sporadic outbreaks of infection caused by the VACV subspecies BPXV that involve transmission between milking buffalo, cattle, and people have been reported, mainly in India but also in Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia. Vaccinia-like lesions have been observed on the animals’ teats and the milkers’ hands. Biological data and limited DNA analyses of isolates from an outbreak in India in 1985 suggest that BPXV may be derived from VACV strains transmitted from humans to livestock during the smallpox vaccination era (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0034">34</link>).

        <para id="ch0130s000000p0021">VARV major strains produced “variola major,” a syndrome consisting of a severe prodrome, fever, prostration, and a rash. Toxemia or other forms of systemic shock led to case fatality rates of up to 30%, with secondary attack rates of 30 to 80% among unvaccinated contacts within households. VARV minor strains (alastrim, amass, and kaffir viruses) produced “variola minor,” a less severe infection with case fatality rates of less than 1%, although secondary attack rates among unvaccinated contacts were as high as rates of VARV major infections. DNA and biological data have indicated that alastrim (VARV minor) viruses obtained from Europe and South America are similar to each other but distinct from the so-called African VARV minor viruses, which appear to be variants of VARV major (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0008">8</link>). Epidemiologically, the disease syndromes were discriminated by case fatality rates; current sequence data indicate that the genetic distinctions between strains causing major or minor disease manifestations are multiple and varied. The last naturally occurring smallpox case occurred in Somalia in October 1977, although a fatal laboratory-associated infection with VARV major occurred at the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, England, in August 1978 (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0012">12</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0130s000000p0022">Naturally acquired VARV infection caused a systemic febrile rash illness. For ordinary smallpox, the most common clinical presentation, after an asymptomatic incubation period of 10 to 14 days (range, 7 to 17 days), was fever, quickly rising to about 103°F, sometimes with dermal petechiae. Associated constitutional symptoms included backache, headache, vomiting, and prostration. Within a day or two after the incubation period, a systemic rash appeared that was characteristically centrifugally distributed (i.e., lesions were present in greater numbers on the oral mucosa, face, and extremities than on the trunk). Initially, the rash lesions appeared macular, then papular, enlarging and progressing to a vesicle by day 4 to 5 and a pustule by day 7; lesions were encrusted and scabby by day 14 and sloughed off. Skin lesions were deep seated and were in the same stage of development on any one area of the body. Milder and more severe forms of the rash were also documented. Less severe manifestations (modified smallpox, or variola sine eruptione) occurred in some vaccinated individuals, whereas hemorrhagic or flat-pox types of smallpox occurred in patients with impaired immune responses.</para>
        <para id="ch0130s000000p0023">VARV major smallpox was differentiated into four main clinical types: (i) ordinary smallpox (~90% of cases) produced viremia, fever, prostration, and rash; (ii) modified smallpox (5% of cases) produced a mild prodrome with few skin lesions in previously vaccinated people; (iii) flat smallpox (5% of cases) produced slowly developing focal lesions with generalized infection and an ~50% fatality rate; and (iv) hemorrhagic smallpox (&lt;1% of cases) induced bleeding into the skin and the mucous membranes and was invariably fatal within a week of onset.

        <para id="ch0130s000000p0024">Prior to its eradication, smallpox as a clinical entity was relatively easy to recognize, but other exanthematous illnesses were mistaken for this disease (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0012">12</link>). For example, the rash of severe chicken pox, caused by varicella-zoster virus, was often misdiagnosed as that of smallpox. However, chicken pox produces a centripetally distributed rash and rarely appears on the palms and soles. In addition, in the case of chicken pox, prodromal fever and systemic manifestations are mild, if present at all. Chicken pox lesions are superficial, and lesions in different developmental stages may be present on the same area of the body. Other diseases confused with vesicular-stage smallpox included monkeypox, generalized vaccinia, disseminated herpes zoster, disseminated herpes simplex virus infection, drug reactions (eruptions), erythema multiforme, enteroviral infections, scabies, insect bites, impetigo, and molluscum contagiosum. Diseases confused with hemorrhagic smallpox included acute leukemia, meningococcemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with numerous professional organizations, has developed an algorithm for evaluating patients for smallpox. The algorithm and additional information are available at <ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/clinicians/diagnosis-evaluation.html">https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/clinicians/diagnosis-evaluation.html</ulink>.

Monkeypox was first recognized by Von Magnus in Copenhagen in 1958 as an exanthem of primates in captivity. Later, the disease was seen in other captive animals, including primates in zoos and animal import centers.</para>
        <para id="ch0130s000000p0026">The clinical appearance of human monkeypox, typified by that seen with the Congo Basin (clade I) virus, is much like that of smallpox, with fever, a centrifugally distributed vesiculopustular rash (appearing also on the palms and soles), respiratory distress, and in some cases, death from systemic shock. Like VARV, MPXV appears to enter through skin abrasions or the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, where it produces an exanthem and cough. During the primary viremia, the virus migrates to regional lymph nodes, and during secondary viremia, it disseminates throughout the body and the skin rash appears. During the prodrome, lymphadenopathy (generally inguinal) with fever and headache is common. Individual skin lesions develop through stages of macule, papule, vesicle, and pustule. Sequelae involve secondary infections, permanent scarring and pitting at the sites of the lesions, and sometimes alopecia and corneal opacities. Acute illness in the United States in 2003, caused by the West African (clade II) variant, appeared generally mild (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0023">23</link>); genomic sequence analyses, comparative epidemiologic data, and clinical data support the existence of two distinct clades of MPXV. Additional information on clinical manifestations of classic MPXV disease (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0058">58</link>) is also available. In 2022, a new clinical form of MPXV was recognized. Sexual activities and intimate contact were a key factor in disease transmission in a community of individuals who largely reported male-to-male sexual activity and globally resulted in over 75,000 cases of disease (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0030">30</link>). Manifestations of disease in this population include prodromal symptoms of fever and headache, followed by rash, often localized in the genital, anal, and perianal regions, with inguinal lymphadenopathy. Pharyngitis, proctitis, phimosis, and rectal pain, as well as conjunctivitis and keratitis, have been described. Although disease is largely not associated with death, pain associated with mucosal infections can be extreme, and in individuals with advanced HIV, disease can be protracted and associated with death (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0059">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0060">60</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0130s000000p0027">Humans have historically encountered VACV most commonly in the form of smallpox vaccine (now called vaccinia vaccine), a live-virus preparation that is cross-protective against other OPXV infections. In 2015, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) made recommendations for the use of ACAM2000, the only smallpox vaccine available in the United States at that time (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0061">61</link>). During 2020 to 2021, the ACIP considered evidence for the use of JYNNEOS, a replication-deficient vaccinia virus vaccine, as an alternative to ACAM2000. In November 2021, ACIP unanimously voted in favor of JYNNEOS as an alternative to ACAM2000 for primary vaccination and booster doses (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0062">62</link>). With these recommendations for use of JYNNEOS, two vaccines are now available and recommended for preexposure prophylaxis against orthopoxvirus infection among persons at risk for such exposures. The ACIP recommends smallpox vaccination as a safeguard for laboratory and health care workers who are at high risk for OPXV infection. Although laboratory infections have occurred primarily in research laboratories, vaccination with JYNNEOS is offered to clinical laboratory personnel performing testing for MPXV. In the United States, the CDC Drug Service provides the vaccine after CDC approval of a formal request for this purpose by the administering physician. Vaccinia immunoglobulin and antivirals are available to treat possible postvaccination complications, which can be severe.</para>
        <para id="ch0130s000000p0028">Vaccination with replicating virus (ACMA2000) is performed by using a multiple-puncture technique that causes a local lesion, which develops and recedes in a distinctive manner in primary vaccinees during a 3-week period. At the site of percutaneous vaccination, a papule forms within 2 to 5 days, and the lesion reaches maximum size (about 1 cm in diameter) by 8 to 10 days postvaccination after evolving through vesicle and pustule stages; an areola may encircle the site. The pustule dries into a scab, which usually separates by 14 to 21 days after vaccination. In some vaccinated children, fevers with temperatures as high as about 100°F have occurred, but these have been uncommon in adults, and a regional lymphadenopathy has been observed.</para>
        <para id="ch0130s000000p0029">Because of an increased risk for serious adverse events, such as eczema vaccinatum or vaccinia necrosum, the ACIP has stated that the vaccine is contraindicated for persons with eczema or immunocompromising conditions.

On a clinical basis alone, it is often difficult to distinguish between generalized vaccinia, which represents virus presumably spread hematogenously, and a form of erythema multiforme, which may be immunologically mediated.

Both dry swabs and swabs collected in viral transport medium are acceptable samples for molecular tests. The viscous material can be submitted on the swab or applied onto a clean glass microscope slide and air dried. A “touch prep” can be prepared by pressing a clean slide onto the opened lesion by using a gradual pressing motion. If available, three electron microscope grids can be applied in succession (shiny side to an unroofed vesicle) to the lesion by using minimal, moderate, and moderate pressure.

Sample storage in transport medium (as is done, for example, with herpesviruses) may also be possible, but the volume of medium should be kept to a minimum when electron microscopy will be performed, since specimen dilution decreases the sensitivity of direct evaluation by electron microscopy.

Blood and throat swabs obtained from patients with suspected smallpox during the prodromal febrile phase and early in the rash phase were also a potential source of virus during the smallpox era. In addition to swabs of lesions, additional sample types, including serum, whole blood, urine, breast milk, saliva, and rectal swabs, have been evaluated and validated for MPXV PCR testing by several laboratories.

      <para id="ch0130s000000p0047">Electron microscopy could be a method for laboratory diagnosis of poxvirus infections. Negative-stain electron microscopy of lesion samples was widely used during the smallpox eradication era. Because the clinical diagnosis of poxvirus infection is now infrequent, electron microscopy observations may provide one of the first clues into the cause of an unknown rash illness. Although electron microscopy can distinguish between OPXV and parapoxvirus morphologies, it cannot differentiate between species. OPXVs have a distinctive brick-shaped, knobby morphology when examined with sodium phosphotungstate or other heavy-metal negative stains (<anchor id="ch0130s000000a0044"/><link linkend="ch0130s000000a0047">Fig. 1</link>). Parapoxviruses appear ovoid with a spiraling crisscross surface. The relative sensitivity of the negative-stain method was about 95% for detecting VARVs in smallpox lesions and about 75% for detecting VACV (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0077">77</link>). Sensitivity may be improved by directly pressing a prepared grid into the base of an unroofed skin lesion, as described above (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0078">78</link>). Descriptions of methods for negative-stain evaluation and pictures of negative-stained particles are available on the Internet (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/lab-personnel/specimen-collection/negative-stain.html">https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/lab-personnel/specimen-collection/negative-stain.html</ulink>) and elsewhere (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0077">77</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0079">79</link>). As electron microscopy is not routinely used in clinical laboratories, molecular methods are the preferred method to perform diagnostic and confirmatory testing of poxvirus infections.</para>

Perinuclear basophilic or B-type cytoplasmic inclusions (virus factories or viroplasm) are observed in cells infected with any of the poxviruses and represent sites of virus replication. Certain species of OPXVs (e.g., CPXV) produce acidophilic inclusions or A-type inclusions. Depending on the strain, A-type inclusions may or may not contain virions.</para>

OPXV antigen can also be rapidly detected by the Tetracore Orthopox BioThreat assay, which uses a lateral flow system to rapidly detect the presence of virus in clinical specimens. It has been shown to recognize VACV and MPXV at levels that may be found in rash lesions (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0080">80</link>).

      <para id="ch0130s000000p0050">PCR analysis is used by the WHOCC at the CDC to detect poxvirus DNA in samples. A recent development is the validation of a pan-poxvirus PCR assay, which can screen specimens for the presence of poxviruses other than avipoxviruses (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0081">81</link>). Multiple single-gene PCR assays, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis or sequence analysis of the amplicon, permits species identification of OPXVs. A number of different targets are used, including the HA gene, which is unique for the genus OPXV, the gene for the B cytokine response modifier (CrmB, one of several different tumor necrosis factor receptor homologs produced by OPXVs), and the gene for the A-type inclusion protein. In these assays, DNA that is present in any OPXV is amplified (<anchor id="ch0130s000000a0050"/><link linkend="ch0130s000000a0055">Table 3</link>). The amplicon is digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease, and digested fragments are electrophoresed. Fragment sizes are compared to reference restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles to discriminate species. Conventional PCR tests for other poxvirus genera have also been reported (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0082">82</link>). Other nucleic acid diagnostic approaches include random amplified polymorphic DNA fragment length polymorphism for OPXV species and strain discrimination (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0083">83</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0084">84</link>). Microchips have also been utilized to identify the poxvirus species by discernment of PCR-amplified, fluorescence-labeled DNA fragment hybridization to OPXV species-specific immobilized DNA.</para>
      <para id="ch0130s000000p0051">The high sensitivity of and rapid results from real-time PCR assays have made them standard protocols for laboratory clinical diagnostic use (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0085">85</link>). In the United States, many national reference laboratories, as well as the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories, use this format of nucleic acid testing for rapid response to diagnose suspected OPXV infections and/or to rule out smallpox infections. The use of a probe or probes in this type of assay allows the specificity; however, the extreme sensitivity of the assays can lead to false-positive contaminants from specimen carryover; therefore, ensuring appropriate staff training and assay controls is critical. On the other hand, mutations in gene targets may results in false-negative results, as highlighted during the 2022 pandemic, with the CDC clade II and generic monkeypox PCR targeting the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor gene (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0086">86</link>). Many of these methods for detection of OPXVs and other poxviruses are summarized in <anchor id="ch0130s000000a0051"/><link linkend="ch0130s000000a0060">Table 4</link>. These types of assays are performed primarily at specific reference centers, including the CDC Poxvirus Program/WHOCC for Smallpox and Other Poxvirus Infections and certain LRN laboratories proficient in OPXV diagnostics. Several real-time PCR assays for the detection of OPXV, MPXV, or VARV have gained emergency use authorization (EUA) approval by the Food and Drug Administration (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0087">87</link>). Further resolution of the virus species, geographic location and clades can be obtained through the high-throughput whole-genome sequence determination as evidenced from recent clinical characterizations (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0027">27</link>). Monkeypox diagnostics largely use nucleic acid detection methods. A number of PCR methods, including GeneXpert based methods, have been published (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0088">88</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0089">89</link>). In 2022, the FDA cleared a CDC real-time PCR test that detects nonvariola orthopoxvirus DNA (including MPXV) available at designated CDC LRN was expanded to selected commercial laboratories (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0090">90</link>). In addition, a number of commercial and academic laboratories implemented laboratory developed non-variola OPXV and MPXV PCR tests for clinical use with EUA by FDA (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0087">87</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0130s000000p0091">OPXVs can be grown in a variety of established cell culture lines, including Vero, BS-C-1, CV-1, LLCMK-2 monkey kidney cells, human embryonic lung fibroblast cells, HeLa cells, chicken embryo fibroblast cells, and MRC-5 human diploid fibroblast cells, as well as in fetal rhesus monkey kidney FHRK-4 cells. Propagation of samples at high risk for smallpox should not be attempted unless at a WHOCC for smallpox. Variola virus propagation in cell culture is restricted to the two WHOCC laboratories and performed at BSL4. Monkeypox virus isolation requires BSL-3 lab facilities, while other poxviruses can be cultured in BSL2 laboratories or BSL2 with BSL3 practices with smallpox-vaccinated staff. Site-specific BSL and vaccination requirements should be followed. Cytopathic effects (CPEs) appear as cell rounding with long cytoplasmic extensions (<anchor id="ch0130s000000a0066"/><link linkend="ch0130s000000a0070">Fig. 2</link> and <anchor id="ch0130s000000a0067"/><link linkend="ch0130s000000a0072">3</link>). In some cases, syncytium formation can also be seen; in <link linkend="ch0130s000000a0072">Fig. 3B</link>, this is seen in the MPXV-induced CPE. The timing of CPE is dependent on infectious inoculum. Most laboratories will confirm the presence of a specific OPXV via PCR (see above). Methods for growing and discriminating the morphologies of OPXVs on the chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of 12-day-old chicken embryos have been described previously (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0091">91</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0092">92</link>). OPXVs are the only human poxviruses that produce pocks (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0091">91</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0092">92</link>) on the CAMs of fertile chicken eggs; pock morphology is useful for biologic species and variant differentiation. Parapoxviruses, yatapoxviruses, and MCV do not form pocks on the CAM, in contrast to avipoxviruses, leporipoxviruses, and capripoxviruses. Poxvirus genera can usually be identified and differentiated by virus neutralization testing with hyperimmune reference sera (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0049">49</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0077">77</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0093">93</link>). However, it can be difficult to identify the infecting species since poxviruses are antigenically closely related within a given genus. Real-time PCR or whole-genome sequencing can be utilized for identification of species at the resolution of strains/clades and can be performed in BSL2 laboratories.</para>

      <para id="ch0130s000000p0092">When virus-containing clinical specimens are not available, antibody detection may be the only way to define the etiology of the disease. Serologic methods currently used to detect antibodies against human OPXVs include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), the virus neutralization test, Western blotting, and hemagglutination inhibition. Various protocols for poxvirus serologic testing used at the CDC are detailed elsewhere (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0050">50</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0130s000000p0093">The description of an OPXV immunoglobulin M (IgM) assay offers great promise to enhance investigations of OPXV infection outbreaks, which are often semiretrospective (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0050">50</link>). This technique offers the advantage of measuring recent infection or illness with an OPXV. It is useful for evaluating disease incidence in epidemiologic surveillance studies. For example, during the 2003 U.S. monkeypox outbreak, the IgM capture assay demonstrated ~95% sensitivity and ~95% specificity for epidemiologically linked and laboratory test-confirmed patients when sera were obtained between days 4 and 56 after rash onset. A low-grade response, termed “equivocal,” awaits further research. This assay was also used to detect anti-OPXV IgM in the cerebrospinal fluid of an encephalitic patient with monkeypox (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0094">94</link>). A peptide-based ELISA for the identification of MPXV-specific antibodies has been reported (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0095">95</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0096">96</link>). The peptide-based ELISA was capable of differentiating between MPXV and VACV. However, this ELISA is known to cross-react with VARV and, due to sequence conservation across the OPXVs, is also likely to cross-react with many strains of CPXV. Alternatively, protein microarray chips have been used to determine antibody responses against individual viral proteins to differentiate vaccination from infection (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0097">97</link>–<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0099">99</link>). These tests remain an investigational tool rather than a clinical test, since their clinical utility has not been further established. An MPXV-specific antibody has been isolated, and characterization of the epitope has provided insight in the design of peptides to be used in a monkeypox-specific serological assay (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0100">100</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0101">101</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0130s000000p0094">In the current state of bioterrorism response awareness, tests to evaluate residual protection from previous vaccination are being requested. It is important to note that there is not one routine immunologic test that defines a person’s degree of protection against a poxvirus infection, and determination of protection requires a concert of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Studies (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0102">102</link>) suggest that humoral responses may be the critical component of recovery from and survival of a systemic OPXV infection. The presence of neutralizing antibodies generally indicates recovery from an infection but not always protracted protection against future infection. Neutralizing antibodies against OPXVs may be detectable as early as 6 days after infection or vaccination. Neutralizing antibodies have been detected as long as 20 years after vaccinia vaccination or natural infection with other human OPXVs.</para>
      <para id="ch0130s000000p0095">The OPXV neutralization test has been traditionally performed by looking for a reduction in plaque number. This was improved upon by using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged VACV and measuring viral entry into tissue culture cells (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0103">103</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0104">104</link>). In the virus neutralization assay, a fourfold rise in antibody titer between serum samples drawn during the acute and convalescent phases is usually considered diagnostic of poxvirus infection. When only one serum specimen is available from one phase of infection, confirmation of a clinical diagnosis may be difficult or impossible. Because OPXVs are closely related, serum cross-absorption tests, such as those performed in immunofluorescent-antibody or immunodiffusion methods, have been used with variable success with patient and animal sera. OPXV antigen cross-absorption assays have been performed using hyperimmune animal sera and have been utilized in serosurveys for animal or human monkeypox infection (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0130s000000li0077">77</link>). False-positive results should be ruled out by using appropriate control sets of sera of known provenance.</para>
      <para id="ch0130s000000p0096">The Western blot assay is performed essentially as described by Towbin et al. (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0105">105</link>) and uses various antigens, including purified virus and sometimes the concentrate of culture fluid from infected cells maintained under medium that contains 1% or no serum supplement. Few laboratories are using this method, as reliable standardization has not been achieved.</para>

Serologic testing for TPV infection by standard ELISA (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0106">106</link>) with antigens obtained from concentrates of infected cell culture, by an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test, and by neutralizing test has been moderately effective. Optimally, sera should be collected at the time of actual disease and 3 to 5 weeks or later after the presumed onset date. Because MCV cannot be readily grown in culture, no routine serologic test is available. Molluscum contagiosum is readily diagnosed clinically, often with the aid of electron microscopy and histopathologic testing performed by a diagnostic facility or by real-time PCR.</para>

        <para id="ch0130s000000p0098">For confirmation of an infectious agent, cell culture or another mechanism for demonstrating viable virus should be regarded as the gold standard. Propagation of samples from individuals at high risk for smallpox or samples with a high probability of containing variola virus should not be attempted except at a WHOCC for smallpox. Propagation of MPXV should also be done only by laboratories with the appropriate biosafety measures and other means to do so. Given the lack of readily available or feasible tissue culture methods, the use of multiple diagnostic assays or techniques improves the specificity of a diagnosis. Nucleic acid amplification tests constitute the primary means for diagnosing MPXV beginning with the 2022 international outbreak, with testing now available at commercial and hospital laboratories, in addition to LRN laboratories. Nucleic acid amplification tests, while sensitive, can result in false-positive results. A 2006 proficiency survey of nucleic acid amplification tests performed by 33 labs spanning three geographic areas (Europe, Australasia, and the United States) found a substantial rate of false-positive results (~12%), highlighting the need for sound molecular practices, which becomes even more critical when tests for potential biothreat agents are carried out (<link linkend="ch0130s000000li0107">107</link>). In addition, viral gene mutations or deletions, can lead to falsely negative results. The use of multiple nucleic acid tests, with different detection targets, can improve the specificity of a diagnosis. Utilization of a fully validated assay that has achieved regulatory approval and which uses appropriate controls also improves accuracy of test results. Electron microscopy can be used to evaluate generically for the presence of a poxvirus and to infer the presence of infectious mature forms (if multiple virus forms are present), but it cannot be used to make a specific genus diagnosis except in the case of parapoxvirus infections. Serologic assays are available at a few reference laboratories worldwide but can only rarely be used to make a specific species diagnosis. Histochemistry combined with immunologic analysis can be used to identify poxvirus genera in a few reference centers worldwide. A combination of nucleic acid amplification, growth of agent in culture, serology, electron microscopy, and/or immunohistochemistry techniques improves the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnosis.</para>
