      <para id="ch0123s0001p0002">Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a wide variety of disease states, ranging from infectious mononucleosis (IM) to autoimmune diseases and malignant disorders. Antibody assays are employed primarily for patients with suspected IM. Varieties of immunoassays such as enzyme immunoassay (EIA), chemiluminescent assay (CLIA), blotting assays, or bead-based assays are used. Assays targeting viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, VCA IgM, and EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA 1) IgG are favored. Additional assays, such as avidity testing (in Europe) or viral load measurement, are sometimes necessary to establish the diagnosis of IM. The detection of heterophile antibodies is discouraged, since it often lacks sensitivity and specificity, particularly in children or when symptoms are atypical. Antibody assays detecting early antigen (EA) are rarely useful due to heterogeneity and poor specificity. EBV viral load measurement in blood using quantitative nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is established mainly for patients with EBV-associated malignant disorders. The best evidence exists for EBV DNA monitoring to trigger preemptive therapy to prevent posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs), as well as for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. An international reference standard for EBV DNA significantly reduced variability for viral load measurement. Quantitative NAAT values that could be used as trigger points for intervention are under investigation but may vary by specimen type, clinical setting, and patient group. Dynamic changes in viral load, rather than absolute quantitative NAAT values alone, may be important in patient management. The use of small noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) as diagnostic or prognostic markers in EBV-related disorders is under investigation.</para>

        <para id="ch0123s0001s0002p0001">Morphologically, EBV is a typical herpesvirus with 162 capsomeres in an icosahedral arrangement surrounded by a lipid-rich envelope. The virus has a double-stranded, ~172-kbp DNA genome which exists in a linear form in the mature virion and in a circular episomal form in latently infected cells. The genome consists of a series of unique sequences alternating with internal repeats, all sandwiched between two terminal repeat elements which are joined during circularization. Integration of viral DNA into host chromosomal DNA occurs rarely and has been documented primarily for lymphoblastoid cell lines.</para>
        <para id="ch0123s0001s0002p0002">EBV infects naive B cells by binding of the major EBV outer envelope glycoprotein gp350/220 with the cellular complement receptor C3d (also known as CD21 or CR2) and of gp42 with the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule.<emphasis>In vivo</emphasis>, EBV uses the highly regulated, sequentially expressed proteins described below to persist in the host and transmit infection. It is believed to do this by usurping normal B cell physiologic processes. EBV replaces antigen, T cell help, the B cell receptor, and other signals that result in cellular activation, proliferation, differentiation, and survival, mimicking pathways followed when naive B cells encounter antigen, with the result of establishing latency in memory B cells (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0002">2</link>). <emphasis>In vitro</emphasis>, EBV transforms B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines. Epithelial cells in the oropharynx are the most important site of viral replication and amplification (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0002">2</link>). EBV can enter cells with no or low CD21 expression, such as many epithelial cells, by binding of BMRF2 (BamHI M right-frame 2 protein) to β1 integrins. Next to B cells and epithelial cells, different other cell types such as monocytes, T cells, or NK (natural killer) cells may also be infected by EBV.</para>
        <para id="ch0123s0001s0002p0003">During latency, the EBV nuclear antigens—EBNA 1, EBNA 2, EBNA 3A (also referred to as EBNA 3), EBNA 3B (EBNA 4), EBNA 3C (EBNA 6), and EBNA LP (EBNA 5)—and latent membrane proteins (LMP 1, 2A, and 2B) may be expressed (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0003">3</link>). In addition, different nontranslated RNAs might be found, as follows. (i) Two EBV-encoded RNAs (EBER 1 and 2), which may inhibit antiviral effects by cytokines as well as apoptosis; EBERs are present in high copy numbers (10<superscript>6</superscript> to 10<superscript>7</superscript> copies) in virtually all EBV-infected cells and thus are a good target for <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> detection of EBV. (ii) In addition, small noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) are found in latency from the BART region (BamHI A right transcripts) and the BHRF 1 region (BamHI H rightward open reading frame 1); these regulate posttranscriptional gene expression and are modulators of human immune response genes and genome stability in infected and bystander cells (<anchor id="ch0123s0001s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0123s0002a0004">Table 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0005">5</link>).

        <para id="ch0123s0001s0002p0004">Different types of B cell latency have been defined, based on various levels of expression of the latency-associated proteins or RNAs. In latency type 0, only EBERs and miRNAs from BART are expressed. This expression profile is seen in resting memory B cells of healthy carriers. In latency type I, in addition to the type 0 expression profile, EBNA 1 is detectable; this is observed in Burkitt’s lymphoma or gastric carcinoma. In latency type II, LMP 1 and 2 are expressed in addition to gene products of latency type I; this is observed in germinal center and memory B cells in the tonsil and in malignancies, including Hodgkin’s lymphoma, nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, chronic active EBV infection, and nasopharyngeal lymphoma (NPC). Finally, in latency type III, all EBNA proteins and all RNAs (EBERs, miRNAs [BART and BHRF1]) are detectable. This is observed in naive B cells of the tonsil during acute infection and in immunodeficiency-related lymphoproliferative disorders. A variant form of latency is Wp-restricted latency, which occurs in approximately 15% of human Burkitt lymphomas. In this latency type, a deletion of the EBNA 2 gene is found. As a result, transcription is initiated from the latent W promoter (Wp) rather than Qp, resulting in expression of the EBNA 1, EBNA LP, and EBNA 3A/B/C in addition to the RNAs (<link linkend="ch0123s0002a0004">Table 1</link>, <anchor id="ch0123s0001s0002a0005"/><link linkend="ch0123s0002a0005">Table 2</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0123s0001s0002p0005">EBV has a highly restricted host range. Although during acute EBV infection, as many as 10% of all circulating B cells, representing 50% or more of all memory B cells, may be infected, in a healthy individual remote from infection, only in about 1 to 50 B cells per million EBV genomes may be found (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0009">9</link>). During lytic replication, more than 70 proteins are expressed, including the virus capsid antigens (VCAs) and the early antigens (EAs) used in diagnostics. This occurs primarily in epithelial cells and in B cells as they undergo plasmacytoid differentiation.</para>

        <para id="ch0123s0001s0003p0001">Virtually everyone becomes infected with EBV at some time during his or her life. In lower socioeconomic strata and developing countries, EBV infection occurs mainly during the first years of life and is usually subclinical. However, in developed countries, only about 50% are infected before puberty. In these settings, seroconversion often occurs during the first 3 to 5 years and in adolescence and early adult life (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0010">10</link>). The role of neutralizing maternal antibodies in protection against early infection after birth is uncertain (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0011">11</link>). By the age of 30 years, ~90% of individuals are seropositive, and by the age of 50, almost 99% of the population have seroconverted. Infection resulting in a clinical IM syndrome or atypical symptomatic infection is found to be very low in young children and to peak between 15 and 25 years of age, with a manifestation rate between 20% and 90% of cases (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0010">10</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0123s0001s0003p0002">Transmission of EBV occurs primary through saliva, mainly through deep kissing (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0012">12</link>); however, virtually any body fluid may contain EBV. EBV shedding in saliva is continuous, persistent, and rapid in all previously infected subjects (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0014">14</link>). Therefore, the use of saliva for the diagnosis of acute infections is discouraged. Although infection via blood products is possible, the importance of blood products as a source of EBV infection is uncertain, particularly in settings where blood products are universally leukodepleted (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0015">15</link>). Among transplant recipients, latently EBV-infected cells transmitted with the donor organ or hematopoietic stem cells from seropositive donors to seronegative recipients are the most important source of primary infection in the early posttransplantation period.</para>
        <para id="ch0123s0001s0003p0003">EBV strains may be classified into types 1 and 2 (sometimes referred to as types A and B, respectively), based on the polymorphism of their EBNA 2 genes (~50% homology on protein level between both types), and EBNA 3A, -3B, and -3C. Both EBV types have a worldwide distribution, though they predominate in different geographical areas or ethnic groups (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0016">16</link>). Dual infections with the two types are not uncommon. In immunosuppressed individuals, coinfection with multiple strains of EBV has also been demonstrated (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0017">17</link>). Due to the rapid progress in sequencing methods, different strain variants have been identified that may show a preference for clinical symptoms including tumor association (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0018">18</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0123s0002p0001">IM is believed to be an immunopathologic disease with symptoms resulting from an uncontrolled T cell response of a more mature immune system to a self-limited lymphoproliferative process and perhaps high viral loads (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0019">19</link>).

In patients with acute symptomatic EBV infection, EBV DNA (possibly representing virions) is rapidly cleared from plasma within a week of symptom onset, but EBV DNA in whole blood (perhaps representing episomal DNA in latently infected B cells) takes up to 200 days or more to clear to levels seen in healthy carriers (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0012">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0021">21</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0123s0002p0009">Symptoms vary from mild to severe, and data suggest that the initial viral inoculum, viral type (type 1 versus 2), and human leukocyte antigen class 1 polymorphisms may be risk factors for symptomatic disease (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0022">22</link>–<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0025">25</link>). The classical symptom triad of IM is fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy; symptoms and signs such as pharyngitis, tonsillitis, hepatitis, splenomegaly, and lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes are often present (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0026">26</link>). Symptomatic disease is more frequently seen in nonsmoking females with a low body mass index (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0027">27</link>). Rash in a variety of forms is seen in up to 15% of IM patients. Earlier, it was believed that using antibiotics, especially ampicillin or amoxicillin, might cause antibiotic-associated rash in over 80% of patients with IM. However, studies indicated that this number is far too high, and that rash occurs with antibiotic treatment at the same level or only slightly higher than without (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0028">28</link>). This EBV- or antibiotic-associated rash is not predictive of future drug intolerance (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0029">29</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0002p0010">The time span between infection and symptoms is relatively long, ranging from 30 to 50 days (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0019">19</link>), and clinical disease generally persists for 1 to 4 weeks or longer. However, protracted illness and postinfection fatigue and/or depression are not uncommon (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0031">31</link>). Atypical presentations can occur in which hematologic features such as anemia (including autoimmune hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia), or neurologic conditions such as meningoencephalitis, radiculitis, or mononeuritis, will predominate. When visceral organs are affected, almost any symptom resulting from inflammation of the affected organ may be seen (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0032">32</link>). Death due to IM is rare but has been described; it occurs most often because of splenic rupture (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0033">33</link>), airway obstruction, or neurologic complications (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0034">34</link>). A severe and sometimes fatal complication of primary infection is hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a hemophagocytic syndrome characterized by a hyperinflammatory interaction of EBV-infected cells with T cells and macrophages, resulting in excessive production of cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), or interleukin-1 (IL-1). Extremely high levels of EBV DNA are observed in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0035">35</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0123s0002p0011">Atypical presentations of IM, including acute cholestatic hepatitis sometimes misdiagnosed as acute cholecystitis, are common in older subjects (&gt;40 years) with acute EBV infection (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0036">36</link>). EBV is often reactivated in healthy individuals, due to physical or emotional stress, but reactivation has not been clearly associated with symptoms (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0038">38</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0002p0012">It should also be noted that primary EBV infections cause only approximately 50 to 90% of mononucleosis syndromes. Other infectious agents, such as acute cytomegalovirus, adenovirus,<emphasis>Toxoplasma gondii</emphasis>, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as lymphoma and autoimmune diseases, can cause symptoms and signs like those seen in EBV-associated IM (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0039">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0040">40</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0002p0013"><emphasis>In vitro</emphasis>, (val-)acyclovir, (val-)ganciclovir, and foscarnet inhibit EBV replication through blockade of the viral DNA polymerase. However, the <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> efficacy of these antivirals is less clear. In addition, since pathogenesis of IM appears to be (at least in part) immune mediated, treatment with antivirals blocking viral shedding proved to have no or only small effect on IM symptoms. Indeed, a meta-analysis showed only minor benefits associated with acyclovir use for IM treatment (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0041">41</link>). Antiviral therapy is therefore not recommended for treatment of nonsevere IM. Meta-analysis of steroid use in nonsevere IM showed no relevant effects as well (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0042">42</link>). However, steroids may be useful in complicated or severe disease (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0032">32</link>). Uncomplicated IM is generally treated with supportive treatment only. Importantly, trauma to the spleen must be avoided; consequently, the size of the spleen is, next to other markers of inflammation, an important factor for return-to-sport guidelines, especially in contact sports (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0043">43</link>).</para>

Persistently active infection of EBV-infected B cells could lead to CNS damage. Interestingly, treatment with EBV-specific T cells was beneficial in patients with MS (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0051">51</link>).</para>

The oncogenic potential of EBV relies on the ability of its latency genes to mimic several growth factors, transcription factors, and factors interfering with cell apoptosis (<anchor id="ch0123s0004a0003"/><link linkend="ch0123s0004a0005">Table 3</link>). In addition, EBV-transformed cells are able to avoid T cell recognition through inhibition of major histocompatibility complex signaling and exploitation of the PD-1/PDL1 pathway (<link linkend="ch0123s0004a0005">Table 3</link>). Finally, EBV and HHV 8 are often co-present in rare lymphomas in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., those with multicentric Castleman disease or primary effusion lymphoma).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0004p0002">The EBV latency genetic program(s) mirrors the normal B lymphocyte programming and superimposes EBV genetic reprogramming of B lymphocytes at different maturation stages that might lead to the emergence of the various lymphoproliferations and lymphomas on the basis of costimuli (e.g., malaria infection for Burkitt’s lymphoma [58, 59]) and the crossing of specific cell checkpoints (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0002">2</link>). Moreover, proteins and miRNAs expressed at the initiation of the lytic replication may support development of malignancies (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0060">60</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0004p0003">EBV-associated NPC and EBV gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) represent 80% of all EBV-associated tumors; they are both of epithelial origin and are not clearly related to immunosuppression. NPCs show a lymphoepithelial (LEL) appearance and are 100% EBV positive. A similar LEL pattern is found in a subset (1 to 4%) of gastric carcinomas, which are also 100% EBV positive. In addition, the majority of gastric carcinomas are adenocarcinomas, and even 5 to 10% of these are EBV positive as well.</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0004p0004">The majority of lymphoid tumors originate from B cells (e.g., Burkitt’s lymphoma, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders [PTLDs], Hodgkin’s lymphoma); a minority originate from NK or T cells (e.g., chronic active EBV infection [CAEBV]) and are found in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals.</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0004p0005">Due to the limited impact of the EBV-DNA replication during the lytic cycle in the pathogenesis of EBV-associated tumors, there is no proven role for antiviral agents (which target the viral DNA polymerase, which is inactive during latency and the early lytic phase) in the management of these malignancies; standard cancer treatment is usually used for management. EBV can persist asymptomatically in the vast majority of infected individuals on the basis of an efficient innate and adaptive cellular immune control (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0060">60</link>).

      <para id="ch0123s0004p0007">CAEBV is a rare, severe (often fatal) disease characterized by inflammation and lymphoproliferation with clonal expansion of EBV-infected T cells and NK cells, and as such it is classified among the Epstein-Barr virus-associated T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative diseases (EBV-T/NK-LPDs), together with a couple of other rare disorders with EBV infection in these cell types (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0066">66</link>). CAEBV is most often described to occur in East Asian immunocompetent children (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0067">67</link>). This disease is by definition EBV positive, and high EBV DNA loads in both PBMC/whole blood (in active and inactive disease) and serum/plasma (mainly only in active disease) can be found; these are believed to be free DNA rather than virion associated, often accompanied by atypical patterns of EA antibodies (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0068">68</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0069">69</link>). Although chemotherapy and immunomodulatory therapy have been attempted as treatment, most cases are chemotherapy resistant. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the preferred treatment option (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0068">68</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0070">70</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0004p0008">Primary immunodeficiencies and, as their prototype, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP), are rare hereditary immunodeficiencies primarily involving the inability of T cells and NK cells to engage EBV-infected B cells (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0071">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0072">72</link>). Previously healthy individuals become symptomatic after infection with EBV and develop acute fatal IM, HLH, or lymphoproliferative disorders and/or dysgammaglobulinemia. For some of these immunodeficiencies, different genetic defects have been identified. Untreated, these diseases are often lethal, and patients benefit from HSCT (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0073">73</link>). The role of antiviral therapy early during acute EBV infection in these patients is uncertain. During recent years, treatment modifications using monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) or alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 antibody) have improved outcome significantly (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0074">74</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0075">75</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0004p0009">In immunocompromised patients (mainly due to HIV or transplantation), both primary infection and EBV reactivation can result in lymphoproliferative disorders.</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0004p0010">PTLD represents a spectrum of disorders varying from benign polyclonal proliferations to true malignancies containing clonal chromosomal abnormalities. In most cases, PTLD is of B cell origin, but EBV-positive NK or T cell may occur with a worse prognosis (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0076">76</link>). PTLD is often extranodal, can be restricted to the allograft, especially early after solid-organ transplantation (SOT), and, unlike lymphoma in immunocompetent patients, can involve the brain in isolation or as part of multisystem disease. Principal risk factors are (i) EBV primary infection after transplantation in the setting of SOT and (ii) immunosuppression, mainly severe T cell depletion (e.g., after administration of T cell antibodies or following infusion of a manipulated graft), in both SOT and HSCT settings (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0077">77</link>–<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0079">79</link>). Although &gt;90% of early (first posttransplant year) PTLD lesions after SOT have demonstrable EBV, &gt;50% of late PTLDs are EBV negative at presentation (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0080">80</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0081">81</link>). It is believed that loss of EBV in late PTLDs might reflect the cell replication-promoting nature of the virus in early polyclonal phases, while chromosomal abnormalities in oligo- and monoclonal lymphoproliferations might <emphasis>per se</emphasis> sustain uncontrolled cell proliferation. Incidence of PTLD (especially EBV-positive PTLD) has declined over the years, probably reflecting progress in optimizing immunosuppression and the use of prophylactic measures because of EBV DNA monitoring (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0082">82</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0004p0011">EBV-related lymphomas are also common malignancies seen in HIV-infected and AIDS patients. Burkitt’s lymphoma, lymphomas of the central nervous system (CNS), and smooth muscle tumors are strongly associated with EBV (~90%); the latter are also observed in transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0083">83</link>–<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0085">85</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0004p0012">Some SOT recipients, mainly after experiencing primary EBV infection, have sustained elevation of EBV DNA load in blood after asymptomatic infection or resolution of EBV disease (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0086">86</link>). These patients show a chronic high EBV DNA load phenotype, not necessarily progressing to PTLD. The risk of developing late-onset EBV-positive PTLD in high viral load carriers appears, in part, to be organ specific, with high risk in pediatric thoracic SOT (45%) (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0087">87</link>), intermediate risk after intestinal SOT (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0088">88</link>), and low risk after liver or kidney SOT (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0089">89</link>). The persistence of EBV DNA in blood without progression to a disease has also been observed in children and adults with HIV infection (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0090">90</link>). The pathogenesis of this EBV infection state is unknown; it might indicate that the immune system is still able to control EBV-driven proliferation, although at a lower level than in immunocompetent individuals (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0086">86</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0004p0013">The prevention and management of PTLD are complex, requiring a multidisciplinary team (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0078">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0091">91</link>). Prophylactic and preemptive approaches, such as reduction of immunosuppression, are used to prevent PTLD. In seronegative SOT recipients, antiviral substances such as valganciclovir have been shown to delay primary infection until a time when immunosuppression is less severe (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0092">92</link>). However, the role of antiviral treatment is still not completely clear (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0093">93</link>). Moreover, preemptive strategies include the use of rituximab and, in a few situations, adoptive immunotherapy (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0094">94</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0095">95</link>).</para>

In treatment of localized lesions, reduction of tumor burden by surgery or radiotherapy may be an option. For systemic treatment, rituximab and specific chemotherapy are mainly used. Adoptive immunotherapy using EBV-specific cytotoxic T cell therapies (autologous or allogeneic T cells) has demonstrated efficacy in treatment (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0091">91</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0097">97</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0098">98</link>).

        <para id="ch0123s0005s0001p0002">In routine diagnostics, NAAT is currently most frequently used to detect EBV in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and biopsy samples. The choice of sample matrix depends on the nature of EBV DNA in the EBV-associated respective disease (cell associated versus free; nonencapsidated DNA) and the indication for testing (screening versus prognosis) (<anchor id="ch0123s0005s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0123s0006a0003">Table 4</link>) (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0104">104</link>). For example, investigators have proposed sampling of PBMC or whole blood in CAEBV infection for diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0105">105</link>), but plasma for monitoring and prognostic evaluation (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0106">106</link>). In AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma, tumor cells from CSF (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0107">107</link>) are recommended. For IM or Hodgkin’s lymphoma, plasma rather than whole blood is recommended as the preferred sampling matrix (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0108">108</link>–<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0110">110</link>), as well as for diseases in which malignant cells do not necessarily circulate in the blood, e.g., NPC (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0111">111</link>) and nasal T/NK-cell lymphoma (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0112">112</link>). The optimal sample matrix for monitoring transplant recipients and patients under immunosuppression has not been definitely determined. EBV DNA in cell-free samples might correlate better with active infection, whereas whole blood or PBMC are more sensitive but less specific (78, 113–115). Therefore, it may be appropriate to use whole blood for monitoring before primary infection and plasma for reactivation. For serial monitoring of individual patients, it is particularly important that the sample matrix is not varied.</para>
        <para id="ch0123s0005s0001p0003">The sample quantity required varies, but it is advisable to provide at least 1 ml of plasma or whole blood. Source blood specimens for serum, plasma, or PBMC should be processed as soon as possible. If the transport time is less than 24 h, samples may be kept at room temperature until separated. Separated materials can thereafter be stored at 4 to 7°C for a few days or frozen. Whole blood can be stored for a few days at room temperature or frozen without further processing. For long-term storage, freezing at −70°C is recommended.</para>
        <para id="ch0123s0005s0001p0004">CSF for quantitative NAAT should be collected without additives and processed and stored as described above for blood; at least 0.5 ml should be submitted for testing when possible. EBV DNA quantification in a paired blood sample is advised, especially for immunocompromised individuals, to distinguish intrathecal DNA synthesis versus blood contamination.</para>
        <para id="ch0123s0005s0001p0005">Tissues (e.g., nasopharyngeal brushings for NPC) and biopsy samples to be examined for viral nucleic acids or antigens should be collected and refrigerated in saline or balanced salt solutions. Fresh-frozen samples are preferred. For patients with NPC, endoscope-guided nasopharyngeal brushings are an important sample matrix. A brush covered by a plastic catheter should be used to prevent contamination by cells from non-nasopharyngeal sites. The brush tip can be placed in transport medium and transferred immediately to the laboratory or stored at −80°C.</para>

Serum can be stored at 5°C for several months. For long-term storage, freezing at −20°C or −70°C is recommended.</para>

A major advantage of ddPCR is its extremely high sensitivity, which enables detection of minimal amounts of DNA that might be relevant in samples such as aqueous humor or biopsies (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0123">123</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0124">124</link>).

In addition, in ddPCR, quantification is absolute through Poisson statistics after limiting dilution and endpoint PCR and thus can be performed without a standard curve. However, there are also some disadvantages compared to qPCR, mainly a narrow dynamic range.

      <para id="ch0123s0007p0003">Assessment of EBV DNA viral load can be broken down into two basic strategies, based upon the genomic region being targeted. (i) The conserved BamHI W region, coding for a long internal repeat sequence of EBNA 1, is present in multiple copies (7 to 11 copies) in EBV-infected cells. NAAT targeting this region has maximal sensitivity in clinical samples. (ii) Single copy genes, such as LMP 1, LMP 2, or thymidine kinase, or other parts of the EBNA 1 seem to be a better choice for a more precise quantification. It was shown that the two concepts differ in viral load by around 0.5 log<subscript>10</subscript> (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0124">124</link>). A WHO international standard (a whole-virus preparation of EBV B95-8 with a potency of 5 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> IU/ml) is available for calibration (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0125">125</link>). In B95-8 cells, 11 copies of the BamHI W region are present, but clinical strains might have fewer copies. However, even between NAATs using single-copy genes, target-specific quantitative differences in results were obtained (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0126">126</link>). For measuring EBV virus in NPC, there is a consensus to use BamHI W as a target (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0127">127</link>). Gene targets that result in small amplicons may be more useful when viral DNA is measured in plasma samples, since EBV DNA in plasma is often free DNA, i.e., not encapsidated, and so may be fragmented. However, the effect of intentional fragmenting of the international standard to increase commutability between laboratories was limited (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0128">128</link>).</para>

Normalization to cell number or genomic DNA in cellular specimens may also be unnecessary (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0134">134</link>).

Heterophile antibodies are not EBV specific. The test for them relies on the detection of antibodies reacting with erythrocytes of non-human animals that develop because of polyclonal B cell stimulation occurring in the setting of IM. Historically, sheep erythrocytes were used (Paul-Bunnell test) as assay targets, but the assays using them lacked sensitivity (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0150">150</link>). Later, horse erythrocytes were used, and to improve specificity, the Davidsohn differential test was added. This test discriminates between the IM heterophile response and the heterophile response seen in serum sickness and rheumatic diseases (i.e., it targets the Forssman antigen). To exclude agglutination resulting from heterophile antibodies against the non-IM-related Forssman antigen, in the Davidsohn differential test these non-IM-related heterophile antibodies are first removed by adsorption of serum with guinea pig kidney cells that express the Forssman antigen. As an additional control, serum is also adsorbed with bovine erythrocytes not expressing the IM antigen. When the two adsorbed sera are then mixed with sheep or horse erythrocytes, stronger agglutination in the guinea pig-adsorbed serum indicates a positive result.</para>

The tests differ in methods, antigens, and antibody isotypes tested for. Although immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) and blotting techniques (mainly used in Europe) are more reliable, enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and chemiluminescence assays (CLIAs) or bead-based assays (BBAs) in a multiplex approach are used most frequently. In the case of unclear results, any of these methods may be supplemented by avidity testing (in Europe). Traditionally, antibodies to three antigen complexes have been measured, including VCA, EA, and EBNA. In addition, different immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG, IgM, and sometimes IgA) can be detected. The large numbers of assays can lead to complex antibody patterns, making results difficult to interpret. When possible, kits from the same manufacturer should be used for detecting different markers in an individual patient. The antibody profile for a patient with suspected mononucleosis is presented in <anchor id="ch0123s0008s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0123s0010a0005">Fig. 1</link>.</para>
        <para id="ch0123s0008s0001p0002">Immunofluorescence together with immunoblotting (mainly done in Europe but not in the U.S.) is the gold standard for EBV serology at present. IFAs have fairly uniform performance characteristics, principally because suppliers use the same cell substrates. Their sensitivity is similar to or even lower than that of EIA, CLIA, or BBA (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0152">152</link>). The performance of all other antibody assays is much more variable, due to the plethora of antigen preparations used in the different kits. These range from cell extracts to recombinant or fusion proteins and synthetic peptides. This means that reference criteria established for interpretation of IFAs may not apply to all other antibody assays, even when the antigens are referred to by the same name. For example, EBNA (a complex of EBNA 1 and EBNA 2) is detected in Raji cells by anticomplement immunofluorescence (ACIF); in other antibody assays, the same designation may be given to a single oligopeptide derived from EBNA 1 or an EBNA 1 recombinant protein (p72). ACIF is problematic, since the other assays demonstrate high sensitivity (≥95%) and thus ACIF is often replaced by other methods. Recombinant proteins and peptides are advantageous because they are easier to standardize than cell-grown antigens and tests with synthetic antigens.</para>
        <para id="ch0123s0008s0001p0003">BBAs in a multiplex format, sometimes also including heterophile antibodies or non-EBV antigens, have become more popular, since they allow parallel detection of different antigens (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0153">153</link>). In theory, up to 100 uniquely identifiable fluorescently labeled microspheres can be detected with this technique, each particle coated with a different antigen (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0154">154</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0155">155</link>).

Anti-EA/D (diffuse distribution in cells) and anti-EA/R (restricted to cytoplasm) are antibodies traditionally measured with Raji cells activated to enter the lytic phase by phorbol ester or sodium butyrate. Ethanol fixation eliminates the EA/R complex; cells fixed in ethanol are used for studies of EA/D antibodies.

        <para id="ch0123s0008s0001p0008">An alternative algorithm sometimes used in Europe but not in the U.S. is provided in<anchor id="ch0123s0008s0001a0006"/><link linkend="ch0123s0012a0004">Fig. 2</link>. In this cost-effective approach, stepwise analysis and data interpretation feature testing for EBNA 1 IgG in serum as the key initial step. This schema is feasible for assays with short turnaround times and random access (e.g., CLIA, BBA). EBNA 1 IgG antibodies normally appear between 6 weeks and 7 months after onset of IM and should be negative in acute IM. They are maintained for life and are therefore a good marker of prior infection. However, in about 5 to 10% of patients, EBNA 1 IgG may be present in low titers or even undetectable (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0152">152</link>). Increasing age, severe immunosuppression, and rheumatic disorders are often reasons for reduced or absent EBNA 1 IgG titers. Diagnosis of primary EBV infections should not rely solely on the detection of VCA IgM, since both false-positive and false-negative results are possible. False positives result mainly from the presence of rheumatoid factor cross-reacting with other herpesvirus infections and antinuclear factors. False negatives may result from insufficiently sensitive assays or when the specimen is collected late, during a period after IgM has disappeared.</para>

        <para id="ch0123s0008s0001p0009">In rare cases, blotting techniques including VCA p23, VCA p18, and EBNA 1 p72 may be performed using line blots, Western blots, or microarrays (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0152">152</link>). VCA p18 may be important, since antibodies of the IgM class are detectable quite early during infection, whereas IgG antibodies are produced late (similar to EBNA 1 IgG). Thus, a VCA IgG using p18 might be used as substitute for EBNA 1 IgG (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0154">154</link>) or as an additional test. If EBNA 1 IgG and p18 IgG are negative, an avidity test for VCA IgG can be informative (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0152">152</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0123s0010p0001">Antibody assays are the method of choice for diagnosing acute EBV infection in immunocompetent hosts. NAAT in plasma might be an option especially for young children &lt;6 years of age and particularly infants with maternal antibodies (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0109">109</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0163">163</link>). Studies suggest that EBV DNA is cleared rapidly from plasma but persists significantly longer in whole blood, with clearance from this matrix occurring in most subjects within 200 days (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0012">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0164">164</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0010p0002">Heterophile antibodies are no longer recommended. They are a marker of IM but not necessarily of acute EBV infection. High levels of heterophile antibodies are seen during the first month of IM, normally followed by a rapid decrease. Low but persisting heterophile antibody titers can be found after primary EBV for up to 1 year (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0156">156</link>), which can be misleading, and more importantly, heterophile antibodies can sometimes be found in an acute HIV infection, lymphoma, or infection with other infectious agents (e.g., cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, or <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0165">165</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0166">166</link>). EBV-specific serology should always be performed in settings where the interpretation of a positive heterophile result is uncertain. False-negative heterophile antibody results (15 to 20%) are the rule among young children (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0150">150</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0165">165</link>) but also occur for adolescents and adults, particularly when atypical clinical presentations are present. Thus, the use of heterophile antibodies is discouraged.</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0010p0003">Almost all IM patients have high titers of IgG to various lytic-phase EBV antigens (VCA and EA) but lack antibodies to the EBNA antigens (for details, see<link linkend="ch0123s0010a0005">Fig. 1</link>). The patient’s EBV status can generally be ascertained from a single serum sample by measuring VCA IgG, VCA IgM, and EBNA 1 IgG. In upwards of 90 to 95% of cases, the antibody profile is sufficiently distinct to determine whether the patient (i) is still susceptible to EBV, (ii) has a current primary infection, or (iii) has a past infection (<link linkend="ch0123s0010a0006">Table 7</link>). The use of terms such as “recent,” “convalescent,” or “reactivated” infection, as suggested by some manufacturers in results reporting, is discouraged. As these diagnoses correspond to infection states in healthy individuals, they are of limited clinical relevance when testing is performed for symptomatic patients. The exact antibody titers and the time needed to develop the complete antibody profile of past infection vary widely between individuals and do not correlate with severity of disease (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0164">164</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0167">167</link>).

      <para id="ch0123s0010p0004">It is not uncommon for other IgM antibodies (e.g., against CMV) to be found at the same time as EBV IgM and vice versa. This may be the result of a cross-reaction, but also of polyclonal stimulation, which is typical for IM and in which several IgM antibodies are often detectable. This should not be interpreted as multiple infection but is an epiphenomenon in IM.</para>

Different antibody isotypes (mainly IgA but also IgG) targeting a wide variety of antigens (from the latent and lytic cycle) have been studied for disease diagnosis. For routine diagnostics, VCA, EA, and EBNA 1 have turned out to be the most important antigens used as a tumor marker in NPC (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0137">137</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0168">168</link>). In gastric carcinoma, the role of antibodies is less clear.

This algorithm can be applied using assays with short turnaround time and random access. Diagnostic procedures and interpretation may start with EBNA 1 IgG. If this parameter is positive, a past infection is proven; if EBNA 1 IgG is negative, a negative VCA IgG results in the diagnosis of seronegative and a positive VCA IgM in the diagnosis of a primary infection. If VCA IgG is positive and the other parameters are negative, supplementary tests should be applied, e.g., avidity testing or blotting using p18 antigen (used in Europe) or PCR (in Europe and the U.S.).

      <para id="ch0123s0012p0003">Routine posttransplantation monitoring of EBV viral load has been recommended for PTLD prevention only in high-risk settings (e.g., patients with risk of primary infection after transplantation or high-risk patients identified by a scoring system in HSCT recipients) but not as a routine in all transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0078">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0115">115</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0176">176</link>). Monitoring is performed to initiate preemptive interventions. However, EBV DNA thresholds that could be used as trigger points for preemptive intervention have been suggested, but cannot be clearly defined in all situations. They depend on the presence of individual risk factors, and, along with the absolute EBV DNA level, the kinetics may play an important role.</para>
      <para id="ch0123s0012p0004">In high-risk asymptomatic SOT recipients being serially monitored, the use of EBV DNA load in whole blood as a diagnostic test usually has good sensitivity for detecting EBV-positive PTLD, but misses EBV-negative PTLD and some cases of localized PTLD (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0177">177</link>). However, this method has poor specificity, resulting in good negative predictive values (greater than 90%) but poor positive predictive values in these populations (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0078">78</link>). Using plasma increases specificity with a limited loss of sensitivity.</para>

A short-term fall and clearance of EBV DNA in blood, coincident with clinical and histologic regression in response to interventions such as reduction of immunosuppression and adoptive immunotherapy, have been observed in PTLD patients and patients with high viral loads. In contrast, when rituximab was used, EBV DNA levels in blood often fell dramatically and remained low even when disease progressed and relapsed, and similarly a rebound without clinical relapse could be found (<link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0178">178</link>, <link linkend="ch0123s0015s0001li0179">179</link>).</para>
