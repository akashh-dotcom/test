        <para id="ch0042s000000p0001">Historically, most aerobic endospore-forming bacteria were classified as species of<emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis>. However, the application of phylogenetic methods to prokaryotic systematics has triggered a taxonomic transformation, resulting in many species being renamed and reassigned to new monophyletic taxa. Minimal standards for describing new taxa of aerobic endospore-forming bacteria have been published (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0001">1</link>). However, most novel taxa cannot be distinguished phenotypically, since many were described on the basis of molecular characteristics alone and/or on single to few strains, precluding any assessment of intragenus or intraspecies variability. Those species that remain in the <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> genus are now limited to those species related to the type species of the genus (<emphasis>Bacillus subtilis</emphasis>), the <emphasis>Bacillus cereus</emphasis> group, and a number of species for which the placement is still unclear (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0003">3</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0042s000000p0002">Currently, the aerobic endospore-forming bacteria are distributed among &gt;180 genera and seven families within the order<emphasis>Caryophanales</emphasis> (class <emphasis>Bacilli</emphasis>, phylum <emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis>). For the clinical microbiologist, the reassignment of taxa and proliferation of new species are of limited practical concern. The vast majority of aerobic endospore-forming bacteria are nonpathogenic, environmental organisms. The medically important and/or most commonly encountered genera in the clinical setting, primarily <emphasis>Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Priestia, Peribacillus, Brevibacillus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Lysinibacillus</emphasis>, with &gt;100, &gt;275, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0029">29</link>, and 21 valid species, respectively (<ulink url="https://lpsn.dsmz.de/">https://lpsn.dsmz.de/</ulink>), are found within the families <emphasis>Bacillaceae, Caryophanaceae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Paenibacillaceae</emphasis>. Only a fraction of those have been detected in clinical specimens. With rare exceptions, the families <emphasis>Alicyclobacillaceae, Pasteuriaceae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Sporolactobacillaceae</emphasis> are not known to contain clinically relevant species. In contrast to other <emphasis>Caryophanales</emphasis>, organisms in the family <emphasis>Thermoactinomycetaceae</emphasis> appear filamentous and produce mycelia, aerial hyphae, and sporophores. Although some are true aerobic endospore-forming bacteria, for the purposes of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>, the <emphasis>Thermoactinomycetaceae</emphasis> are grouped with the aerobic actinomycetes (see <ulink url="ch0045#ch0045s0001">chapter 29</ulink>).</para>
        <para id="ch0042s000000p0003">The<emphasis>Bacillus cereus</emphasis> group, also referred to as <emphasis>Bacillus cereus sensu lato</emphasis>, includes the classic species <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> (<emphasis>sensu stricto</emphasis>), <emphasis>Bacillus anthracis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Bacillus thuringiensis</emphasis>, as well as psychrotolerant (<emphasis>B. mycoides</emphasis> and <emphasis>B. wiedmannii</emphasis>), thermotolerant (<emphasis>B. cytotoxicus</emphasis>), and morphologically distinct (<emphasis>B. mycoides</emphasis> and <emphasis>B. pseudomycoides</emphasis>) variants (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0004">4</link>). Phylogenetic analyses have revealed extensive variation within the <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group, and the number of proposed taxa continues to expand (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0005">5</link>). Recent validly published species include <emphasis>B. sanguinis, B. paramobilis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>B. hominis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0006">6</link>), all of which were initially recovered from blood specimens. Reliable classification of <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> (<emphasis>sensu lato</emphasis>) species is hampered by the limitations of routine identification methods. Key phenotypic features, most notably toxin production and crystal formation, are determined by virulence plasmids that can be acquired or lost, thus leading to designations that are inconsistent with phylogenetic analyses (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0008">8</link>). Molecular approaches, including whole-genome analysis, can assist with identification, and tools for standardized analysis of sequencing data have been proposed (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0009">9</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0042s000000p0004">Although the<emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group is phylogenetically unrelated to the <emphasis>B. subtilis</emphasis> clade, it has not been transferred to a new genus. The renaming of medically important taxa (e.g., <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis>) has the potential to create confusion and endanger health and is discouraged under the perilous name (<emphasis>nomen periculosum</emphasis>) principle (Rule 56a; <ulink url="ch0133#ch0133s0001">section 5</ulink>) of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0002">2</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0042s000000p0005"><emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> is the type genus of the <emphasis>Bacillaceae</emphasis> and contains the largest number of species. The typical <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> isolate is a large, rod-shaped, endospore-forming organism that is aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, mesophilic, catalase positive, and motile by means of peritrichous flagella. Microscopically, they may present as individual cells, pairs, short chains, and/or long chains. Cells usually stain Gram positive, but may appear Gram negative even in fresh cultures. Older cultures are more likely to be Gram variable or Gram negative. The genus is phenotypically diverse, in that some species are asporogenous, strictly anaerobic, and thermophilic or psychrophilic. A positive catalase test can be used to distinguish <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> from the few aerotolerant <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species. Colony morphology varies significantly both between and within species and may also depend on growth media and conditions. In the clinical microbiology laboratory, most isolates grow quite well on routine media such as blood agar or chocolate agar, and their colonies are often quite large after an overnight subculture.</para>

        <para id="ch0042s000000p0006">Other important genera of aerobic endospore-forming organisms are phenotypically similar to<emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis>, but some differences do exist. <emphasis>Geobacillus</emphasis> species are obligately thermophilic, and <emphasis>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</emphasis> is commonly employed as a biological indicator for laboratory quality control activities (e.g., for monitoring autoclave efficacy and the sporicidal activity of disinfectants). <emphasis>Lysinibacillus</emphasis> species are distinguished by the composition of the cell wall peptidoglycan, which is rich in lysine and aspartic acid. <emphasis>Paenibacillus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Brevibacillus</emphasis> cultures may stain Gram positive but are more likely to appear Gram negative or Gram variable, and sporangia often have a swollen appearance. Additional species of aerobic endospore-forming bacteria, which may present with a wide range of phenotypic characteristics, may be encountered in the microbiology laboratory, usually as contaminants, while others may never be found in this setting, as they are derived from extreme or exotic environments.</para>

        <para id="ch0042s000000p0007">Aerobic endospore-forming bacteria are ubiquitous in nature. They are found in terrestrial and aquatic habitats of all kinds, ranging from acid to alkaline, nonsaline to highly saline, and hot to cold. Because endospores are resistant to heat, desiccation, radiation, and disinfectants, they persist in places where most other organisms cannot. These exotic and extreme environments include air at high altitude, subterranean waters, glacial ice cores, permafrost, hot springs, and volcanic soils. Dissemination of spores, via wind, dust, and aerosols, contributes to contamination of human-made environments, including hospital operating rooms and industrial clean rooms. Because they contribute to food spoilage and food poisoning, aerobic endospore-forming organisms are unwanted contaminants in food production and preparation facilities. However, these bacteria are also essential to the production of certain fermented traditional foods and the probiotic properties of animal feed and horticultural and dietary supplements. Similarly, some species encountered in the clinical laboratory (e.g.,<emphasis>B. subtilis, Priestia megaterium, Bacillus licheniformis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Paenibacillus</emphasis> spp.) are also employed by industry for the commercial production of enzymes (e.g., amylases, proteases, and cellulases), antibiotics (e.g., polymyxins, colistins, and gramicidins), and biopesticides (e.g., <emphasis>B. thuringiensis</emphasis> [Bt] toxins). <emphasis>Lysinibacillus sphaericus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Brevibacillus laterosporus</emphasis> are also recognized as pathogens of insects and other invertebrates, used in biocontrol applications. <emphasis>Paenibacillus</emphasis> spp. include nitrogen-fixing organisms associated with plant roots that can promote crop growth when used as a biofertilizer (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0010">10</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0042s000000p0008">The majority of aerobic endospore-forming bacteria are nonpathogenic saprophytes. Species frequently isolated in the clinical microbiology laboratory include the<emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group, <emphasis>P. megaterium, B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Peribacillus simplex</emphasis>. Although they are commonly encountered in the laboratory, few isolates are clinically relevant, and most of the clinically significant species are best described as opportunistic human pathogens. Transmission is restricted to ingestion, injection, injury, inhalation, or other contact with material that has been contaminated with spores or vegetative cells.</para>
        <para id="ch0042s000000p0009">Characterization of culturable aerobic<emphasis>Actinobacteria</emphasis> from the human gastrointestinal tract reveals an abundance of <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp. and related organisms, with <emphasis>Alkalihalobacillus</emphasis> (prev. <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis>) <emphasis>clausii</emphasis> and <emphasis>B. licheniformis</emphasis> being most frequently isolated. <emphasis>Lysinibacillus, Oceanobacillus, Ornithinibacillus, Ureibacillus, Virgibacillus</emphasis>, and other <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp. have also been isolated. Aerobic endospore-forming bacilli could therefore also be considered commensal gut bacteria (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0011">11</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0042s000000p0010">While several environmental species are recognized as entomopathogens, only<emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> has been described as an obligate pathogen of animals. Infection of wild and grazing domesticated mammals occurs through ingestion of <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> spores from environmental sources, most commonly soil, water, or vegetation contaminated by anthrax-infected carcasses, with an estimated 20,000 to 100,000 cases worldwide (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0012">12</link>). Direct animal-to-animal transmission is rare, although scavengers can become infected by feeding on anthrax-infected carcasses. Biting flies are believed to be vectors that have contributed to large outbreaks in regions where anthrax is endemic, whereas nonbiting flies may serve as vectors between anthrax-infected carcasses and foliage eaten by herbivores (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0013">13</link>). <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> spores remain viable for many years and are exceedingly difficult to eradicate. Some authorities contend that, in certain soils, self-maintenance can occur (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0014">14</link>) and that soil-dwelling amoebae support the germination and amplification of <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> spores (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0015">15</link>). Human cases are predominantly due to direct contact with infected animals or their carcasses (nonindustrial) or acquired during processing of animal products, such as wool, hair, hides, or bones (industrial). An estimated 1.83 billion people live in anthrax-suitable regions, though most face little exposure (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0012">12</link>). The use of veterinary vaccines, improvements in industrial hygiene, requirements in place for imported animal products, and implementation of proper control measures in the case of outbreaks (both livestock and wildlife) have all contributed to a marked decline in the incidence of disease (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0013">13</link>). In the United States, the incidence of anthrax in humans is extremely low. Four decades of surveillance data indicate that, excluding the bioterrorism events in 2001, only up to two cases are reported annually (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0016">16</link>). Nevertheless, anthrax remains endemic to many countries, particularly those that lack effective vaccination policies, and human and animal cases are documented frequently (e.g., annually, ProMed-Mail posts &gt;100 anthrax-related events and updates [<ulink url="https://www.promedmail.org/">https://www.promedmail.org/</ulink>]).</para>
        <para id="ch0042s000000p0011">The most common scenario in human infection involves the slaughtering and/or processing of an anthrax-infected animal in an informal setting outside the confines of a regulated establishment like an abattoir. This may be as a result of chronic food insecurity within communities where food is scarce (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0017">17</link>). Routine vaccination can prevent anthrax, but often, vaccination campaigns for livestock are implemented only after cases are identified. Delays in case recognition can undermine control measures, prolong outbreaks, and lead to the sale and slaughter of infected animals. Because of these challenges, anthrax remains common in regions most at risk, including rain-fed agricultural regions throughout arid and temperate ecosystems across Eurasia, Africa, and North America (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0012">12</link>). In Texas alone, over 85 cases of animal anthrax have been confirmed by culture since 2000, including an outbreak in 2019 (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0018">18</link>). These numbers are likely an underrepresentation, since 1 case per site per year is typically reported.</para>

It has been hypothesized that the heroin associated with the European cases can become contaminated with <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> spores during transport from the point of origin (e.g., in skins from anthrax-infected animals). However, it remains difficult to ascertain the true source of individual strains, since adequate geographical sampling throughout possible trafficking routes is lacking.</para>
        <para id="ch0042s000000p0013">Anthrax is not a contagious disease. Person-to-person spread has been reported, but is rare (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0013">13</link>). Standard infection control practices are adequate for patients who exhibit any form of anthrax, unless large amounts of uncontained drainage from nonintact skin are present, in which case contact precautions are recommended (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/appendix/bioterror-precautions.html#Anthrax">https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/appendix/bioterror-precautions.html#Anthrax</ulink>). Cases of anthrax due to laboratory accidents, biological warfare, and bioterrorism events are also rare, but ongoing vigilance in the clinical microbiology laboratory is critical (see <ulink url="ch0031#ch0031s0001">chapter 16</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). An FDA-approved anthrax vaccine exists for pre-exposure immunization in high-risk occupational settings, as well as for postexposure prophylaxis in the context of a suspected exposure to <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> spores (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/anthrax/hcp/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/anthrax/hcp/index.html</ulink>).</para>

Because they are also common specimen or laboratory contaminants, it may be extremely difficult to substantiate whether or not they were truly the cause of an infection when reported in case studies. That said, infections usually result from contamination of wounds, surgical sites, or medical devices with bacterial spores, and the typical patient is immunocompromised or afflicted with a comorbid condition (e.g., cancer or kidney disease). A plethora of clinical cases due to <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp. have been published. However, the methods used in older studies did not always provide accurate species-level identification, and so historical designations may not align with current taxonomy. Despite this, species common in the past remain common today. When using more accurate identification methods such as sequencing and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), the most commonly isolated species in the clinical microbiology laboratory include the <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group (excluding <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis>), <emphasis>P. megaterium, B. licheniformis, B. pumilus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. simplex</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0021">21</link>).

      <para id="ch0042s000000p0022">Robert Koch’s landmark work on anthrax helped establish the germ theory of disease. Anthrax is primarily a disease of wild and domesticated herbivores that, historically, was a leading cause of mortality among cattle, sheep, goats, and horses.</para>
      <para id="ch0042s000000p0023">In humans, the major clinical forms of the disease—cutaneous anthrax, gastrointestinal anthrax, inhalational anthrax, and injectional anthrax—are linked to the route of infection, with estimated mortality rates of 1%, 25 to 60%, 46%, and 33%, respectively (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0048">48</link>). Adult males account for the majority of anthrax cases, but disease may be more severe in children (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0049">49</link>). Initial symptoms may be nonspecific and mild (e.g., fatigue, malaise, fever, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms), but following lymphohematogenous dissemination from a primary lesion, fulminant disease can rapidly develop. Symptoms can include dyspnea, cyanosis, severe pyrexia, and disorientation, followed by circulatory failure, shock, coma, and death. The bacteria can multiply rapidly in the blood and, depending on the host, reach terminal levels of 10<superscript>7</superscript> to 10<superscript>9</superscript> CFU/ml during the final few hours of life. Enhanced clinical and laboratory expertise is a critical component of rapid anthrax diagnosis, and due to the biothreat potential of <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis>, there is a need for prospective surveillance and response preparedness. Similarly, case investigations should strive to establish the origin of any infection so as to differentiate between naturally occurring events and those of malicious origin.</para>
      <para id="ch0042s000000p0024">Cutaneous anthrax accounts for &gt;95% of naturally acquired human anthrax cases. The global incidence is difficult to determine and varies between countries depending on control strategies and the strength of health systems, but rates are highest in Africa and central and southern Asia (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0013">13</link>). Infection typically occurs when spores are inoculated through a break in the skin, although case reports and animal studies suggest that preexisting lesions are not necessary for infection. Rarely, human infection has been attributed to insect bites (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0050">50</link>). Following an incubation period of usually 1 to 6 days (range, a few hours to 3 weeks), a small papule appears. Over the next 24 h, this progresses to a ring of vesicles, which subsequently ulcerates to form a blackened eschar, the characteristic lesion of cutaneous anthrax. Once formed, the eschar may become thick and surrounded by extensive edema. Fever, pus, and pain at the site are normally absent, and the presence of such symptoms may be indicative of a secondary bacterial infection. Before the availability of antimicrobial therapy, 10 to 20% of untreated cutaneous anthrax cases were fatal. Today, less than 1% of cases are fatal. Fatalities are mainly due to obstruction of the airways by the edema that accompanies lesions that form on the face or neck but can also occur when cutaneous disease progresses to systemic infection. Eschars take several days to evolve, but even with effective antimicrobial therapy, they may take several weeks to resolve.</para>
      <para id="ch0042s000000p0025">Gastrointestinal anthrax results from the consumption of infected animals, usually meat that is raw or undercooked. Asymptomatic cases can occur and may not be uncommon, but disease usually presents in one of two forms (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0051">51</link>). The oral or oropharyngeal form features lesions on the buccal cavity, tongue, tonsils, or posterior pharyngeal wall. Symptoms include sore throat, dysphagia, and regional lymphadenopathy, followed by severe edema of the neck and chest. The intestinal form can develop anywhere within the gastrointestinal tract, but ulcerations typically appear in the mucosa of the terminal ileum or cecum. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, fever, mild diarrhea (which can progress to bloody diarrhea), hematemesis, and massive ascites. Owing to the nonspecific nature of the early symptoms, gastrointestinal anthrax may be underreported, antimicrobial therapy may be initiated late, and mortality rates range widely (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0051">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0052">52</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0042s000000p0026">Inhalational anthrax is a rare but serious form of the disease. During the 20th century, 21 cases of naturally acquired inhalational anthrax were recorded in the United States (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0053">53</link>). The mortality rate has improved over time, likely due to improved diagnosis and early initiation of appropriate therapy. Although the disease was previously known as pulmonary anthrax, the preferred designation, “inhalational anthrax,” more accurately reflects the fact that active infection occurs in the lymph nodes rather than the lungs themselves. Regrettably, <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> has been developed, and effectively deployed, for biological warfare and bioterrorism purposes. The last known event occurred in late 2001, when the malicious dissemination of <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> spores in mailed letters was responsible for an outbreak of 22 cases in the United States. Laboratory-confirmed inhalational anthrax accounted for 11 of the cases, including all five deaths attributed to the outbreak (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0054">54</link>). Analysis revealed a median incubation period of 4 days (range, 4 to 6 days). Clinical presentation included fever or chills, fatigue or malaise, minimal or nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and nausea or vomiting. Some patients experienced chest pain and sweats. All patients had abnormal chest radiographic images, with pleural effusion, infiltrates, or mediastinal widening (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0055">55</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0042s000000p0027">Injectional anthrax refers to cases associated with injection drug use. Although the route of infection is through the skin, symptoms of injectional anthrax differ from those of cutaneous anthrax. Skin around the injection site may be bruised or discolored, but the characteristic papules and eschar are absent. Cases usually present as severe soft tissue infections with significant edema and tissue necrosis, and progression to septic shock can be rapid. A small portion of cases may present with symptoms of cellulitis and require only antibiotics, but the majority of cases require surgical intervention, e.g., debridement or fasciotomy (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0056">56</link>).</para>

Similar to other aerobic endospore-forming bacteria, when isolated from clinical specimens, they are very often contaminants, and clinical relevance must be ascertained using a combination of laboratory and clinical findings. The majority of reported cases are attributed to <emphasis>B. cereus sensu stricto</emphasis> (henceforth <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis>), with the caveat that in the clinical laboratory, distinction between all members of the <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group is often not possible. Clinically, <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> is an opportunistic pathogen, and cases involving local (e.g., eyes, skin, and wounds) and systemic (e.g., bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, peritonitis, endocarditis, and respiratory and urinary tract) infections have all been reported (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0062">62</link>).

Systemic infections are most common in patients who are immunocompromised due to a comorbid condition (e.g., hematologic malignancy).

Less than 1% of cases resulted in hospitalizations, and death was extremely rare. Surveillance data from the European Food Safety Authority indicate that 413 outbreaks implicating <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis>, with strong evidence that a suspect food vehicle was involved, were reported from 2007 to 2014: 6,657 human cases, with 352 hospitalizations (~5.3%) and no deaths (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0073">73</link>). These statistics likely underrepresent the true burden of <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> disease, because these organisms are not always considered in clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory investigations of foodborne illness. <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> spores can survive normal cooking temperatures and many cleaning procedures, and thus, they can be widespread in food preparation environments.

      <para id="ch0042s000000p0040">In 1999, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/CDC, in partnership with the Association of Public Health Laboratories and Federal Bureau of Investigation, established a Laboratory Response Network (LRN) to integrate laboratory responses to public health emergencies, including acts of bioterrorism. The LRN links local laboratories (sentinel level) with state (reference level) and federal (national level) laboratories that provide specialized testing and increased biosafety capacity, in all 50 states of the United States and in other selected countries. The reference-level laboratories are able to rapidly detect and confirm the identity of select agents, including<emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis>. The LRN also provides guidance for testing and transportation of suspicious or challenging specimens. Guidelines for sentinel-level laboratories and contact information for state and territorial public health laboratories are available through the CDC (<ulink url="https://emergency.cdc.gov/lrn">https://emergency.cdc.gov/lrn</ulink>) and American Society for Microbiology (ASM) (<ulink url="https://asm.org/Articles/Policy/Laboratory-Response-Network-LRN-Sentinel-Level-C">https://asm.org/Articles/Policy/Laboratory-Response-Network-LRN-Sentinel-Level-C</ulink>) websites and are regularly updated. For general questions, there is a hotline number: 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636). Queries can also be submitted 24/7 by email (online) at <ulink url="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/dcs/ContactUs/Form">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/dcs/ContactUs/Form</ulink>.

Culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis of anthrax. Specimens for culture should be collected prior to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. If this is not possible, histopathological evaluations of tissue in 10% buffered formalin using special stains or immunohistochemistry (IHC) may provide confirmation. In all manifestations of the diseases, an acute-phase plasma (preferred) or serum sample may be tested for the LF toxin. Because there is a gradual decline in toxin levels during antimicrobial therapy, specimens for LF testing should be collected ≤7 days (and up to 18 days) after symptoms appear, or as soon as possible after a known exposure. Postmortem samples are also of diagnostic value. For specimen collection and submission of autopsy samples, please refer to the CDC link above.</para>

        <para id="ch0042s000000p0043">If cutaneous anthrax is suspected, two swab specimens should be obtained, one for Gram staining and culture and the other for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). The method of sampling depends on the stage of the lesion. In the early stage (best for detection), fluid is collected aseptically from a previously unopened vesicle. At the eschar (late) stage, the edge of the eschar should be lifted and two specimens should be collected by rotating premoistened swabs beneath it. If only an ulcer is seen, the base of the lesion should be sampled with a premoistened swab. A full-thickness biopsy sample of a lesion (including adjacent skin) may be submitted for histopathology, special staining, and IHC. If the patient is not on antibiotics or has been treated for &lt;24 hours, a second biopsy should be submitted for culture and NAAT. If vesicle and eschar are present, biopsy specimens should be taken from both (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0089">89</link>).

Acute-phase (obtained within 7 days of onset) and convalescent-phase (obtained 14 to 35 days after onset) serum samples should be collected for serologic testing. Ideally, the convalescent-phase specimen should be collected 2 weeks after the acute-phase sample. Serology may also be performed with all other manifestations of anthrax. Pleural fluid, if present, should be obtained for Gram staining, culture, and NAAT and can be tested for LF toxin.

Whenever large, nonhemolytic, nonmotile, Gram-positive rods are observed, and especially if large numbers of these bacilli are observed in a specimen from a patient with symptoms consistent with an anthrax-like syndrome, then <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> should be suspected. The LRN provides protocols for ruling out <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> and referring out potential isolates. Several methods, including a <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis>-specific LRN PCR assay (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0092">92</link>) and serology (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0093">93</link>), were effectively used during investigation of the 2001 bioterrorism-associated outbreak as well as for confirmation of cases associated with drum-making (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0059">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0089">89</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0042s000000p0053">The most widely used and efficacious detection method in the U.S. public health system is the LRN PCR (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0092">92</link>). This test targets several distinct loci on the <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> chromosome and pXO1 and pXO2 virulence plasmids. The use of multiple loci increases specificity and allows the detection of avirulent or noncapsulated <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> strains (e.g., lacking pXO1 or pXO2) that might otherwise be mistaken for some other organism (e.g., <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis>). A positive PCR result on any clinical specimen collected from a normally sterile site (such as blood or CSF) or a lesion of other affected tissue (e.g., skin, pulmonary, reticuloendothelial, or gastrointestinal) is regarded as a supportive or presumptive diagnostic test. It is considered sufficient to provide a probable diagnosis but is not confirmatory in itself. The principal reason for such stringent guidelines on the use of NAAT approaches and the value of their results towards providing a confirmatory diagnosis are based on the possibility that environmental contamination of a non-anthrax-related lesion could result in a positive result. This is especially the case with the use of some previously published PCR primers for capsule and chromosomal genes that can produce false positives with reactions to soil microbiota. This is similar to the recommendations that are included in the 2008 WHO guidelines (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0013">13</link>), in which PCR can be used for identification of an isolate but is not recommended for testing of specimens. A rapid cartridge-based multiplex NAAT was developed for the simultaneous detection of <emphasis>B. anthracis, Francisella tularensis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Yersinia pestis</emphasis> bacteremia (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0094">94</link>). The limit of detection for <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> was 10 CFU/ml using spiked blood, with an assay specificity of 100% against non-<emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> isolates and patient samples.

Polyclonal antibodies specific for one of the <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> S-layer (cell surface) proteins is the basis of RedLine Alert Kit (Tetracore, Inc., Rockville, MD), a rapid test that can provide a result within 15 min. This assay has been approved by the FDA for use on nonhemolytic <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> sp. colonies cultured on sheep blood agar plates. Manufacturer’s data suggest that the test was 98.6% sensitive when tested on 145 <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> isolates and 49 nonhemolytic, non-<emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> isolates. Identification of <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> is considered only presumptive and should not be used as a stand-alone test, since cross-reactions do occur with a portion of <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group isolates. Similarly, a negative result, where there is suspicion of <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> by other criteria, warrants further testing. One of two strains of <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> bv. <emphasis>anthracis</emphasis> tested was negative using this assay (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0095">95</link>).

With such systems, it is important to keep in mind that, if a species is not included in the database, accurate identification is not possible. These systems also have limited value in distinguishing between some members of the <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0103">103</link>), with the exception of the presumptive identification of <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0104">104</link>). The API 50 CH strips, in conjunction with the API 50 CHB/E Medium, can identify 36 <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> and related genera to the species level in 24 to 48 h of incubation. A large number (&gt;200) of <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp. and related genera are listed in the Biolog database using the GEN III microplates. Setup is minimal, and bacteria can be identified in as little as 2 h. bioMérieux has designed the VITEK 2 <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> identification card (BCL) for the automated identification of aerobic endospore-forming bacteria of the family <emphasis>Bacillaceae</emphasis> using the VITEK 2 system (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0105">105</link>), and it is intended for industry use. A total of 55 species can be identified, and final results are obtained after 14 h. The more commonly used Gram-positive identification card in the clinical setting, however, does not include <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp. The BD Phoenix automated microbiology system (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD) lists 12 <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> species and related taxa in its Gram-positive panel identification database. Some commercially available databases are expanding and continue to improve, but keeping up with the changing taxonomy and deluge of new aerobic, endospore-forming species is a significant challenge. To be effective in identifying a particular species, a diagnostic database must account for intraspecies variability. Creation of a robust profile requires multiple authentic strains from a range of sources, yet many new species are proposed on the basis of single isolates and limited phenotypic information. Ideally, commercial kits with a limited database should always be used in conjunction with other methods. These automated systems should not be used to identify suspected high-risk pathogens, including <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis>. Doing so may result in misidentification (in some systems, <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> is not listed) and unnecessarily expose laboratory personnel to infection.</para>

        <para id="ch0042s000000p0067">Nucleic acid-based methods, especially 16S rRNA gene sequencing, may effectively identify strains that cannot be definitively characterized by morphological or biochemical methods. Guidelines for sequencing-based identification of bacteria are outlined in Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document MM18-A (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0106">106</link>). In the past, there were concerns about the accuracy and availability of reference sequences. These have since largely been resolved, and high-quality 16S rRNA gene sequences, for type and reference strains of most species, can be found in public databases (e.g., GenBank). Some species, notably <emphasis>B. cereus, B. thuringiensis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis>, are not effectively differentiated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. However, members of the <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group contain 11 to 14 ribosomal operons, with some intragenome variability. A single SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) at 16S rRNA gene position 1139 was deemed specific for <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis>, but it may not be detected without the use of base-calling software and/or visual inspection of electropherograms (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0107">107</link>). The 16S-23S intergenic transcribed spacer region contains signature sequences that can distinguish <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> from other members of the <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0108">108</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0042s000000p0068">In recent years, MALDI-TOF MS platforms for bacterial identification have been widely adopted by clinical microbiology laboratories. Two commercial systems, the VITEK MS (bioMérieux) and the MALDI Biotyper (Bruker, Billerica, MA), are currently available (see<ulink url="ch0021#ch0021s0001">chapter 6</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). As with the phenotypic methods, the availability of comprehensive databases impacts the accuracy of MS-based identification. IVD (<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic, FDA-approved) databases may not include spectral profiles for uncommon or recently described species, which can lead to no identification, misidentifications (particularly with closely related species), or genus-level-only results (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0021">21</link>). That said, the number of species represented in IVD and research-use-only (RUO) databases continues to expand with every update, as well as the number of strains added for select species. The MALDI Biotyper (MBT) RUO library updated in 2021 contains nearly 70 <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp. and &gt;140 <emphasis>Paenibacillus</emphasis> spp., many of which are represented by multiple strains, and includes species of both clinical and environmental/food relevance. In addition, representative strains spanning &gt;45 other genera of aerobic endospore-forming Gram-positive bacilli are also included, with many representing novel genera resulting from the most recent taxonomical updates of the <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> genus (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0003">3</link>). Similarly, the VITEK MS Plus/RUO SARAMIS V4.17 database contains &gt;40 <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp., &gt;30 <emphasis>Paenibacillus</emphasis> spp., and related species representing 19 other genera and includes some of the recent taxonomical changes (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0003">3</link>). These lists encompass more than the species typically encountered in the clinical setting or that are included in the IVD libraries. However, this helps to minimize the occurrence of “no identification.” These databases may not include recent or all uncommon species, and profiles for closely related but clinically distinct species (e.g., <emphasis>B. subtilis</emphasis> group and <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group) may be too similar to differentiate. MALDI-TOF MS for species identification should not be attempted if <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> is not ruled out. In addition to the added safety hazard without a filtration step (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0109">109</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0110">110</link>), <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> cannot readily be distinguished from other members of the <emphasis>B. cereus</emphasis> group, and this is a limitation of current systems. Furthermore, the Bruker and VITEK IVD libraries do not include <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> (and other biothreat agents), though it is included in the VITEK RUO database and in a separate Bruker database, i.e., Biotyper Security-Relevant (SR) Library. When the databases that contain biothreat agents are used, <emphasis>B. cereus, B. thuringiensis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>B. mycoides</emphasis> can be misidentified as <emphasis>B. anthracis</emphasis> and <emphasis>vice versa</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0111">111</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0112">112</link>). Supplementing commercial databases with locally produced profiles using in-house strains may help improve identification (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0113">113</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s000000li0114">114</link>). Analytical methods will continue to improve.</para>

Many PCR- and DNA sequencing-based typing methods have been described, but only a few gained widespread acceptance, including multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing. Whole-genome sequencing-based strategies, such as core genome MLST (cgMLST), are quickly becoming the gold standard for strain typing and molecular epidemiology. Whole-genome datasets include millions of nucleotides and can reveal differences among isolates that appear identical by other typing methods. These genomic approaches are also being used to reexamine phylogenetic relationships and are driving the taxonomic revision of aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0115">115</link>).</para>

In outbreak situations, serologic tests for anthrax are of limited utility because seroconversion takes time, whereas effective treatment and public health responses require rapid diagnostics. Moreover, in human anthrax, early treatment sometimes prevents development of a detectable rise in antibody titer (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0093">93</link>). However, serologic assays are valuable for retrospective surveillance and epidemiological investigations and can also be used to monitor vaccination effectiveness.

PA, LF, and EF are available commercially (List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA). In cases where culture has failed, serologic assays for the detection of antibody response against PA have been used, in combination with NAAT or IHC test results, to confirm the diagnosis of anthrax. During the 2001 event, a quantitative human anti-PA immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, performed at the CDC, was positive only with sera from individuals with anthrax or vaccinated with Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA) (<link linkend="ch0042s000000li0127">127</link>).

For example, if isolated in low numbers in a mixed culture along with <emphasis>Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis> from a skin surface swab, nonpathogenic <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> species may simply be reported as normal skin microbiota. Similarly, correlation with clinical picture would be required if isolated from a sterile site in only one of several media or specimens. However, opportunistic infections have been reported for a variety of species, and the clinical importance of aerobic endospore formers (most, but not all, of them <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp.), under certain circumstances, is widely accepted. One must be wary of dismissing any organism as a mere contaminant before considering the clinical context of its isolation. If it is obtained in moderate or heavy growth of a pure culture (or at least appears to dominate the microbiota), or if it is isolated from a sterile site or from more than one clinical specimen, then the organism should be considered of potential clinical significance.
