      <para id="ch0028s000000p0001">The long- and short-term preservation of microorganisms for future study has a long tradition in microbiology. As early as the 1880s it was observed that bacteria survived well in ice but that freeze-thaw cycles damaged the cell wall (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0001">1</link>). By the 1900s, researchers had optimized methods to preserve tissues, viruses, and bacteria for later use by freeze-drying. It had become apparent to early researchers that preserving microorganisms allowed them to be studied at a later time and to remain viable when transported (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0002">2</link>). Indeed, culture collections of microorganisms are valuable resources for scientific research in microbial diversity and evolution, patient management, epidemiological investigations, diagnostic test verification and validation, and educational purposes. Preserved individual strains of microorganisms serve as permanent records of microorganisms’ unique phenotypic profiles and provide the material for further genotypic characterizations. Such reference collections can encompass rare infectious agents unique to an individual or catalog the history of disease caused by common pathogens such as those responsible for community outbreaks.</para>
      <para id="ch0028s000000p0002">There are multiple methods for microbial preservation. Effective storage is defined as the ability to maintain an organism in a viable state, free of contamination and without changes in its genotypic or phenotypic characteristics. In addition, the organism must be easily restored to its condition prior to preservation. Microbial preservation methods have been extensively evaluated over the past 60 years, and often, optimal methods for preservation depend on a microorganism’s taxonomic classification. Review articles, monographs, and books have been published that provide detailed information about the storage of various types of microorganisms (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0003">3</link>–<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0007">7</link>). For clinical microbiology laboratories, simple and broadly applied methods are necessary to maintain organisms for short-and long-term recovery. This chapter presents methods that can be used for the storage of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses.</para>

        <para id="ch0028s000000p0003">The simplest method for maintaining the short-term viability of microorganisms, usually used for bacteria, is periodic subculture to fresh medium. Although it is simple, if a microorganism is saved for &gt;1 week, this method is potentially labor-intensive, requires extensive laboratory space, and may compromise a microorganism’s phenotypic profile. Each transfer to a new subculture increases the likelihood of mutation, with undesirable changes in a microorganism’s characteristics. Furthermore, plasmids may be lost with subculturing.</para>
        <para id="ch0028s000000p0004">The interval between transfers varies among organisms. Additionally, the rate of mutation is quite variable. Some organisms appear stable indefinitely with repeated transfer, and others may change phenotypic traits after as few as two or three passages. The actual rate of mutation, however, has not been studied until recently using sequencing technology (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0028s000000li0009">9</link>). In <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>, for example, the rate of mutation is estimated to be ~2.2 per 10<superscript>10</superscript> nucleotides per generation (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0009">9</link>). Other issues that must be addressed with direct transfer include the medium to be used, the storage conditions, and the frequency of transfer.</para>

          <para id="ch0028s000000p0005">The medium should support the survival of the microorganism but minimize its metabolic processes and slow its rate of growth. Extreme environments should be avoided because microorganisms have the unique ability to adapt through mutation events to survive in suboptimal surroundings. A medium with too high a nutrient content will induce rapid replication that requires more frequent transfers. The optimal medium for maintaining microorganisms has not been clearly defined and most likely varies from one species to another and may even depend on the individual strain. Media that have been used include distilled water, tryptic soy broth, and nutrient broths, all of which may be used with or without cryopreservatives.</para>

          <para id="ch0028s000000p0006">Many clinical laboratories store organisms, usually bacteria, for short periods on routine agar media at the workbench. Cultures kept in this fashion for prolonged periods are subject to drying. However, the preferred method is to transfer organisms into an agar slant tube (e.g., tryptic soy agar, blood agar, potato dextrose agar) with a screw top and to store them in an organized location away from sunlight and significant temperature changes. To prevent drying, caps can include rubber liners, or film can be wrapped over the top of the tube before or after the cap is screwed on. Storage at lower temperatures (5 to 8°C) slows metabolic processes and maintains viability for longer periods.</para>

          <para id="ch0028s000000p0007">There is no set protocol for the frequency of transfer since storage conditions, media used, and types of microorganisms vary among laboratories. Individual laboratories may conduct studies for each category of microorganism to determine optimal intervals between transfers under their conditions used for storage. Such studies would involve performing subcultures at scheduled times until the laboratory identifies an acceptable interval between transfers at which a microorganism can reliably and reproducibly be recovered. When transfers are performed, 5 to 10 representative colonies should be used to avoid the possibility of introducing an altered genotypic or phenotypic characteristic. For the passage and storage of quality control organisms for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, published standards should be followed (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0010">10</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0028s000000p0009">An alternative to capping tubes is to add a layer of mineral oil to the top of the isolate storage medium. Many bacteria and fungi can be stored for periods of up to 2 to 3 years with this method, and transfers are not needed as frequently. However, microorganisms are still metabolically active in this environment, and mutations can still occur. Mineral oil should be medicinal-grade oil with a specific gravity of 0.865 to 0.890. It is important to note that contamination of the isolate storage medium can occur if the mineral oil is not adequately sterilized. For sterilization, it should be heated to 170°C for 1 to 2 h in an oven with proper chemical and biological controls for the sterilization process (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0004">4</link>). Laboratories may further consider checking the sterility of the end product by culturing a sample before use. Autoclaving is not considered acceptable because steam cannot penetrate mineral oil as well as it does an aqueous solution. Sterile mineral oil is also commercially available.</para>
        <para id="ch0028s000000p0010">To prepare the isolate for stocking, a sampling of 5 to 10 colonies of the microorganism should be placed on an agar slant or in tubed broth media. Once there is adequate growth, typically after 24 to 48 hours of incubation for bacteria and yeast, and ~2 weeks incubation for molds, a layer of mineral oil at least 1 to 2 cm deep is added on top of the slant, and the media must not be exposed to air. As with the simple transfer method, tests for viability should be performed to determine the optimal transfer schedule that will ensure microorganism recovery. Most routine bacteria and nearly all fungi will remain viable for at least 1 to 2 years, with some strains documented to survive for 14 or more years. Colonies may be transferred by first removing as much oil as possible, then sampling colonies on the slant using a sterile stick or needle. Transfers will be less frequent than those of microorganisms stored without oil; however, oil is more difficult to add to vials and to clean up in the event of spills. Oil used to preserve microorganisms should be regarded as contaminated and properly disposed of as biohazardous waste.</para>

        <para id="ch0028s000000p0011">Refrigeration or freezing in ordinary freezers at −20°C may be used to preserve microorganisms for periods longer than those that can be accomplished by repeated transfers. Viability may be maintained for 1 to 2 years for specific microorganisms, but overall, damage caused by ice crystal formation (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0006">6</link>) and electrolyte fluctuations (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0004">4</link>) results in poor long-term survival. The medium used for storage appears to be important, since preservation times vary from a few months to 2 years depending upon which maintenance medium is used (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0028s000000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0028s000000li0012">12</link>) (<anchor id="ch0028s000000a0012"/><link linkend="ch0028s000000a0017">Table 1</link>). Modern self-defrosting freezers with freeze-thaw cycles must be avoided because cyclic temperature fluctuation will destroy the microorganism. Instead, freezers with only a manual defrosting option should be used.</para>

Soil has been described as a storage medium if it is autoclaved and air dried, but it is not a standardized, defined, and consistent product for use over long periods (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0004">4</link>). Instead, commercial silica gel can be used in small cotton-plugged tubes after being heated in an oven to 175°C for 1.5 to 2 h, with moderately successful recovery of fungi (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0006">6</link>). Alternatively, a suspension of 10<superscript>8</superscript> microorganisms can be inoculated onto sterile filter paper strips or disks. The paper is dried in air or under a vacuum and is placed in sterile vials. These vials can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 years, and then single strips or disks can be removed as needed (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0004">4</link>).

      <para id="ch0028s000000p0015">Whereas the methods described above may be used to store microorganisms for periods of up to a few years, ultralow-temperature freezing and freeze-drying (lyophilization) are recommended for long-term storage. Although the initial investment in ultralow-temperature freezers and/or lyophilization may be costly, these methods are less labor-intensive over time, require less laboratory space (e.g., a cryovial versus broth or agar media), and reduce the chance of mutation events. Of course, mutations, loss of mobile genetic elements, or phenotypic changes can still occur. For example,<emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> strains were observed to lose the <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> gene during long-term preservation at −80°C (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0020">20</link>), and <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis> has been described to become optochin resistant after frozen storage in glycerol (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0021">21</link>). Similar to other preservation methods, survival rates after freeze-drying vary with species. Evaluating microorganisms over a 10-year period, Miyamoto-Shinohara et al. found that survival rates after freeze-drying for <emphasis>Brevibacterium</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis> spp. approached 80%, whereas those for <emphasis>Streptococcus mutans</emphasis> decreased to 20% after 10 years (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0022">22</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0028s000000p0016">Microorganisms can be maintained at temperatures of −70°C or lower for prolonged periods. Systems for achieving these temperatures include ultralow-temperature electric freezers and liquid nitrogen storage units. With either system, unwanted heating can occur due to the loss of electrical power or liquid nitrogen. Close observation of the system and an adequate alarm mechanism are essential, since any increase in temperature will reduce organism viability. If the temperature does rise, restoring power and returning to the target storage temperature as quickly as possible are essential. The presence of a cryopreservative such as glycerol or skim milk may reduce the risk to microorganisms upon exposure to higher temperatures (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0028s000000li0024">24</link>). If thawing does occur, there are no guidelines for rapid restoration of the storage condition. Refreezing of the sealed vials as described below may be considered.</para>
        <para id="ch0028s000000p0017">For long-term storage, temperatures below −130°C are recommended for fastidious cells, particularly fungal hyphae, spirochetes, and protozoa. Cellular activity and chemical reactions cease at these low temperatures, but at −70°C they may still continue to a limited extent along with gradual decline in viability. Hence, for long-term cryopreservation of organisms beyond 10 to 15 years, storage in liquid nitrogen (−196°C) or liquid nitrogen vapor (−150°C) is recommended (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0003">3</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0028s000000p0018">Storage vials must be able to withstand very low temperatures and maintain a seal for their contents. Plastic (polypropylene) or glass (borosilicate) tubes that have been sterilized may be used. Plastic vials with screw tops and silicone washers are much easier to use than glass vials that must be sealed with a flame and then scored and broken open. Several commercial suppliers stock acceptable vials, e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA), VWR Scientific (Radnor, PA), DWK Life Sciences (Millville, NJ), and Becton, Dickinson and Co. (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Vials come in a variety of sizes. Half-dram vials are available from several suppliers and can be conveniently packaged in a 12-by-12 grid so that 144 vials are stored in one box or layer.</para>

          <para id="ch0028s000000p0019">To protect microorganisms from damage during the freezing process, during storage, and during thawing, cryoprotective agents are often added to the culture suspension. Whereas most bacteria, fungi, and viruses survive better with such additives, studies have shown that cryoprotective agents significantly damage other organisms. The reader is referred to detailed references for specifics (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0028s000000li0006">6</link>). Rapid freezing without additives may still be acceptable for the long-term survival of protozoa, although freeze-drying may be preferred.</para>
          <para id="ch0028s000000p0020">There are two types of cryoprotective agents: those that enter the cell and protect the intracellular environment and others that protect the external milieu of the organism. Glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are usually used for the former; sucrose, lactose, glucose, mannitol, sorbitol, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyglycol, and skim milk are used for the latter. Combinations of agents as well as detergents (e.g., Tween 80 and Triton WR 1339), other carbohydrates (e.g., honey), and calcium lactobionate have also been used. The most universal cryoprotectant is DMSO; however, the optimal cryoprotectant often varies with the microorganism. For example, glycerol appears to be best suited for the general preservation of bacteria and fungi whereas DMSO is preferred for complex organism cells such as protozoa and algae (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0003">3</link>). A comprehensive review of protectant additives used in the cryopreservation of microorganisms is provided by Hubálek (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0025">25</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0028s000000p0021">Glycerol is typically added at a final concentration of 10% (vol/vol), and DMSO is added at 5% (vol/vol). Prior to use, glycerol is sterilized by autoclaving. Once prepared, it can be stocked at room temperature for months. DMSO must be filter sterilized and can be stored in open containers for only 1 month prior to use.</para>
          <para id="ch0028s000000p0022">Of the external products, skim milk is the most often used. Dehydrated skim milk can be purchased from medical product suppliers, e.g., Becton, Dickinson and Co. and Hardy Diagnostics (Santa Maria, CA). It is autoclaved and used in a final concentration of 20% (wt/vol) in distilled water (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0003">3</link>). This is double the concentration of a reconstituted equivalent of regular milk.</para>

The pellet is withdrawn and resuspended in 2 to 5 ml of broth with the appropriate concentration of cryoprotectant additive. For microorganisms growing on agar, the agar surface can be scraped with a sterile loop, which is then placed directly into the vial of cryoprotectant and emulsified into a final dense suspension. The volume of the aliquots to be frozen is typically 0.2 to 2.0 ml. While more prone to contamination, another approach is to place broth containing the cryoprotectant on the surface of the agar. The surface is scraped with a pipette or sterile loop to suspend microorganisms, and then the broth mixture is pipetted directly into freezer vials.</para>

With molecular testing implemented in many clinical microbiology laboratories, it has become increasingly important to understand the storage conditions required for microorganism nucleic acids. Studies of extracted DNA from various specimen types have shown that microbial DNA is stable at refrigerated temperatures for at least 1 year and at frozen temperatures –20°C and below for 7 or more years (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0028s000000li0058">58</link>).

While contrived specimens and control materials are often used for verification of assays including multiplexed molecular panels, inclusion of primary patient specimens provides additional assurance that the assay can reliably detect target pathogens in a true biological matrix. Clinical laboratories should also consider how to properly store specimens that have unusual findings, that may be of public health interest, or that may require additional investigation. Given the competing storage needs of a laboratory, transfer of specimens to smaller vials is often necessary to conserve space. On the other hand, it may be advisable to make several single-use aliquots of specimens with rare or unusual analytes to prevent multiple freeze-thaw cycles to the specimen. In all cases, samples must be properly labeled and stored in an organized fashion, and inventory must be regularly updated for both practical and biosafety reasons.</para>

        <para id="ch0028s000000p0064">To preserve specimens containing microorganism DNA or RNA of interest, a simple and inexpensive method for blood or plasma is to spot the specimen on a filter paper-based product such as Whatman Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) matrix cards (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, United Kingdom) (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0028s000000li0061">61</link>). This approach is useful in settings where refrigerators and freezers are not readily available. In laboratories with access to ultralow freezer storage, microbial nucleic acids in patient specimens should be archived at –70°C or lower, temperatures which preserve not only the nucleic acid but often organism viability within the primary specimen (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0062">62</link>).

        <para id="ch0028s000000p0066">Specimens containing antibodies of interest typically retain stability for long periods when stored at –20°C or lower.

As demonstrated during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, banked pre-2019 serum or plasma as well as prospectively collected serum or plasma from patients in the acute and convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection were necessary planning steps for clinical laboratories to evaluate new assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (<link linkend="ch0028s000000li0070">72</link>).
