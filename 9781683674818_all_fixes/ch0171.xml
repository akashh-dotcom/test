      <para id="ch0171s000000p0002">Filarial worms are arthropod-transmitted nematodes (roundworms) that dwell, as adults, in the subcutaneous tissues and the lymphatics. Although eight filarial species infect humans, four are responsible for most of the pathology associated with these infections:<emphasis>Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, Onchocerca volvulus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Loa loa.</emphasis> The taxonomy of these parasites follows a newly adopted molecular approach (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0001">1</link>). In general, each of these parasites is transmitted by biting arthropods. Although these parasites are nonendemic in temperate areas, they are often seen in individuals who have immigrated to, resided in, or traveled to filaria-endemic tropical and subtropical areas. Infection is generally not established unless exposure to infective larvae is intense and prolonged (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0002">2</link>). The distribution and vectors of all the filarial parasites of humans are given in <anchor id="ch0171s000000a0002"/><link linkend="ch0171s000000a0009">Table 1</link>.</para>
      <para id="ch0171s000000p0003">All filariae go through a complex life cycle that includes an infective larval stage carried by the insects and an adult worm stage that resides in humans, either in the lymph nodes, the adjacent lymphatics, the subcutaneous tissue, or the pleural/peritoneal cavities. Development of the infective larvae to the gravid, adult stage in the vertebrate host requires several months and in some cases a year or more. Adult female worms produce microfilariae that circulate in the blood or migrate through the skin and eyes (for<emphasis>O. volvulus</emphasis>). The microfilariae can then be ingested by the appropriate biting arthropod and develop into infective larvae that can initiate the life cycle once more. Certain species (<emphasis>W. bancrofti, Brugia</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>L. loa</emphasis>) circulate in the blood with a defined circadian rhythm or “periodicity,” which can be nocturnal (typically the lymphatic filariae) or diurnal (<emphasis>L. loa</emphasis>). For some filarial species, periodicity of circulating microfilariae appears to be associated with the peak biting time of the insect vector. Other species (<emphasis>Mansonella perstans, Mansonella ozzardi</emphasis>) lack periodicity and are found in the peripheral blood at all hours of the day and night. When absent from the peripheral blood, the microfilariae are found in the deeper visceral capillaries, particularly within the pulmonary vasculature. Because the adult worms are typically sequestered in subcutaneous or lymphatic tissues, the diagnosis of infection depends on the detection of microfilariae in either blood or skin, depending on the species. Adult worms may survive for decades (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0003">3</link>), whereas the life spans of microfilariae range from 3 months to 3 years.</para>
      <para id="ch0171s000000p0004">Microfilariae are relatively simple in their organization and structure (<anchor id="ch0171s000000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0171s000000a0015">Fig. 1</link>). They are vermiform and in stained preparations appear to be composed of a column of nuclei interrupted along its length by spaces and special cells that are the precursors of body organs or organelles. Some species of microfilariae are enveloped in a sheath (<link linkend="ch0171s000000a0009">Table 1</link>; <anchor id="ch0171s000000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0171s000000a0017">Fig. 2</link>). Hematoxylin staining highlights the sheaths of all species, whereas sheaths of some microfilariae appear colorless on Giemsa-based stains. Blood microfilariae can be differentiated based on size, presence or absence of sheath, distribution of nuclei, and tail shape (<anchor id="ch0171s000000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0171s000000a0020">Fig. 3</link>) (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0004">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0171s000000p0005">There are significant differences in the clinical manifestations of filarial infections, or at least in the period over which the manifestations present, between patients native to the areas of endemicity and those who are travelers or recent arrivals in these same areas (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0005">5</link>–<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0007">7</link>).

It has an extensive distribution throughout tropical and subtropical areas of the world, including Asia and the Pacific Islands, Africa, areas of South America, and the Caribbean Basin. Humans are the only definitive host for this parasite and are therefore the natural reservoir for infection. There are both periodic and subperiodic forms of the parasite. Nocturnally periodic forms have microfilariae present in the peripheral blood primarily at night (between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.), whereas the subperiodic forms have microfilariae present in the blood at all times but with maximal levels in the afternoon. Generally, the subperiodic form is found only in the Pacific Islands (Tuvalu, Fiji, New Caledonia, the Marquesas, Samoa, and the Society Islands). Elsewhere, <emphasis>W. bancrofti</emphasis> is nocturnally periodic. The natural vectors are <emphasis>Culex fatigans</emphasis> mosquitoes in urban settings and usually anopheline, aedean, or mansonian mosquitoes in rural areas.</para>

      <para id="ch0171s000000p0010">Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is associated with a variety of clinical manifestations, which are primarily related to lymphatic damage caused by the adult worm and the associated host immune response. The most common presentations are asymptomatic (or subclinical) microfilaremia, lymphedema, hydrocele, acute adenolymphangitis or dermatolymphangioadenitis, and elephantiasis. Less frequently, LF can present with chyluria or tropical eosinophilia (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0171s000000li0009">9</link>). The range of clinical disease varies somewhat across geographic locations and according to the species of nematode causing the infection (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0010">10</link>). Additionally, the disease in previously unexposed individuals is more acute and intense than that found in natives of the region of endemicity (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0002">2</link>). Patients with asymptomatic (or subclinical) microfilaremia rarely come to the attention of medical personnel except through the incidental finding of microfilariae in the peripheral blood. Although they may be clinically asymptomatic, virtually all persons with <emphasis>W. bancrofti</emphasis> or <emphasis>B. malayi</emphasis> microfilaremia have some degree of subclinical disease that includes dilated and tortuous lymphatics, which can be visualized by lymphoscintigraphy (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0011">11</link>) and—in men with <emphasis>W. bancrofti</emphasis>—scrotal lymphangiectasia (detectable by ultrasound) (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0012">12</link>). Despite these findings, the majority of individuals appear to remain clinically asymptomatic for years. Relatively few progress to either the acute or chronic stage of infection (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0013">13</link>). Development of lymphedema may not occur until long after the initial infection. Lymphatic dysfunction develops as a primary event in response to adult filarial parasites and host immune responses in virtually all infected persons. This process has been shown to be progressive during infection and permanent once established (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0014">14</link>). Lymphedema most commonly affects the lower extremities but can also affect arms, breasts in females, and the scrotum in males. Secondary effects such as thickening of the subcutaneous tissues, hyperkeratosis, fissuring of the skin, and hyperplastic skin changes can occur. Recurrent attacks of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA)—characterized by edematous inflammatory plaques and systemic symptoms (fever, chills, myalgia, headache)—on the background of chronic skin changes and lymphatic dysfunction play a major role for lymphedema disease development and progression to elephantiasis (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0171s000000li0016">16</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0171s000000p0011">Acute attacks in LF cover a variety of clinical entities that present with inflammation. True filarial adenolymphangitis (ADL), believed to reflect the death of an adult worm, presents with inflammation, swelling, and retrograde lymphangitis extending peripherally from the draining node where the parasites presumably reside. Regional lymph nodes are often enlarged, and the entire lymphatic channel can become indurated and inflamed. The second type of acute attack is now labeled bacterial ADL or dermatoadenolymphangitis (DLA). Skin changes may result in entry lesions of the affected limb—particularly in the toe webs, which serve as portals of entry for skin biota (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0171s000000li0018">18</link>). For these reasons, limbs become susceptible to recurrent bacterial infections (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0171s000000li0020">20</link>). The clinical pattern of DLA is distinctly different from that of ADL (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0019">19</link>).

      <para id="ch0171s000000p0012">Hydrocele formation occurs in bancroftian filariasis when adult worms block retroperitoneal and subdiaphragmatic lymphatics. In males, this causes accumulation of straw-colored lymph either unilaterally or bilaterally between the visceral and parietal layers of the tunica vaginalis. The condition presents as a translucent mass obscuring palpation of the testis and differs from a congenital hydrocele or herniation in that the tunica is sealed at the top and peritoneal fluid is not communicating. If there is obstruction of the retroperitoneal lymphatics, renal lymphatic pressure can increase to the point at which they rupture into the renal pelvis or tubules so that chyluria is seen. The chyluria is characteristically intermittent and is often prominent in the morning just after the patient arises. In females, there have been reports of vulval lymphedema (also termed “vulval elephantiasis”) as well (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0171s000000li0024">24</link>).</para>

This syndrome affects males more often than females, most commonly young adults. Most cases have been reported from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Guyana, and Southeast Asia, but it can occur in any area where filarial infections occur. The main features include a history of residence in filaria-endemic regions, paroxysmal cough and wheezing that are usually nocturnal, weight loss, low-grade fever, and adenopathy and pronounced blood eosinophilia (&gt;3,000 eosinophils/μl). Patients are rarely found to have microfilariae in the blood, and circulating filarial antigen may be undetectable. Chest imaging generally shows increased bronchoalveolar markings, diffuse interstitial lesions, and/or mottled opacities prominently in the lower lung fields, but may be normal in 20 to 30% of cases (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0027">27</link>). Tests of pulmonary function show restrictive abnormalities in most cases and obstructive defects in half. Total serum IgE levels (10,000 to 100,000 ng/ml) and antifilarial antibody titers are characteristically elevated. Although there is no single clinical or laboratory criterion that aids in distinguishing TPE from other pulmonary diseases, residence in the tropics, the presence of high levels of antifilarial antibodies, and a rapid clinical response to diethylcarbamazine (DEC) favor the diagnosis of tropical eosinophilia (<link linkend="ch0171s000000li0027">27</link>).</para>

Skin snips are generally obtained from an area of affected skin or from the scapular, gluteal, and calf areas (in the African form) and from the scapular, deltoid, and gluteal areas (in the Central American form).
