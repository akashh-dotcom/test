        <para id="ch0110s0001s0001p0001">Enteroviruses (EVs) are members of the<emphasis>Picornaviridae</emphasis> family, with “pico” meaning very small, “rna” indicating an RNA genome, and “viridae” signifying viruses. Traditional criteria for taxonomy and identification of EVs to subgroups were based on patterns of replication in cell cultures, clinical syndromes, or disease and on disease manifestations in suckling mice. The subgroups were poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus A (CVA), coxsackievirus B (CVB), and echovirus (E). Echoviruses were initially named with the acronym “echo,” meaning enteric cytopathic human orphan, since they were first isolated from the stool of asymptomatic children and caused a cytopathic effect in cell culture. The criteria classified 67 different human EV serotypes until the designation was dropped in the 1960s, with all subsequent serotypes designated enterovirus (EV) followed by a number beginning with 68 (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0002">2</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0001p0002">With the development of molecular sequencing and the limited availability of antisera for characterizing newly identified strains and variant strains, the traditional methods of taxonomy have become challenging. The EV taxonomy was effectively redefined through phylogenetic analysis of the<emphasis>VP1</emphasis> gene (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0003">3</link>). Currently, EVs which predominantly cause disease in humans are divided into seven species: EV A through D and rhinoviruses (RVs) A through C (<anchor id="ch0110s0001s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0110s0001s0002a0004">Table 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0004">4</link>). Several EVs originally thought to be distinct serotypes are variants of the same strain (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0005">5</link>), and some strains have been reclassified into different groups (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0006">6</link>). Furthermore, new EVs have been identified (EV73 to EV121) (<ulink url="https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/positive-sense-rna-viruses/w/picornaviridae/681/genus-enterovirus">https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/positive-sense-rna-viruses/w/picornaviridae/681/genus-enterovirus</ulink>) (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0007">7</link>). To further complicate EV nomenclature, EVs have demonstrated intertypic recombination, most notable for PVs. The increase in pathogenic PVs has been attributed to intertypic recombination (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0008">8</link>). Lastly, host names have been removed from the EV genus (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0009">9</link>) and all classified EVs contain the species in the name (e.g., EV-B111).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0001p0003">Originally identified in 1956 as members of the EV genus, based on growth characteristics, echoviruses 22 and 23 are genetically distinct from other EVs and were classified as a separate species and renamed HPeV1 and HPeV2 (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0010">10</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0012">12</link>). HPeV3 was identified decades later by molecular methods (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0013">13</link>). Analogous to the genotyping of EVs, the use of the <emphasis>VP1</emphasis> gene sequence to determine the HPeV genotype is standard (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0015">15</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0001p0004">The genus<emphasis>Parechovirus</emphasis> (PeV) is now classified into six species. The host names have been removed from the PeV species, while the common names have remained the same in order to differentiate from the species names (<link linkend="ch0110s0001s0002a0004">Table 1</link>). PeV A is the only species that infects humans and comprises 18 different types, HPeV1 through -18 (<ulink url="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/picornaviridae/picornaviridae/parechovirus">https://ictv.global/report/chapter/picornaviridae/picornaviridae/parechovirus</ulink>). PeV B (previously <emphasis>Ljungan virus</emphasis> [LV]) was proposed to infect humans; however, the data are inconclusive.</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0001p0005">Molecular techniques have led to identification of many additional types of PeV based on the<emphasis>VP1</emphasis> gene sequence. Whole-genome sequence (WGS) analyses have identified multiple novel homologous recombinant HPeV strains within as well as between types (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0016">16</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0018">18</link>). This is not surprising since recombination has been documented to play a role in PeV evolution (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0019">19</link>). WGS analysis has identified common recombination breakpoints which will help to discern evolutionary relationships between HPeVs (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0020">20</link>).</para>

They are stable in acid, ether, and chloroform and are insensitive to nonionic detergent. As a result, EVs are environmentally stable and able to survive for days to weeks in water and sewage. They are inactivated by heat (&gt;56°C), UV light, chlorination, and formaldehyde. In cell culture, most EVs replicate optimally at 36 to 37°C except for RVs A and B, which replicate optimally at 33°C. RVs are covered more extensively in <ulink url="ch0111#ch0111s0001">chapter 92</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis> PeV are also acid stable and have a buoyant density in CsCl of 1.36 g/cm<superscript>3</superscript>.</para>

        <para id="ch0110s0001s0002p0004">The EV and PeV RNA genomes, of 7,100 to 7,450 and 7,339 to 7,608 nucleotides, respectively, serve as a template for both viral protein translation and RNA replication (<anchor id="ch0110s0001s0002a0009"/><link linkend="ch0110s0001s0002a0013">Fig. 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0021">21</link>). The genomes contain a long (approximately 750 bases) 5′-nontranslated region (5′ NTR), which immediately precedes a single open reading frame (ORF) (<link linkend="ch0110s0001s0002a0013">Fig. 1</link>). The EV ORF is translated into a single polyprotein that is posttranslationally cleaved into several functional intermediates and the final 11 proteins by the virus-encoded proteases 2A<superscript>pro</superscript>, 3C<superscript>pro</superscript>, and 3CD<superscript>pro</superscript> (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0022">22</link>), while PeV has a single protease (3C<superscript>pro</superscript>; <ulink url="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/picornaviridae/picornaviridae/parechovirus">https://ictv.global/report/chapter/picornaviridae/picornaviridae/parechovirus</ulink>). Immediately downstream of the ORF is a short noncoding region of approximately 70 to 100 bases (3′ NTR) and a terminal polyadenylated tail.</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0002p0005">The EV 5′ and 3′ NTRs play critical roles in the EV life cycle. The 5′ NTR contains multiple regions of predicted higher order structure (i.e., stem loops or domains). A domain located at the extreme 5′ terminus of the 5′ NTR is essential for viral RNA replication. Cap-independent translation of the EV genome is regulated by the internal ribosome entry (IRES) site, which spans a discontinuous region within the 5′ NTR. For PV and several non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs), the 5′ NTR has been documented to be a determinant of virulence phenotype and cell type specificity (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0024">24</link>). Given the crucial nature of the functions controlled by the 5′ NTR, it is not surprising that nucleotide sequences with near-absolute conservation among the EVs exist within this region. These regions of high nucleotide identity have been targeted for the design of primers and probes used for the detection of the EVs, but inevitably these same regions are conserved in RVs, making differentiation of EV and RV difficult. The 3′ NTR has also been demonstrated to play a role in viral RNA replication.</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0002p0006">The EV capsid is arranged in 60 repeating protomeric units that confer an icosahedral shape to the virion (<anchor id="ch0110s0001s0002a0010"/><link linkend="ch0110s0001s0002a0015">Fig. 2</link>) (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0021">21</link>). VP1, VP2, and VP3 compose the surface of the virion and possess an eight-stranded “beta barrel” core structure. The external loops that connect the beta strands are responsible for the differences in surface topography and antigenic diversity among the EVs. Neutralization sites, typically three or four per protomer, are most densely clustered on VP1. VP4 is located internally within the capsid and has no surface exposed regions.</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0002p0007">The resolution of the near-atomic structures of multiple human picornaviruses revealed that the EVs (and RVs) share many conserved structural motifs. Surrounding a conserved protrusion at the 5-fold axis of each pentameric unit (i.e., five protomers) is a narrow deep cleft (25 Å) or canyon. It is into this site that the specific receptors for the EVs bind when the virus encounters a susceptible host cell. EVs use a host of receptors include integrins, decay-accelerating factor (DAF; CD55), the coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), sialic acid, and the poliovirus receptor (PVR). Some EVs are able to use more than one receptor, and some require two receptors for infection, such as CV-A21, which requires both DAF and ICAM-1. Little is known about PeV receptor usage other than the use of αν integrins by HPeV-1.</para>

In addition, the PeV IRES is more similar to those of cardioviruses and aphthoviruses than of enteroviruses (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0025">25</link>). Cryoelectron microscopy has revealed a 28-nm-diameter PeV particle similar to other known picornaviruses, but with a somewhat smoother surface (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0026">26</link>). Sequence similarities between PeVs and the other picornaviruses suggest that the major capsid proteins share the typical beta-barrel core structure. Relative to the EVs, the PeVs are predicted to have a flatter surface topography (as shown with cryoelectron microscopy), with antigenic variants determined by the external loops.</para>

The majority of EV infections (70 to 80%) occur between July and September, which is 1 month earlier than that for historical poliomyelitis (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0027">27</link>). There are exceptions; for example, CV-A6 tends to occur in April, and EV-D68 peaks in September and continues into October. In tropical climates, EV infections occur year-round or with increased incidence during the rainy season. There are latitudinal differences within the U.S., with more regular distribution of cases year-round in the south and more pronounced summer and fall peaks in the north. These differences in seasonal patterns may be due to climate changes, particularly dew point, which is the best single predictor, followed by temperature and specific humidity (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0027">27</link>). Around the world, the peak incidence of HPeV infections occurs during the summer and fall months, but seasonal differences in incidence have been seen among serotypes (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0029">29</link>).</para>

Epidemic serotypes were characterized by substantial fluctuations in numbers over time with occasional increased incidence. Endemic serotypes had stable and usually low levels of circulation with few changes in incidence. The five most commonly reported EV serotypes from 1970 to 2005 (E9, E11, E30, E6, and CVB5) accounted for 48.1% of cases (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0030">30</link>), but from 2009 to 2013, CVA6 was the most commonly detected EV, with the majority of isolates of CVA6 occurring in 2012 (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0031">31</link>).

Generally, no disease is uniquely associated with any specific serotype, and no serotype is uniquely associated with any one disease. This is true even of paralytic poliomyelitis, which has been associated with numerous NPEV serotypes. However, different serotypes of EV have been associated with more severe disease and/or death in different age groups of children; in particular, CVB4 and HPeV3 were associated with higher risk for death, while E9 was associated with lower risk for death (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0048">48</link>).

Encephalitis and a sepsis-like syndrome consisting of high fever, severe irritability, tachycardia, poor perfusion, erythroderma, abdominal distention, and hepatitis have been more frequently associated with HPeV3 infection. It is important to point out that mortality is not common with EV infections. Although data from the National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) indicated mortality rates of cases with known outcomes being 3.3% over a 35-year period of surveillance, these data overrepresent more-severe cases of infection, as those are more often reported (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0030">30</link>). Unfortunately, these data were gathered from 1970 through 2005, and such intensive studies with outcomes have not been repeated. Furthermore, it is believed that much of the subsequent surveillance data available was skewed by heightened investigations of particular syndromes, for example, EV-D68 respiratory infections and CVA6-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease. It is possible that some of the evolving EV disease presentations such as EV-D68 and EV-A71 may increase overall EV mortality rates.</para>

The most common symptomatic manifestation of infection is acute nonspecific febrile illness with or without an exanthem. This so-called viral syndrome is one of the most numerically important causes of fever among infants and children. Although this illness itself is benign, it is of great concern because it mimics other more serious illnesses in infants and young children. Distinguishing EV and PeV infections from those due to common bacteria and other viruses is often difficult on clinical grounds alone, and hence, leads to unnecessary treatment. EVs and HPeV are responsible for a significant proportion of hospital admissions for the evaluation of acute febrile illness in children (8 to 20% and 3 to 8%, respectively), with much higher rates among infants (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0051">51</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0055">55</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0004p0003">By far the most vexing clinical EV/PeV syndrome that physicians encounter is aseptic meningitis. EV and HPeV are the most common cause of meningitis in the United States in all age groups and account for over 80% of all viral meningitides (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0042">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0048">48</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0056">56</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0058">58</link>). The onset of symptoms is usually sudden and generally includes fever, headache, occasionally photophobia, vomiting, rash, and myalgias. In young children, symptoms include fever, lethargy, and anorexia, again mimicking bacterial infection. Interestingly, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alterations are often minimal, in particular with the HPeV, with the majority of cases in infants lacking pleocytosis. Currently, treatment is supportive, with illness generally resolving after a week with no long-term sequelae. An estimated 30,000 to 50,000 hospitalizations for EVs meningitis occur each year. EV species B—including echoviruses and CVBs, particularly E4, E6, E9, E11, E16, and E30 and CVB2 and CVB5—constitute the principal EVs associated with this syndrome. HPeV3 has been recognized to cause a significant number of cases of aseptic meningitis, but other genotypes have been found (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0042">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0048">48</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0059">59</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0004p0004">The term poliomyelitis refers to the inflammatory damage due to infection of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. Recognized clinically as acute-onset lower motor neuron paralysis of one or more muscles, the case-fatality rate in the prevaccine era ranged from 5 to 10% (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0060">60</link>), and in recent epidemics, as high as 48% (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0061">61</link>). Historically, this disease was most commonly associated with the PVs; however, in most countries, this is no longer the case. In regions of the world where the polioviruses have been eradicated, the NPEVs, PeVs, and circulating vaccine-derived PVs (cVDPVs) are now the principal causes of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). cVDPVs are circulating strains derived from the vaccine (Sabin) strains of PV that have regained the capacity to cause paralytic poliomyelitis. Coinciding with the substantial decline in OPV2-induced immunity, many countries have reported cVDPV outbreaks which have resulted in 1,293 paralytic cVDPV2 cases from 2020 through 2021 (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0062">62</link>). Further, the deleterious impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on poliovirus vaccination efforts is exemplified by the reappearance of wild-type PV1 paralytic disease in Malawi, a country deemed polio-free since 2005 [<ulink url="http://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/wild-poliovirus-type-1-(WPV1)-malawi">www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/wild-poliovirus-type-1-(WPV1)-malawi</ulink>]. It is also important to point out that despite efforts towards polio eradication, these viruses are still endemic in some countries and have served as reservoirs for the reintroduction of polio to other areas (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0062">62</link>).</para>

Some affected children developed respiratory failure due to paralysis severe enough to require mechanical ventilation.

EV-D68 infection was detected from nasopharyngeal swabs from some of the paralyzed children. To further complicate matters, indications of infections with other organisms were also present in some children, including some coinfections. In 2014, a national AFM surveillance program began. Fall peaks in AFM cases were observed in the United States in 2014, 2016, and 2018, coinciding with similar patterns of increased rates of EV-D68 respiratory infections.</para>

However, EV71, which is closely related to polioviruses and CVA16, has been the cause of large outbreaks of HFMD with neurological and systemic complications in the Asia-Pacific region (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0088">88</link>). The neurological manifestations range from aseptic meningitis to AFM and brainstem encephalitis, which is associated with systemic features such as severe pulmonary edema and shock. Although serious disease due to EV71 has been described worldwide, high rates are observed in Asia; the reason for the geographic disparity in presentations is largely unknown but may be related to viral strain differences or to host HLA antigens (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0088">88</link>). CVA6, which has been associated with herpangina, has now been linked to outbreaks of atypical HFMD in the United States (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0089">89</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0004p0012">Upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms may accompany many of the enteroviral syndromes. EVs and HPeVs may be causal agents of upper and lower respiratory tract syndromes (e.g., summer cold, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia). Non-RV EVs have been etiologically linked in up to 15 to 21% of cases of upper respiratory tract syndromes (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0090">90</link>). The use of nucleic acid amplification methodologies has demonstrated that, depending on the country, the non-RV EVs are responsible for up to approximately 19% of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0091">91</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0092">92</link>).

Originally isolated from four children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in 1962 (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0099">99</link>), most reports on the isolation of EV-D68 from then until 2013 have been from the respiratory tract as sporadic isolations, as clusters of infections, or as epidemic collections (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0096">96</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0100">100</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0105">105</link>).

Clinical syndromes associated with infection have included bronchiolitis, bronchitis, encephalitis, and pneumonia. In some, disease has been severe enough to warrant admission to the intensive care unit (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0112">112</link>). Deaths have been reported (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0111">111</link>).

Surprisingly, approximately one-half to three-quarters of children are afebrile. Hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen is very common and can be severe enough to require admission to intensive care. Some children may require bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Chest radiographs may show infiltrates and atelectasis.</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0004p0015">Other acute clinical EV syndromes of significance include acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (predominantly caused by EV70 and a variant CVA24), herpangina, and pleurodynia (Bornholm disease). Data have been presented suggesting a link between EV infections and several chronic illnesses, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, polymyositis, congenital hydrocephalus, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but definitive proof of causation is lacking (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0113">113</link>).

Typically, EV infection begins with viral replication in the epithelial cells of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract and in the lymphoid follicles of the small intestine, followed by viremia, leading to a secondary site of tissue infection. Hence, for patients with aseptic meningitis, CSF is generally the specimen of choice; however, testing serum or plasma can yield better results early in the disease process (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0051">51</link>).

Pleocytosis is common in adults (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0123">123</link>), but in the early stages of CNS disease, neutrophils may predominate for a few hours. On the other hand, patients with EV encephalitis often have negative CSF PCR results even when they have CSF pleocytosis; in these patients, throat swabs and/or stool may be the specimen of choice. However, since EV and PeV are associated with prolonged periods of asymptomatic shedding from the throat and gastrointestinal tract (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0124">124</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0128">128</link>), their presence in samples from these sites is not necessarily proof of cause. However, many advocate for nonsterile site specimens such as stool and throat swabs or respiratory specimens, despite the lower specificity, because these samples are better suited for the detection of EV-A71 and EV-D68, respectively (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0116">116</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0118">118</link>).

Other than for infants less than 1 year old, analyses of blood samples by PCR have been almost uniformly negative (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0063">63</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0133">133</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0135">135</link>). For cases of herpangina and HFMD, vesicle fluid is an efficient sample for diagnostic testing, with greater yields observed when multiple vesicles are swabbed. For cases of AHC, the best specimens are conjunctival swabs (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0001">1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0005p0009">Optimal specimens are best transported and stored in viral transport media. However, because EVs are stable in liquid environments and can survive for many weeks in water, body fluids, and sewage, rapid transport of specimens to the laboratory is not critical. In fact, EVs survive at room temperature for 7 days and at 4°C to –20°C for up to a year (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0136">136</link>). Long-term storage at –70°C or colder is recommended to prevent degradation of viral RNA, which also preserves viral infectivity for cell culture for years (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0136">136</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0001s0005p0010">Certain clinical specimens, such as stool, require processing prior to inoculation of cell cultures. Specimen processing procedures for nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) should preserve viral capsid integrity so that the EV RNA genome is protected from nucleases that are ubiquitous in body fluids and the environment. Excessive freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided. Residual samples found in clinical laboratory refrigerators may be suitable for nucleic acid-based detection of the EVs because of the inherent environmental stability of the viral particle. Specimens that have been handled by automated chemistry or hematology analyzers should be considered compromised because of the potential for cross-contamination with other specimens. Sera for antibody testing are best collected 2 to 4 weeks apart at both acute and convalescent stages. The sera should be frozen at –20°C and tested simultaneously.</para>

      <para id="ch0110s0003p0001">Currently, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), are the recommended method for the detection of EV and PeV because of their enhanced sensitivity and rapid turnaround times (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0116">116</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0137">137</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0138">138</link>). Cell culture has little clinical utility due to the prolonged time required for viral isolation (up to 10 days for EV and 21 days for PeV). Some serotypes within the EV species C (i.e., CVA1, CVA19, and CVA22), as well as HPeV7 through -16, either fail to grow in cell culture or their propagation capacity is unknown. Furthermore, EV NAAT testing has a favorable impact on patient care. Outcome studies have demonstrated a correlation between time to result and length of stay (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0139">139</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0141">141</link>). Antibiotic usage was reduced, fewer ancillary tests were performed, and hospitalization was shortened and less costly when positive EV results were reported within 24 h (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0140">140</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0144">144</link>). Lastly, concern regarding the incidental culture of high-risk pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 had dissuaded more clinical laboratories away from culture.</para>
      <para id="ch0110s0003p0002">NAAT of CSF is more sensitive than cell culture, which has a sensitivity of 65 to 75% (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0145">145</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0150">150</link>). Interestingly, the sensitivity of NAAT for the detection of EV in cases of aseptic meningitis ranges from 70 to 100% despite indications that EVs are the primary causative agent (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0151">151</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0154">154</link>). One reason for this discrepancy is the fact that PeV, which can account for a significant number of cases of neonatal sepsis and aseptic meningitis, is not detected by universal EV RT-PCR assays. Furthermore, some neuroinvasive strains, such as EV-71 and PV, may not be detectable in CSF. More importantly, EV NAATs can have variability in their sensitivities for detecting all EV; for example, Xpert PCR detected only 82% of CSF specimens positive by another method (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0155">155</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0110s0003p0003">A limited number of studies have evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of NAAT with other sample types. For serum, the sensitivity of RT-PCR ranges from 74 to 83% for the diagnosis of EV infection and varies with presentation and patient age, with the sensitivities in infants being the highest (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0117">117</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0119">119</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0154">154</link>). In contrast, 100- to 1,000-fold greater sensitivity of RT-PCR over culture has been reported for detection of EV and PeV from CSF, throat swabs, or stool specimens (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0149">149</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0150">150</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0154">154</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0156">156</link>). In addition to the enhanced sensitivity of NAAT testing, this technology has the added benefit of rapid turnaround times, with results available in as little as 65 minutes.</para>
      <para id="ch0110s0003p0004">Prior to being tested by NAAT, EV RNA must be extracted from specimens to eliminate ubiquitous RNases and to remove potential amplification inhibitors. Only a small sample, generally 100 to 350 μl of fluid or 1 mg of tissue, is required. The most common methods for RNA extraction are gel membrane or magnetic silica binding. Multiple automated extraction methods have been utilized, including MagNA Pure LC and Compact (Roche Diagnostics System); easyMAG and EMAG (bioMérieux); and M48, QIAcube, QIAcube HT, EZ1, and QIAsymphony (Qiagen). Most systems utilize guanidine thiocyanate-based nucleic acid extraction buffers, which has an added benefit of inactivating polioviruses (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0157">157</link>). Both Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NAATs discussed below include extraction, amplification, and detection all in one cartridge or pouch. All aspects of NAAT testing, from extraction to detection, are discussed in more detail in <ulink url="ch0023#ch0023s0001">chapter 8</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="ch0110s0003p0005">Two FDA-approved NAAT assays are available for the detection of EV from CSF, the Cepheid Xpert EV and the BioFire Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) Panel (<anchor id="ch0110s0003a0003"/><link linkend="ch0110s0003a0005">Table 4</link>). In a multicenter analysis, the Xpert EV had a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 100% (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0158">158</link>). However, in routine clinical practice the sensitivity appeared to be much lower (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0155">155</link>). The BioFire ME panel is a multiplex test system which detects seven viruses, including EV and PeV, six bacteria, and one yeast associated with meningitis/encephalitis, and demonstrated a sensitivity of 92 to 96% for EV, with a specificity of greater than 99% (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0159">159</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0161">161</link>). The sensitivity for HPeV appears to be 94 to 97%, although the number of studies evaluating this target is low. It is not surprising that most studies, including those that compared the multiplex panel to the Xpert EV, demonstrated higher sensitivity with singleplex assays, a finding that was also observed with other viral targets. Xpert EV is scheduled to be discontinued in October 2023.</para>

In Europe, two assays are CE-IVD certified for the detection of PeV, the bioMérieux Parechovirus r-Gene and the Fast-track Diagnostics, FTD Viral Meningitis assay (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0178">178</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0179">179</link>). The Fast-track assay is a multiplex RT-PCR assay that detects both EV and PeV (<link linkend="ch0110s0003a0005">Table 4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0110s0003p0014">With regard to quality control, EV NAATs should include internal controls to detect amplification inhibitors and to assess nucleic acid recovery. EV RNA assay verification experiments and quality assurance performance demonstrate the need for a universal, nominal EV standard; however, none exists. Instead, most laboratories use either quantified EV isolates or transcripts from clones of target regions, both of which must be created and validated in the laboratory. Alternatively, there are commercial sources for EV and PeV viruses or RNA for validation and control material, including quantified material.</para>
      <para id="ch0110s0003p0015">Multicenter proficiency testing programs for LDT EV NAATs indicate that properly designed tests can be equally effective in the detection of EV, regardless of the format used (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0180">180</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0181">181</link>). However, other studies have reported marked variation in testing proficiency between centers. In one survey, one-third of participating laboratories were nonproficient in the detection of EV by RT-PCR (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0136">136</link>). In another report, 6.8% of participating laboratories recorded false-positive results, pointing to the need for fastidious attention to methods for preventing cross-contamination (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0180">180</link>). It would be useful to repeat the studies to see these if these problems exit currently for pan-EV assays. There has been a quality assessment study for EV-A71 and CV-A16 detection; interestingly, the results differed substantially between laboratories, even when using the same assay, as one of the assays failed to detect EV-A71 altogether (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0181">181</link>). Overall, these findings underscore the importance of rigorous quality control and periodic proficiency reassessment to ensure uniformly high-quality testing.</para>

        <para id="ch0110s0003s0001p0001">Historically, a combination of human and primate cell lines is typically used for EV and PeV isolation since no single cell line supports the growth of all types. Furthermore, several CVA serotypes do not grow in routine cell culture (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0001">1</link>). However, the inclusion of a cell line with ICAM-1 receptors, such as HEp-2 cells, enhances the recovery of CVAs (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0182">182</link>–<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0184">184</link>). The general susceptibilities of commonly used cell lines are summarized in <anchor id="ch0110s0003s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0110s0003s0001a0006">Table 5</link>. Often, at least three different cell lines, usually including monkey kidney cells and human fibroblasts, are used. Isolation times for EVs from CSF using traditional cell culture techniques range from 4 to 8 days but are shorter (1 to 3 days) from sites with higher viral titers. Recovery time for PeV is variable, dependent upon both virus and cell type, and often is associated with delayed or no production of cytopathic effect (CPE) (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0185">185</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0110s0003s0001p0002">Infections of susceptible cell monolayers with EVs result in a characteristic CPE, consisting of shrinkage and rounding of individual cells within the monolayers. The nuclei of infected cells exhibit pyknosis. As infection progresses, the cells degenerate and separate from the monolayer. Often the CPE is so characteristic that a presumptive diagnosis of EV infection can be made (<anchor id="ch0110s0003s0001a0005"/><link linkend="ch0110s0003s0001a0024">Fig. 3</link>). However, experience is necessary, as toxic effects from primary specimens, such as <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> toxin, can mimic CPE (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0186">186</link>). Although the CPEs for EV and PeV are very similar, differences have long been noted. The CPE for PeV can appear as larger, regularly shaped spheres compared to small irregular shapes caused by EVs (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0001a0024">Fig. 3</link>) (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0187">187</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0003s0001p0003">The relatively low sensitivity of viral culture from CSF (65 to 75%, reviewed in reference<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0188">188</link>) is likely due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies, inadequate CSF volume for a comprehensive culture (i.e., inoculate three to five cell types), low viral load, and resistance of some serotypes to culture. Many serotypes within the EV group C (i.e., CVA1, CVA19, and CVA22) and HPeV7 through -14 are nonculturable. Historically, stool cultures have been thought to have greater sensitivity for EV/PeV detection than CSF culture (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0189">189</link>); however, PCR testing of stool is even more sensitive (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0156">156</link>).</para>

Evaluations of the capacity of Super E-Mix to isolate PeV have not been performed; however, it is presumed that at least HPeV1 and HPeV2 would grow in this cell mix because A549 cells are susceptible to infection.

        <para id="ch0110s0003s0002p0001">Public health and reference laboratories still performing culture generally use PCR and molecular typing methods for identification of culture isolates. But historically, broadly reactive and serotype-specific EV monoclonal antibodies were applied to cell culture confirmation by immunofluorescence (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0194">194</link>). These reagents, used singly and in blends (D<superscript>3</superscript> IFA Enterovirus Identification Kit [Quidel] and Light Diagnostics Pan-Enterovirus Blend [MilliporeSigma]), play an important role in serotype identifications. The D<superscript>3</superscript> IFA Enterovirus Identification pool claims to have good sensitivity, including the detection of EV71 with no cross-reactivity. The concordance of results for identification of clinical EV isolates to the species level using monoclonal blends versus the neutralization assay has demonstrated that the latter is superior for the identification of the EVs (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0195">195</link>). With regard to PeV, typing reagents are only available for types 1 and 2, and not all HPeV-2 isolates are neutralized by specific antisera (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0196">196</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0110s0003s0003p0001">This virus family exhibits a considerable amount of genetic variability, driven by both mutation and recombination (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0197">197</link>). However, serotype determination is usually unnecessary for clinical purposes because the diseases caused by the EVs are not serotype specific. Currently, the identification of EV type is most useful for distinguishing between VDPV and NPEVs to facilitate the interpretation of viral culture results in areas where the Sabin PV strains are used for vaccination, as the live vaccine can be shed for 1 to 2 weeks from the throat and can remain in the feces for several weeks to months (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0038">38</link>). Identification of NPEV serotypes is useful for epidemiological purposes and for determination of serotypes associated with unusual or novel clinical manifestations, such as flaccid paralysis (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0002">2</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0003s0003p0002">Historically, EV serotype determination involved neutralization with the Lim Benyesh-Melnick (LBM) pools of antisera; however, genetic drift of the EVs over time has given rise to antigenic variants. It is also known that permissiveness of cell lines significantly biased the incidences of various EV types and skewed the distribution towards EV-B viruses (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0198">198</link>). Furthermore, the procedure is labor-intensive and the supply of LBM pools available from the World Health Organization is limited (distribution is restricted to reference laboratories).</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0003s0003p0003">Sequencing of the<emphasis>VP1</emphasis> gene is now the primary method used for typing. Specifically, a 340-bp region that encodes the serotype-specific neutralization epitopes of <emphasis>VP1</emphasis> is amplified, sequenced, and analyzed against a sequence database for known EVs (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0199">199</link>, <link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0200">200</link>). A threshold of 25% nucleotide and 12% amino acid divergence in the complete <emphasis>VP1</emphasis> gene sequence generally corresponds to the previous serological division of EVs into members of the same or different serotypes (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0005">5</link>). A pyrosequencing method based on the assay reported by Nix et al. (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0199">199</link>) has also been developed to shorten the time to identify the EV type (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0201">201</link>). Molecular typing methods reduce the testing time by weeks (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0200">200</link>) over classical serotyping. In addition, these methods of “molecular serotyping” have been extremely useful in characterizing new EV serotypes and identifying “nontypeable” isolates that could not be neutralized by traditional LBM pools (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0005">5</link>).

Complement fixation testing is available from a few commercial laboratories in the United States but is not recommended for the diagnosis of EV infection due to lack of specificity (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0138">138</link>). Classically, serologic diagnosis of EV infection involved comparing antibody titers in acute- and convalescent-phase serum in a neutralization assay, with a 4-fold or greater rise in type-specific antibody titer considered as diagnostic of recent infection. However, acute-phase sera are often not obtained because of nonspecific presentations early in EV disease.</para>

        <para id="ch0110s0003s0006p0001">An understanding of the sites where asymptomatic shedding and disease-induced replication occur is critical to the interpretation of EV and PeV test results. Detection of these viruses in the CNS, bloodstream, and lower respiratory tract implies a true invasive infection and a high-level likelihood of association with current illness. In contrast, they can be shed asymptomatically from the nasopharynx and the gastrointestinal tract for weeks to months. Detection of EVs by virus isolation or NAAT at these sites for diseases other than respiratory or gastrointestinal must be interpreted cautiously because their presence alone does not establish a diagnosis. EV in the feces or nasopharynx of a patient with meningitis may represent residual shedding from an infection from weeks before and may be unrelated to the current illness.</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0003s0006p0002">In young children, an additional factor potentially complicating the evaluation of results from these body sites is the administration of live attenuated oral PV in the first years of life. While the vaccine is no longer used in the United States (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0138">138</link>), most countries worldwide, including some in Europe, still employ oral PV as part of their vaccination regimes. In such settings it is necessary to test specifically for PV and NPEV.</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0003s0006p0003">Another issue with the specificity of NAAT testing from respiratory specimens is that most pan-EV assays likely cross-react with RVs. Many commercial tests do not claim to differentiate between the two. Furthermore, most assays have not been completely evaluated against a large number of EV or RV strains to confirm inclusivity or exclusivity of all strains (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0232">232</link>). However, rarely is it clinically necessary to differentiate the viruses, particularly for respiratory infection, and one must remember that RVs are EVs. On the rare occasion when differentiation between EV and RV is needed, sequence analysis can be performed. But even for viral myocarditis, understanding the etiological agent has more academic than therapeutic benefit.</para>
        <para id="ch0110s0003s0006p0004">A further cautionary note is warranted regarding coinfections of the CNS with EVs and bacteria (<link linkend="ch0110s0003s0007li0142">142</link>). In these rare instances, illness was clinically compatible with bacterial meningitis and EV was later isolated incidentally. Because of the severity of disease, antibiotics would have been used regardless of the sequence of pathogen detection. When the clinical presentation is typical of viral meningitis, coinfection with a clinically “silent” bacterium would be extraordinarily unlikely. Hence, identification of an EV from a sterile site in a patient with a clinically compatible illness is sufficient evidence for establishment of EV causality. PeV NAAT testing should be considered if negative results are obtained for EVs in the setting of clinically compatible disease.</para>
