        <para id="ch0034s000000p0001">The principles that underpin taxonomy remain remarkably stable, despite being theoretical, and methodological advances used to assign microorganisms to specific taxa continue to evolve. Perhaps the most remarkable change came with the advent of DNA sequencing and its application to the sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene found in all genomes of<emphasis>Bacteria</emphasis> and <emphasis>Archaea</emphasis>. This revolution began in the mid-1980s but gained universal acceptance and utilization in the 1990s, becoming a standard method used in the identification of microorganisms. This major development in microbial identification and classification was further enhanced when the second edition of <emphasis>Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology</emphasis> arranged organisms into a phylogenetic framework based on analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene. Previous editions of the manual, which was first published in the 1920s, were based on the phenotypes of microorganisms.</para>
        <para id="ch0034s000000p0002">The application of 16S gene rRNA sequencing was embraced by the taxonomic community and quickly led to an explosion of novel taxa being described and, as important, the realization that many established taxa had been misclassified and required reassignment. Nowhere is this more apparent and important than with the genus<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> and its close relatives, as many of these organisms are associated with diseases, as discussed in <ulink url="ch0073#ch0073s0001">chapter 56</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>, “<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> and Other Spore-Forming Gram-Positive Rods.” Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, Collins and colleagues showed huge diversity of the clostridia, designating 19 16S rRNA gene clusters, and suggested that the name “<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis>” should be reserved for the group containing the type species (<emphasis>Clostridium butyricum</emphasis>) and close relatives located in rRNA cluster I (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0002">2</link>). However, based on this work and others, it was not until 2016 that Lawson and Rainey formally made the proposal to restrict <emphasis>Clostridium sensu stricto</emphasis> to the group designated rRNA cluster I and reclassify several species into novel and existing genera (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0004">4</link>). The consequences of these changes were that many clostridial species that were not phylogenetically located in rRNA cluster I could no longer be considered true members of the genus <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> and therefore required reclassification. Indeed, this process continues to the present day, with many former <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species having been reclassified. While many organisms are not of clinical importance, some have long been associated with human infections, and their reclassification is not always universally welcomed (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0006">6</link>); thus, the relationship between taxonomy and health care professions is not always an easy one. Two cases exemplify this. The first is the important clinical pathogen <emphasis>Clostridium difficile</emphasis>, a member of rRNA cluster XI that was renamed <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> by Lawson and colleagues in 2016 (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0005">5</link>). While initially not universally approved by the clinical community, the name was validly published and is now well established (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0007">7</link>) and used on the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/organisms/cdiff/Cdiff_infect.html">https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/organisms/cdiff/Cdiff_infect.html</ulink>). A second example is the revision of the genus <emphasis>Propionibacterium</emphasis> and the transfer of many recognized species to novel genera, including the controversial reclassification of the common pathogen <emphasis>Propionibacterium acnes</emphasis> as <emphasis>Cutibacterium acnes</emphasis>. Although these changes were based on sound phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses, some clinical microbiologists may be uncomfortable with the renaming of long-established pathogens present in many clinical databases. One issue raised by the clinical community is that of outdated data retrieval systems where new names have not been incorporated into databases or there is no method to input some of the long names now being proposed (K. Carroll, personal communication). To address some of these issues, the <emphasis>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</emphasis> publishes a biennial report of novel taxa derived from human clinical specimens and nomenclature revisions (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0008">8</link>). Therefore, taxonomy can have a huge impact on members of the health care community dealing with clinical isolates that is often unappreciated, and yet by the process of identification and the naming of organisms in an orderly manner, it is the basis of determining diagnoses and formulating therapeutic interventions. With the increasing number of novel taxa recovered from clinical material and the increasing role of the microbiome in personalized medicine (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0009">9</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0011">11</link>), it is imperative that clinical microbiologists be cognizant of taxonomic changes. In order to assist clinical laboratories, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) will shortly be publishing a document (CLSI M64) to assist in these changes (K. Carroll, personal communication).</para>

      <para id="ch0034s000000p0003">Since Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first observed his “animalcules” using his simple microscope lenses, scientists have sought to identify and then classify microorganisms (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0012">12</link>). These first observations of morphology were further enhanced by the development of the Gram stain by Hans Christian Gram in 1882 and followed by the determination of physiological traits via the determination of biochemical tests, including the differential utilization of carbohydrates which became fundamental methods for identification (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0013">13</link>). Comparative biology between organisms, known as systematics, became the cornerstone of this science and makes use of methods that are continually being refined or advanced. For example, chemotaxonomic properties and more modern methods, such as the application of molecular techniques, including sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), and a slew of DNA fingerprinting methods, have added increasing levels of sophistication and sensitivity. More recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have enhanced the tools available in the identification of microorganisms and taxonomy as a whole.</para>
      <para id="ch0034s000000p0004">For most modern investigators, the terms “systematics” and “taxonomy” are synonymous, but scholars such as Cowan would contest this assertion (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0015">15</link>). Systematics is a broader field of biology that studies the diversity and relationships between organisms. Taxonomy, on the other hand, is more narrowly defined and can be considered to fall under the umbrella of systematics <emphasis>per se</emphasis>, consisting of (i) classification (the arrangement of organisms into taxonomic groups), (ii) nomenclature (assignment of names to the taxonomic groups), and (iii) identification (the process of determining that a new isolate belongs to one of the established taxa). In 2010, Staley proposed that “comprehending microbial diversity” should be a fourth goal of taxonomy considering the enormous amount of microbial diversity revealed by sequencing methods (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0017">17</link>). Although figures vary, a conservative estimate of the number of bacterial and archaeal species on Earth is well over a million (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0019">19</link>). However, to date, only about 21,088 species have been validly named, with just 700 to 1,000 novel species being added annually (<ulink url="https://lpsn.dsmz.de/text/names-per-year">https://lpsn.dsmz.de/text/names-per-year</ulink>). At this rate, it will take many centuries to catalog even a fraction of this enormous microbial diversity. Indeed, we are at a pivotal point in the field of microbial systematics. A robust debate is now taking place on precisely which methods should be used, ranging from the traditional polyphasic approach, incorporating multiple methods to characterize taxa as comprehensively as possible, to a more minimalist approach, in which the genome sequence is published with only a few laboratory-based characteristics (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0020">20</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0022">22</link>). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the genome sequence be the “type” material for taxonomic descriptions of prokaryotes in addition to extant organisms (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0023">23</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0034s000000p0005">A strong taxonomy must encompass sufficient biological markers for identification and ensure that the assignment of taxa to a particular group is a robust process. The fundamental goal is to construct a taxonomy that is practical and predictive and that is broadly stable. It is inevitable that, with the explosions in WGS, the full repertoire of information derived from these sequences will increasingly be used to describe new taxa and the information incorporated into new taxonomies. This “genomic route” is now preferred by a growing number of investigators, due mainly to the reduced costs and reduced time taken to analyze and publish the data. The practice of confirming physiological traits inferred from genes present in the genome is more often being circumvented, leading to a “production-line” taxonomy. Although a unifying theme adopted by most professional taxonomists is that information acquired from genomic analysis by affordable next-generation sequencing must be embraced, the debate continues as to what level of analysis is required and whether this will be at the expense of good taxonomic practices traditionally performed (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0025">25</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0034s000000p0006">For some, taxonomy is viewed as a somewhat antiquated subject, esoteric and not worthy of study. Of course, many would argue this point, and taxonomy is currently receiving renewed attention in response to investigations into the microbiome for the diagnosis of disease and its manipulation for therapeutic applications (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0026">26</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0029">29</link>). In the clinical laboratory, it is essential to detect, isolate, and identify which organism(s) is responsible for an infection and convey this information to health care providers and the wider public health system when necessary; a species name must mean the same thing to everyone. Studies on the human microbiome are revealing insights into its multiple roles in health and disease processes; it is evident that the identification of key, clinically important organisms will lead to a rise in the use of microbiome applications in human health as the commercialization of personalized medicine will be exploited in the coming years (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0026">26</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0029">29</link>). Despite being an important tool in our fight against disease, understanding of the microbiome and the organisms present is remarkably insufficient, with only approximately 60% to 80% of sequences recovered being assigned to known taxa (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0030">30</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0032">32</link>). With public interest in “the microbiome” growing and a suite of new tools to identify and cultivate microorganisms in the laboratory, a renaissance in taxonomy is under way. This chapter introduces methods used in modern taxonomy; rather than including extensive information on each method, which is beyond the purview of this chapter, the reader is directed to the primary literature cited. Where appropriate, practical resources for the methods discussed are provided; for example, two invaluable textbooks are volumes 38 and 41 of the <emphasis>Methods in Microbiology</emphasis> series, <emphasis>Taxonomy of Prokaryotes</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0033">33</link>) and <emphasis>New Approaches to Prokaryotic Systematics</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0034">34</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0034s000000p0008">Systematics, and more specifically the classification of microorganisms, is a dynamic field subject to theoretical and methodological advances that affect how characteristics of organisms are determined; these may vary from simple refinements to existing methods to the wholesale development of new technologies, as exemplified by the application of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which revolutionized our view of microbial diversity (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0036">36</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0038">38</link>). In a relatively short period, this method became the method of choice and the gold standard for taxonomy, as reflected by the change in the name of <emphasis>Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology</emphasis> (editions 1 to 9, 1923 to 1994) to <emphasis>Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology</emphasis> (first edition, 1984 to 1989; second edition, 2001 to 2012) and the recent online digital edition, <emphasis>Bergey’s Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0039">39</link>) (<ulink url="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781118960608">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781118960608</ulink>). The latter innovation is in response to the explosion in the description of novel taxa and the need to provide up-to-date descriptions of all named prokaryotic taxa in a timely manner. A reliable classification is a prerequisite for anyone dealing with microorganisms, whether in academia, industry, or health care. The goal is the characterization and orderly arrangement of organisms into groups. A comprehensive review of classification is beyond the scope of this text, and the reader is referred to primary literature (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0041">41</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0034s000000p0009">Broadly speaking, classification schemes can be divided into those constructed prior to the advent of molecular methods and those based or modified on these methods, providing a phylogenetic (evolutionary) approach (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0040">40</link>). Early classification systems were based on morphological and biochemical data embracing staining methods, such as Gram staining (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0042">42</link>), and the ability to utilize carbohydrates that produce specific profiles. These allowed the identification and delineation of species; such fundamental methods continue to form the basis of identification for many laboratories (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0013">13</link>). An important development, particularly in the clinical laboratory, was the introduction of miniaturized test kits or phenotypic fingerprinting, wherein a single test system allowed the determination of multiple physiological properties, such as carbohydrate and enzymatic profiles. These profiles correspond to numeric identification codes, which can be searched with online databases; unfortunately, a drawback of these databases is that they often lag behind and do not contain the data from recently described organisms (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0043">43</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0046">46</link>). Another shortfall of phenotypic methods is that such approaches cannot be universally applied across all bacterial and archaeal groups; for example, not all organisms are metabolically active in these assays, a complication that leads to data and classification schemes that are fragmented.</para>
      <para id="ch0034s000000p0010">Such limitations led to the concept and theory of applying traits linked to evolution and phylogeny. Unfortunately, these early attempts at constructing phylogenetic relationships and tree-based taxonomies were rooted in cell morphology (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0035">35</link>). Classifications based on natural phylogenetic relationships could not be realized until the application of molecular methods based on nucleic acids and the evolutionary information contained therein. In 1965, a seminal paper by Zuckerkandl and Pauling introduced the concept of “molecular clocks,” derived from the sequences of amino acids or nucleotides (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0047">47</link>). The next major step forward was achieved in the 1960s and 1970s with the pioneering work of Carl Woese, George Fox, and colleagues and the development of oligonucleotide cataloging, followed by almost full-length sequencing of 16S and 23S rRNA genes (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0048">48</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0049">49</link>). In addition to sequence information, chemical constituents of the cell known as chemotaxonomic markers, e.g., cellular fatty acids, cellular sugars, mycolic acids, polar lipids, polyamines, respiratory quinones, and amino acid composition, as well as the diamino acid of the murine layer, were found to be stable biomarkers and reflect phylogenetic relationships (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0050">50</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0055">55</link>). Indeed, these traits, to a lesser or greater extent, are still included in most contemporary formal descriptions of <emphasis>Bacteria</emphasis> and <emphasis>Archaea</emphasis>. However, many laboratories now lack the technical ability to perform such analyses. Some now suggest that due to the labor involved, lack of reproducibility, and absence of curated databases, these chemotaxonomic methods should no longer be a prerequisite of future descriptions (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0056">56</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0057">57</link>).</para>

A definition generally accepted by microbiologists was proposed by Colwell in the 1970s: “a group of strains that show a high degree of overall similarity and differ considerably from related strain groups with respect to many independent characteristics,” or simply “a collection of strains showing a high degree of overall similarity, compared to other, related groups of strains” (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0079">79</link>).

        <para id="ch0034s000000p0013">Although DDH has long been regarded as the gold standard for prokaryotic species circumscriptions, the explosion of the description of novel species, based on the use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, became the method of choice, especially in the initial identification process. The relationship of DDH to 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity has been studied; for many years, a value of 97% sequence similarity was used to correspond to 70% DDH similarity (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0084">84</link>). This threshold of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity was quickly adopted by the scientific community to reduce the need to perform the tedious DDH in the laboratory. More recent studies have now increased the 16S rRNA gene similarity threshold value to between 98.6% and 99.0% (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0085">85</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0086">86</link>).</para>

        <beginpage pagenum="344"/>
        <para id="ch0034s000000p0014">Due to the time involved in performing DDH, error rates, and the lack of cumulative databases, alternative methods for DDH have been sought (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0074">74</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0087">87</link>). Because of its conserved nature, the resolution of the 16S rRNA gene for the discrimination of novel taxa can be insufficient to separate very closely related organisms. Gene sequences having greater resolution, such as ATP synthase (<emphasis>atpA</emphasis>), DNA gyrase subunit B (<emphasis>gyrB</emphasis>), RNA polymerase A subunit (<emphasis>rpoA</emphasis>), RNA polymerase B subunit (<emphasis>rpoB</emphasis>), RNA polymerase C subunit (<emphasis>rpoC</emphasis>), phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase (<emphasis>pheS</emphasis>), and superoxide dismutase (<emphasis>sod</emphasis>), have been extensively used as alternative chronometers (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0088">88</link>). Molecular phylogenies based on single genes can also lead to discrepancies, but these can be reduced with the application of multiple housekeeping genes incorporated into MLSA (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0088">88</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0089">89</link>). Multiple genes provide more informative nucleotide sites and offset biases associated with the use of single gene products. Although the method proved very useful, it was not without problems, notably the lack of universal primers and a standard set of genes that cover all phylogenetic groups; problems also arose with the concatenation of genes (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0090">90</link>). In addition to the problems identified, the basic method, like so many other molecular methods, has been overtaken by low-cost genome-sequencing technologies (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0091">91</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0092">92</link>) and to a large extent has fallen by the wayside.</para>
        <para id="ch0034s000000p0015">Expansion of sequencing applications coupled with advances in computerization incorporated in bioinformatics encouraged even more laboratories to turn to genomic methods (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0091">91</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0094">94</link>). The methods that have come to the forefront in the delineation of taxa are based upon an estimation of genomic relatedness by use of genome-sequencing data, generally termed “overall genome relatedness indices” (OGRI), which provide a simple, reproducible, and objective means of comparing two genomes. These methods have been reviewed by Chun and Rainey (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0095">95</link>). Two approaches that have become the methods of choice are digital DDH (Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator [GGDC]) (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0096">96</link>) and determination of average nucleotide identity (ANI) (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0096">96</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0098">98</link>). Both programs are available as web services, providing accessibility to a wider range of end users (<anchor id="ch0034s000000a0012"/><link linkend="ch0034s000000a0015">Table 2</link>). The proposed species boundaries for ANI and converted digital DDH values are 95% to 96%, which corresponds to the 70% DDH relatedness limit (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0096">96</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0098">98</link>). Thus, a combination of 16S rRNA gene similarity and OGRI can be used in a systematic process to identify and recognize a new species. In this two-step approach, the list of species required for comparison to the query strain with genome sequences is obtained by 16S rRNA-based searches; only species showing 98.7% or higher 16S rRNA gene similarity are selected for calculating OGRI (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0085">85</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0086">86</link>). ANI values are certainly important for delineation of closely related strains but of little use for the comparison of genomes of more distantly related taxa. For this, the average amino acid identity (AAI) is a better tool, but with the caveat that distantly related genomes have the disadvantage that the absolute and shared gene contents between a given pair of strains may differ tremendously (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0099">99</link>). In a recent study, Nicholson et al. proposed the delineation of species belonging to separate genera be based on AAI values of 74 to 76% (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0100">100</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0034s000000p0016">Whatever the means used to delineate a species, one strain is designated as the “nomenclatural type” or “type species,” which is maintained in pure culture; it is the reference specimen for the name, representing phenotypic and genotypic variation (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0101">101</link>). However, in practice, the type species is often the first strain isolated and characterized. Sneath calculated that 25 strains should be included in a species description to fully encapsulate the representative phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0102">102</link>). A subsequent complication has arisen, because the use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing has led to a tremendous increase in the description of novel taxa since the 1980s; many genera and species have been circumscribed based upon a single strain. Of course, a single strain cannot encompass the physiological, metabolic, and genotypic variations present within a species (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0103">103</link>). Many of these single-strain descriptions are from organisms originating from clinical and veterinary sources, where attempts to isolate additional strains have been unsuccessful. This difficulty in isolating more than one strain leads to an interesting dilemma: should authors publish descriptions of single strains or refrain from such practices until multiple strains can be recovered? One could argue that publication of a single strain, described by molecular methods, allows the discovery and collection of other strains randomly discovered at other institutions and thus furthers the accumulation of physiological and metabolic variations. The scientific community is being encouraged to close the enormous gap between the number of validly named taxa and “yet-to-be-named” organisms that still have eluded cultivation (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0057">57</link>). On examination of the literature, many single-strain taxa described in the 1980s and 1990s remain, with no additional strains having been recovered in the ensuing decades. Furthermore, over 80% of papers in issues of the <emphasis>International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</emphasis> (IJSEM) report new taxa based on a single strain. If these strains had not been reported and the names validly published, an immense amount of microbial diversity would now be missing from the literature, much of it of clinical importance (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0104">104</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0105">105</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0034s000000p0017">“Uncultivatable” and “unculturable” are commonly used terms for organisms that are not able to be grown and maintained in pure culture, but a more informative term is “not yet cultivated,” as all microorganisms are potentially “cultivatable” under appropriate conditions. The challenge is to address difficulties in finding appropriate nutrient concentrations and conditions to grow and isolate these fastidious organisms (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0106">106</link>). Staley and Konopka observed a discrepancy between the numbers counted under a microscope and viable counts in culture (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0107">107</link>).

        <para id="ch0034s000000p0020">Over the past three decades, molecular profiles based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing have shown that an overwhelming number of both<emphasis>Bacteria</emphasis> and <emphasis>Archaea</emphasis> remain to be cultivated and described, a shortfall that gives rise to the term “microbial dark matter” (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0113">113</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0116">116</link>). Evidence suggests that only 0.1 to 1% of taxa from environmental sources have been cultured in the laboratory (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0019">19</link>). Although in animal and human microbiomes the numbers are a little more encouraging, the ratio of cultivated to uncultivated organisms varies tremendously, depending on the methods used. Lagkouvardos and colleagues reviewed the literature and suggested that anywhere between 35 and 65% of human and mouse microbiota have been cultivated (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0032">32</link>). Raoult and colleagues have made efforts with respect to the cultivation of many novel organisms recovered from the human gastrointestinal tract, combining cultivation methods with rapid screening by MALDI-TOF MS, for which they have coined the term “culturomics” (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0117">117</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0120">120</link>). Generally, cultivation strategies have focused on three main concepts: (i) refinement of standard cultivation strategies (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0121">121</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0125">125</link>), (ii) simulated natural environments (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0126">126</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0130">130</link>), and (iii) cultivation of microbial communities (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0131">131</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0134">134</link>). Although the goal is to isolate organisms in pure culture, it is highly likely that for some (or many), the recovery to pure culture may not be possible because of intimate symbiotic, mutualistic, and syntrophic interactions (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0135">135</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0140">140</link>). Therefore, some cultivation studies may ultimately result in microbial consortia where individual organisms are impossible to separate, requiring genomic tools to identify and describe members of the consortium. This also raises the interesting questions of how these can be maintained, whether culture collections will accept them, and whether indeed the consortium can be maintained (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0141">141</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0144">144</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0034s000000p0021">Nomenclature is probably the most challenging component of taxonomy for many microbiologists for whom taxonomy is not the focus of interest. Because there are no formal or official classification systems or an explicit list of methods to be used for the characterization of strains, nomenclature is governed by what may seem like an overwhelming array of rules. These rules are governed by the<emphasis>International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria</emphasis> (<emphasis>The Bacteriological Code</emphasis>), a document approved by the <emphasis>International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology</emphasis> in 1990 (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0145">145</link>) and recently updated as the <emphasis>International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</emphasis> (<emphasis>The Prokaryotic Code</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0063">63</link>). Prior to 1980, a proposal of a new taxon could be published in any microbiological journal or book; this flexibility resulted in two major problems: (i) type strains were lost and unavailable to the scientific community for comparison with novel isolates, and (ii) the same organism was often described by different authors, and multiple descriptions led to the presence of synonyms (multiple scientific names that refer to the same taxon).</para>
        <para id="ch0034s000000p0022">To resolve these and other issues, in 1980 the<emphasis>Approved Lists of Bacterial Names</emphasis> was published on behalf of the Judicial Commission of the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (ICSB) (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0146">146</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0147">147</link>). This list included only those names that had standing in bacterial nomenclature, had been sufficiently described, and had a designated type strain. To put it simply, this validation process represents a form of official registration or indexing of all names published prior to January 1, 1980 and included in the <emphasis>Approved Lists of Bacterial Names</emphasis>; the named organisms are treated for all nomenclatural purposes as though they had been validly published for the first time on that date. Furthermore, from that date, all new names must be “validly” published in the IJSEM (<ulink url="http://ijs.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem">http://ijs.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem</ulink>). Names can be “effectively” published in other journals and then provided to the IJSEM for review prior to publication in the validation lists (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0148">148</link>). This process also requires that type strains of all validly named organisms be deposited in two publicly available culture collections (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0149">149</link>). These collections should be associated with the World Federation of Culture Collections (<ulink url="http://www.wfcc.info">www.wfcc.info</ulink>). Such collections are invaluable, preserving and distributing microbial strains to the microbiologist, whether they are academics, industrialists, or biotechnologists, for further study (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0150">150</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0152">152</link>). This process ensures that the number of validly published names of species, genera, families, and orders of prokaryotes is known at any time. The information is also available online at the LPSN, as mentioned above, which is an invaluable resource for the scientific community (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0153">153</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0155">155</link>). In the past, the International Code of Nomenclature for Prokaryotes (ICNP) covered the nomenclature of prokaryotes up to the rank of class only; for historical reasons, the rank of phylum was not included. However, recent changes to the ICNP allowed the rank of phylum to be included (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0156">156</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0034s000000p0023">For a comprehensive review on bacterial nomenclature, the reader is encouraged to read the article by P. Sneath (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0101">101</link>). An integral component of nomenclature is the actual naming of organisms, which is based on the binomial system (genus and species) established by the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0157">157</link>). Etymology (the origin and historical development of a word) is an element of nomenclature that explains existing names and allows the formation of new names. Prokaryotes are designated by Latin or Greek names, in italics, with the genus name capitalized and the species written in lowercase, e.g., <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>. Describing the etymology of prokaryotic names is beyond the scope of this chapter. The reader is directed to several excellent references that give practical information on how to name organisms (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0158">158</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0160">160</link>). Furthermore, the sheer number of novel organisms requiring new names is making nomenclature ever more challenging; however, in an article entitled “The next million names for <emphasis>Archaea</emphasis> and <emphasis>Bacteria</emphasis>,” Pallen et al. report the development of an ingenious solution by creating software and documenting a list of over a million names (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0161">161</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0034s000000p0024">As mentioned above, most microbial life is yet to be recovered in pure culture and formally described. Whenever isolation in pure culture is possible, characteristics such as morphology, Gram reaction, habitat or source, and physiology (anaerobic or aerobic, electron acceptor or donor, growth temperature, etc.) should be determined in addition to sequence information. Currently, for unculturable strains, for which only sequence information is available (16S rRNA gene sequences to complete genomes), the physiological characteristics required for description according to the ICNP are lacking, although metagenomics information can be mined for genes that may infer physiological, metabolic, or functional properties of the organism. Such features can be included so that in the future, when the organism in question can finally be cultivated, it may be named in the usual manner according to the ICNP.</para>

        <para id="ch0034s000000p0025">When culture-independent methods using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed the enormous diversity of novel taxa, including many deep phylogenetic lineages, the rank of “<emphasis>Candidatus</emphasis>” was proposed (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0162">162</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0163">163</link>) as a provisional status for putative taxa that could not be described and named using the normal rules and requirements of the ICNP (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0063">63</link>). Put simply “<emphasis>Candidatus</emphasis>” refers to those organisms that have been characterized via their genome sequence but have not yet been cultured in the laboratory. Furthermore, the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP) does not currently include the nomenclature of these “<emphasis>Candidatus</emphasis>” taxa, and so the names assigned by authors cannot be validly published and thus do not have any standing in the literature. The term “<emphasis>Candidatus</emphasis>” is used at the ranks of family, order, and class; names can be registered in the IJSEM but it is apparent that the derivation of many of these names is problematic and in need of correction (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0164">164</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0165">165</link>). Konstantinidis et al. proposed standards for a new genome-based taxonomy to address the issues with yet-to-be-cultivated organisms (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0166">166</link>). In response, Oren and Garrity strongly advised against a separate taxonomy, which could lead to confusion (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0167">167</link>). Recently, Whitman, an advocate of the use of genome sequences in taxonomy, made proposals to expand the type material including gene sequences for naming of prokaryotes (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0168">168</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0169">169</link>). The outcome would be to unite the nomenclature of the cultivated and yet-to-be-cultivated prokaryotes into a single system and allow <emphasis>Candidatus</emphasis> names published before January 1, 2020 to be granted priority (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0170">170</link>). However, these proposals were rejected by the ICSP (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0171">171</link>), and thus, these issues remain to be resolved.</para>

        <para id="ch0034s000000p0026">Classification is a prerequisite of identification, as classification determines if an isolate belongs to an established taxon or is a member of a previously unidentified species; in this case, it is named and described according to the rules of nomenclature governed by the ICNP (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0049">49</link>). The characterization of a strain is a key element in prokaryote systematics. Various new methods have been developed and incorporated to complement those considered “traditional” to allow a strain or strains to be characterized as comprehensively as possible. The sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and whole genomes and outsourcing to commercial “sequencing centers” expanded these methods beyond a limited number of specialized laboratories to academic, clinical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical facilities. To nonprofessional taxonomists, once a strain has been identified (normally via 16S rRNA gene sequencing), the process of characterizing and describing the organism and then ensuring that it is correctly named and validly published can be overwhelming. The literature is littered with novel organisms that have been “effectively published” but not “validly published,” the result of names either not being submitted to IJSEM for this process to be completed or being rejected due to technical deficiencies in the publication itself, such as the failure to submit the strain to two different culture collections. Fortunately, there are now several excellent publications by leading taxonomists that cover the choice of tests used in the characterization process, naming, and publication of novel organisms (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0126">126</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0133">133</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0136">136</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0034s000000p0027">However, it is pertinent to note that on examination of recent literature, a growing trend appears to incorporate genomic data without providing sufficient phenotypic information derived from cultivation studies. This approach advances the rapid description of novel taxa but may be detrimental to a better understanding of microbe-microbe and microbe-host interaction, as it is the expressed features (the phenotype) of organisms that drive the structure and stability of ecosystems (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0172">172</link>). For example, investigations of respiratory microbiota in pneumonia have shown that anywhere from 9.62 to 55.5% of taxa remain to be described (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0173">173</link>).

      <para id="ch0034s000000p0028">Although there is a healthy debate on exactly how much information is required to describe a new taxon (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0012">12</link>), polyphasic taxonomy is currently the method of choice for most authors; however, as stated above, there is a growing reliance on genomic data with minimum phenotypic data (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0172">172</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0176">176</link>). Colwell first coined the term “polyphasic taxonomy” to describe a taxonomy that incorporates as much information as possible, including everything from phenotypic to genotypic information (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0079">79</link>). Vandamme and colleagues further refined polyphasic taxonomy to include all available methods leading to phylogenetic classifications (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0177">177</link>). Genotypic information is derived from nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), whereas phenotypic information is derived from proteins and their functions, chemotaxonomic markers, and a wide range of other expressed features. In the modern era, microbiologists can rapidly determine the 16S rRNA gene sequence of an isolate, and subsequent database searches reveal the isolate’s nearest phylogenetic relatives. The literature is then examined for related organisms to choose the most appropriate tests required for a comprehensive characterization and to assign the isolate to an existing species or, if novel, to describe a new species or genus (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0176">176</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0178">178</link>).

        <para id="ch0034s000000p0029">Historically, phenotypic analyses such as morphology, physiology, and biochemistry were central to the identification of microorganisms. However, highly standardized procedures are required to obtain reproducible results, especially if these results are to be compatible with data generated from different laboratories (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0013">13</link>). The early development of computers allowed many phenotypic tests and strains to be compared; these computer-generated profiles detailed the degree of similarity between strains (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0180">180</link>). This approach, known as numerical taxonomy, used the number of common characteristics that were considered a qualitative measure of taxonomic relatedness; the popularity of this method was at its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. However, this approach was compromised by the lack of standard methods, especially when data used were taken from the literature rather than determined in parallel with the reference strains. Unlike 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which can be applied universally across all taxa, the paucity and variability of phenotypic characteristics, or problems identifying differential phenotypic characteristics for certain bacterial groups, regularly caused problems in comparative studies describing or differentiating taxa. The deficiencies of numerical taxonomy were highlighted by the rise and application of molecular methods, which are not encumbered by the need for rigorously standardized growth requirements (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0180">180</link>).</para>

To some extent, the introduction of commercial miniaturized biochemical kits, such as API systems and Biolog, has enhanced the speed of identification (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0043">43</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0182">182</link>).

Chemotaxonomic markers are essentially part of the phenotype but are generally discussed separately. These have been widely applied, although a single method is not normally useful for a distinct group of organisms. These markers include whole-cell proteins, isoprenoid quinones, cytochromes, peptidoglycans, polyamines, polar lipids, pigments, particular enzymes, sterols, and hopanoids (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0051">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0186">186</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0187">187</link>). These properties have been extensively used, reflect phylogenetic relationships, and are recommended for polyphasic investigations (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0178">178</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0188">188</link>). It is pertinent to note that these chemical constituents can be identical in different organisms; therefore, it is prudent to rely on chemotaxonomic differences to exclude an organism from a taxon rather than to use a similarity as the sole criterion for inclusion. Cellular fatty acids (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0188">188</link>), peptidoglycan types (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0189">189</link>), polar lipids (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0190">190</link>), and respiratory quinones (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0053">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0191">191</link>) are discussed in more detail below. Although these traits have long been recommended for the descriptions of novel taxa, with the increasing use of sequences for identification and to determine phylogenetic relationships, this information is often not reported (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0051">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0178">178</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0034s000000p0032">Of all the chemotaxonomic traits, the determination of cellular fatty acid profiles is one method that competes well compared to the high-throughput capabilities encountered with molecular methods. Few descriptions of novel taxa fail to include information on fatty acid profiles. Crucial to the wide availability of this method was the introduction of the commercial microbial identification system MIDI (Microbial ID Inc., Newark, DE). The procedures for extraction, chromatographic separation, and data analysis are relatively simple and highly automated, allowing comparison and clustering of large numbers of strains. However, the end user should be aware of two issues: (i) for the data obtained to be truly comparative, it is important that strains be grown under highly standardized conditions, and (ii) the resolution of discrimination between different taxa requires careful examination. These profiles are extremely powerful tools for differentiation between taxa, but caution is necessary, as very similar fatty acid profiles may be obtained for some groups, which makes them less useful as a taxonomic tool; hence the need for the polyphasic approach incorporating multiple methods.</para>
      <para id="ch0034s000000p0033">Cellular fatty acids and their application to taxonomy have been reviewed extensively (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0188">188</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0192">192</link>); therefore, an in-depth discussion is not presented here, but some useful information is outlined. Fatty acids are mainly located in the cytoplasmic membrane as constituents of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides of the outer membrane of Gram-stain-negative organisms and as lipoteichoic acid in Gram-stain-positive organisms. Bacteria have an enormous variety of fatty acids (more than 300 identified to date); the most encountered products include straight-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, iso- and anteiso-branched fatty acids, internally branched fatty acids, hydroxy fatty acids, cyclopropane fatty acids, ω-cyclic fatty acids, and dicarboxylic fatty acids. General trends have been identified: some fatty acids are common across large groups of bacteria, such as those of the <emphasis>Alpha</emphasis>-, <emphasis>Beta</emphasis>-, and <emphasis>Gammaproteobacteria</emphasis>. For example, the <emphasis>Alphaproteobacteria</emphasis> subclass has a common C<subscript>18:1</subscript> (octadecenoic acid), whereas members of the <emphasis>Flavobacterium-Cytophaga-Bacteroides</emphasis> contain high levels of different branched fatty acids of the iso- and/or anteiso-types (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0193">193</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0034s000000p0034">Important differences between<emphasis>Bacteria</emphasis> and <emphasis>Archaea</emphasis> have been identified. In bacterial membranes, the fatty acids of phospholipids are linked by ester bonds to glycerol and form a phospholipid bilayer, whereas archaeal membranes have phospholipids containing two polar heads linked by isoprenoid chains and ether linkages to glycerol, termed fatty ether lipids (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0194">194</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0196">196</link>).

      <para id="ch0034s000000p0035">The determination of the Gram reaction is one of the characteristics first determined to guide subsequent characterization and identification steps. However, this simple test understates the quite different ultrastructural distinction between Gram-stain-negative and Gram-stain-positive types. Gram-stain-negative cells have a thinner, distinctly layered cell wall with an outer membrane mainly composed of lipopolysaccharide, phospholipid, protein, lipoprotein, and relatively little peptidoglycan (usually less than 10% of the total cell wall). In contrast, Gram-stain-positive cells contain peptidoglycan (usually more than 30% of the total cell wall), polysaccharides or teichoic acid (or both), or teichuronic acid as major components. Peptidoglycan (murein) is a heteropolymer consisting of glycan strands composed of alternating units of<emphasis>N</emphasis>-acetylglucosamine and <emphasis>N</emphasis>-acetylmuramic acid linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds that are cross-linked through short peptides. Peptidoglycan types have been used extensively in taxonomy, primarily with Gram-positive taxa, because the peptidoglycan type of cell wall in Gram-stain-negative bacteria is rather uniform and provides little taxonomically useful information. In contrast, peptidoglycan types of Gram-stain-positive bacteria may be genus or species specific (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0189">189</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0198">198</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0199">199</link>). The most valuable peptidoglycan information is derived from the type and composition of the peptide cross-link between adjacent chains in the polymer network. Peptidoglycans are divided into two main types, A and B, based on the way that they cross-link. It is pertinent that the B type is rarely found, only in some members of the phylum <emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis> (e.g., <emphasis>Erysipelotrichaceae</emphasis>) and in some members of the phylum <emphasis>Actinobacteria</emphasis> (e.g., <emphasis>Microbacteriaceae</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0189">189</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0198">198</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0200">200</link>). In type A, the cross-linkage is accomplished by linking the ω-amino group of the diamino acid at position 3 to the carboxylic group of <phrase role="small">D</phrase>-alanine at position 4 of the adjacent peptide subunit, either directly or by means of an interpeptide bridge consisting of 1 to 7 amino acid residues. With B-type cell walls, the α-carboxylic group of <phrase role="small">D</phrase>-glutamic acid or threo-3-hydroxyglutamic acid at position 2 is involved in the cross-linkage. The most taxonomically important information is gained from the type and composition of the peptide cross-links; over 100 structural types are recognized (<ulink url="http://www.peptidoglycan-types.info">www.peptidoglycan-types.info</ulink>). The simplest analysis is the determination of the characteristic diamino acid located at position 3 of the peptide stem, indicating <emphasis>meso</emphasis>- and/or <phrase role="small">L,L</phrase>-diaminopimelic acid, <phrase role="small">L</phrase>-ornithine, <phrase role="small">L</phrase>-lysine, and <phrase role="small">L</phrase>-diaminobutyric acid.

Sequence information has also been generated for the16S-23S rRNA gene spacer region and suggests that considerable variation can occur between species in both the nucleotide length and sequence differences of this region, which can be exploited for typing and identification (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0250">250</link>). Other genotypic methods include pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) based on digestion of genomic DNA with rare-cutting restriction enzymes. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) build this up, whereas PCR is used to amplify subsets of fragments. Yet another set of methods is based on sequencing repetitive DNA regions dispersed through the genomes of microorganisms. These methods, reviewed by Rademaker and Savelkoul (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0248">248</link>), include sequencing the following regions: the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC), repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP), and a series of highly conserved repetitive DNA sequences referred to as the BOX elements of <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis>. Although these methods have proven to be very useful, difficulty in the analysis can arise from interpretation of the large numbers of fragments that are generated and/or when some of the fragments are in similar size ranges.</para>

        <para id="ch0034s000000p0046">Access to genome sequences led to the identification of other molecular markers. One of these markers, termed conserved signature indels (CSIs), has been pioneered and applied to a wide range of phylogenetic lineages by Gupta and colleagues (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0251">251</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0255">255</link>). CSIs are defined as regions in the sequence alignments of proteins where a specific change is observed in the primary structure in all members of one or more taxa, but not in other taxa. The changes in the gene or protein sequences can be the presence of either specific amino acid substitutions or specific deletions or insertions. Numerous CSIs have been identified for members of many different bacterial taxa and are able to resolve deeper-branching evolutionary relationships than those based on single genes or proteins. Different taxonomic ranks can now be clearly delineated in clear molecular terms, based upon multiple uniquely shared characteristics. Inferences based upon these CSIs are in excellent agreement with those based on phylogenetic approaches but with the advantage of evolutionary branching points being more clearly revealed. CSIs have been applied in the demarcation of phyla, orders, families, genera, and even species.</para>

      <para id="ch0034s000000p0047">Just as 16S rRNA gene sequencing revolutionized classification and identification schemes, MALDI-TOF MS has done the same. For a more complete review of this method, the reader is directed to<ulink url="ch0021#ch0021s0001">chapter 6</ulink> in this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="ch0034s000000p0048">MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool used in the identification and classification of<emphasis>Bacteria</emphasis> and <emphasis>Archaea</emphasis>, discriminating at the species, subspecies, and even strain levels (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0256">256</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0257">257</link>), and is now routinely used in the clinical laboratory (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0258">258</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0259">259</link>). The method depends on the associated data analysis tools for interpretation of data produced. An important component is the databases accompanying commercial software packages that allow cluster analysis with dendrograms by using characteristic spectral fingerprints. While most pathogens are well represented in these databases, some organisms are not; this is especially true for nonclinical and environmental strains. For some specialist groups, this can be overcome with the end user constructing local databases populated with spectra of reference species of the taxonomic groups of interest. The challenge is to make these private databases available to the wider scientific community.</para>
      <para id="ch0034s000000p0049">Because the targets of MALDI-TOF MS are mainly conserved ribosomal proteins, it has been proposed that this method may be able to infer phylogenetic relationships. With the incredible rise in the use of this method, the discriminatory resolution of the method is becoming clearer and a powerful tool for use in taxonomy (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0260">260</link>). While not appropriate for defining the relationships of more remotely related genera and higher taxonomic ranks, it provides valuable information on intragenic relationships that compares well with 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Furthermore, it appears to be successful in the differentiation of subspecies that are genetically different; however, the limitation appears to be at the strain level of identification. With more rigorous standardization of media and cultivation conditions coupled with advances in bioinformatics to overcome the subtle differences in spectra, the limitations with resolution may be overcome. The identification by MALDI-TOF MS is carried out in minutes rather than hours or days, as encountered with other methods. With the huge reduction in costs, it is unnecessary to purchase multiple medium formulations, selective media, and commercially available identification kits; these benefits make identification by MALDI-TOF MS attractive to laboratory managers. Many laboratories have switched almost exclusively to this diagnostic tool.</para>

However, the potential of these methods could not have been realized without improvements in computer hardware and software. Bioinformatics is the interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0227">227</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0229">229</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0261">261</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0263">263</link>). The leading journal in this field, <emphasis>Bioinformatics</emphasis>, focuses on new developments in genome bioinformatics and computation (<ulink url="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics">https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics</ulink>). Such approaches are now essential for the analysis, interpretation, and transition of remarkable amounts of raw data into meaningful information that can then be disseminated to and used by the scientific community (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0262">262</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0264">264</link>). Indeed, with the increasing numbers of large sequencing projects involved in microbiome studies, a challenge is to understand this “big data” and translate it into information of practical use in the development of therapeutic applications (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0265">265</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0266">266</link>). Databases are essential to store, maintain, and archive information; they also serve as repositories and global online resources for dissemination to the scientific community and are available at the click of a mouse (<link linkend="ch0034s000000a0015">Table 2</link>). The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health in the United States (<ulink url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ulink>) and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory–European Bioinformatics Institute (<ulink url="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/</ulink>) are two of the most used resources. The latter was established in 1980 as the world’s first nucleotide sequence database, and the NCBI was established in 1988. Other excellent resources at the forefront of molecular investigations are <emphasis>Nucleic Acids Research</emphasis> (<ulink url="https://academic.oup.com/nar">https://academic.oup.com/nar</ulink>) and its online database (<ulink url="https://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/nar/database/a/">https://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/nar/database/a/</ulink>), which provides links to an enormous number of biological databases (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0267">267</link>). A selection of the most useful databases and resources is provided in <link linkend="ch0034s000000a0015">Table 2</link>.

        <para id="ch0034s000000p0051">We are truly in a time of innovation, with the development of extremely powerful methodological and analytical tools. Genome-based systematics and other analytical tools will undoubtedly revolutionize microbial systematics. While in principle the entire phenotype is encoded in the genome, even with the tremendous advances in bioinformatics and computational tools, to date, a complete understanding of the phenotype based solely on genome sequence is not yet possible (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0172">172</link>). For example, it has been debated if values for temperature, pH, and salt tolerance profiles could ever be derived from the genome sequence alone. In addition to a huge number of commercial enterprises now offering all manner of sequencing services, many universities and clinical laboratories have their own core facilities contributing to the enormous amount of genomic data. MALDI-TOF MS, when combined with DNA sequencing, will continue to have a tremendous effect on the clinical laboratory. An important requirement will be the maintenance of searchable databases with constant updates as novel taxa are described. This is of utmost importance as modern approaches to taxonomy are brought to bear on the human microbiome and personalized medicine (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0269">269</link>–<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0271">271</link>). These investigations lead to both the identification of novel taxa and the reassignment of many misclassified organisms; members of the health care community must keep abreast of the assignment of clinically relevant organisms. Finally, as stated above, many methodologies once thought to be state-of-the-art tools making invaluable contributions have now become obsolete; a case in point is the 454 sequencing platform (<link linkend="ch0034s000000li0272">272</link>, <link linkend="ch0034s000000li0273">273</link>). On the flip side, periodically a quantum leap in technology occurs (e.g., DNA sequencing, PCR) that can be embraced by taxonomists, and it is certain that methods will continue to evolve and produce ever more rapid identification that filters into classification schemes.</para>
