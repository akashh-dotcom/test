The reassignment of the genera <emphasis>Moraxella, Acinetobacter</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Psychrobacter</emphasis> to the <emphasis>Gammaproteobacteria</emphasis> was first proposed as a result of DNA-rRNA and DNA-DNA hybridization techniques and later confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0002">2</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0052s0000p0002">Most members of the genus<emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> are cocci with a diameter up to 2 μm, presenting as single bacteria or in pairs. The species <emphasis>Neisseria elongata, N. weaveri, N. bacilliformis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>N. shayeganii</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0003">3</link>) are notable exceptions that consist of short rods, frequently arranged as diplobacilli or in chains. While <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> species are Gram negative, a tendency to withstand decolorization is occasionally noted. Capsules (<emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis>) and pili (<emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis>) may be present, yet flagella are not formed. <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> is the only species that expresses a polysaccharide capsule, of which 12 serogroups are distinguishable (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0004">4</link>). Strains of several species, such as <emphasis>N. flavescens, N. sicca</emphasis>, and <emphasis>N. subflava,</emphasis> may produce a yellowish pigment. <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> species grow optimally under aerobic conditions at a temperature of 35 to 37°C. Nevertheless, isolation of <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> from body sites with reduced oxygen tensions may occur due to nitrite respiration (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0005">5</link>). Microaerobic growth by denitrification of nitrite via nitric oxide has also been shown for <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0006">6</link>). While many species are not nutritionally demanding, the pathogenic species <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> are fastidious, showing particular susceptibility to unfavorable environmental factors such as extreme temperatures, desiccation, and alkaline or acidic conditions. All species are oxidase positive and, with the exception of <emphasis>N. elongata</emphasis> subsp. <emphasis>nitroreducens</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0007">7</link>) and some <emphasis>N. bacilliformis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0008">8</link>) strains, catalase positive. <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> species produce acid from carbohydrates by oxidation, not fermentation. Some species, such as <emphasis>N. elongata</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. cinerea</emphasis>, are asaccharolytic. Most members of the genus can reduce nitrite. Natural habitats of the members of this genus are the mucous membranes of animals and humans. The species <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> are exclusively human pathogens. Exotoxins are typically not produced (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0001">1</link>). All species in the genus <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> are naturally competent for DNA uptake and display a high frequency of horizontal gene transfer (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0009">9</link>). As a consequence, phylogenetic analyses within this genus based on different genes may yield incongruent results (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0010">10</link>). Of note, this limitation has to be considered in taxonomic analyses based solely on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which has been used in the past to define inter- and intrageneric relationships within the <emphasis>Neisseriaceae</emphasis> and <emphasis>Moraxellaceae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0002">2</link>). To adjust for substantial horizontal DNA exchange, multilocus, instead of single-locus, approaches have been suggested for the resolution of species within <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0011">11</link>). Insights from whole-genome sequencing are beginning to result in questions about species assignments of some members of the genus; e.g., the newly described species <emphasis>N. oralis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0012">12</link>) was shown to be identical to <emphasis>N. mucosa</emphasis> var. heidelbergensis; <emphasis>N. sicca</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. macacae</emphasis> were suggested to be variants of <emphasis>N. mucosa</emphasis>; and <emphasis>N. flavescens</emphasis> was found to be so close to <emphasis>N. subflava</emphasis> as to warrant fusion into a single species (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0013">13</link>). Based on the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature (<ulink url="http://www.bacterio.net/neisseria.html">http://www.bacterio.net/neisseria.html</ulink>) at the time of writing, the genus <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> consists of 29 species with three subspecies of <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> <emphasis>elongata</emphasis>.</para>

        <para id="ch0052s0000p0003"><emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> causes gonorrhea, the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0014">14</link>). <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> is always considered pathogenic, and humans are the only hosts of this bacterium. It is mainly transmitted through sexual practices and infects mucosal surfaces of the urethra, cervix, rectum, pharynx, and eye. The risk of infection is greatly influenced by sexual behavior but can be reduced by the use of condoms (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0015">15</link>). Furthermore, the eye can be infected during passage of the fetus through the birth canal. The rate of gonorrhea decreased by 74% from 1975 to 1997 in the United States following implementation of the gonorrhea control program in the mid-1970s; it further decreased to the lowest recorded figure of 98.1/100,000 population in 2009, yet increased again to 188.4/100,000 in 2019 (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0016">16</link>). Due to underreporting, true rates were estimated for 2018 (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0017">17</link>). Thereby, the total estimated number of incident gonococcal infections in persons aged 15 to 39 was 1.57 million, for a rate of 1,425 infections per 100,000 population in the United States (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0016">16</link>). Reported rates vary considerably between states. In 2019, reported cases per 100,000 population ranged from 27.9 in Vermont to 623.8 in the District of Columbia. Since 2013, rates have been lower in women than in men; in 2019, rates in women and men were 152.6/100,000 and 224.4/100,000, respectively. Age groups with the highest burden of disease were young adults between 20 and 24 years (742.0/100,000) in 2019; also, gonorrhea rates were highest among African Americans (581.0/100,000) and lowest among Asians (38.2/100,000).</para>

        <para id="ch0052s0000p0004">With 26.4 reported cases per 100,000 population, disease burden in European Union/European Economic Area member states is just a fraction of that of the United States as of 2018 (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0018">18</link>). Nevertheless, a 22% increase was noted between 2017 and 2018. The highest rates, 93, 50, 38, and 31 per 100,000, were observed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, and Norway, respectively. In 26 European countries for which information on age was available for 2018, adults aged 25 to 34 years constituted the largest proportion (37%) of reported cases, followed by the age group of 15 to 24 years (34%). The male-to-female ratio (3.2) was considerably more pronounced than in the United States, with 70% of male cases categorized as men who have sex with men (MSM) in 17 European countries with records of the mode of transmission. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a decline in registered gonorrhea cases, largely due to reduced testing (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0019">19</link>). The extent to which sexual behavior was impacted by social distancing during the pandemic remains the subject of ongoing research.</para>
        <para id="ch0052s0000p0005"><emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> also occurs exclusively in humans and plays a dual role as a commensal and potentially invasive pathogen. On average, the mucosal surfaces of the oropharynx and nasopharynx of 10% of the population are colonized by this bacterium (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0020">20</link>). Carriage is strongly age dependent; it is estimated to peak at 19 years, at which point approximately one in four individuals is colonized according to a large meta-analysis based on studies conducted in Europe (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0021">21</link>). Because of repeated episodes of carriage, the percentage of sera with bactericidal activity against pathogenic strains, and thus immunity to disease, increases with age. Transmission occurs through large-droplet secretions from the oropharynx and is favored by repeated or close contact. Outbreaks and clusters are rare in developed countries (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0022">22</link>) and may occur after mass gatherings (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0023">23</link>), notably during the Islamic Hajj and Umrah gatherings (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0024">24</link>). They probably occur more commonly in low-income countries, but estimates of their frequency are precluded by lack of surveillance data (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0025">25</link>). Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) occurs in only a minute proportion of individuals acquiring <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> and follows a typical age distribution, with infants and adolescents having the highest incidences in developed countries. A recent study calculated a high risk of recurrent infection among patients who have suffered an IMD episode (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0026">26</link>), and the authors speculate that undetected complement deficiency may be the underlying cause. In fact, apart from genetic host polymorphisms (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0027">27</link>), individuals with underlying conditions such as complement deficiencies, including those following administration of eculizumab, and asplenia are at increased risk (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0052s0000li0029">29</link>). Behavioral risk factors including exposure to smokers (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0028">28</link>) and kissing (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0030">30</link>) have also been described to contribute to acquisition of disease, and increased risk among MSM has caused growing concern (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0031">31</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0052s0000p0006">IMD is rare in developed countries. In the United States, rates have plummeted from over 1 per 100,000 before 2000 to 0.11/100,000 in 2019 (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0032">32</link>), with serogroups B, C, and Y accounting for at least 67% of all cases. The overall incidence rate in European countries was slightly higher at 0.6/100,000 in 2017; the highest notification rates were observed in Lithuania, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom at 2.4, 1.5, 1.2, and 1.2/100,000, respectively (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0033">33</link>). In contrast, African countries in the so-called meningitis belt have traditionally reported epidemic waves, mainly caused by serogroup A, with rates soaring to over 300/100,000 (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0034">34</link>). However, a dramatic epidemiological change was observed in this region after the introduction of meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine 2010; for example, the incidence of meningococcal meningitis dropped to a range of 0.06 to 7.71/100,000 in 2010 to 2018 in Niger. Serogroup A was not found after 2011, and the most common serogroups causing meningitis were serogroups C, W, and X (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0035">35</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0052s0000p0007">During the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in many countries in 2020, the epidemiology of IMD has undergone remarkable changes. IMD case numbers dropped globally in 2020 compared to previous years. Incidences per 100,000 population calculated for Spain and Brazil decreased from 0.86 and 0.49 in 2019 to 0.56 and 0.17 in 2020, respectively (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0036">36</link>). Analysis of the surveillance data from 26 countries showed that COVID-19 containment measures likely reduced transmission of <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> and other bacteria transmitted by airborne droplets (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0037">37</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0052s0000p0008">Several vaccines have been developed for the prevention of IMD. In 2007, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the United States recommended vaccination of all adolescents (preferably 11 to 12 years of age) with a quadrivalent polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine covering serogroups A, C, W, and Y (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0038">38</link>), adding a booster dose at age 16 years in 2010 (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0039">39</link>). Due to high rates of serogroup C disease in the 1990s and early 2000s, several European countries implemented vaccination campaigns with conjugate vaccine against serogroup C, which led to a dramatic reduction of disease caused by this capsule type (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0040">40</link>). Poor immunogenicity of the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide, consisting of (2→8)-α-Neu5Ac (polysialic acid composed of <emphasis>N</emphasis>-acetylneuraminic acid subunits), and concerns about induction of autoimmunity due to the presence of (2→8)-α-Neu5Ac on normal tissues have precluded the development of glycoconjugate vaccines against serogroup B. Thus, two recombinant protein-based serogroup B meningococcal vaccines have been developed and licensed: MenB-FHbp (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0041">41</link>) and 4CMenB (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0042">42</link>), produced by Pfizer (Trumenba) and GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Bexsero), respectively. Bexsero has been introduced into the infant vaccination program in England (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0043">43</link>). Interestingly, the outer membrane vesicle component of the latter vaccine has been reported to also partially protect against gonorrhea (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0044">44</link>–<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0046">46</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0052s0000p0009">Members of the genus<emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> have a high affinity for mucosal membranes. A wide variety of species can be isolated from humans, including <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae, N. cinerea, N. elongata, N. flavescens, N. lactamica, N. meningitidis, N. mucosa, N. polysaccharea, N. sicca</emphasis>, and <emphasis>N. subflava.</emphasis> Several species are predominantly recovered from animals, such as <emphasis>N. animalis, N. animaloris, N. zoodegmatis, N. weaveri</emphasis> (throat of cats and dogs) (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0052s0000li0048">48</link>), <emphasis>N. denitrificans</emphasis> (throat of guinea pigs), <emphasis>N. dentiae</emphasis> (dental plaques of domestic cows), <emphasis>N. macacae</emphasis> (oropharyngeal cavity of rhesus monkeys), and <emphasis>N. dumasiana</emphasis> (oral microbiota of dogs) (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0049">49</link>). Similar to <emphasis>N. elongata</emphasis>, the newly discovered species <emphasis>N. bacilliformis</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. oralis</emphasis> colonize the oral cavity (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0052s0000li0012">12</link>). A recent study found evidence for site tropism (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0050">50</link>). While <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> was predominantly found in the throat, <emphasis>N. flavescens</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. subflava</emphasis> colonized the dorsum of the tongue; in contrast, <emphasis>N. sicca, N. mucosa</emphasis>, and <emphasis>N. elongata</emphasis> were shown to populate gingival plaque. Most human <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> species are considered normal inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract and cause disease in an opportunistic fashion. <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> are, however, exceptions because they can cause disease in previously healthy individuals. Furthermore, species of animal origin (e.g., <emphasis>N. animaloris</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. zoodegmatis</emphasis>) can cause wound infections in humans after animal bites (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0051">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0052s0000li0052">52</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0052s0000p0010">Uncomplicated infection by<emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> (gonorrhea) manifests most commonly as acute urethritis in men. The major symptom is urethral discharge, sometimes associated with dysuria, typically without frequency or urgency. Coinfection of the preputial (Tyson), urethral (Littré), and bulbourethral (Cowper) glands is possible. In addition, asymptomatic infections occur in up to 10% of individuals. Most cases of untreated urethritis resolve spontaneously after several weeks. Further localized complications after gonococcal urethritis include acute epididymitis, penile edema, and abscesses of the above-mentioned glands.</para>
        <para id="ch0052s0000p0011">In women, the endocervix is the primary site of genital infection. Additionally,<emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> may infect the urethra, the rectum, the periurethral (Skene) glands, and the ducts of the greater vestibular (Bartholin) glands. The squamous epithelium of the vagina is typically not infected in sexually mature women. In contrast to infection in men, asymptomatic infection in women is common (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0053">53</link>). Also, if symptoms appear, they often cannot clearly be attributed to infection by <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> because concurrent infection by <emphasis>Chlamydia trachomatis</emphasis> and/or <emphasis>Mycoplasma genitalium</emphasis> is common. The main symptoms include increased vaginal discharge, dysuria, and intermenstrual bleeding. Ascension of the infection may result in pelvic inflammatory disease, which manifests as various combinations of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and peritonitis. Acute perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome) can develop following direct extension of <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> from the fallopian tube to the liver capsule and the surrounding peritoneum. While over 80% of rectal infections remain asymptomatic, some patients have symptoms of acute proctitis.</para>
        <para id="ch0052s0000p0012">Pharyngeal infection is acquired by oral sexual exposure and is mostly asymptomatic, occasionally causing overt pharyngitis or tonsillitis (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0054">54</link>). While probably less transmissible than rectal or urethral gonorrhea, its silent nature and considerable prevalence among MSM render pharyngeal infection a common reservoir for gonorrhea in sexually active MSM.</para>
        <para id="ch0052s0000p0013">Gonococcal conjunctivitis in adults usually results from autoinoculation or oculogenital or orogenital exposure. If not treated promptly, corneal ulceration may rapidly develop. Conjunctivitis of the newborn (ophthalmia neonatorum) is transmitted during birth and is favored by premature rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery. Historically a common cause of blindness, it is prevented by administering an antibiotic ointment (usually containing erythromycin) or povidone-iodine into the conjunctivae after delivery (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0055">55</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0052s0000p0014">Disseminated gonococcal infection reflects bacteremic dissemination, generation of immune complexes, and indirect immunological mechanisms. Disseminated gonococcal infection complicates less than 1% of mucosal infections (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0056">56</link>) and usually manifests as septic arthritis and a characteristic syndrome of polyarthritis and dermatitis. It should be suspected in patients presenting with tenosynovitis, arthritis, and/or vasculitic skin lesions (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0057">57</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0052s0000p0015">IMD commonly presents as meningitis, acute sepsis, or a combination of the two. In addition, unusual presentations include transient mild bacteremia, chronic meningococcal sepsis, pneumonia (mainly by serogroup Y), septic arthritis, and endocarditis (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0058">58</link>). Symptoms of meningitis vary and can include a stiff neck, headache, confusion, and photophobia. Unusual early clinical presentations may include abdominal symptoms, such as gastroenteritis, diarrhea, peritonitis (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0058">58</link>). The case fatality rate of IMD ranges from 4 to 20% and varies according to age and serogroup (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0059">59</link>). Sequelae such as sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delay, and speech defects afflict a substantial proportion of survivors yet in a lower proportion than in other forms of acute bacterial meningitis (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0060">60</link>). Petechial lesions can coalesce and become ecchymotic. Nevertheless, nonpurpuric maculopapular rashes, readily confused with viral exanthems, have also been associated with meningococcemia. Petechiae are a telltale sign of meningococcal sepsis, which can manifest in its most severe form as Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome with widespread purpura and adrenocortical insufficiency. Meningococcal septic shock can take a fulminant course, with a lethality of 30% (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0061">61</link>) and plasma concentrations of up to 10<superscript>8</superscript> meningococci/ml (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0062">62</link>), which in turn lead to massive activation of cytokines and vasoactive anaphylatoxins. Meningococcal shock syndrome is characterized by myocardial depression, vasoplegia, capillary leakage, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0061">61</link>). Complications of IMD include arthritis, pericarditis, cranial nerve dysfunction, meningococcal pericarditis, and, rarely, cerebral or spinal infarction. In addition, adolescent survivors of IMD have been described as suffering from a series of long-term consequences, including poor physical and mental health, quality of life, and educational achievement (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0063">63</link>). Bacteremia can also manifest without signs of sepsis in the form of chronic meningococcemia, a condition associated with low-grade relapsing fever, arthritis, and rash (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0064">64</link>). Very rarely occurring meningococcal pneumonias are caused by serogroup Y and affect adults disproportionately (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0065">65</link>), especially in those &gt;70 years of age (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0058">58</link>). Preceding viral illness, notably pandemic influenza (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0066">66</link>), has been reported to promote its development. <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> is an uncommon cause of acute bacterial conjunctivitis and can also be the etiologic agent of urethritis in men (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0067">67</link>).</para>

In contrast to most other <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> species, this species grows on MacConkey agar. As a distinctive characteristic, <emphasis>N. animaloris</emphasis> is arginine dihydrolase positive. Isolates have been described as ampicillin susceptible (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0051">51</link>).

Samples from the endocervical canal are obtained by introducing a swab after removal of mucus plugging the cervical orifice. In MSM and women practicing anal receptive intercourse, rectal samples should be taken. Swabs heavily contaminated with feces must be discarded. In symptomatic patients, direct swabbing of lesions under rectoscopic guidance improves yield of culture. A pharyngeal swab should be obtained from individuals from high-risk groups, including MSM.

All contain the antibiotics vancomycin and colistin for suppression of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively.

While penicillin was the treatment of choice until the 1970s, the emergence and increase of penicillinase and chromosomally mediated penicillin resistance led to the abandonment of penicillin as a treatment option. Similarly, plasmid-mediated and chromosomally mediated resistance against tetracycline resulted in the replacement of this drug by broad-spectrum cephalosporins in the 1980s and later by fluoroquinolones. Nevertheless, resistance against fluoroquinolones emerged in the 1990s in Southeast Asia (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0166">166</link>) and spread to many countries, including the United States (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0167">167</link>).

Finally, resistance against third-generation cephalosporins has emerged due to alterations within the <emphasis>penA</emphasis> gene (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0166">166</link>). Epidemiologic data for 2015 to 2019 from the CDC reported that the proportion of isolates with elevated cefixime MICs (≥0.25 mg/liter) and elevated ceftriaxone MICs (≥0.125 mg/liter) remained stable, with percentages around 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. In contrast, the proportion of isolates with elevated azithromycin MICs (≥2 mg/liter) almost doubled, from 3% (2015) to 5% (2019). Likewise, the proportion of isolates with ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC ≥ 1 mg/liter) increased to 35% in 2019 (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0170">170</link>). European data from 2017 showed that the rate of cefixime resistance (MIC &gt; 0.12 mg/liter) was 2%, whereas no resistant ceftriaxone isolates (MIC &gt; 0.12 mg/liter) were found in 2017. Azithromycin-resistant (MIC &gt; 0.5 mg/liter) and ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC &gt; 0.06 mg/liter) isolates were found at rates of 8% and 47%, respectively. Whereas many guidelines have abandoned strict dual-antibiotic treatment of gonococcal infections, a combination of parenteral ceftriaxone with oral azithromycin is still recommended according to the 2020 European guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of gonorrhea in adults (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0099">99</link>).

Resistance against ciprofloxacin emerged in the United States in 2007 (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0180">180</link>), associated with a point mutation at position 91 of subunit A of the DNA gyrase. While the rate of resistant isolates is low in the United States (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0172">172</link>) and Europe (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0173">173</link>), an alarmingly high proportion of 65% was reported in an outbreak of IMD in India (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0181">181</link>). Interestingly, infections due to ciprofloxacin resistant strains of nongroupable <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> have been reported from England, Germany, Italy, and Sweden. Molecular analysis showed that these strains were genetically homogeneous and belonged to the ST-175 complex (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0182">182</link>). Azithromycin has been shown to be active against invasive isolates (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0183">183</link>) and is an alternative for the chemoprophylaxis of contacts, especially in areas with high rates of ciprofloxacin resistance (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0180">180</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0052s0000p0065">Due to the imperfect specificity of many diagnostic methods used for identification of<emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis>, results must be interpreted in the context of local disease prevalence, which considerably influences any test’s positive predictive value. This particularly applies to NAATs, which due to varying specificities, cannot be uniformly recommended in low-prevalence settings (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0184">184</link>). If medicolegal ramifications are likely to result from a positive test, as in the case of victims of sexual assault, special scrutiny must be applied to all laboratory procedures involved in the issuing of a positive result.</para>

      <para id="ch0052s0000p0066">In low-prevalence settings, special protocols should be in place to ensure confirmation of results. This is also important for specimens from children and adolescents and for the documentation of sexual abuse. Here, suspected<emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> should be confirmed by at least two different methods, including multitest identification systems, immunologic methods, sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, or MALDI-TOF MS. Additionally, strains and DNA need to be conserved.</para>
      <para id="ch0052s0000p0067">In settings of high prevalence, such as in laboratories serving sexual health clinics, tests giving a “yes-no” answer may be preferable over systems identifying the exact species. Here, two levels of confidence may be attached to the laboratory report. A presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhea may be issued if either of the two following criteria is met: (i) microscopic visualization of typical Gram-negative diplococci on examination of a smear of male urethral exudates or (ii) growth of oxidase-positive bacteria from the male urethra or endocervix on selective medium with colony morphology and microscopic appearance (Gram-negative diplococci) suggestive of<emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae.</emphasis> Because <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> has been described as a causative agent of urethritis (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0185">185</link>, <link linkend="ch0052s0000li0186">186</link>), a definitive diagnosis requires (i) isolation of oxidase-positive Gram-negative diplococci from sites of exposure (e.g., urethra, endocervix, throat, or rectum) by culture on selective medium and (ii) confirmation by mass-spectrometric, biochemical, or molecular methods.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0052s0000a0078"/>
      <para id="ch0052s0000p0068"><emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> is always considered a pathogen when isolated from usually sterile body fluids, such as blood or CSF. Also, when isolated from the urethra, cervix, or conjunctiva, a pathogenic role is likely. Specifically, unencapsulated <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> strains derived from clonal complex 11 (so-called ET-15) are emerging urogenital pathogens (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0186">186</link>). In the above cases, <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> should always be reported and the strain forwarded to a reference laboratory. Many national guidelines consider meningococcal conjunctivitis an indication for chemoprophylaxis of the patient and close contacts, due to high immediate risk of invasive disease (<link linkend="ch0052s0000li0187">187</link>, <link linkend="ch0052s0000li0188">188</link>). Detection of <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> from bronchoalveolar lavage or sputum must be interpreted in consultation with the clinician, because it does not automatically imply a pathogenic role. Growth from oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal specimens usually reflects asymptomatic carriage. Eradication of asymptomatic carriage should generally not be recommended, because carriage is quite a common phenomenon, conferring a very low risk of invasive disease. Furthermore, obtaining nasopharyngeal swabs to detect <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> from close contacts of a patient with invasive disease should not be done on a routine basis, because this may reveal the presence of unrelated strains and delay the decision regarding chemoprophylaxis.</para>
      <para id="ch0052s0000p0069"><emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> are the primary pathogenic species of the genus <emphasis>Neisseria.</emphasis> The remaining species are mostly encountered as commensals and rarely cause disease. Although both <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> can cause urethritis, diseases caused by these organisms differ in terms of means of transmission, organs affected, dissemination frequency, and case fatality rate. Also, antimicrobial resistance is mainly viewed as a problem in gonococci, where there have been frequent changes in recommended therapy due to evolving resistance. Newer liquid Amies-type media contribute to better culture-based diagnostic results by facilitating growth after refrigeration. Nevertheless, as the bacteria remain susceptible to harsh environmental conditions, molecular methods have gained importance for the diagnosis of both meningococcal disease and gonorrhea.</para>
