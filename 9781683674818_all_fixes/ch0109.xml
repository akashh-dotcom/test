      <para id="ch0109s000000p0003">Measles virus is a pleomorphic, enveloped, nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a virion size ranging from 120 to 250 nm. The measles virus genome is 15,894 nucleotides in length, although occasional variation in genome length has been described (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0002">2</link>). The linear genome contains six genes separated by conserved intergenic trinucleotides that are organized on the single strand of RNA in an order consistent with most of the paramyxoviruses (3′-N-P-M-F-H-L-5′). Each gene encodes a single protein except the phosphoprotein (P) gene, which also encodes two nonstructural proteins, V and C, through RNA editing and a secondary translation initiation site, respectively. The nucleoprotein (N) is produced first and due to the transcriptional gradient is the most abundant protein in infected cells. The N protein encapsulates both full-length negative-sense (genome) and full-length positive-sense (antigenome) RNAs (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0001">1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0004">The protein products of the P and the polymerase (L) genes interact with the full-length viral RNA to form the ribonucleoprotein complex. A membrane derived from the plasma membrane surrounds the viral nucleocapsid structures and incorporates the gene products from the M, F, and H genes (matrix, fusion, and hemagglutinin proteins, respectively). The F and H envelope proteins are N-linked transmembrane glycoproteins and form a multimeric complex which mediates viral entry (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0001">1</link>). The H glycoprotein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies, and viral entry into host cells is initiated by binding of H to one of three host cell receptors: CD46, CD150 (human signaling lymphocyte activation marker [hSLAM]), and nectin-4 (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0003">3</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0005">5</link>). CD150 is expressed on many cells of the immune system, including lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and some macrophages (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0006">6</link>), while CD46 is expressed on all nucleated human cells. Nectin-4 is present in adherens junctions of epithelial cells (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0007">7</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0005">Although measles virus has only a single serotype (monotypic), antigenic and genetic variability has been detected between and among wild-type viruses and vaccine viruses. Thus far, immunity to the vaccine viruses has conferred immunity to clinical disease from other circulating viruses. However, RNA viruses are prone to mutations during replication due to the lack of proofreading capacity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. This has implications for the molecular epidemiological interpretation of nucleotide differences that may be observed in viruses collected during outbreaks. The nucleotide sequence variability among wild-type viruses is most evident in the genes encoding the N and H proteins (7 to 10%), and the maximum sequence variability has been determined to reside in the last 450 nucleotides of the coding region of the N gene (~12%) (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0008">8</link>). Based on this sequence region, a standard nomenclature has been established. For molecular epidemiologic purposes, the genotype designations are considered the operational taxonomic unit, while related genotypes are grouped by clades. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recognizes eight clades, designated A to H. Within these clades, there are 24 recognized genotypes (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0009">9</link>). Circulating genotypes detected have systematically decreased over time, and currently two genotypes (D8 and B3) remain in circulation (<anchor id="ch0109s000000a0006"/><link linkend="ch0109s000000a0009">Fig. 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0011">11</link>). The further characterization of circulating measles virus transmission pathways using named strains to track viral variants within the genotypes was established with the development of the Measles Nucleotide Surveillance (MeaNS) database in 2008. Named strains are sequences with significant transmission reported from multiple countries within a 2-year period (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0012">12</link>). Several recent reviews provide an overview of global measles epidemiology and genotype distribution (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0014">14</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0006">Measles virus can be readily inactivated by exposure to organic solvents, disinfectants (e.g., 1% sodium hypochlorite and 70% ethanol), acidic (pH &lt; 5) or basic (pH &gt; 10) solutions, and UV light. It is also heat labile and can be inactivated by heating at 56°C for 30 min. However, measles virus is remarkably resilient to colder temperatures, and infectious virus can be stored at −70°C in combination with a stabilizing agent (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide or serum) for several years. Under ambient environmental conditions, measles virus can survive on most surfaces for up to 2 h, and viral RNA can be detected on surfaces surrounding an infected individual (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0016">16</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0109s000000p0007">Measles virus is an airborne pathogen that is transmitted via inhalation of aerosols or respiratory droplets. Measles can also be transmitted via direct contact with infected secretions or contaminated fomites. Studies in the macaque model indicate that the initial target cells are alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, both of which express CD150 (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0018">18</link>). Measles virus spreads to regional lymph nodes, where it preferentially infects T and B lymphocytes. Following viremia, measles virus spreads to the skin and conjunctiva, replicating in endothelial cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0019">19</link>). Infected immune cells facilitate spread to both lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs. Measles is a highly contagious disease, and up to 90% of susceptible persons who are close contacts develop measles following exposure (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0020">20</link>). In the prevaccine era, more than 90% of individuals acquired measles infections before 10 years of age. The reproduction number (R<subscript>0</subscript>) for measles is estimated to be 9 to 18, higher than any other infectious communicable disease (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0022">22</link>). Therefore, a 2-dose regimen of measles virus-containing vaccine is recommended to provide immunity. The first dose is recommended to be administered at 9 months of age in regions where measles is endemic and at 12 to 15 months of age in regions of nonendemicity (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0014">14</link>). In the United States, the second dose is recommended to be administered at 4 to 6 years of age, though children can receive the second dose earlier, as long as it is at least 28 days after the first dose. The measles vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine derived from genotype A strains and is usually administered as a combined vaccine with live attenuated mumps and/or rubella (MMR or MR) and varicella (MMRV).</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0008">Measles virus causes periodic epidemics in unvaccinated populations, with interepidemic periods of 2 to 5 years. These periods decrease as population size and density increase and are directly related to the availability of susceptible individuals within the population that could sustain disease transmission. Sufficiently high levels of vaccination can interrupt endemic transmission, and the interval between measles outbreaks concomitantly increases in vaccinated populations. Among vaccinated populations, the age distribution of susceptible individuals is determined by which age groups lack vaccine- or measles-induced immunity. In the United States, high two-dose measles vaccine coverage has been successful in stopping endemic transmission, and measles was declared to be eliminated in 2000 (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0023">23</link>). The length of protection afforded by natural infection or vaccination in the absence of circulating wild-type measles virus and subclinical boosting is unclear, although it is believed to be long-lasting.</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0009">While most recent U.S. measles cases have occurred in unvaccinated persons, a small number of cases have been observed among vaccinated and presumptively immune persons (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0024">24</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0029">29</link>). Cases of measles among adults who had previously received two doses of live attenuated measles vaccine in childhood may indicate that titers of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are waning over time or that immunologic memory to measles is more limited than previously believed. This may also highlight interindividual variation in primary vaccine immune responses, where some individuals fail to seroconvert or develop suboptimal antibody titers following vaccination. Laboratory confirmation of measles in previously vaccinated individuals can be challenging, as IgM assays may give inconclusive results in this context, and although a positive reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay result from an appropriately timed specimen can provide confirmation, negative RT-PCR results may not rule out a highly suspicious case. Among previously vaccinated individuals, symptoms can range from classic to mild, with reduced intensity and duration of both fever and rash. In fact, laboratory testing indicated that these individuals have a heightened memory response, with high-avidity IgG and/or an unusually high neutralizing-antibody titer (&gt;40,000 mIU) within the first few days of rash onset (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0025">25</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0027">27</link>). Suspected measles cases that present with modified symptoms may go unrecognized in the absence of a confirmed measles outbreak. While some reports of transmission from these cases have been documented, they are generally thought to pose a low transmission risk in vaccinated populations (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0026">26</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0032">32</link>). Good public health practice would dictate that these cases be monitored to ensure that contacts, particularly unvaccinated contacts, remain uninfected.</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0010">While tremendous strides in global measles control and mortality reduction have occurred, measles remains a formidable childhood disease in many areas of the world (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0014">14</link>). Effective use of available live-attenuated measles vaccines and increased second-dose measles vaccination opportunities across countries have combined to eliminate measles in many large geographic regions; however, maintenance of measles elimination remains challenging, and re-establishment of endemic transmission has occurred in multiple countries with previously documented elimination (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0033">33</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0035">35</link>). The Pan-American Health Organization declared the elimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and the region of the Americas was the first WHO region to document elimination of measles and rubella (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0033">33</link>). However, regional elimination for measles was not maintained: in 2018 and 2019 Venezuela and Brazil lost elimination status, as endemic measles circulation was reestablished in these countries. This prompted the establishment of the Measles and Rubella Elimination Regional Monitoring and Re-Verification Commission in 2019 and the requirement to demonstrate interruption of endemic transmission for more than one year for countries to reverify elimination (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0036">36</link>). Despite these efforts, as of 2019 the global incidence of measles was 120 cases/million population, the highest it had been since 2000 (146 cases/million) (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0037">37</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0039">39</link>). The number of countries reporting annual incidence of &lt;5 cases/million population declined significantly between 2016 (125 countries) and 2019 (85 countries), although incidence varied by WHO region and country (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0039">39</link>). In 2020, 81 countries verified measles elimination status, although no WHO region has achieved sustained elimination (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0011">11</link>). Financial and logistical difficulties, combined with safety concerns and philosophical objections to vaccination, have been implicated as causes of recent outbreaks and the reemergence of measles cases in some populations with established vaccination programs (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0040">40</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0042">42</link>). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has also resulted in a significant disruption in childhood immunization campaigns on a global scale, with an estimated 117 million children having missed a measles immunization in 2020-2021 (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0043">43</link>). Successful achievement of measles elimination will require redoubling of political and especially financial commitments at a time when such resources are difficult to secure. The control and elimination goals set forth by the Measles and Rubella Initiative in the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan (2012-2020) were not achieved due to the global resurgence of measles, which has threatened elimination status in some regions (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0044">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0045">45</link>). The WHO immunization agenda for 2030 outlines new strategies for achieving regional measles elimination goals in support of global measles elimination (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0047">47</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0109s000000p0011">Approximately 1 week to 12 days following infection, clinical presentation begins with cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and fever. The prodromal stage progresses over the next 3 to 4 days, with all symptoms intensifying and the associated fever reaching as high as 105°F. Koplik’s spots, which are pathognomonic for measles, appear on the buccal mucosa 2 to 3 days before rash onset in 50 to 90% of cases and may persist for 1 to 2 days after rash onset. These lesions are small, irregular red spots with a bluish white center. The signature erythematous rash appears approximately 2 weeks following infection and is first evident on the forehead or behind the ears. The rash first presents as red macules 1 to 2 mm in diameter, which develop into maculopapules over the next 3 days. The exanthem is typically most confluent on the face and upper body and initially blanches upon applying pressure. By the end of the second day, the trunk and upper extremities are covered with rash, with the lower extremities affected by the third day. The rash resolves in the same sequence, first disappearing from the face and neck. The lesions turn brown, persist for 7 to 10 days, and are followed by a fine desquamation.</para>
        <para id="ch0109s000000p0012">The nonspecific nature of the prodromal symptoms combined with mild case presentation in many individuals can make the clinical diagnosis of measles difficult. Several other viral infections (e.g., rubella, enteroviruses, and parvovirus B19 infections), bacterial infections, allergic reactions, and other medical conditions (e.g., Kawasaki’s disease) also cause an exanthematous rash akin to measles. It is important that measles infection continue to be considered in the initial clinical case diagnosis, particularly in unvaccinated persons or persons returning from international travel.</para>
        <para id="ch0109s000000p0013">Death resulting from respiratory and neurological complications (see below) occurs in 1 of every 1,000 measles cases. The risk of death is greater for infants and adults than for children and adolescents; however, rates of death from acute measles virus infections can approach 10% in infants and children in developing countries, with rates of morbidity being much higher. This is particularly true among malnourished populations, which has led to several studies that have explored the impact of nutritional status, particularly vitamin A deficiency, on measles immunity (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0048">48</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0050">50</link>).

      <para id="ch0109s000000p0014">Measles virus infection has long been documented to cause a generalized immunosuppression, more recently termed immune amnesia, that may partially result from the depletion of memory T and B cells, significantly limiting the ability of the adaptive immune system to combat other opportunistic pathogens (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0051">51</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0056">56</link>). This immunosuppression lasts from weeks to months and leads to an increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial and viral infections, particularly among children and immunocompromised persons in developing countries (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0057">57</link>). Measles also causes damage to the respiratory tract, resulting in the loss of cilia, which further predisposes infected individuals to secondary infections. The most common complications associated with measles virus infection are otitis media (7 to 9%), pneumonia (1 to 6%), and diarrhea (6%). Notable central nervous system (CNS) complications include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis occurs in 1 per 1,000 cases and is manifested clinically by seizures, lethargy, irritability, and/or coma approximately 1 to 2 weeks after rash onset. In the United States, death resulting from respiratory or neurologic complications has occurred in 1 to 3 of every 1,000 cases during the postelimination era.</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0015">SSPE is a progressive, inevitably fatal, late neurological complication caused by persistent measles virus infection of the CNS that occurs in approximately 1 to 2 per 10,000 measles cases, with higher rates in children &lt;5 years of age (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0059">59</link>). A recent retrospective study found that the incidence of SSPE from 1988 to 1991 was 1:1,367 for children &lt;5 years old and 1:609 for children &lt;12 months old at the time of measles disease, although previous studies have reported the incidence of SSPE to be much lower (1:25,000 overall; 1:5,500 for children &lt;12 months old) (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0060">60</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0063">63</link>). Only wild-type measles virus nucleic acid sequences have been identified in association with this disease, and the use of measles vaccine has largely eliminated SSPE from the United States (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0059">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0064">64</link>). The average time from natural measles virus infection to manifestations of SSPE is 7 years, and as a result, SSPE may be initially misdiagnosed. The disease characteristically involves personality changes, decreased motor and intellectual capabilities, involuntary movements, muscular rigidity and ultimately leads to death. Live measles virus is difficult to recover from brain specimens, requiring cocultivation or brain tissue explant techniques, yet measles virus proteins and RNA can be readily detected in brain tissue (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0066">66</link>).

Atypical measles syndrome occurs only in persons who have previously been vaccinated with multiple doses of formalin-killed measles vaccine and subsequently exposed to wild-type measles virus. An estimated 600,000 to 900,000 persons received the formalin-inactivated vaccine in the United States from 1963 to 1967. The syndrome was believed to result from immunopathological responses due to a combination of the Arthus reaction and delayed hypersensitivity (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0067">67</link>).

Approximately 5 to 15% of vaccinees develop fever after receiving a first dose of either MMR or MMRV vaccine, with MMRV recipients reporting nearly twice as many fever-related medical visits as recipients of separately administered MMR and varicella vaccines (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0068">68</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0070">70</link>).

Fever after the first dose of a measles virus-containing vaccine has been associated with an increased risk of febrile seizures, although this risk is significantly higher among children older than 15 months of age, highlighting the importance of maintaining timely immunization schedules (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0068">68</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0109s000000p0020">For all the laboratory tests described throughout this chapter, it is important to note that both the specimen type being tested and the test method must be validated before a test can used for routine case confirmation. Nasopharyngeal (NP) or throat (oropharyngeal) swabs are the preferred specimen types for detection of measles virus RNA by RT-PCR or for virus isolation. After collection, swabs should be transferred into 1 to 3 ml of viral transport medium and should not be allowed to dry. Measles viruses are sensitive to heat, and infectivity decreases significantly when specimens are not kept cold (2 to 8°C). If possible, clinical specimens for RNA detection or virus isolation should be frozen at −70°C or lower within 1 hour of collection to preserve viral viability. If storage at −70°C or lower is not possible, samples can be stored at 2 to 8°C for up to 72 h before freezing at −20°C or lower. At −20°C, viral viability may be lost, but the integrity of viral RNA should be maintained and be readily detected by RT-PCR. If −70°C or −20°C freezers are not available, it is recommended to keep the specimen refrigerated (2 to 8°C). Samples should be transported as soon as possible following collection, and freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible after rash onset for successful molecular detection and virus isolation, as the virus is present in the highest concentrations at that time (typically 1 to 3 days after rash onset). Urine samples may also contain virus, and collection of both urine and NP samples can increase the probability of detection. Measles virus is cell associated, so if possible, urine specimens (10 to 50 ml) should be centrifuged at 500 ×<emphasis>g</emphasis> for 10 min, preferably at 2 to 8°C (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0078">78</link>). The urine sediment can be resuspended in 2 to 3 ml of sterile transport medium, tissue culture medium, or physiological buffered saline. The resuspended urine sediment should be frozen at −20°C to −70°C and shipped frozen, if possible. If facilities for processing the urine are not available, the uncentrifuged urine sample should be kept at 2 to 8°C and shipped on cold packs as soon as possible in a leakproof container. Nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchial lavage samples may also be used, and under special circumstances, whole blood, serum, brain, and skin biopsy samples may be used. Measles virus is lymphotropic, and measles virus can be detected in circulating B cells and T cells (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0079">79</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0080">80</link>). Thus, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are an excellent source for the isolation of measles virus. PBMCs are obtained from EDTA-treated blood (diluted 1:3 in saline) by sedimentation through density gradients.</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0021">A blood specimen (generally 5 ml in a red-top or serum separator tube) should be collected as soon as possible upon suspicion of measles disease. The blood tube should be centrifuged within 2 h of collection to separate the serum from the clot, and the serum aseptically transferred to a sterile tube labeled with a unique specimen identifier. Serum specimens should ideally be stored frozen at −20°C or lower and shipped on dry ice to ensure stability, but if specimens cannot be frozen, they can be stored at 2 to 8°C for up to 2 weeks and shipped on wet ice packs. Samples for IgM determinations should not be frozen and thawed more than three times. A single serum specimen is sufficient in most cases (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0081">81</link>). However, measles virus-specific IgM may not be detectable in serum collected in the first 72 h after rash onset in approximately 30% of measles cases, and a second serum specimen collected 3 to 10 days after symptom onset may be required (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0082">82</link>). To assess seroconversion following measles vaccination, paired serum specimens can be tested with IgG enzyme immunoassays, multiplex bead assay (MBA), or plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) tests (see below). The first specimen should be obtained prior to vaccination and the second approximately 3 to 4 weeks later, so that a rise in measles virus-specific IgG can be measured. Measles and rubella immunity in large population studies may be evaluated by the multiplex bead assay to determine population level immunity and identify immunity gaps for targeted vaccination strategies or as part of post-campaign coverage surveys (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0083">83</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0085">85</link>). In addition, cerebrospinal fluid samples should be obtained if neurological complications are present or suspected. For immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), slides of respiratory specimens should be fixed in cold acetone for 2 min and stored at 4°C.</para>

      <para id="ch0109s000000p0022">Alternatives to serum specimen collection for the diagnosis of measles include the use of gingival crevicular or oral fluid (OF) and the use of dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper. OF samples have been used for detection of measles virus-specific IgM and IgG as well as for detection of hepatitis, rubella, mumps, and other infections (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0086">86</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0088">88</link>). This specimen collection method is now used almost exclusively for routine measles, rubella, and mumps laboratory surveillance in the United Kingdom (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0089">89</link>). The use of OF specimens has appeal because the collection method is noninvasive, and collection does not require a medical professional. OF samples do not require processing in the field and offer the opportunity to detect measles virus-specific IgM for case confirmation and nucleic acids for molecular characterization (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0090">90</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0091">91</link>). While OF specimens can be used for detection of rubella virus, the lack of a sufficiently sensitive rubella IgM test limits their utility for rubella serologic surveillance. The overall cost of OF testing is comparable to that of traditional serologic testing, but transportation costs tend to be lower, as OF specimens do not generally require a cold chain. Commercial serological assays can exhibit heightened background reactivity and decreased sensitivity with OF samples, and cold chain maintenance remains a concern for transporting OF specimens in warmer climates. Devices (such as OraSure) containing IgM-stabilizing preservatives should be avoided if molecular testing is to be performed, as these additives inhibit nucleic acid amplification.</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0023">Like OF samples, DBS collected on filter paper do not require processing in the field or maintenance of a cold chain. They can be used to test for rubella as well as measles, and they can be used for molecular characterization of the measles virus genome (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0092">92</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0095">95</link>). In addition, serum eluted from blood spots can likely be tested in commercially available measles-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and have been routinely used for serological surveillance by both ELISA and MBA without a loss of sensitivity and specificity (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0084">84</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0092">92</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0096">96</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0099">99</link>), making this collection method very attractive for widespread use. Although still considered an invasive technique, the finger-stick method of sample collection is often viewed more favorably by parents than phlebotomy and can be conducted in the field without a medical professional (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0100">100</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0024">An evaluation and recommendations for the use of DBS and OF as diagnostic specimens for measles and rubella were published by the WHO in 2008 and for serological surveillance in 2019.

While the collection of both serologic and molecular specimens is recommended to provide the best opportunity of confirming a measles case, molecular detection methods can be more advantageous under certain circumstances. For example, rRT-PCR is advantageous for measles case confirmation where IgM testing is compromised by the concurrent or recent use of measles virus-containing vaccine as part of an outbreak response or in settings of recent vaccine distribution, such as supplemental immunization activities (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0108">108</link>). Molecular detection methods are also recommended when genetic characterization of the virus is required to map transmission patterns or classify linkages between outbreak cases. Detection of viral RNA can also be useful in classifying measles cases from low-prevalence and postelimination settings, since the rate of false positives for molecular tests is lower than that observed for IgM testing. RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the last 450 nucleotides of the coding region of the N protein gene are commonly used for genotype analysis. Genotyping is the only diagnostic method that can distinguish between a vaccine reaction and a wild-type measles virus infection, and a method for rapid identification of measles vaccine genotype in clinical samples has been developed (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0109">109</link>). The use of rRT-PCR for case confirmation has increased in recent years and, if specimens are collected early after rash onset, can provide increased sensitivity and specificity compared to serologic testing. However, unlike IgM testing, which is widely available at clinical reference laboratories, measles virus rRT-PCR is limited primarily to public health laboratories, resulting in a barrier to timely testing.</para>

Although virus has been isolated from the urine as late as 4 to 7 days after rash onset, viremia generally clears 2 to 3 days after rash onset in parallel with the appearance of antibody. Thus, virus can be most readily isolated in the 2 to 4 days preceding rash onset until about 4 days after rash onset. Cell lines, such as B95a, primary monkey kidney, and Vero cells, can be used for measles virus isolation. However, to improve laboratory safety and efficiency, the Vero/hSLAM cell line is now widely used for measles virus isolation and has been adopted for use in most laboratories of the WHO Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN). These cells were developed by transfecting the Vero cell line with a plasmid carrying the gene for hSLAM and are permissive for growth of both measles and rubella viruses (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0110">110</link>). The hSLAM molecule has been shown to be a cell surface receptor for both wild-type and laboratory-adapted strains of measles virus. Current studies indicate that the sensitivity of Vero/hSLAM cells for isolation of measles virus is equivalent to that of B95a cells. Vero/hSLAM cells also express the simian CD46 molecule; CD46 has also been identified as a receptor for vaccine strains of measles virus (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0004">4</link>). As with RT-PCR, the interpretation of negative cell culture results should be made with caution, as many factors influence the outcome.

IFA test kits are available from numerous commercial sources, and it is also possible to configure an indirect IFA without using a commercial kit. Most monoclonal antibodies with specificity to the measles virus N protein perform well in the general IFA procedure described above. Monoclonal antibodies directed against other viral proteins (such as the hemagglutinin and fusion proteins) may recognize conformational epitopes that are not stable after acetone fixation.

Molecular epidemiology in conjunction with conventional epidemiology and case investigation has enabled the linking of imported cases to their foreign sources.

Genetic data can help confirm the sources of virus or suggest a source for cases with unknown origin, as well as establish links (or lack thereof) between various cases and outbreaks. Further development of molecular virologic surveillance including the sequencing of expanded genome regions such as the M-F noncoding region (NCR) and whole-genome sequencing has proven important to provide greater sensitivity in evaluating transmission clusters as the number of measles virus genotypic variants has decreased through disease control measures (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0114">114</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0115">115</link>).

      <para id="ch0109s000000p0032">The most widely used laboratory method for the confirmation of clinically diagnosed measles is a serum-based IgM ELISA. Commercial IgM assays are available and used worldwide by public health, clinical, and commercial laboratories. ELISA was the primary confirmatory test used by the laboratory network of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) during the measles control and elimination phases throughout the Americas. The WHO GMRLN has also recommended the use of IgM ELISA for laboratory confirmation of measles (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0117">117</link>). As regions enter the elimination phase, measles cases become more difficult to diagnose, and ELISA results become less reliable. The use of RT-PCR for confirmation has become a routine adjunct for the United States, and in other elimination settings, molecular diagnosis has largely replaced IgM testing due to the lower positive predictive value associated with low disease prevalence. Many regional public health reference laboratories have also implemented IgG testing and in some cases IgG avidity testing to supplement surveillance and case classification (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0111">111</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0118">118</link>). The ELISAs can be performed using a single serum specimen, are relatively rapid (2 to 6 h), are simple to perform, and can be used to diagnose acute measles virus infection from the time of rash onset until at least 4 weeks after rash onset. Thus, ELISA fulfills all the basic criteria for the accurate, effective, and efficient diagnosis of measles.

In general, IgG measurements by ELISA or similar assays have been used for surveillance (antibody prevalence) studies, while PRN has been reserved for studies interested in questions regarding immunity. Most laboratories have trained personnel and are already equipped to run ELISAs. The multiplex bead assay (MBA) using Luminex bead-based technology has shown strong correlation with PRN and is currently being used in both serological surveillance and immunity studies (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0083">83</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0085">85</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0034">Commercial laboratories and some large clinical centers performing large-volume testing of measles (and rubella) specimens require high-throughput automated assay platforms in conjunction with ELISA (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0129">129</link>). Chemiluminescence assays (such as those on the DiaSorin Liaison system) are widely used among clinical laboratories for measles and rubella IgM and IgG testing. Similarly, multiplex flow immunoassays (MFIs) are also widely used by commercial laboratories. MFIs employ antigen-coated, fluorescently labeled magnetic beads to test for measles virus-specific antibodies and exhibit sensitivities/specificities equivalent to standard commercial ELISA (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0130">130</link>). Although these assay formats may differ from those of the traditional ELISAs, their performance characteristics and rapid turnaround times make them viable alternatives for large surveillance, seroprevalence, and seroconversion studies (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0096">96</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0129">129</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0130">130</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0109s000000p0036">IgG avidity is an indicator of the overall binding strength of IgG antibodies elicited by an antigen. Low-avidity antibodies are synthesized following the initial exposure to an antigen, and over time (weeks to months), high-avidity antigen-specific IgG antibodies are selected through somatic hypermutation. Both in-house and commercial ELISAs to determine the avidity of IgG antibodies to measles virus have been developed (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0126">126</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0133">133</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0135">135</link>), yet offerings for measles virus IgG avidity testing at commercial laboratories remain limited. Avidity differences can be detected by using protein denaturants (i.e., urea or diethylamine) in the washing step of an indirect ELISA for measles virus IgG (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0135">135</link>). An avidity index can be subsequently calculated by comparing the optical densities obtained with and without the denaturing agent in the wash buffer. These tests can be used to differentiate between primary and secondary responses to vaccination and to natural infection (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0136">136</link>). Measles avidity assays are limited in their use and can only be used to rule in a case of measles. Nevertheless, this can be very useful in elimination settings where IgM assays yield indeterminate or questionable results that appear to conflict with clinical presentation and patient history.</para>

        <para id="ch0109s000000p0037">The MBA (or multiplex immuno-assay [MIA]) is a Luminex bead-based assay for the detection of IgG to measles virus and/or rubella virus. The Luminex beads are internally labeled with differential quantities of red and infrared dyes to result in unique emission spectrum combinations for the identification of individual bead fluorescent signatures, termed regions, by the instrument. Beads of different regions are covalently coupled with antigens or antibodies of interest as determined by the intended use of the assay. This technology allows efficient multiplexing of multiple targets in a single assay. For measles virus, the use of whole-virus lysate as the source antigen has demonstrated higher correlation to PRN than the use of N antigen, despite effective N antigen use in IgM ELISAs (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0083">83</link>). The rubella component of the measles and rubella multiplex bead assay also uses viral lysate as the antigen target on coupled beads. IgG is detected in serum or DBS elution by a phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-human secondary antibody or through a biotinylated anti-human IgG followed by streptavidin-PE. This assay has several advantages, including the ability to test multiple antigens of interest in a single small volume of serum, making it a highly desirable assay for serological surveillance of multiple diseases of public health interest (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0084">84</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0096">96</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0097">97</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0137">137</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0109s000000p0038">The PRN assay, which measures neutralizing antibodies directed against the surface glycoproteins of measles virus, is more sensitive and specific than hemagglutination inhibition or ELISA (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0105">105</link>). Since functional neutralizing antibodies are detected, the PRN assay provides the best serologic correlate for the assessment of immune protection (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0138">138</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0139">139</link>). However, the PRN test is not practical for routine serologic diagnosis because it is very labor-intensive, requires paired serum samples, and takes 5 to 7 days to complete. To perform the assay, test serum is diluted (2-fold or 4-fold) in microtiter plates, and a specified number of virus particles are added to each well and incubated to allow the antibody to bind to the virus. The serum-virus mixture is then added to tissue culture plates containing confluent Vero cell monolayers and incubated for an hour. The inoculum is removed, and plates are covered with carboxymethyl cellulose to prevent the virus from spreading indiscriminately. Following a 4-day incubation period, plates are stained, and plaques are counted. The dilution of serum required to reduce the number of plaques by 50% is the neutralizing antibody titer. A fluorescence-based plaque reduction microneutralization assay for measles virus has been developed and used to evaluate measles immune status among specimens from a large observational study (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0140">140</link>). Microneutralization assays and the MBA (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0083">83</link>) permit higher-throughput processing of small quantities of serum specimens and are more amenable to use in large serosurveys for assessing immune status than standard plaque neutralization assays.</para>
        <para id="ch0109s000000p0039">As mentioned above, laboratory confirmation of measles in vaccinated individuals can be challenging, since IgM may be transient and viral RNA may be less abundant. High concentrations of measles virus-neutralizing antibody (PRN titer &gt; 40,000) have been observed among confirmed measles cases with high-avidity IgG (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0025">25</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0027">27</link>), and this biomarker can be used to classify clinical measles cases with previous history of vaccination or disease. Such cases are infrequent but do occur and were identified during several recent outbreaks of measles (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0040">40</link>). In the United States, approximately 8 to 16% of measles cases reported from 2012 to 2015 occurred in vaccinated individuals. IgG avidity testing and PRN testing can be used when case classification requires additional methods to confirm measles infection, usually when the result obtained for IgM is suspected of being a false negative or a false positive and RT-PCR testing was not performed.</para>

      <para id="ch0109s000000p0040">Evaluation and interpretation of measles diagnostic results can be complicated, particularly in measles elimination settings. Measles virus infection can be diagnosed by a positive serologic test result for measles IgM antibody, a significant increase in measles IgG antibody concentration between paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens, or isolation of measles virus or identification of measles virus RNA (by RT-PCR) from clinical specimens, such as urine, blood, or throat or nasopharyngeal secretions.</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0041">Serologic tests can result in negative results when serum specimens are collected too early with respect to rash onset. For example, an IgM capture assay developed at CDC, with a sensitivity and specificity equivalent to those of commercial ELISAs, has been shown to detect IgM in only 77% of true measles cases within the first day of rash onset (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0141">141</link>). In addition, measles IgM may be transient or diminished among previously vaccinated persons suspected of having measles and therefore not detected. Since IgM tests are not 100% specific, false positives will also occur, particularly in elimination settings. Interference with other agents causing febrile rash illness occurs; parvovirus B19, enteroviruses, or human herpesvirus 6, can all give a false-positive result (overall rate of about 4%) when tested in measles IgM ELISAs and vice versa (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0142">142</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0143">143</link>). False-positive tests due to the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) can also occur. Indirect ELISAs appear to be more affected by RF than IgM capture assays. RF is an IgM class immunoglobulin that reacts with IgG and is produced as a result of some viral and autoimmune diseases. Immune complexes may form that contain test antigen-specific IgG and RF IgM. By virtue of the IgG binding to the viral antigen, the IgM component of the RF immune complex is recognized and can result in a false-positive test. Similar false-positive results can occur in capture assays but appear to be enhanced by the presence of high levels of both antigen-specific antibody and RF (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0119">119</link>). Lastly, patients with throat or ear infections occasionally develop a rash following administration of antibiotics. Subsequent serologic specimens sent for measles IgM testing may result in a false-positive test.</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0042">The positive predictive values of the ELISAs when disease prevalence is low also become a factor in interpretation. This situation occurs in countries that have eliminated endemic measles but remain vigilant in performing case-based surveillance of rash illnesses. In these geographic regions, both measles IgM and IgG ELISAs are performed on serum specimens from suspected cases due to high vaccine-induced seroprevalence. In this setting, if the IgG test is positive and the IgM test is negative, the case is usually discarded (depending upon the timing of serum collection). In some rare instances, previously vaccinated persons may develop measles, although many of these do have an IgM response (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0026">26</link>). IgG avidity testing can be used to further classify such cases as secondary vaccine failure. However, IgG avidity testing cannot be used to rule out measles cases, particularly acute secondary infections with atypical presentation. There is also evidence that case contacts that have a resident IgG response, due either to a history of natural infection or to vaccination, may develop a secondary IgG or an IgM response to currently circulating virus (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0144">144</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0145">145</link>). The IgM is generally fleeting and weakly positive and, except for rare instances, should not be a source of diagnostic confusion (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0108">108</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0043">It is important to note that the serologic correlate of protection for measles is not precisely known, although it is widely accepted as 120 mIU/mL (as measured by standard PRN test) (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0138">138</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0139">139</link>). To quantify protective measles antibody titers, serologic assays must be calibrated against a validated international reference serum standard and, perhaps more importantly, an assay that measures functional protection, such as a PRN test. Most IgG ELISA kits include calibrators for calculating the immunological status ratio (ISR), but this defines only seropositivity, not seroprotection. The measles IgG assay for the DiaSorin Liaison platform is calibrated against the WHO Third International Serum Standard, although the manufacturer reports an assay cutoff equal to 175 mIU/mL, further demonstrating the need to calibrate each assay platform to ensure accurate reporting.</para>

It should be emphasized that the majority of serum specimens submitted for serology yield a test result that is easily interpretable. However, as mentioned earlier, the current CDC <emphasis>Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0146">146</link>) strongly encourages the collection of both blood and respiratory specimens when persons with suspected measles cases first visit a health care provider. Additionally, laboratorians should be provided with as much clinical and epidemiological information as possible to aid in the final interpretation of the test result(s).</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0049">Both rRT-PCR and conventional, endpoint RT-PCR can be used to detect measles virus RNA in a clinical specimen to provide laboratory confirmation of infection. Measles virus rRT-PCR assays are typically more sensitive than the endpoint RT-PCR assays. In general, the endpoint assay is used to amplify the region of the measles virus genome required to determine the genotype. In elimination settings, it is increasingly important to develop and use molecular tests, since false-positive RT-PCR results rarely occur. Negative RT-PCR results do not rule out a case of measles, since successful detection depends on timing of specimen collection and the quality of the clinical sample. Previously vaccinated persons may have less virus present and therefore shed less virus for a shorter period of time.</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0050">Moreover, genomic regions selected for amplification in measles virus rRT-PCR assays do not distinguish between wild-type and vaccine viruses and therefore will be of limited utility in many outbreak settings where vaccination is in use to control the outbreak. The utilization of conventional RT-PCR coupled with nucleotide sequencing and genotyping as confirmatory testing for rRT-PCR is strongly advised. Genotyping will distinguish whether a person has a wild-type measles virus infection or a rash caused by a recent measles vaccination. A rapid genotype A rRT-PCR identification method has been developed and is being used by the VPD RCs to distinguish between wild-type infections and vaccine reactions (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0109">109</link>). Standard measles virus genotyping along with extended sequencing windows can also help establish which foreign country may be the source of an imported U.S. case as well as identifying multiple separate importations of the same measles virus genotype. However, genotyping alone is not sufficient, as each genotype and, more specifically, named strains can circulate in multiple countries and regions of the world. Epidemiological information should also be reviewed and considered when investigators are determining which country may be the source of an imported U.S. case.</para>

The viral envelope originates from the trans-Golgi membranes and contains two viral glycoproteins, E1 and E2, which form heterodimeric spike complexes on the virus surface (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0149">149</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0151">151</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0152">152</link>).

The average incubation period for rubella is 17 days, ranging from 12 to 23 days. Infected individuals are contagious from 7 days before until 7 days after rash onset. Rubella is less infectious than measles, with the reproduction number (R<subscript>0</subscript>) for rubella estimated to be between 3.4 to 7.8 (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0163">163</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0055">Rubella virus was not isolated until 1962, largely because a specific morphology change for infected cells is difficult to identify in tissue culture (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0164">164</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0165">165</link>). Soon thereafter, several live-attenuated rubella vaccines were developed. Introduction of a rubella vaccine in the United States (licensed in 1969) immediately broke the 6- to 9-year epidemic cycle of rubella. The last major U.S. rubella epidemic was from 1964 to 1965, when approximately 20,000 congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) cases and 2,100 neonatal deaths occurred (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0166">166</link>). Population immunity of 87.5% in the United States is accepted as eliminating significant endemic transmission (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0167">167</link>). Occasional outbreaks of rubella in some U.S. populations have not spread to undervaccinated populations, suggesting that herd immunity has been protective (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0168">168</link>). Rubella and CRS were eliminated in the United States in 2004; from 2004 to 2012, only 79 cases of rubella and six cases of CRS were reported (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0169">169</link>).

Endemic rubella and CRS have been eliminated not only from the United States but also from the Americas as of 2015. While this fell short of the ambitious goals outlined in the global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan (2012-2020) of achieving rubella and CRS elimination in at least five WHO regions, elimination goals have been established in three other WHO regions (the European, Western Pacific, and Southeast Asia regions). The elimination of endemic rubella has been verified in 83 countries (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0171">171</link>). Significant progress toward these goals has been documented, with an increase in global vaccination coverage from 40% in 2012 to 70% in 2020, and 173 of 194 WHO Member States had rubella-containing vaccines in their immunization schedules in 2020 (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0172">172</link>). Despite the possibility of worldwide rubella eradication, rubella remains endemic in many countries, and about 100,000 CRS cases occur annually in the world (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0173">173</link>).

      <para id="ch0109s000000p0057">Rubella (also known as German measles, or 3-day measles) was first described in the 18th century and was accepted as a separate disease from measles and scarlet fever in 1881 (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0178">178</link>). Postnatal rubella is characterized by an acute onset and generalized maculopapular rash with mild fever (greater than 99°F); symptoms may also include arthritis or arthralgia (mostly in postpubertal females), lymphadenopathy (specifically postauricular and suboccipital nodes), and conjunctivitis. As disease caused by rubella virus is mild, approximately 50% of postnatal rubella cases are not clinically diagnosed. In 1941, N. McAlister Gregg first recognized that cataracts in children were associated with maternal rubella during gestation (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0179">179</link>). The association between congenital rubella and a spectrum of significant birth defects, including sensorineural hearing loss, cardiovascular abnormalities, cataracts, congenital glaucoma, and meningoencephalitis, is now widely accepted. Rubella virus is currently recognized as the most potent infectious teratogen yet identified (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0180">180</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0058">When rubella occurs in a pregnant woman during the first 11 weeks of gestation, there is a high likelihood (~90%) of a birth defect(s) in the infant. After 18 weeks, the likelihood of birth defects declines, although the infant may still be born with asymptomatic rubella virus infection. It is important to note that CRS diagnosis requires a live birth; thus, the full effect of<emphasis>in utero</emphasis> rubella infection is underestimated, since fetal deaths are not included in CRS case counts. The current understanding of CRS pathogenesis is that during viremia, the virus establishes persistent infection in the placenta and subsequently crosses the placenta (an ineffective barrier to infection during early gestation) to infect the differentiating cells of the fetus (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0181">181</link>). Since the fetus is incapable of mounting effective immune responses and transplacental transfer of maternal IgG is blocked during the first trimester, fetal infection often results in viral persistence in multiple organs for the remainder of the pregnancy and after birth. Multiple different cell types can be affected, including endothelial cells, neurons, cardiac and interstitial fibroblasts, and epithelial cells of lungs, kidneys, and the ciliary body of the eye (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0181">181</link>). Rubella infection of each cell type is consistent with organ abnormalities which have been identified in patients with CRS. Congenital abnormalities arise from the direct effects of rubella virus on infected cells as well as from placental damage and vascular insufficiency that causes neurodegenerative damage and general growth retardation. Persistent rubella infection may result in clinical problems which present later in life (such as late-onset deafness), possibly due to direct cell damage or because of immunopathological mechanisms (e.g., pneumonitis). Congenital rubella infection (CRI) results in both shedding of the virus and production of IgM antibodies in the neonate. Diagnosis is based on detection of rubella virus RNA (rRT-PCR), infectious virions (virus culture), or rubella virus-specific IgM in such patients. The clinical definition of CRS is standardized; if congenital defects characteristic of CRS are not present, the infant with laboratory evidence of infection is diagnosed as having CRI only. Suspected CRS case identification is crucial to effective CRS surveillance, but laboratory confirmation of rubella virus infection in the newborn by either serologic or virus detection techniques is also critical, especially when only a single defect presents, as the defects characteristic of CRS can occur for other reasons (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0182">182</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0109s000000p0059">The measles section of this chapter contains details on sample collection which are not repeated here. Although specimens are collected in the same manner for both diseases, there are important differences in timing for optimal specimen collection and the amount of virus that is present. Clinical specimens for culture of rubella virus are usually throat swabs or nasopharyngeal secretions diluted into transport medium (e.g., Culturette collection and transport devices). The virus can also be isolated from various other specimens, including tissue biopsy samples and urine (if pH is controlled) (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0144">144</link>). Specimens for virus detection or isolation should be stored refrigerated (2 to 8°C) immediately after collection and preferably frozen (−20°C or lower) within 1 h of collection. If necessary, specimens for virus detection can be stored at 2 to 8°C for short periods (up to 3 days) before freezing at −70°C or lower for longer storage periods (weeks); virions lose infectivity at higher temperatures (e.g., 37°C). Virions are rapidly inactivated by mild heat (≥56°C), detergents, or lipid solvents. Specimens for serology or culture should ideally be frozen and shipped on dry ice to ensure specimen stability, but they can be transported by standard methods (e.g., overnight carrier) at 2 to 8°C if necessary. Alternative specimens such as DBS and oral mucosal transudate (OMT) have been shown to be adequate for surveillance of rubella using IgM detection (DBS and OMT) and virus detection (OMT) (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0090">90</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0092">92</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0183">183</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0185">185</link>). Two caveats should be considered if these alternative specimens are used. First, diagnostic kits are usually not approved by FDA for use with DBS; second, low IgM levels in OMT necessitate the use of highly sensitive detection assays.</para>
      <para id="ch0109s000000p0060">The timing of specimen collection is important in postnatal rubella. Rubella virus-specific IgM detection is the most common laboratory diagnostic criterion for rubella confirmation, but approximately 50% of rubella cases are IgM negative on the day of rash onset (see<anchor id="ch0109s000000a0059"/><link linkend="ch0109s000000a0063">Table 2</link> and related text below). Since postnatal rubella is a mild disease of short duration, special effort may be required to obtain a serum sample 5 to 7 days after the onset of rash, when most rubella patients are strongly IgM positive and before the urgent need for clinical treatment subsides. Timing of specimen collection is less critical for patients with CRS, as IgM and virus can be detected for months.</para>

Throat swabs taken on the day of rash onset are usually positive for rubella virus, even though more cases can be confirmed if swabs are collected 1 to 2 days before rash onset. Virus shedding in the throat declines rapidly, and only ~50% of cases are positive by 4 days after rash onset. Viral culture is also used to monitor shedding of the virus in CRS and CRI patients for the purpose of determining when isolation of these patients from susceptible contacts can be ended. Although the virus will grow in a variety of cell types, including Vero, BHK21, AGMK, and RK-13 cells, Vero is the continuous cell line most commonly used for rubella virus isolation. The primary problem encountered with tissue culture is the lack of CPE in a single passage of wild-type viruses. Virus growth can now be identified in the absence of CPE using methods such as rRT-PCR, IFA, and immunocolorimetric assays (ICA) to detect viral RNA or proteins (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0187">187</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0190">190</link>).</para>

Unfortunately, only about 50% of postnatal rubella cases are IgM positive on the day of symptom onset (<link linkend="ch0109s000000a0063">Table 2</link>; <anchor id="ch0109s000000a0080"/><link linkend="ch0109s000000a0083">Fig. 4</link>) (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0183">183</link>).

A negative IgM serologic result prior to 5 days after onset should be followed with testing of a serum sample taken as soon as possible thereafter to avoid false-negative results (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0196">196</link>). If a serum sample taken at onset and a convalescent-phase serum sample are available, a 4-fold rise in rubella virus-specific IgG is confirmatory for postnatal rubella infection; such sera should be taken as early as possible after disease onset (within 1 week) and about 2 to 3 weeks thereafter. When IgG titers are used for diagnostic purposes, a dilution series of each serum sample should be made and ELISA results for each dilution series compared. A single dilution set is an unreliable measure of IgG quantification.</para>

(A) For postnatal rubella, molecular detection of viral RNA by rRT-PCR or isolation of rubella virus is typically best accomplished in the first 3 days following rash onset (red line), although the amount of detectable virus shed by an infected individual is dependent on numerous factors. Rubella virus-specific IgM levels peak around 5 days following rash onset (orange line) and gradually decline after recovery; IgG levels typically lag behind IgM production by several days, reaching and maintaining peak titers after 1 to 2 weeks (blue line). (B) The detectable levels of rubella virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies can differ in CRS cases. Infants born with CRS can shed detectable rubella virus (black line) up to 1 year of age. Rubella virus-specific IgM levels (red line) can remain elevated for several months. High-avidity maternal IgG antibody levels (blue dashed line) decline over the first 6 months of life, while low-avidity IgG levels (blue solid line) from the infant mature by 6 to 9 months.

        <para id="ch0109s000000p0076">Since most rubella virus strains do not exhibit CPE, two immunocolorimetric neutralization assays have been developed for assessment of the neutralization capacity of rubella antibody-positive serum specimens: a focus reduction neutralization assay (FRNA) and a soluble immunocolorimetric neutralization assay (sICNA) (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0190">190</link>, <link linkend="ch0109s000000li0200">200</link>–<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0202">202</link>). The initial step of both assays is incubation of 2- or 10-fold serum dilutions and a standard amount of rubella virus (usually 100 to 200 FFU) in cell culture medium for 1 h at 35 to 37°C. A control consisting of virus alone must be included in the assay, since some reduction in the number of infectious virions is observed during the 1-h incubation. Virus-serum mixtures are then added to confluent Vero cell monolayers and incubated for 1 h at 35°C. After removal of the inoculum, the monolayers are overlaid with cell culture medium (sICNA) or Avicel-containing culture medium (FRNA). After 3 days, the overlay is removed, and the monolayers are fixed with methanol. The infected cells are detected by indirect immunostaining with the rubella-specific monoclonal antibody, which are subsequently recognized by a secondary antibody conjugated with an enzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP). For FRNA, incubation with an insoluble HRP substrate results in appearance of stained infected cell foci, which are then counted. For sICNA, incubation with a soluble HRP substrate results in the change of an optical density of the substrate solution, which is measured with a plate reader. The optical density is proportional to the number of infected cells in the monolayer. The neutralizing capacity of the serum is typically reported as the inverse of the serum dilution giving 50% reduction of virus infectivity. The sICNA is suitable for high-throughput quantitation of rubella-specific neutralizing antibody (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0200">200</link>). Following both vaccination of nonimmune individuals and postnatal rubella infection, the serum neutralizing capacity rises at least 100-fold, making it possible to confirm past exposure to rubella virus. Information on the precise assay used is required to quantitatively compare neutralization titers when assays are performed in different laboratories.</para>

However, in the United States, much of the testing is for assessing immunity to rubella, since health care providers should test all pregnant women for immunity by a serum IgG test at the earliest prenatal visit. There are slightly different criteria for rubella immunity that are recommended by various groups, with rubella IgG titers ranging from 10 to 15 IU/ml (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0176">176</link>).

Multiple negative controls and amplified product in more than one specimen from a given patient will increase confidence of a positive diagnosis based on direct RT-PCR. The significance of negative results is usually difficult to determine, since false-negativity rates are usually not available. Sequence variation in wild-type viruses, which can lead to poor primer binding and poor amplification, must be considered when negative results are evaluated. Nevertheless, when serum from a patient cannot be obtained, or when confirmation of serologic results is desired, direct detection of rubella virus RNA by RT-PCR should be performed.</para>

For example, when primary rubella virus infection is suspected in a pregnant woman, false positives and false negatives may lead to incorrect clinical decisions (<link linkend="ch0109s000000li0208">208</link>). Accurate interpretation of results is essential. Testing for recent infection with other viruses that cause similar clinical presentation (e.g., human parvovirus B19) is often prudent. Positive rubella results may be more reliable if no other infection is detected. Retesting of specimens and testing of different specimen types with alternative methods (e.g., serology and viral culture) (<link linkend="ch0109s000000a0063">Table 2</link>) often yield consistent interpretation of the results and reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis. False positives can occur even with IgM capture ELISA.

False negatives can often be identified by testing multiple specimens from a patient (e.g., sera collected 1 week apart). If only a single specimen is available, it may be tested by multiple assays.

Additionally, birth defects characteristic of CRS can occur for other reasons. Thus, the best classification of suspected postnatal rubella and CRS is based on laboratory results rather than clinical presentation. Classifications of a postnatal rubella case are categorized as suspected, probable, confirmed, or asymptomatic confirmed; for a case of congenital rubella, the categories are suspected CRS, probable CRS, confirmed CRS, and infection only. Positive laboratory results are required to correctly classify asymptomatic confirmed and confirmed cases of postnatal rubella and CRS.
