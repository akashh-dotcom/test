        <para id="ch0017s0000p0001">The current laboratory regulatory framework for accreditation in the United States began with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, which gave Congress oversight of reference laboratories involved in interstate commerce and hospital laboratories that served patients in the Medicare/Medicaid programs (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html">https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html</ulink>). These regulations mandated that the laboratories participate in state-approved or -operated proficiency testing (PT) programs and set standards for quality control (QC) and personnel competency. However, only 10% of clinical laboratories were required to meet federal standards under CLIA ’67 (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0044">1</link>) (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html">https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html</ulink>). In the late 1980s, however, a series of news media reports on laboratory errors in cytopathology amid revelations of poorly trained and compensated staff led Congress to take further action by passing the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA ’88) (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0045">2</link>) (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html">https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html</ulink>). Under CLIA ’88, a clinical laboratory is defined as “a facility for the examination of materials derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of health of, human beings. These examinations also include procedures to determine, measure, or otherwise describe the presence or absence of various substances or organisms in the body” (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html">https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html</ulink>). This legislation brought all laboratories perform-ing clinical testing, including physician offices, nursing homes, and health fairs, under the CLIA umbrella. After incorporation of many suggested changes, CLIA ’88 was published as the Final Rule on 28 February 1992 and again with amendments in April 2003. CLIA ’88 significantly increased oversight of all aspects of clinical laboratories and also stratified regulatory requirements based on technical complexity of tests performed.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0002">The CLIA program is administered by three agencies within the Department of Health and Human Ser-vices.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0003">(i) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS administers the CLIA program by registering laboratories, enforcing guidelines, performing surveys, and accrediting organizations that perform inspections. CLIA oversight extends to laboratory testing performed on all patients, not just Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. CMS also exempts states from CLIA if their requirements are determined to be equivalent to CLIA. Currently, New York State and Washington State regulations are deemed to be equivalent to CLIA.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0004">(ii) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC advises the Department of Health and Human Services on technical and scientific issues. This is accomplished through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee.</para>

      <para id="ch0017s0000p0006">Waived tests are procedures determined by the FDA to be simple enough to be cleared for home use with negligible risk of erroneous results and no reasonable risk of harm to the patient in the event of a testing error. Laboratories performing only waived testing need to maintain a valid CLIA certificate of waiver and ensure that they are following manufacturer’s instructions when performing testing. QC must be performed according to the package insert. Test results must be reported using the exact language from the FDA-cleared package insert. Inspections may occur in response to complaints or if laboratories are found to be performing nonwaived testing. CMS performs annual inspections of a small percentage of waived laboratories as part of an information-gathering and educational effort. This was initiated in response to initial findings that a large percentage of laboratories performing CLIA-waived testing did not follow manufacturer’s instructions (<ulink url="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-05-00-00251.pdf">https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-05-00-00251.pdf</ulink>).</para>

      <para id="ch0017s0000p0007">The CLIA ’88 requirements are more stringent for laboratories that perform moderate- or high-complexity testing. These laboratories must enroll in the CLIA program, pay appropriate fees, maintain QC processes, participate in external proficiency surveys from approved providers, comply with personnel requirements, and undergo biennial inspections by an accrediting agency. Laboratories performing high-complexity testing, such as laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) or modified versions of FDA-approved assays, are subject to more stringent requirements for personnel and quality management.</para>
      <para id="ch0017s0000p0008">Provider-performed microscopy (PPM) tests fall in the category of moderate complexity provided that they are performed by physicians, advanced practice providers (e.g., nurse practitioners or physician assistants) under the supervision of a physician, or dentists and are performed using a microscope (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0044">1</link>) (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html">https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html</ulink>).</para>

      <para id="ch0017s0000p0014">To maintain accreditation status, laboratories performing moderate- or high-complexity testing for patient care must undergo inspections every 2 years. Inspections are unannounced, since laboratories are expected to be constantly maintaining compliance rather than specifically preparing for scheduled inspections. The goal of the inspection process is not just to determine whether the laboratory is in compliance with regulatory requirements but also to educate the laboratory on opportunities to improve the quality of testing processes (<ulink url="https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/clia/interpretive_guidelines_for_laboratories.html">https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/clia/interpretive_guidelines_for_laboratories.html</ulink>). Inspectors are expected to have access to all physical areas of the laboratory as well as documentation and protocols pertaining to testing. The inspection includes review of personnel, training, and PT records. Inspectors may also inspect the quality assurance (QA) system and records of instrument verification and maintenance. Rather than limit themselves to the examination of documents and records, inspectors are encouraged to follow a specimen through the entire testing process and interact with testing personnel to gain a better understanding of laboratory processes and the effectiveness of personnel training. Unannounced inspections may also occur in the setting of allegations of misconduct or noncompliance.</para>
      <para id="ch0017s0000p0015">CLIA inspectors may cite the laboratory for deficiencies based on the nature of the noncompliance. Deficiencies may be either standard or condition level.</para>

Accrediting organizations such as the CAP and Joint Commission may choose to have required response periods for citations that are less than those of CMS. However, the laboratory may be determined to be in “immediate jeopardy” as defined in 42 CFR §493.2 if “a situation in which immediate corrective action is necessary because the laboratory’s noncompliance with one or more condition-level requirements has already caused, is causing, or is likely to cause, at any time, serious injury or harm, or death, to individuals served by the laboratory or to the health or safety of the general public.

As per 42 CFR 493, CMS may impose sanctions on a laboratory that is out of compliance. These include sus-pension, limitation, or revocation of the CLIA certificate, civil money penalties of up to $10,000 per day of noncompliance or per violation, criminal sanctions, and more (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html">https://www.cdc.gov/clia/law-regulations.html</ulink>).</para>

      <para id="ch0017s0000p0017">Outside the United States, regulatory requirements vary based on national requirements; however, laboratories looking for a common quality management-based accreditation system are increasingly adopting the medical laboratory-specific standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). ISO is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and its membership comprises the national standards bodies of 165 countries. ISO is more commonly known for developing standards to ensure the quality of products, services, or systems and is the largest international developer of standards (<ulink url="https://www.iso.org/home.html">https://www.iso.org/home.html</ulink>). The ISO 15189 standards for medical laboratories were developed at the request of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in 2003 by a technical committee (ISO/TC 212), with revisions in 2007 and 2012 (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0046">3</link>). The ISO standards cover different aspects of laboratory oversight, including quality management, pre- and postanalytical procedures, analytical test performance, laboratory safety, reference systems, and QA. The standards were developed via a consensus process including CLSI and technical organizations from 33 countries.</para>

      <beginpage pagenum="8"/>
      <para id="ch0017s0000p0018">Rather than focus on specific requirements and regulations, the primary focus of ISO accreditation is the development of a quality management system that implements a system of continuous improvement. This is accomplished by the identification, tracking, and categorization of defects within all stages of the testing process. This should be complemented by a pathway for determining the root cause, implementing corrective action, and monitoring the effectiveness of changes. Routine audits are required to ensure the effectiveness of the quality management system and to ensure that it adequately addresses defects and customer complaints. Because of these features, ISO 15189 complements other quality initiatives, such as Lean and Six Sigma (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0047">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0017s0000p0019">ISO accreditation differs from the CLIA program administered by CMS in that it provides the standards but does not certify that accredited laboratories meet those standards. Third-party organizations are responsible for accrediting laboratories using the ISO standards (<ulink url="https://www.iso.org/home.html">https://www.iso.org/home.html</ulink>). These third-party organizations reference best practices for assessment of compliance with ISO standards that are developed by the ISO Committee on Conformity Assessment. ISO recommends that accrediting organizations rely on the Committee on Conformity Assessment standards and are accredited themselves by the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) (<ulink url="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification.html">http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification.html</ulink>). Accreditation by ILAC is not a requirement for ISO certification, and major organizations, such as the CAP, that now offer ISO accreditation are not accredited under the ILAC umbrella (<ulink url="https://www.cap.org">https://www.cap.org</ulink>). Laboratories may choose to be ISO accredited by non-ILAC-accredited organizations, such as the CAP, or by ILAC-accredited organizations (<ulink url="https://www.ilac.org">https://www.ilac.org</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0017s0000p0020">Although ISO accreditation is now offered in the United States by organizations such as the CAP, it does not serve as a surrogate for CLIA regulatory requirements. ISO inspections typically occur on a 3-year cycle, with the laboratory undergoing surveillance inspections the first 2 years followed by a full reaccreditation inspection in the third year (<ulink url="http://www.iso.org">www.iso.org</ulink>). While laboratory accreditation inspectors under CLIA typically focus on the technical competence of the laboratory, ISO inspectors may assess the technical competence as well as the quality management system, with a specific focus on the system of continuous improvement (<ulink url="https://www.cap.org">https://www.cap.org</ulink>, <ulink url="https://www.a2la.org">https://www.a2la.org</ulink>, <ulink url="https://www.iso.org/home.html">https://www.iso.org/home.html</ulink>).</para>

        <para id="ch0017s0000p0024">QC is an element of the quality management system that assesses processes and detects analytical errors. QC consists of the selection and incorporation of suitable QC materials, the establishment of criteria for acceptable performance, the development of schedules for performing QC, and the documentation and assessment of QC records. Unacceptable results from QC testing are examples of nonconforming events that require investigation and corrective action. Control procedures must detect errors due to test system failure (including operator performance) or to adverse environmental conditions. QC must also track over time the accuracy and precision of test performance. Unless a laboratory has an individualized QC plan (IQCP) for a test system, procedures must have QC performed each day of patient testing or as specified by the test manufacturer if more frequent than once each day. Generally speaking, quantitative procedures require at minimum a negative control and two positive control materials of different concentrations, and qualitative procedures require a negative and a positive control. For tests that produce titration results (e.g., rapid plasma reagin, immunofluorescence assays, etc.), the positive control must have titrated reactivity, with acceptable performance usually within one 2-fold dilution. For tests that include an extraction phase (most molecular procedures), one of the control materials must be subjected to the extraction phase. Additionally, for molecular methods, at least one of the control materials must be able to detect inhibition of nucleic acid amplification (such as the use of an internal control). Each batch, lot number, and shipment of reagents, stains, media, and test kits must be checked. There are certain exceptions to these requirements for daily QC and QC of new lots and shipments of materials, and these are explained in the section on IQCP below. QC testing must be performed and reviewed after performance of significant maintenance on an instrument or replacement of any important part of the test system, including reagents. All QC procedures must be documented, including corrective action taken when control results are unacceptable. Additional and detailed QC requirements are described in appropriate regulations. It is incumbent upon the laboratory personnel to be aware of and compliant with these regulations.</para>

        <para id="ch0017s0000p0025">CLIA ’67 set guidelines regulating laboratories that performed Medicare billing and/or engaged in interstate commerce to adhere to QC, PT, test performance, and personnel standards. CLIA ’88 consisted of new regulations for personnel standards, specimen management, QC, PT, and QA for all entities performing laboratory testing. Fifteen years later, in 2003, CMS published their Quality Systems Regulations, which updated all QC requirements. This update included what CMS referred to as “equivalent QC testing,” or EQC. EQC reduced the burden and cost of QC for diagnostic laboratories, was an alternative to CLIA default QC (two levels of controls each day of patient testing), and gave laboratories the option of using both external and internal controls in their total QC testing process. In 2011, CLSI, as requested by CMS, developed a QC evaluation protocol that was published in their document EP23, Labor-atory Quality Control Based on Risk Management (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0050">7</link>). This document uses a risk assessment approach to the management of policies, procedures, and practices for the tasks of analyzing, evaluating, controlling, and monitoring risk. CMS incorporated the key concepts of CLSI document EP23 into the CLIA Interpretive Guidelines, and in 2014, CMS announced that laboratories could either comply with CLIA default QC or develop an individualized quality control plan (IQCP) (<ulink url="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Individualized_Quality_Control_Plan_IQCP.html">https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Individualized_Quality_Control_Plan_IQCP.html</ulink>). These two options applied to all nonwaived tests and became effective 1 January 2016. Although the revised CLIA Interpretive Guidelines released in May 2015 contained no references to CLSI, it should be noted that clinical microbiology laboratories can still use the CLSI guidelines and EQC as components of an IQCP.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0026">CMS states that IQCP is a flexible QC option that provides the opportunity to tailor QC to unique testing environments and patients and will establish the appropriate quality practices which will reduce the likelihood of errors occurring in the laboratory. Developing an IQCP involves a review of the entire testing process, beginning with specimen collection (preanalytical) and continuing through the analysis of the specimen (analytical) until the final test result is reported (postanalytical). There are three components to an IQCP: risk assessment, quality control plan (QCP), and quality assessment. Five components (specimen, test system, reagents, environment, and testing personnel) must be evaluated in the risk assessment as part of the IQCP for each test system and must also include an assessment of the frequency of occurrence and impact of possible laboratory errors. The frequency of errors can be determined by reviewing historical data, but the accurate determination of patient harm resulting from these errors is highly variable. A strong, well-documented QCP will establish control procedures that reduce the likelihood of providing an inaccurate patient test result. Before implementation, the QCP must be signed and dated by the named CLIA laboratory director before patient results are reported. It should be noted that for IQCP, the QC defined by the QCP cannot be less than that recommended by the manufacturer.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0027">Last, the quality assessment should be designed to ensure and actively monitor the effectiveness of the QCP. As part of quality assessment, if the laboratory discovers a testing process failure or error, it must conduct and document an investigation to identify the cause of the failure/error, perform a risk assessment, and make appropriate modifications to the QCP to control this failure/error going forward. Examples of microbiology IQCPs, developed as a joint effort of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), the CAP, and the CLSI, can be found on the ASM website (<ulink url="http://www.asm.org">www.asm.org</ulink>). It is also of note that as of 2016 the CAP, holding deemed status as an accreditation agency for CMS, now includes requirements for IQCP in their in-spection checklists.

In April 2003, the CDC and CMS published final CLIA Quality Systems laboratory regulations. According to CMS, PT is the testing of unknown samples sent to a laboratory by a CMS-approved PT program (<ulink url="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Proficiency_">https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Proficiency_</ulink>&#13;
Testing_Providers). Most regulated PT surveys are sent to participating laboratories three times per year and usually include five challenges per event. After testing the PT samples in the same manner as patient specimens, the laboratory reports its results back to its PT program provider. A listing of CLIA-approved accreditation organizations/PT providers as of 2020 can be found at <ulink url="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Downloads/ptlist.pdf">https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Downloads/ptlist.pdf</ulink>. Some accreditation organizations, such as the CAP, require laboratories to participate in PT for more than just the CLIA-regulated analytes. New York State and Washington State have exempt status under CLIA because their requirements are judged to be at least as stringent as CLIA regulations. New York requires laboratories to use its internal PT program, while Washington allows laboratories to use any CMS-approved PT program. Approved PT pro-grams grade results using CLIA grading criteria and send the laboratory scores reflecting how accurately it performed the testing. Laboratories must get at least four of the five (80%) challenges correct for the event to be considered satisfactory. CMS and accreditation organizations routinely monitor laboratories’ performance.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0030">PT is not required for waived tests. A list of waived tests is available at<ulink url="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfClia/testswaived.cfm">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfClia/testswaived.cfm</ulink>. PT is required for “regulated” analytes found in Subpart I, Proficiency Testing Programs for Nonwaived Testing of the CLIA Regulations. PT is required for each separate CLIA-certified laboratory (excluding laboratories with only a certificate of waiver). PT samples must be tested in the same manner as patient specimens, meaning testing the same number of times as patient specimens, at the same time as patient specimens, by the same personnel that routinely perform the testing, and using the same test system that is routinely used for the patient specimens. It is important to know that with some PT samples, preparation may be necessary or may differ from how patient specimens are handled before testing. However, after preparation, PT samples must be treated in the same manner as patient specimens. In addition, a laboratory must never send a PT sample to another laboratory for any reason, and this too may differ from the normal laboratory process used for patient specimens. Likewise, PT results must never be discussed with other laboratories until the due date for submis-sion has passed. Copies of PT results must be maintained for a minimum of 2 years from the date of the PT event, and any documentation of corrective actions taken as a result of an unsatisfactory score must also be maintained for 2 years.</para>

        <para id="ch0017s0000p0032">The mechanism for scoring challenges depends on whether the analyte is qualitative or quantitative. For qualitative challenges, the participant result must match the correct result, which is determined by the overall participant consensus or may be established by a group of at least 10 referee laboratories selected by the PT program. A minimum of 80% consensus is required to grade a challenge. For quantitative results (those reported in numerical values), the correct response may be set using the overall average of participant responses (after removal of outliers), or it may be established by a minimum of 10 referee laboratories. Quantitative analytes are not graded if there is not at least 80% agreement within the criteria for acceptable performance as specified in CLIA regulations.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0033">If a laboratory does not achieve at least 80% on the survey, its performance is considered unsatisfactory. There are no sanctions if the laboratory has an occasional unsatisfactory PT event for a specific analyte. However, unsuccessful participation is defined as any of the following: (i) unsatisfactory performance for the same analyte in two consecutive or two of three PT events, (ii) repeated unsatisfactory overall testing event scores for two consecutive or two of three PT events for the same specialty or subspecialty, or (iii) unsatisfactory testing event scores for subspecialties not graded by analyte (that is, bacteriology, mycobacteriology, virology, parasitology, and mycology) for the same subspecialty for two consecutive or two of three PT events. Repeated unsuccessful PT performance for the same analyte, subspecialty, or specialty may result in the laboratory no longer being allowed to perform testing for a period of 6 months. If a laboratory has been made to cease testing due to unsuccessful PT performance, to return to routine patient testing it must first demonstrate that it has identified the reason for the unsuccessful perfor-mance, has corrected this deficiency, and has complete documentation of this process. The laboratory must also obtain two successful consecutive reinstatement PT survey test results for the analyte, subspecialty, or specialty in question.</para>

        <para id="ch0017s0000p0036">U.S. federal regulations require that diagnostic laboratories verify (term used by CLSI, the CAP, and CMS) (CLSI QMS01-A4, CLIA brochure “Verification of Performance Specifications” [<ulink url="https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/clia/clia_brochures.html">https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/clia/clia_brochures.html</ulink>]) the performance characteristics of FDA-approved or -cleared laboratory tests prior to the initial reporting of patient results. These test performance characteristics usually include accuracy (the ability to generate a correct result), reproducibility or precision (the ability to generate the same or comparable results repeatedly), and reportable and reference (normal) ranges (<anchor id="ch0017s0000a0029"/><link linkend="ch0017s0000a0030">Table 2</link>). For many microbiology laboratory tests, the reportable range is simply “positive” or “detected.” CLIA regulations state that the laboratory must verify that it can produce correct positive test results at both low and high levels of analyte. The reference range for many microbiology laboratory tests is “negative” or “not detected.” CLIA regulations require that laboratories verify that the manufacturer’s reference intervals are appropriate for the laboratory’s patient population. Additional performance characteristics for quantitative tests such as viral load assays include linearity (the ability of a test [within a given range] to obtain results that are directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample) and analytical measurement range (the range over which a test generates accurate and reliable results). These performance characteristics are relevant for both molecular detection methods and nonmolecular methods. The intent of these regulations is to demonstrate that the test performs as per the manufacturer’s expectations within each laboratory. This process is not intended to duplicate extensive multisite clinical evaluations; rather, with an appropriately assembled panel of specimens, a laboratory can verify test accuracy, reproducibility, reference and reportable ranges, and any other relevant characteristics with a small amount of resources and time.</para>

Appropriately, more data are required to establish performance characteristics in a validation study (<link linkend="ch0017s0000a0030">Table 2</link>). The prevailing opinion, if not outright regulation, is that more specimens should be tested to establish performance characteristics than are required to verify performance characteristics of an FDA-approved test (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0053">10</link>). Regulations state that the laboratory director should determine the appropriate size of the verification study. While a panel consisting of 20 specimens may be sufficient to verify the accuracy of an unmodified FDA-approved or -cleared test, a panel consisting of significantly more specimens may be needed to establish accuracy (including diagnostic sensitivity and specificity) of an LDT or significantly modified test (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0052">9</link>). In addition to accuracy, precision, and reportable and reference ranges, laboratories are required to determine the limit of detection (analytical sensitivity), as well as analytical specificity and in-terfering substances (components present in patient specimens that can produce false-negative and false-positive test results) of modified tests and LDTs (<link linkend="ch0017s0000a0030">Table 2</link>).</para>

A complete test system usually consists of reagents, quality controls, instrumentation (if applicable), and the operator who performs the test.</para>

One of the essential elements to ensure high-quality test results for patients is laboratory employee training and competency. CLIA ’88 mandates performance and documentation of initial employee training and ongoing assessment of competency to ensure that prior to testing patients’ specimens, all personnel have the appropriate education and experience, receive the appropriate training for the type and complexity of the services offered, and demonstrate that they can perform all testing operations reliably to provide and report accurate results (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0054">11</link>) (<ulink url="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1248e3189da5e5f936e55315402bc38b&amp;node=pt42.5.493&amp;rgn=div5#sp42.5.493.m">https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1248e3189da5e5f936e55315402bc38b&amp;node=pt42.5.493&amp;rgn=div5#sp42.5.493.m</ulink>).</para>

CLIA ’88 does not give particular guidance for initial training, and it is ultimately up to the laboratory director to ensure that all employees are appropriately trained prior to releasing patient results.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0041">The CAP states in its general checklist that there must be records showing that all staff have satisfactorily completed initial training on all instruments/methods applicable to their designated job. It notes that records must show that training specifically applies to the testing performed by each individual. It also states that retraining must occur when problems are identified with employee performance. The CAP also requires that personnel files be maintained on all current technical personnel and that these records include, among other items, a summary of training and experience for the employee and a description of his/her current duties and responsibilities, procedures the individual is authorized to perform, whether supervision is required for specimen processing, test performance, or result reporting, and whether supervisory or director review is required to report patient results.</para>

This document also indicates that training should not only cover training for technical job duties but also include areas of safety, ethics, computer, compliance, and quality.

        <para id="ch0017s0000p0043">Training of personnel is not the same as competency assessment, and documentation of training does not satisfy the requirement for competency assessment. Training occurs before someone begins testing, and competency assessment confirms that the individual is doing the testing correctly. The Code of Federal Regulations states that the technical supervisor is responsible for evaluating the competency of all testing personnel and for ensuring that the staff maintain their competency to perform test procedures and report test results promptly, accurately, and proficiently (<ulink url="http://laboratory-manager.advanceweb.com/competency-assessment/">http://laboratory-manager.advanceweb.com/competency-assessment/</ulink>). Competency assessment, as defined by CLIA ’88, outlines six areas that must be included as part of a laboratory competency assessment program: (i) direct observation of routine patient test performance; (ii) monitoring the recording and reporting of test results; (iii) review of intermediate test results, QC records, PT results, and preventive maintenance records; (iv) direct observation of performance of instrument maintenance and function checks; (v) assessment of test performance through testing previously analyzed specimens, internal blind testing samples, or external PT samples; and (vi) assessment of problem-solving skills. Competency assessment is a means to confirm that training is effective and that personnel are competent to perform laboratory testing. According to CLIA ’88, the competency of testing personnel must be assessed semiannually for the first year of patient testing and annually thereafter. Competency must also be demonstrated and documented whenever new testing methods, kits, and/or instruments are added to the laboratory’s test menu. Competency assessment for all tests performed simultaneously on the same testing platform may be com-bined; however, any test with unique aspects within the same testing platform should be assessed separately.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0044">Competency assessment is not limited to testing personnel but is also required for individuals fulfilling the following personnel responsibilities as outlined in subpart M of the CLIA regulations: clinical consultant, technical consultant, technical supervisor, and general supervisor. Clinical consultants, technical consultants, technical supervisors, and general supervisors who perform testing on patient specimens are required to have the six required areas in their competency assessment. Ultimately, the laboratory director is responsible for ensuring that all testing personnel are competent and maintain their competency in order to perform and report accurate and reliable test results. The competency of laboratory directors is not assessed directly, since they are held to additional standards and criteria to confirm that they are fulfilling the responsibilities of their positions.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0045">Since CLIA does not specifically define how to perform competency assessment, it is acceptable to utilize many methods which work best for the laboratory. Quizzes, checklists, document reviews, PT, and other tools can be used, as long as all of the six areas are addressed. However, when the CLIA requirement specifies “direct observation,” then this must be done. For competency assessments, the assessor must sign and date the assessment documentation at the time of the evaluation.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0046">As stated above, competency assessments must be documented, and this documentation must be maintained in personnel files. The documentation must state whether competency was demonstrated and what corrective actions were taken if competency was not demonstrated. Performance and documentation of remediation constitute a critical component of the competency assessment process. Unless an employee has been deliberately negligent in the performance of his/her work, corrective action should be educational and aim to improve performance.</para>

        <para id="ch0017s0000p0048">CLIA ’88 came into being in part because of media reports of a number of major errors in cytology laboratories which caused significant patient harm (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0045">2</link>). The Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) 2015 report on errors in medicine further shone the spotlight on the impact of errors on patient care (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0057">14</link>). The IOM report stated that diagnostic errors cause about 10% of all patient deaths and about 17% of adverse events. When taking into consideration that 70% of health care decision-making relies on laboratory results, it is reasonable to speculate that laboratory errors contribute to a significant proportion of those errors (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0058">15</link>). The IOM report emphasized that errors were due to system defects rather than individual issues. Despite this, there is an absence of a clear strategy to define, characterize, track, and reduce errors within laboratory medicine. Errors may occur at any stage of the total testing process (TTP), which encompasses every step from selection and ordering of the appropriate test to result reporting and interpretation. This is complicated by the number of personnel with various levels of training involved at different points of the process (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0059">16</link>). While the laboratory is generally considered responsible for the TTP, in reality, only the analytical phase of TTP is often directly under laboratory oversight. Laboratory-based quality initiatives tend to focus on errors in the analytical phase that fall within the laboratory domain while ignoring pre- and postanalytical phases. However, studies by clinical chemists have demonstrated that 70% of errors occurred in the preanalytical phase. The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals’ laboratory patient safety goals as of 2017 emphasize pre- and postanalytical facets of laboratory testing, such as reduction of misidentifications and timely reporting of critical values (<ulink url="https://www.jointcommission.org/lab_2017_npsgs/">https://www.jointcommission.org/lab_2017_npsgs/</ulink>).</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0049">While there has been a significant reduction in the incidence of errors over time in clinical chemistry laboratories (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0060">17</link>), data suggest that analytical errors, which represent only 15% of total errors, can have an adverse impact on patient care in 24 to 30% of cases (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0059">16</link>–<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0061">18</link>). Data on the incidence and impact of errors in clinical microbiology are limited. Yuan et al. showed that 6.7% of corrected microbiology reports had adverse clinical impact (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0062">19</link>). There are, however, no comprehensive multicenter studies on the incidence of errors in clinical microbiology. The incidence of Gram stain errors has been documented, but this does not address the TTP in microbiology laboratories (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0063">20</link>). The current manual nature of microbiology specimen processing coupled with the subjective nature of Gram stain and culture interpretation leads to difficulties in standardization of processes and increased likelihood of errors. The risk of errors is further increased by the lack of understanding by nonlaboratory personnel of the factors that can contribute to laboratory errors and their potentially severe impact on patient care. This includes preanalytical errors such as inappropriate test selection and incorrect specimen or collection device. The inherent delays in the testing process—which are especially relevant to microbiology due to required incubation times for cultures—contribute to the failure to recognize and document these errors. In addition, there are no clear guidelines on the definition or classifi-cation of errors in the clinical microbiology laboratory. This lack of standardization can hamper laboratories’ efforts at comparing their performance against their peers.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0050">The ISO 15189:2012 medical laboratory standards include a clause regarding the role of the laboratory in monitoring and addressing the incidence of errors. It states, “The laboratory shall evaluate the impact of work processes and potential failures on examination results as they affect patient safety, and shall modify processes to reduce or eliminate the identified risks and document decisions and actions taken” (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0046">3</link>). It strongly emphasizes the need for the quality management system to address both corrective and preventive actions to reduce errors, including a documented process to address nonconformities at all stages of the testing process. Corrective actions may be undertaken using the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle (<anchor id="ch0017s0000a0037"/><link linkend="ch0017s0000a0041">Fig. 3</link>) (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0064">21</link>). The use of the PDCA cycle allows for determination of root cause as well as monitoring the impact of corrective measures and determining whether additional interventions are required.</para>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0051">In addition to ISO 15189, the technical specification ISO/TS 22367, released by ISO in 2008, describes the process of preventive action via risk management within the framework of ISO 15189 as an approach to reducing laboratory errors (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0065">22</link>). ISO/TS 22367 describes a laboratory error as “failure of planned action to be completed as intended or use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim, occurring at any part of the laboratory cycle, from ordering examinations to reporting results and appropriately interpreting and reacting to them.” As per ISO/TS 22367, laboratories can use risk management to identify and stratify errors by incidence and severity using a risk matrix (<anchor id="ch0017s0000a0038"/><link linkend="ch0017s0000a0042">Table 3</link>) (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0065">22</link>). This analysis should extend across all aspects of the testing cycle, from test selection to result reporting and interpretation. The process of risk analysis requires the following:</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para id="ch0017s0000p0052">Once potential gaps in the process have been identified based on incidence and severity, the next steps should follow the PDCA cycle. The first step would be to develop an appropriate monitor to track incidence over time. Corrective measures can then be put in place and the impact monitored at regular intervals to determine resolution. Laboratories should frequently assess the effectiveness of their risk management strategy by internal audits and should avoid relying on single or multiple metrics monitored without specific goals. When set goals have been achieved, laboratories should revert to risk assessment to identify additional gaps in the process as part of a continuous improvement process. Over time, this process should have an accretive effect in improving the quality of laboratory results.</para>

        <para id="ch0017s0000p0053">The FDA defines LDTs as tests intended for clinical use that are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. Many clinical and public health laboratories use these tests. In many cases, LDTs are used out of clinical necessity, as FDA-cleared or -approved tests are not available. Historically, the FDA has generally not enforced oversight of LDTs because of their relative simplicity and limited availability, but during the last two decades, LDTs have become more complex, and their use has increased rapidly, including in high-risk applications (largely outside the infectious disease setting). The FDA has expressed its concerns about the absence of appropriate control procedures for some LDTs and intended-use claims that lack adequate evidence (<ulink url="https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/InVitroDiagnostics/LaboratoryDevelopedTests/default.htm">https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/InVitroDiagnostics/LaboratoryDevelopedTests/default.htm</ulink>). As a result, in 2010 the FDA announced its intent to reconsider its policy of enforcement discretion for LDTs. In October 2014, the FDA released its draft guidance on regulation of LDTs. The FDA’s position in the draft guidance is that it possesses (since 1976) the legal authority to regulate all diagnostic tests, both manufactured test kits and LDTs. The FDA draft guidance describes a risk-based approach to LDT regulation in which high-risk LDTs would be first to be regulated, followed by moderate-risk-test oversight to be phased in over a 9-year period. The timeline for a risk-based approach to implementation of FDA oversight of LDTs is presented in <anchor id="ch0017s0000a0044"/><link linkend="ch0017s0000a0046">Table 4</link>. The draft guidance immediately generated controversy, with manufacturers of <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic devices generally in favor of FDA regulation of LDTs and clinical laboratories opposed.</para>

        <para id="ch0017s0000p0054">Organizations representing clinical laboratories, laboratory professionals, and infectious disease physicians have published position statements against the proposed regulations on the grounds that they will restrict diagnostic innovation, limit access to testing, and be disadvantageous to the practice of medicine (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0066">23</link>). As written, the draft guidance would require (with few exceptions) that LDTs be registered as devices with the FDA and be subject to medical device reporting. High-risk (class III) LDTs would require premarket application (PMA), and moderate-risk (class II) LDTs would require a 510(k) premarket review. Even modified tests (also referred to as “off label” use), including modification of specimen types, would need to be submitted to the FDA for premarket review under the FDA proposed draft guidance. Societies representing laboratory professionals, such as ASM, and infectious disease specialists have taken the position that infectious disease LDTs, essential for optimal patient care, have a long history of providing reliable results and can be safely regulated by other approaches (<link linkend="ch0017s0000li0066">23</link>). These approaches are predicated on the appropriate classification of infectious disease LDTs as moderate or low risk. CMS under CLIA ’88 would have statutory authority to oversee low- and moderate-risk LDTs. Additionally, it has been proposed that exemptions for unmet medical needs be further expanded and that modified specimen types be exempt from FDA oversight if there is an unmet need or if the modified specimen type is unlikely to change a patient’s diagnosis or therapy (referred to as meaningful clinical impact).</para>

      <para id="ch0017s0000p0055">The Project BioShield Act of 2004 provided the FDA commissioner the authority to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of unapproved medical devices and products or unapproved uses of approved devices during biological and other events. This authority was further defined through subsequent legislation, including the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act (PAHPRA) in 2013, which enhanced the FDA’s authority to foster the development of medical products and devices for use during public health emergencies (<ulink url="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/mcm-related-counterterrorism-legislation#bioshield">https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/mcm-related-counterterrorism-legislation#bioshield</ulink>).

EUAs terminate when the public health emergency determination expires. For example, the EUA for influenza A virus subtype H1N1pmd09 expired on 23 June 2010 (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/H1N1flu/EUA/pdf/CDC_IVD.pdf">https://www.cdc.gov/H1N1flu/EUA/pdf/CDC_IVD.pdf</ulink>). The FDA may elect to exercise enforcement discretion for such devices if they were already within clinical laboratory inventories prior to the EUA expiration date. Upon expiration of the EUA, manufacturers must cease further distribution of EUA-labeled product or obtain FDA clearance or approval for their device.</para>

      <para id="ch0017s0000p0056">Tests that have received EUA are classified as IVDs, just like tests that have gone through other FDA regulatory pathways such as 510(k) and premarket approval. However, there are some important distinctions between EUA and FDA-cleared or approved IVDs. Users must follow the instructions for use under the EUA; off-label use is not permitted without a separate EUA covering that specific off-label use. EUA IVDs are generally subject to the same QA requirements as other IVDs (test method verification, proficiency testing, etc.). Users must perform external quality control at least as frequently as specified in the instructions for use. CMS has stated that IQCP is not generally applicable to EUA IVDs (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2020/cms_iqcp_clarification_for_eua_tests.html">https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2020/cms_iqcp_clarification_for_eua_tests.html</ulink>).

        <para id="ch0017s0000p0057">The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has stretched the boundaries of laboratory testing far beyond the walls of the laboratory and our oversight for monitoring the quality of specimen collection and testing. Antigen tests and tests utilizing nucleic acid amplification are now available for use at the point of care. At the time of writing, several at-home specimen collection kits for SARS-CoV-2 testing and at least two at-home SARS-CoV-2 tests have received FDA EUA. It appears increasingly likely that these will become widely available for at-home testing in the near future. The current regulatory framework will need to adapt to ensure the quality of such testing. Additional safeguards will need to be put in place to ensure that results are accurately communicated to care providers and that patients receive adequate guidance on the interpretation of test results.</para>
