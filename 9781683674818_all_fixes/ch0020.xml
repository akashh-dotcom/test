      <para id="ch0020s0000p0001">Clinical microbiology laboratories play an essential role in establishing an etiologic diagnosis for sepsis and bloodstream infection. Because mortality from bacteremia and fungemia remains high, the rapid, accurate, and reliable identification of patients with bloodstream infection is critical. Diagnosis requires multiple steps, including one or more blood cultures drawn from different sites, recovery and identification of microorganisms detected in blood culture, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of clinically significant organisms, and interpretation of results in conjunction with other clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings. Ultimately, blood culture results guide antimicrobial therapy, hospitalization, subsequent surgical and radiological procedures, removal of vascular access lines, and other clinical interventions. The goal of this chapter is to provide a summary of the clinical importance of bacteremia and fungemia, the scientific and medical principles underlying current diagnostic methods, a summary of diagnostic approaches, and a brief review of tests that are emerging as potential additions to or replacements for culture-based methods.</para>

        <para id="ch0020s0000p0002">Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0003">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0004">2</link>). It is a significant cause of mortality worldwide. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimated that there were 48.9 million sepsis cases and 11 million sepsis-related deaths worldwide in 2017. Mortality rates for hospitalized patients with sepsis are &gt;10% and increase to &gt;40% for patients with septic shock (sepsis 3), and rates vary widely based on access to health care, resources available, and how the clinical condition of sepsis is defined or coded into the system (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0005">3</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0007">5</link>). The rising incidence of cases has been attributed to several factors: an aging patient population; larger populations with comorbidities; increasing rates of invasive procedures, immunosuppression, and organ transplantation; increasing rates of multidrug-resistant organisms; and potentially even increasing recognition of sepsis as a condition (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0004">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0008">6</link>). The terms “sepsis” and “bacteremia” are often used interchangeably, and there is no simple definition or single laboratory test to identify a patient with sepsis. Not all patients with sepsis have bacteremia, with less than half of septic patients having microorganisms recovered from the blood (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0009">7</link>), but patients with bacteremia have higher rates of septic shock than those who do not (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0010">8</link>). Etiologic agents of sepsis and bacteremia most frequently originate from respiratory and abdominal tract infections but also include organisms from skin and soft tissue infection and urinary tract infection (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0011">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0012">10</link>). Regardless of the terms, the recommendations for patients who are septic and/or symptomatically bacteremic are the same: blood for cultures should be drawn prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and de-escalation of therapy should occur once an etiologic agent and its AST profile are identified (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0003">1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0003">Determining which patients have bacteremia or fungemia, subsequent isolation and identification of pathogens, and determination of their AST profiles are the most important objectives for use of blood cultures as a diagnostic test. The identity of pathogens and the pattern of recovery from blood cultures provide important diagnostic clues as to the location and type of infection. There are strong associations between sites of infection and which pathogens are recovered from the bloodstream (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0009">7</link>), and these observations can provide critical information to health care providers as to the nature of the infection. Recent studies have shown that the organisms most frequently isolated from patients with true bacteremia are <emphasis>Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>, coagulase-negative staphylococci, <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella</emphasis> species, <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> species, <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Enterobacter</emphasis> species.

        <para id="ch0020s0000p0004">No method has been shown to be the ultimate standard for detection of bacteria or fungi in blood. Because the clinical presentation of patients with bacteremia or fungemia is so varied, clinical signs and symptoms alone cannot be used as a standard against which blood culture performance can be assessed. Moreover, there are no other laboratory tests (or combination of tests) that can serve as a surrogate gold standard, including recently developed molecular assays. It was long expected that molecular methods would improve sensitivity for the detection of bacteremia or fungemia, and although molecular methods have improved or enhanced diagnostic capabilities (reviewed below), significant limitations remain. Even with the use of current blood culture systems, use of optimal methods for collecting blood specimens, and limiting collection of blood specimens to patients with a high pretest probability for bacteremia or fungemia, only 8 to 12% of blood cultures yield microorganisms (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0015">13</link>), and in many hospitals, a significant proportion of positive blood cultures yield contaminating skin microbiota (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0016">14</link>). Several factors likely contribute to the overall low positivity rates: (i) low pretest probability of disease; (ii) inadequate volume of blood cultured; (iii) patients receiving empiric antimicrobial therapy at the time blood specimens are collected, thereby reducing the yield from blood cultures; (iv) the possibility that patients may have temporarily cleared microorganisms from their bloodstream or demonstrate intermittent shedding of microorganisms into the bloodstream from the nidus of infection; (v) mishandling of specimens (e.g., delay in incubation); (vi) the inability of some microorganisms to be recovered adequately with broth-based blood cultures; and (vii) the number of (concentration of) microorganisms in a given specimen too low to be recovered by current methods (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0005">In the absence of a definitive reference standard, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a blood culture cannot be determined, and only estimates can be made. A small number of studies have addressed this question directly (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0018">16</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0021">19</link>). However, these are older studies (published between 1975 and 2000), and their results should be interpreted in light of the following limitations: (i) the studies used different blood culture systems; (ii) different volumes of blood were cultured; (iii) the relative distribution of pathogenic species changed during this time; (iv) different classes of antimicrobial agents were in use; (v) this period was one in which a large number of intravenous devices, implants, and prostheses were introduced and later used widely; and (vi) the study designs were different. A summary of the results from two of the more recent studies (published after 2000) is shown in <anchor id="ch0020s0000a0006"/><link linkend="ch0020s0000a0007">Table 1</link>.</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0006">One approach to establishing accuracy/sensitivity for laboratory tests or clinical approaches for detection of microorganisms in blood has been to use composite standards, for example, using a combination of results from different assays. This type of analysis is problematic for several reasons. First, comparison of one assay against itself as part of a gold standard is statistically biased. Second, a “combined” gold standard that uses multiple assays results is a challenging and impractical study design for future evaluations. Because assays change over time, are discontinued or introduced, and may require specific instrumentation, this approach results in a continually evolving standard, which often cannot be replicated by multiple sites. Despite their challenges, blood cultures remain the imperfect gold standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of bacteremia and fungemia.</para>

      <title>Indications for Ordering Blood Cultures</title>

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0008">In many hospitals, blood culture is one of the most frequently ordered microbiology tests (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0022">20</link>). Due to the high mortality rates associated with sepsis and bacteremia/fungemia, there is often a low threshold for ordering blood cultures. Overutilization of blood cultures in patients with a low pretest probability increases the likelihood of recovering contaminating organisms and producing false-positive results, which can lead to the possibility of unnecessary treatment and diagnostic procedures (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0016">14</link>). Including clinical indication and pretest probability of positivity in diagnostic algorithms for ordering blood cultures can help to optimize blood culture as a diagnostic test and improve the positivity rate (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0022">20</link>). Optimizing ordering practices to obtain blood cultures for patients with conditions that are associated with a higher pretest probability of positivity (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0009">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0023">21</link>) is consistent with recent studies and guidelines that support a selective approach to initial ordering of blood cultures based on clinical and laboratory findings (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0009">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0015">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0024">22</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0028">26</link>). In general, patients in the ambulatory setting, including pediatric patients, have a low pretest probability of having a positive blood culture (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0015">13</link>). Patients with uncomplicated cellulitis and patients admitted to the hospital with community-acquired pneumonia, including pediatric patients, also have a low (&lt;10%) pretest probability of having a positive blood culture (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0029">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0030">28</link>). Patients with pyelonephritis and cholangitis have a moderate pretest probability (20 to 50%) (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0031">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0032">30</link>) and patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, infective endocarditis, septic arthritis, catheter-related bloodstream infections, or acute bacterial meningitis have a high pretest probability of bacteremia (&gt;50%) (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0015">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0033">31</link>). Patients with intravascular foci of infection, such as infective endocarditis, typically have persistent bacteremia, and all blood cultures in a series frequently yield the pathogen (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0019">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0026">24</link>). Other indications for obtaining blood cultures include unexplained leukocytosis, febrile neutropenia, and complicated pneumonia or skin and soft tissue infection (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>). Fever alone, apart from other factors such as leukocytosis or comorbid risk factors, is a poor predictor of bacteremia (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0015">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0034">32</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0009">The use of “surveillance” blood cultures, meaning blood cultures carried out in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms in an attempt to prospectively detect bacteremia or fungemia, has been most extensively studied in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and multiple studies have shown little or no benefit to the practice (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0035">33</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0037">35</link>). The practice has also been studied in critically ill patients and again has been shown to be of little or no clinical benefit (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0038">36</link>). The same is generally true for test-of-cure or repeat blood cultures: most patients with uncomplicated infections causing bacteremia do not benefit from additional blood cultures (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>). The utility of repeat blood cultures depends on the clinical condition of the patient as well as the corresponding pathogen, and there are specific indications where repeat blood cultures are beneficial and should be done. These indications include patients who have <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> bacteremia, endovascular infection such as infective endocarditis (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0039">37</link>), catheter-related infections, or infections caused by Gram-negative multidrug-resistant microorganisms (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0040">38</link>). Additional blood cultures are also recommended for patients with candidemia (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0041">39</link>). Patients with bloodstream infection and infective endocarditis caused by <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> may remain bacteremic for several days after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Additional blood cultures are recommended 2 to 4 days after initial positive cultures until clearance of the organism to establish an endpoint for treatment (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0042">40</link>). In contrast, studies have demonstrated that additional blood cultures may not add value in the management of bloodstream infection with non-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and viridans group streptococci.

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0010">For adults and older children, venipuncture of veins in the antecubital fossae is recommended, and blood should be collected sequentially from two separate venipuncture sites. Although the practice is common, collection of blood through indwelling vascular access lines should be avoided when possible, and especially in patients with prosthetic valves or implanted devices, due to the association with higher contamination rates. However, for patients with suspected line-related infection, blood should be drawn through the line but must also be drawn from a peripheral venipuncture site to adequately compare results and assess the source of infection (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0046">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0047">45</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0011">More recent strategies to reduce blood culture contamination during specimen collection include the concept of initial specimen diversion. This strategy relies on discarding or diverting the initial volume of specimen collected during venipuncture to avoid introducing commensal skin microbiota into the blood culture bottle. Commercial diversion devices include the Steripath Gen2 system (Magnolia Medical Technologies, Seattle, WA) and the Kurin Lock device (Kurin, Inc., San Diego, CA) (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0048">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0049">47</link>).

      <title>Volume of Blood Cultured</title>

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0012">For both pediatric and adult patients, the volume of blood cultured remains the most important factor in recovery of pathogenic microorganisms from blood. This conclusion is derived from several studies that demonstrate a direct relationship between the total volume of blood cultured and the likelihood of recovery of pathogens (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0019">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0051">49</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0053">51</link>). This principle applies, in general, to young children and infants as well, but in that patient population there are practical limits to the volumes of blood that can be withdrawn for laboratory tests such as blood cultures (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>). For adults, 8 to 10 ml of blood should be inoculated into each blood culture bottle, in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. A standard blood culture set consists of two bottles, one supporting aerobic conditions and one supporting anaerobic conditions, inoculated from a single venipuncture sample (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0018">16</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0021">19</link>). The terms “blood culture” and “blood culture set” are often used interchangeably (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0019">17</link>). The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) joint guidelines recommend that two to four sets of blood cultures are needed to detect bacteremia or fungemia during a septic episode, meaning that up to 80 ml (four blood culture sets of 20 ml each) may be drawn to maximize microbial recovery (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0054">52</link>). At a minimum, 40 ml (four bottles, two blood cultures/sets) should be collected per septic episode, with weight-based exceptions for patients with neutropenia (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0055">53</link>) and pediatric patients (see below). On average, there is a 3% increase in the rate of detection for bloodstream infection for each milliliter of blood cultured (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0056">54</link>). As summarized in <link linkend="ch0020s0000a0007">Table 1</link>, two blood culture sets recovered 80 to 90% of pathogens in patients with bacteremia, and three blood culture sets increased the recovery to 96 to 98% of pathogens.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0013">For hospitalized patients, who typically are having blood drawn for other laboratory tests as well, patients with anemia, and patients for whom there are other reasons for concern about the overall volume of blood drawn for laboratory testing, there is no benefit in decreasing the volume of blood drawn per culture. For children, the available data show that, as with adults, yield of blood cultures increases with the volume of blood cultured (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0057">55</link>). With older children, the volume of blood that should be drawn for culture differs little from that specified for adults. There are no controlled clinical trials that provide guidance; however, broadly speaking, children aged 12 years and older (except children who are small for their age) should have blood volumes drawn according to the criteria used for adult patients. In contrast, for neonates, infants, and young children, the total volume of blood drawn is limited by both the total blood volume in these patients and by practical considerations, such as blood draw difficulty. There are several recommendations regarding how much blood can safely be drawn for culture, but there is little consensus between these recommendations (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0057">55</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0060">58</link>). Both age- and weight-based blood volume collections have been suggested for pediatric patients (<anchor id="ch0020s0000a0017"/><link linkend="ch0020s0000a0021">Tables 2</link> and <anchor id="ch0020s0000a0018"/><link linkend="ch0020s0000a0024">3</link>), though weight-based guidance may be more practical in neonates and critically ill patients (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0059">57</link>). Because the number of blood cultures drawn at one time is critical for proper interpretation of blood culture results, no fewer than two blood culture sets should be drawn from pediatric patients whenever possible, although it is often not possible to do so for neonates. Pediatric blood culture bottles are intended to accommodate lower blood volumes and improve recovery of pathogens by purportedly optimizing the blood-to-broth ratio and reducing the amounts of potentially inhibitory components, such as sodium polyanethol sulfate (SPS). Seeded studies suggest that pediatric bottles offer a slight advantage for certain organisms at low organism concentrations and low blood volumes, but head-to-head studies comparing clinical performance of standard versus pediatric bottles have not been reported (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0057">55</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0061">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0062">60</link>). Historically, when only a small volume of blood was collected from a pediatric patient, it was common practice to place it all in an aerobic blood culture bottle because it was assumed that pediatric patients were at low risk for bloodstream infections caused by anaerobic bacteria (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0019">17</link>). However, more recent studies have indicated that the addition of anaerobic blood culture bottles to collections from pediatric patients improves the recovery of clinically significant pathogens, particularly facultative anaerobes, even at low volumes (&lt;1 ml) and in neonatal patients (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0063">61</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0065">63</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0014">Although adult patients vary substantially in both height and weight, in general, the number of blood samples drawn does not need to be adjusted for either parameter. Collecting more than one set of blood samples whenever possible has two benefits. First, it helps ensure that an adequate volume of blood is drawn for culture, as stated above. Second, it guides providers’ interpretation of blood culture results. Single blood cultures yield information that is difficult to interpret, unless the isolate is one that rarely, if ever, is recovered as a contaminant (e.g.,<emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> species). Contaminating organisms are frequently recovered from only one blood draw site in a set and are likely introduced during the venipuncture process (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0016">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>).

Dilution of blood to overcome these factors was more important with older blood culture media, but even with current blood culture systems that use a standardized blood culture medium, a sufficient blood-to-broth ratio is required to minimize inhibitory activity. In the current continuous monitoring blood culture systems (CMBCS), a blood-to-broth ratio between 1:5 and 1:10 is sufficient (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0066">64</link>).

SPS, in addition to its anticoagulant property, inhibits complement activity, inactivates clinically achievable concentrations of some aminoglycoside antibiotics, inactivates lysozyme, and blocks phagocytosis; however, SPS is known to inhibit growth of certain bacteria, including <emphasis>Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptobacillus moniliformis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Peptostreptococcus anaerobius</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0068">66</link>).

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0019">Although the standard set of blood culture bottles (aerobic and anaerobic bacteriological media) are capable of recovering yeasts that most commonly cause invasive infection (<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species, primarily <emphasis>Candida albicans</emphasis>), blood culture, overall, is less sensitive for detection of candidemia than bacteremia. For invasive candidiasis, the estimated sensitivity of blood culture is 50%, which leaves many bloodstream infections caused by yeasts undetected when the organism burden is &lt;1 CFU/ml (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0078">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0079">77</link>). European studies have demonstrated that the addition of a dedicated fungal bottle (Bactec Mycosis IC/F bottles) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), which is not available in the United States, recovers yeasts at higher rates than aerobic/anaerobic blood culture sets alone and is beneficial when concomitant bacteremia exists. These studies suggest that incorporation of a dedicated fungal bottle into blood culture testing algorithms may improve recovery of yeasts but should likely be reserved for individual patients with risk factors for fungemia, such as those with hematologic malignancy, immunosuppression, or admission to an intensive care unit (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0080">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0081">79</link>). It should be noted that there are clinical practice differences between Europe and the United States (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0082">80</link>), and at least one U.S. study determined that standard blood culture bottles were noninferior to the Bactec Myco/F lytic bottle for the detection <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0083">81</link>). <emphasis>Malassezia</emphasis> spp. typically require lipid supplementation, and current bottle formulations for automated systems may not be effective for recovery (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0084">82</link>). Lysis centrifugation (reviewed below) utilized with medium supplemented with olive oil has also been shown to improve recovery of <emphasis>Malassezia</emphasis> spp., specifically <emphasis>Malassezia furfur</emphasis>, from blood culture (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0085">83</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0020">With regard to fungemia with dimorphic or filamentous fungi, only a handful of organisms are typically recoverable in CMBCS bottles.

Historically, lysis centrifugation has been the recommended method for recovery of the dimorphic fungi (as well as mycobacteria and other fastidious organisms) from blood; however, the Abbott Isolator (formerly Wampole Laboratories, now Abbott Laboratories) lysis-centrifugation system was discontinued in the United States and Canada in 2022, so this method will no longer be available. Recovery of other filamentous fungi in blood culture bottles is a rare event that should be evaluated carefully. Even in a population at highest risk for invasive aspergillosis, positive blood cultures with <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> species are not typical and cannot be readily associated with invasive aspergillosis. There are reported cases of <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> that are associated with events discovered on autopsy, but the majority of positive results, from both blood culture bottles and the Isolator system, are often determined to be pseudofungemia. <emphasis>Aspergillus terreus</emphasis> has been noted to be associated with true fungemia. This is likely due to its ability to produce yeast-like forms in tissue. A case-by-case assessment by treating physicians, including clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data, should be conducted to determine the significance of recovery of <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> species from blood culture (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0087">85</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0088">86</link>).

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0021">Mycobacteremia due to<emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> (MTB) or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is associated with high mortality, often because of a delayed or missed diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0089">87</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0090">88</link>). Addition of mycobacterial blood cultures in high-risk patients can improve time to diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0091">89</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0093">91</link>). While rapidly growing mycobacteria are often detected in CMBCS, specific processes are required for optimal recovery of slowly growing mycobacteria from blood culture (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0054">52</link>). The lysis centrifugation system has long been a commonly used method for recovery of mycobacteria from blood (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0094">92</link>). Following sample processing, the concentrated sediment is inoculated directly to mycobacterial solid or liquid media and routinely incubated for 6 to 8 weeks. As stated above, this system is no longer available in the United States and Canada as of 2022. Two blood culture liquid medium formulations specifically designed for the recovery of mycobacteria are currently commercially available: the Bactec Myco/F lytic bottle and the VersaTREK Myco medium (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) (<link linkend="ch0020s0000a0037">Table 4</link>). Both culture media are modifications of Middlebrook 7H9 broth. Myco/F lytic medium contains the lytic agent saponin and additional modifications to support growth of fungi. The use of both liquid medium systems has been consistently reported to improve overall recovery and decrease the time to detection compared to solid media for mycobacterial blood culture (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0095">93</link>). In high-risk patients, performance of multiple mycobacterial blood cultures can improve diagnostic yield of MTB and NTM (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0096">94</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0097">95</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0020s0000p0022">Preparation for blood culture collection and transport to the laboratory includes a number of stepwise processes. Preanalytical steps include preparing the supplies needed for collection, labeling blood culture bottles, performing hand hygiene, donning appropriate personal protective equipment, and selecting collection sites for venipuncture. Next, a tourniquet is applied to assess venous access, and disinfection is performed. For adults and children &gt;2 months old, the venipuncture site is cleaned with alcohol and disinfected with chlorhexidine gluconate or iodine tincture, which require approximately 30 s of exposure time. Chlorhexidine gluconate is not recommended for children &lt;2 months old. To ensure adequate disinfection, it is recommended to swab or wipe the area (according to manufacturer’s instructions if using a commercial product/applicator), moving outward from the center of the site, to allow the disinfectants to dry for the appropriate amount of time, and to avoid touching the site after disinfection has taken place (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0098">96</link>). The blood culture bottle is also prepared prior to inoculation by disinfection of the septum or stopper of the bottle, as recommended by the bottle manufacturer. Marking the side of the bottle with the manufacturer’s recommended volume is important primarily when using an apparatus that allows collection directly into the bottle (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>). Prior to venipuncture it is important to avoid repalpating the skin at the venipuncture site after it has been disinfected, even with a sterile glove. During venipuncture a needle is inserted into the vein, and it is recommended to withdraw the blood using a safety device, whenever possible, to protect the phlebotomist from needle exposure. Safety devices are typically available from the manufacturer of the blood culture bottles and are specific to the shape of the bottle. The manufacturer’s instructions should be followed for use of the specific safety device and bottle inoculation, and samples should be drawn from each venipuncture site in rapid succession (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>). If poor venous access requires that blood for culture be drawn through a port in an indwelling catheter, at least one additional sample should be collected from a peripheral venipuncture site.</para>

Bottles should be held at room temperature during transport until being processed in the laboratory.

Blood culture samples are rarely, if ever, rejected, and samples should be processed even if suboptimal. In cases of suboptimal collection, communication with and feedback to the clinical team are essential for quality improvement (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>). In the event that a laboratory receives blood in a bottle that is incompatible with its instrument, the laboratory should have a plan to manually monitor a commercial blood bottle.

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0031">Conventional detection of bacteremia or fungemia has been either direct, via recovery of pathogenic microorganisms by culture of blood specimens, or indirect, by identification of surrogate markers. The latter method was investigated widely during the 1970s and 1980s by attempts to identify methods such as detection of<emphasis>Limulus</emphasis> endotoxin assays and detection of bacterial antigens in blood, but these efforts are largely only of historical interest. As a result, culture remains the primary laboratory method for detection of bacteremia or fungemia.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0032">Blood cultures were first described more than a century ago and, by the 1930s, had prompted a number of investigations that defined some of the methods still used today. By the 1960s, blood cultures were widely used, but methods varied considerably, and it became increasingly clear over time that the overall approach left much to be desired. During the 1970s, John Washington and other investigators began a series of experiments and controlled clinical trials to define critical factors for the detection of bacteremia and fungemia, to identify best practices for blood cultures, and to establish scientific evidence upon which future blood culture systems could be developed and used on a widespread basis. These studies resulted in more refined clinical approaches to blood cultures and to development, design, and use of commercially available blood culture systems.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0033">As the number of blood cultures performed increased during the 1960s and 1970s, and the need for methods that were less labor-intensive increased, interest grew in the development of automated blood culture systems. The first of these was the BACTEC 460 radiometric system (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD), a derivative of the original Bactec 220 system, which was developed in the late 1960s and first marketed in the early 1970s. During the next 2 decades, the Bactec 660, 730, and 860 systems in turn succeeded the 460 system. The 220 and 460 systems used radiometric detection of<superscript>14</superscript>C-labeled CO<subscript>2</subscript>, whereas the 660, 730, and 860 systems detected microbial growth by monitoring CO<subscript>2</subscript> production of growing microorganisms by infrared spectrophotometry. Because both radiometric and nonradiometric detection methods required removal of an aliquot of the atmosphere in the bottle headspace, monitoring more than once or twice per day was not possible. An equal volume of sterile gas had to be added to bottles after sampling to maintain the appropriate pressure in each bottle, and this, in turn, slightly reduced the CO<subscript>2</subscript> present in the atmosphere, thereby limiting the frequency of sampling. Because once- or twice-daily sampling did not allow for the earliest detection of microbial growth, a newer generation of blood culture technology was needed.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0034">The next generation, conceived in the late 1980s and introduced in the 1990s, was CMBCS, providing the foundation for the systems that are used in laboratories today. These newer systems take their name from the fact that, unlike previous automated blood culture systems which monitored bottles for CO<subscript>2</subscript> production only a few times each day, they monitor CO<subscript>2</subscript> production much more frequently, typically once every 10 to 15 min (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0053">51</link>). Unlike older automated systems, which flagged potential microbial growth when the CO<subscript>2</subscript> level in a bottle exceeded an arbitrary threshold level, CMBCS use several computer algorithms to detect microbial growth. The first algorithm uses a threshold level, the second uses a sustained linear increase in CO<subscript>2</subscript> production, and the third uses an increase in the rate of CO<subscript>2</subscript> production (although specific computer algorithms used by each manufacturer are proprietary). Because the latter two criteria depend upon actively growing microorganisms, delayed placement of bottles in instruments, which allows microorganisms to grow and thereby produce CO<subscript>2</subscript> prior to testing, can result in delayed (or lack of) detection of microorganisms in bottles. Because of the large amount of data to be analyzed for each bottle and the bottle capacity of each incubator, the success of CMBCS could not have been accomplished without the development of computers with more powerful processors and larger memory.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0035">For CMBCS to monitor CO<subscript>2</subscript> levels on a frequent basis, two other barriers to testing had to be removed. The first barrier was elimination of the need for manual sampling and replenishing the atmosphere in the bottle headspace. This was achieved by the development of sensors that could be read through the wall of the bottles without the need for invasive testing. The second barrier was elimination of the need for repeated manual loading and unloading of bottles onto instruments for testing. Although this was achieved to some degree by the Bactec 860 system, each bottle still had to be moved to the testing apparatus. In contrast, CMBCS have a mechanism for monitoring the sensor of each bottle individually, thereby eliminating the need to manually move bottles during incubation and testing. Overall, the change to more frequent testing with CMBCS reduced the time to detect microbial growth by 1 to 1.5 days compared with Bactec radiometric and nonradiometric systems (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0053">51</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0037">Relatively few nonautomated blood culture systems are still manufactured and sold commercially in the United States. Those that are available are well characterized as to their diagnostic strengths and limitations. These systems are adequate for the detection of common bacterial and fungal pathogens, are easy to use, require only a non-CO<subscript>2</subscript> incubator, and are inexpensive (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0053">51</link>). The main drawbacks to manual systems are that they are labor-intensive, precluding their use in laboratories processing even moderate numbers of blood cultures, longer time to results, and the inability to interface result reporting and provide data management through contemporary laboratory information systems. Moreover, with the availability of smaller blood culture instrument systems, even laboratories processing low numbers of blood cultures can use automated systems. Only one manual blood culture system remains available in the U.S. market: the Thermo Scientific Oxoid Signal (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The Abbott Isolator (formerly from Wampole Laboratories) (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) lysis-centrifugation system was discontinued in the United States and Canada in 2022 but is reviewed here.</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0038">The manual blood culture system Oxoid Signal is a single aerobic bottle system. With the Signal system, bottles are inoculated with blood through a rubber septum in the lid. The Signal device consists of an empty plastic cylinder attached to a needle, which when inserted into the bottle extends below the surface of the blood-broth mixture. During microbial growth, release of gases into the blood-broth mixture increases the concentrations of those gases, which reach equilibrium with those in the bottle headspace. Over time, this increases the atmospheric pressure within the bottle, eventually forcing some of the blood-broth mixture upward through the needle into the attached Signal device. In controlled clinical evaluations, the Signal system has not performed as well as other blood culture systems (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0099">97</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0102">100</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0020s0000p0039">With lysis-centrifugation, blood is inoculated into tubes containing a mixture of a lysing agent (saponin), an anticoagulant (SPS), and a fluorocarbon-cushioning agent. The blood is lysed by the saponin, and the mixture is centrifuged to separate the components. The supernatant is then removed and discarded, and the pellet is suspended and used to inoculate designated culture media to recover specific pathogens. The system has been used for detection of routine bacterial pathogens, but because delayed processing has been reported to reduce recovery of anaerobic bacteria, some<emphasis>Haemophilus</emphasis> species, and <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> (saponin also causes lysis of pneumococci), other commercial broth-based systems are likely better for routine use (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0103">101</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0108">106</link>). Although at one time lysis centrifugation was a preferred method for recovery of pathogenic yeasts, dimorphic fungi, mycobacteria, <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> spp., continuous-monitoring blood culture systems are at least equal for recovering many of these pathogens. Detection of <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> spp. is best achieved by use of nucleic acid amplification (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0109">107</link>); if this is not available, serologic testing can be used.

BacT/Alert is a colorimetric system, detecting changes in CO<subscript>2</subscript> concentration in bottles via changes in color of a pH-sensitive device in the base of bottles.

Similar to BacT/Alert, Bactec has updated its medium formulations to contain antibiotic-binding resins attached to tiny glass beads (<anchor id="ch0020s0000a0049"/><link linkend="ch0020s0000a0058">Fig. 2</link>).

        <para id="ch0020s0000p0044">The third CMBCS introduced during the 1990s was the ESP system (Difco Laboratories), now marketed by Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) as VersaTREK. VersaTREK differs from the BacT/Alert and Bactec systems in several fundamental ways. First, VersaTREK uses a different system for detecting microbial growth. Once received in the laboratory, bottles are fitted with an adapter mechanism before being loaded into the instrument. The detector mechanism allows the system to monitor pressure changes within the headspace of each bottle as oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide are consumed or produced by growing microorganisms. Second, the blood-broth mixture within aerobic bottles is agitated by use of a stir bar contained within each bottle. Anaerobic bottles are not agitated. Third, the broth medium in VersaTREK Redox 1 aerobic bottles is soy casein peptone broth, whereas the broth medium in Redox 2 anaerobic bottles is proteose-peptone broth (<anchor id="ch0020s0000a0055"/><link linkend="ch0020s0000a0064">Fig. 4</link>). Fourth, bottles are monitored for growth less frequently, at 12-min intervals for aerobic bottles and 24-min intervals for anaerobic bottles. Fifth, all bottles for the VersaTREK system are made of glass. Last, unlike BacT/Alert FAN and Bactec Plus bottles, both of which contain additives to minimize or negate antimicrobial activity in blood specimens, VersaTREK Redox 1 and Redox 2 bottles contain 80 ml of broth medium, with the larger volumes providing greater dilution of blood and any antimicrobial agents contained therein. The smaller Redox 1 EZ Draw and Redox 2 EZ Draw bottles, which are marketed to allow for direct collection of blood specimens into the bottles, albeit at lower recovery levels, still contain 40 ml of broth medium for greater dilution of blood specimens comparable to broth medium volumes in BacT/Alert and Bactec bottles (<link linkend="ch0020s0000a0037">Table 4</link>). The VersaTREK Myco (formerly ESP II system) culture bottle (<anchor id="ch0020s0000a0056"/><link linkend="ch0020s0000a0067">Fig. 5</link>) in conjunction with growth and antibiotic supplements is specifically formulated for recovery of mycobacteria from blood and sterile and processed clinical samples. It contains 11.5 ml of a modified 7H11 broth and cellulose sponges that provide a growth support matrix and increase the surface area exposed to headspace oxygen for detection of pressure changes due to microbial gas production or consumption during growth. For mycobacterial blood culture, the system is compatible with processed sediments from the lysis centrifugation system and whole blood or buffy coat preparations collected in SPS or heparin tubes. When compared to growth from solid media, the ESP II system showed improved recovery with shorter time to detection of mycobacteria from blood samples (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0119">117</link>).</para>

Isolation from even a single culture can be clinically important, specifically in cases of infective endocarditis. Assessment of blood culture contaminants is especially difficult in preterm and low-birth-weight neonates, as signs of sepsis in this group are nonspecific and coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common cause of health-care associated infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0122">120</link>). Due to increased susceptibility to low-virulence organisms, recovery of coagulase-negative staphylococci in this population is often considered significant (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0123">121</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0124">122</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0020s0000p0048">Interpretation of blood culture results collected by venipuncture is more straightforward than those collected from indwelling venous lines. For cultures of blood collected from lines, interpretation involves analysis of the additional factors such as the type of line, where it is inserted in the body, how long it has been in place, and whether isolates are recovered from the line only, from an accompanying blood culture collected by venipuncture, or from both. A number of interpretive criteria have been proposed, but the multiplicity of studies with various methodologies makes interpretation and comparison difficult. Although complex by necessity, the current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>) remain useful and are shown in <anchor id="ch0020s0000a0069"/><link linkend="ch0020s0000a0073">Table 5</link>.</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0049">A commonly used approach to determine organism significance is to compare results between multiple blood culture sets. However, the comparison should be done from cultures collected from more than one site rather than by comparing the number of positive bottles. While the same organism recovered from two or more sets from different collection sites is likely to be a truly clinically relevant organism, the number of positive bottles from a single collection site may not be an accurate indicator of organism significance. Although there are conflicting data regarding this issue, a study by Mirrett and colleagues (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0125">123</link>) showed that for coagulase-negative staphylococci, there is no correlation between the number of bottles positive in blood culture sets and the clinical importance of the isolates. This observation held true for sets that consisted of two, three, or four blood culture bottles (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0125">123</link>). Fewer data are available regarding other types of blood culture isolates. Because microorganisms in blood cultures show a Poisson distribution, however, there is no reason that the findings with coagulase-negative staphylococci should not hold true for other types of isolates.</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0050">Other criteria have been suggested for making the interpretation of blood culture results more accurate and reliable. The time required for an automated blood culture system to flag a bottle as positive (i.e., to detect a growth signal), or time to positivity, has been studied in a number of settings and there is a correlation between the earlier detection of pathogens; however, there is so much overlap between the time to positivity for pathogens and contaminants that the information is of minimal use. Moreover, time to positivity is not useful for slowly growing microorganisms and may not be useful in patients who are receiving antimicrobial therapy, which can delay detection of microbial growth. Unlike the use of time to positivity to distinguish between contaminants and true pathogens, the use of time to positivity as a predictor of clinical outcomes is now well supported with good data (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0126">124</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0131">129</link>). Another exception is that isolates recovered after more than 72 h of incubation are usually contaminants, with the obvious exceptions of some slowly growing pathogenic bacteria and yeasts (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0132">130</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0051">Last, the utility of quantitative blood cultures still arises on occasion. Although methods for quantitation (or semiquantitation) have been devised and there are some data to support this approach, in reality, it is not practical for routine use.</para>

Early attempts were largely modifications of biochemical tests or early molecular methods (e.g., DNA probes) that did not produce the desired results. More recent methods have yielded substantially better results for rapid identification of selected groups of microbial pathogens. Moreover, there is evidence that earlier detection and identification of bloodstream pathogens, or antimicrobial resistance, improves outcomes (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0133">131</link>) and facilitates antimicrobial stewardship (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0134">132</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0135">133</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0020s0000p0053">The peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization (PNA-FISH) method (OpGen, Gaithersburg, MD), although limited to a few selected pathogens (<emphasis>S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis</emphasis>, Gram-negative organisms, and several <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp.), has been shown to reduce the time needed to identify selected microbial pathogens present in blood cultures. The principle of the method is simple, being based on the widely used principle of <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization. Unlike DNA and RNA probes, which have negatively charged sugar-phosphate backbone structures, the PNA backbone structure is composed of an electrically neutral polyamide (peptide) structure. The neutral electrical charge allows for more rapid, tighter, and more specific hybridization with nucleic acid targets. The probes are labeled with fluorescent dyes, which can be observed with a fluorescent microscope. Once a blood culture bottle is flagged as positive, a smear is made of the blood-broth mixture and a Gram stain is performed. On the basis of those results, the appropriate PNA-FISH probe(s) can be selected for testing. For <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> isolates, a companion test for <emphasis>mecA</emphasis> (mecA <emphasis>Xpress</emphasis>FISH) is also available (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0136">134</link>). The method is easy to use, with moderate cost, and requires little in the way of infrastructure beyond that already present in clinical microbiology laboratories (other than a fluorescent microscope) (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0137">135</link>). However, to take full advantage of the method, it is necessary to perform the test on demand for individual isolates, which is inefficient in many microbiology laboratories. Of note, a recent study of the impact of PNA-FISH on the time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy showed that this occurred only in the context of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0138">136</link>).</para>

This is followed by signal amplification by what the manufacturer calls a “silver staining process.” This platform has separate panels for detection of either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria directly from positive blood cultures. The Verigene Gram-positive panel has shown concordance with positive blood cultures for microbial identification ranging from 92 to 96% in adult populations depending on the evaluation (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0142">140</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0145">143</link>).

      <para id="ch0020s0000p0216">FilmArray is a multiplex PCR assay, with an initial nucleic acid extraction and purification step followed by PCR-based amplification in two stages. The first PCR stage is a multiplexed reaction; this is followed by individual PCR amplification reactions designed to detect specific products from the first-stage amplification. Final detection is based on the use of endpoint melting curves. The FilmArray panel, has two versions, and the most recent version (Blood Culture ID 2 [BCID2]) detects a combination of 43 Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts and 10 antimicrobial resistance genes in a single combined assay (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0154">152</link>). In the published evaluations of the first version of the FilmArray panel, FilmArray showed 86 to 92% concordance with conventional identification methods (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0154">152</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0156">154</link>).

Voltage is applied to each capture probe electrode, and target DNA is analyzed by electrochemical detection. This platform offers three separate panels for detection of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal pathogens. One unique feature included on the two bacterial ePlex panels is the addition of pan-targets for yeasts and the other bacterial panels (<link linkend="ch0020s0000a0083">Table 6</link>). For example, the Gram-positive ePlex panel contains a pan-target for yeast and a pan-target for Gram-negative bacteria. There are several publications that evaluate the performance characteristics of the three ePlex panels, and they all report very high sensitivity and specificity (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0160">158</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0163">161</link>). Additionally, Bryant et al. retrospectively reviewed patient charts and determined that the identification of the pathogen with the ePlex panels would have modified antimicrobial treatment in 45% of the patients (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0163">161</link>). In all studies, antimicrobial resistance gene detection with ePlex was 100% concordance with that obtained by standard AST methods (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0160">158</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0163">161</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0020s0000p0221">Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is an extensively studied approach to rapid microbial identification of blood culture isolates. Currently, two manufacturers of MALDI-TOF MS systems have instruments cleared by the FDA for marketing in the United States to identify microbial isolates from solid media (i.e., not directly from blood culture bottles): the Microflex LT Biotyper (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and the Vitek MS IVD (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). In an early study, 90% of bacterial isolates were identified directly from positive blood culture bottles (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0166">164</link>). Other early studies of this technology also showed good results for identifying bacteria and fungi directly from blood culture broth specimens. One evaluation of the Biotyper evaluated the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to identify bacterial pathogens in 212 blood cultures (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0167">165</link>). Of these, 42 (19.8%) showed insufficient numbers of bacteria in the blood-broth mixtures for MALDI-TOF MS to identify the bacteria (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0167">165</link>). Of the other 170 blood cultures, MALDI-TOF MS showed 95.3% concordance in correctly identifying the bacteria compared with conventional identification methods (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0167">165</link>). In another evaluation using the Biotyper (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0168">166</link>), 330 positive blood culture bottles were analyzed, of which 318 showed growth on subcultures and 12 were considered false-positive signals by the blood culture instrument. Of the latter group, the MALDI-TOF MS results were fully concordant with culture results (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0168">166</link>). For the 318 blood cultures that yielded growth on cultures, all were monomicrobial. When compared with results of conventional identification methods, MALDI-TOF MS results were concordant to the species level for 83.3% and to the genus level for 96.6% of blood cultures (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0168">166</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0020s0000p0222">In a comprehensive comparison of the two MALDI-TOF MS systems, a total of 202 positive blood culture bottles processed on the Bactec system were tested with both versions of MALDI-TOF MS (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0169">167</link>). In this evaluation, there were 181 monomicrobial and 21 polymicrobial samples. Biotyper correctly identified 177 of 181 (97.8%) of organisms from monomicrobial samples, compared to 167 of 181 (92.3%) identified by the Vitek system (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0169">167</link>). Neither system performed well for identification of organisms from polymicrobial samples (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0169">167</link>). Although time to identification was not evaluated in this study, two previous studies showed a reduction of between 26.5 and 34.3 h in the time to identification compared with conventional methods (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0170">168</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0171">169</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0223">All of these initial direct-from-blood MALDI-TOF studies led to Bruker developing the commercially available MBT Sepsityper IVD kit (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0172">170</link>). This kit requires 1.0 ml of positive blood culture fluid, which is then processed by blood cell lysis, centrifugation, and washing steps. The final pellet is spotted onto the MALDI target plate. Generally, the Sepsityper kit performs better in the identification of Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0173">171</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0174">172</link>). This can be attributed to Gram-positive bacteria having a thicker cell wall that decreases the effectiveness of protein extraction needed for MALDI-TOF MS identification. This MBT Sepsityper IVD kit protocol gave a 62% reliable identification of yeast organisms (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0175">173</link>). These organisms have a thick cell wall, and the addition of a formic acid treatment step improved the identification of yeast to 89.7% (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0175">173</link>). The use of a “smudge plate” method for decreasing the amount of time needed for processing and testing positive blood culture broth aliquots allows identification of bacterial isolates in less than 4 h (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0176">174</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0224">Despite acceptable performance for identification, the inability to perform AST with this method and the emergence of rapid and accurate commercial molecular assays for identification of microbial pathogens (and some antimicrobial resistance markers) raise the question of whether MALDI-TOF MS is a suitable approach for use with blood cultures. There is no doubt that use of MALDI-TOF MS, like any method that provides results earlier than conventional identification methods, can have a positive impact on clinical care (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0177">175</link>). What is less clear is whether it offers any advantages compared with molecular assays, especially as the latter require much less processing and expertise to perform and typically yield test results in less than 90 min. Although a single published comparison between methods showed that the Verigene Gram-positive assay had better concordance for identification of isolates than MALDI-TOF MS (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0145">143</link>), there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions as to the optimal method for rapid identification of microbial pathogens in blood cultures.</para>

        <para id="ch0020s0000p0225">Given that many positive blood cultures are monomicrobial, the use of positive blood culture broth as the inoculum for disk diffusion or an automated AST system (off-label use) has long been proposed. Initially, a lack of interpretive criteria, regulatory requirements, and concerns regarding a nonstandardized inoculum and potential matrix effect slowed widespread use of such modifications in the United States (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0178">176</link>). However, the availability of rapid, accurate species identification from positive blood cultures using MALDI-TOF MS and a number of recent reports demonstrating high concordance of rapid AST from positive blood culture broth with conventional AST have revitalized interest in the development of these methods.</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0226">Much of the work advancing the use of positive blood culture broth for rapid AST has occurred in Europe. The European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) first developed testing methods and published interpretive criteria for disk diffusion in 2019 (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0179">177</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0181">179</link>). Briefly, 100 to 150 μl of positive blood culture broth is directly inoculated to Mueller-Hinton agar (or Mueller-Hinton fastidious agar for <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>) and incubated for up to 8 h. When growth is confluent, clearly visible zones of inhibition are read at 4, 6, or 8 h and interpreted using EUCAST species- and incubation time-specific rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (RAST) breakpoints (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0182">180</link>). Zone diameter breakpoints for RAST directly from blood culture bottles are available for <emphasis>E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, S. aureus, E. faecium, E. faecalis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. This method was clinically validated in a multicenter clinical trial across 55 clinical laboratories in Europe (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0183">181</link>). In that study, results for more than 70% of Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates tested by rapid disk diffusion could be interpreted at 4 h, improving to 85% at 8 h incubation. Only half of Gram-positive isolates’ zone diameters were interpretable at 4 h, and <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> zone diameters could be read only after 6 h incubation. This study reported acceptable category agreement with very major error (VME) rates of &lt;1% and total error rates of &lt;4% for Gram-negative organisms (<emphasis>E. coli, K. pneumoniae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>) and VME rates of &lt;3.5% and total error rates of &lt;9% for Gram-positive organisms (<emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>) across all incubation times compared to standard disk diffusion interpreted using EUCAST clinical breakpoints (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0183">181</link>). These findings were largely reproduced in a single-center study in Singapore that evaluated the EUCAST RAST method with clinical and spiked blood culture bottles with Gram-negative isolates. Although slightly biased by low counts of resistant isolates, this study found that only certain organism-drug combinations (<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> with meropenem, gentamicin, and amikacin; <emphasis>K. pneumoniae</emphasis> with ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin; and <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> with gentamicin) met CLSI M52 criteria for equivalency of the AST method when compared to Vitek 2 (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0184">182</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0227">In their evaluation of rapid disk diffusion directly from spiked Gram-negative positive blood culture broths, the CLSI Methods Development and Standardization Working Group found that following 18 h incubation, most drugs evaluated met or approached ≥90% categorical agreement with acceptable error rates, excluding organism-drug combinations with low numbers of susceptible isolates, when compared to the reference disk diffusion method (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0178">176</link>). Although &gt;80% of direct AST samples could be interpreted at 6 h incubation, performance was suboptimal, with 69.9% categorical agreement, 2.3% VMEs, and 11.8% major errors (MEs) compared to the reference disk diffusion method from colonial growth at standard incubation time. Further, this effect was significantly worse with BacT/Alert FA Plus blood culture bottles than those from other manufacturers. This was thought to be due to higher inocula in positive BacT/Alert FA Plus bottles than in Bactec Plus Aerobic/F and VersaTREK Redox1 bottles, leading to higher rates of false resistance. Not surprisingly, the working group found that performance of direct disk diffusion at 6 h and 18 h incubations was optimal when the cell density of culture-positive bottles approached that of a 0.5 McFarland suspension (1.5 × 10<superscript>8</superscript> CFU/ml) (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0178">176</link>).</para>

The Accelerate PhenoTest BC performs rapid identification by fluorescence<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization in 1.5 h and AST by time-lapse imaging of bacteria under dark-field microscopy in ~7 h directly from positive blood cultures. In the first clinical evaluation of the system, a small trial of 115 episodes of bloodstream infection caused by Gram-negative bacteria, the system showed overall high concordance with conventional methods for both microbial identification and for detection of antimicrobial resistance markers (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0194">192</link>). In a second evaluation, the system showed high concordance with conventional identification methods with 100% accuracy to the genus level (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0195">193</link>). Overall categorical agreement for AST was 91 to 92%.

However, a limitation of nucleic acid-based organism detection from positive blood cultures is detection of nonviable organisms (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0219">217</link>). Since 2014, there have been several FDA-mandated recalls due to multiplex nucleic acid commercial systems detecting contaminant microbial nucleic acids, resulting in a false-positive detection of nonviable organisms (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0220">218</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0221">219</link>).

While not a universal problem, the implementation and reporting of the results from molecular methods will require continued surveillance. The issue of false-positive detection and how to handle proper reporting is still evolving in clinical practice, but the current recommendation is to use these systems in conjunction with conventional methods. In addition, it is widely considered best practice to confirm molecular identification of antimicrobial resistance genes with culture and conventional AST methods and to investigate and resolve genotypic to phenotypic discrepancies. This may require additional subculturing of blood cultures with heterogeneous populations to recover uncultivated organisms or those carrying genes and/or mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance that are detected using molecular methods but not recovered on the first round of culture (for example, a culture with both an MSSA strain and an MRSA strain).</para>

Results constituting a critical value, the time frame for notification, and the responsible clinical caregiver are designated by local institutional policies, and reporting practices will vary between sites and systems, especially with the inclusion of rapid diagnostic testing that cannot be completed within a 1-h time frame.

        <title>QUALITY AUDITS AND BENCHMARKS</title>

        <anchor id="ch0020s0000a0099"/>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0247">The most commonly studied, documented, and reported quality metric regarding blood cultures is the contamination rate. This metric can be tracked in two ways. The first, the percentage of all blood cultures collected (both positive and negative) that recover organisms considered contaminants, is the metric most frequently tracked by hospitals. There has been a long-standing recommendation that blood culture contamination rates be kept at or below 3% for hospitalized patients, and rates above 3% suggest overinterpreting of contaminants, flawed venipuncture technique, or lapses in adherence to collection practice standards. However, this target is largely historic and reflects use of skin disinfectants that were not as effective as chlorhexidine (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0230">228</link>). With use of chlorhexidine by phlebotomists who are trained to perform good skin antisepsis, there is no reason rates significantly lower than 3% cannot be achieved on a consistent basis, and a new target has been proposed (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0017">15</link>). Whether the proposed 1% target is realistic for patient care settings such as emergency departments is an unanswered question (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0016">14</link>). To optimize patient safety, quality, and cost (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0231">229</link>), quality improvement efforts target the lowest possible contamination rates, with the understanding that different contamination rates may occur in different settings. The second way contamination rates may be tracked is by monitoring the positive blood cultures that recover organisms that are considered contaminants. Studies have found widely varying rates of contamination from 13 to 56% of all positive blood cultures, and there currently is no defined benchmark for this metric (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0016">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0000li0047">45</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0248">A second important metric is the adequacy of filling of blood culture bottles. Filling bottles with inadequate volumes of blood diminishes yield, and a report indicating that the volume was inadequate should be sent to the provider, with a recommendation to recollect the blood sample, if possible. Adequacy of fill volume is useful for blood cultures drawn from adult patients and older children. Because of the smaller volumes of blood collected, this metric is challenging for monitoring the adequacy of fill volume for blood cultures drawn from small children and infants. There are several methods for assessing adequacy of fill volume. Visual inspection against a prefilled standard is a manual process and may lack reproducibility from person to person. In contrast, weighing filled bottles and comparing weights against those of a known standard is less subjective, but blood culture bottles may have variable weights, as the walls of glass blood culture bottles are not always of uniform thickness. The Bactec FX system has an automated blood volume monitoring system that has been evaluated in one pilot study (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0232">230</link>). Automating this process eliminates interobserver variability and allows consistent data collection. Adequacy of filling should be monitored by location of collection so that any patterns of underfilling (or overfilling) can be identified and data can be communicated to the specific location as part of ongoing quality improvement practices.</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0249">Another metric related to specimen collection is the number of blood cultures drawn per septic episode and site of collection (peripheral versus line collection). As noted above, interpretation of blood culture results depends heavily upon both drawing an adequate volume of blood and performing more than one culture. Determining the clinical importance of isolates recovered from single blood cultures can be challenging depending on the identification of the isolate recovered. At the same time, collecting more blood cultures than is necessary is wasteful, contributes to phlebotomy-caused anemia, and increases the risk of recovery of contaminants. As stated above, it is not recommended to collect blood from a central line except to assess central line infection, and collecting a second blood sample from an accompanying venipuncture source is essential for interpreting the results. Tracking and reporting the number of collections per septic episode and from central lines without accompanying venipuncture can provide data to support quality improvement for proper blood culture utilization overall.</para>
        <para id="ch0020s0000p0250">Metrics related to specimen processing and handling are also common, but they are often challenging to interpret due to the multiple factors impacting recovery of organisms in blood culture. Studies have reported reduced rates of recovery of organisms when blood culture bottles are delayed in transport, but the specific limitations due to delays have not been fully elucidated. Although the recommendation is to transport bottles as quickly as possible, at least two studies have demonstrated minimal or no impact with transportation times of &gt;4 h (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0233">231</link>–<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0235">233</link>).</para>

Although the appropriate time to notification may be institution specific, a survey of 65 institutions accredited by the College of American Pathologists or the Joint Commission reported a median turnaround time of 45 min (range, 27 to 158 min) from blood culture positivity to Gram stain notification (<link linkend="ch0020s0000li0236">234</link>). In this study, most participating laboratories reported turnaround time goals that ranged from 30 to 180 min, with a median success rate of 80.9% (range, 41 to 96%), providing some data to benchmark laboratory timeliness of notification policies.</para>

        <para id="ch0020s0000p0252">Detection of bacteremia and fungemia remains a critical role of clinical microbiology laboratories. Despite the development and introduction of several novel technologies, blood culture using liquid-based media remains the only practicable approach for routine patient care. Molecular detection methods are becoming more widely adopted, but the available methods are limited, as they do not currently have the sensitivity of blood cultures (except for a few pathogens), provide only limited information regarding AST, would not allow retention of isolates for epidemiologic investigations if used alone, are not effective for detecting polymicrobial isolates, and are not cost-effective to use on a routine basis. Nonetheless, as a complementary approach coupled with antimicrobial stewardship, they can contribute to earlier determination of specific therapy for some patients. Other methods, such as MALDI-TOF MS, can achieve similar results for rapid identification of microorganisms isolated on solid media and directly from blood cultures. Experience has shown that novel technologies for blood culture rarely replace older technologies but rather serve as adjunct methods to enhance older technologies. Because the isolation of pathogens from blood serves multiple clinical purposes—defining infection, assisting in making a prognosis, guiding therapy, monitoring response to therapy, and epidemiology—any approach to the laboratory detection of bacteremia and fungemia must be able to fulfill each of these roles. It is unlikely that any new technology will replace blood cultures entirely in the foreseeable future; however, newer technologies are being integrated with blood cultures into an algorithmic approach that takes advantage of the benefits of each method and are becoming accepted as best practices.</para>
