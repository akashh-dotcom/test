      <para id="ch0162s0000p0002">This chapter discusses various approaches and diagnostic methods currently used for the diagnosis of parasitic infections. Assuming that clinical specimens have been properly collected and processed according to specific specimen rejection and acceptance criteria, the examination of prepared wet mounts, concentrated specimens, permanent stained smears, thick and thin blood films, and various culture materials can provide critical information leading to organism identification and confirmation of the suspected cause of clinical disease (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0006">6</link>). Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), molecular assays, and diagnostic molecular panels are also becoming more widely used. However, even with the expansion of molecular testing, the majority of this diagnostic work depends on the knowledge and microscopy skills of the microbiologist. The field of diagnostic parasitology has taken on greater importance during the past few years for a number of reasons. Expanded world travel has increased the potential levels of exposure to a number of infectious agents, as well as expanding epidemiologic boundaries and organism changes in pathogenicity. It is important to be aware of organisms commonly found within certain areas of the world and the makeup of the patient population being served at your institution, particularly if immunocompromised patients are frequently seen as a part of your routine patient population. It is also important for the physician and microbiologist to recognize and understand the efficacy of any diagnostic method for parasite recovery and identification. Specific information on specimen collection and processing can be found in <ulink url="ch0160#ch0160s0001">chapter 137</ulink>. In order to become proficient in diagnostic medical parasitology, there is no substitute for performing extensive bench work and the required microscopy associated with this type of testing.</para>

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0004">The purpose of a direct wet mount is to confirm the possibility of infection with certain protozoa and helminths, to assess the worm burden of the patient, and to look for organism motility (<anchor id="ch0162s0000a0009"/><link linkend="ch0162s0000a0016">Table 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0014">14</link>). Any fresh stool specimens that have not been refrigerated and that have been delivered to the laboratory within specified time frames are acceptable for testing; however, it is much more important to examine liquid or soft stools than formed stools. Liquid and soft stools are much more likely to contain motile protozoan trophozoites than cysts, which do not demonstrate motility. Low-power examination (magnification, ×100) of the entire coverslip preparation (22 mm by 22 mm) and high dry power examination (magnification, ×400) of at least one-third to one-half of the coverslip area are recommended before the preparation is considered negative. Often, results from the direct smear examination should be considered presumptive; however, some organisms (<emphasis>Giardia duodenalis</emphasis> [<emphasis>G. lamblia, G. intestinalis</emphasis>] cysts and trophozoites, <emphasis>Entamoeba coli</emphasis> cysts, <emphasis>Iodamoeba bütschlii</emphasis> cysts, helminth eggs and larvae, and <emphasis>Cystoisospora belli</emphasis> oocysts) can be definitively identified. Reports of results obtained by this method should be considered preliminary, with the final report being made available after the results of the concentration wet mount and permanent stained smear, both of which are more sensitive methods than the direct wet smear, have been obtained. It is important to remember that direct wet smears are not relevant for concentration sediments, since the specimen has been subjected to various solutions that kill the organisms. Although liquid or very soft fresh stools should be examined by the laboratory within 30 minutes of passage, this is often not practical, and stools are collected in fecal preservatives for submission.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0005">If iodine is added to the preparation for increased contrast, the organisms will be killed and motility will be lost. Specimens that arrive in the laboratory in stool preservatives do not require a direct smear examination; proceed to the concentration and permanent stained smear. Examination of the wet mount using iodine is not required but is the decision of each user performing this type of microscopy.</para>

Either Schaudinn’s fixative (zinc base with PVA) or one of the single-vial systems (with or without PVA) can be used for the preparation of the permanent stained smear. Organism motility is seen when saline is used; iodine kills the organisms, so motility will no longer be visible. The use of ethyl acetate may remove the entire specimen and pull it into the layer of debris that will be discarded (liquid specimen normally contains mucus); the liquid should be centrifuged at 500 × <emphasis>g</emphasis> for 10 min (normal centrifugation time), but ethyl acetate should not be used in the procedure. In general, laboratories have switched to nonmercury substitutes; the original Schaudinn’s fixative contains mercuric chloride. However, in some instances the term “Schaudinn’s fixative” is still used to describe not the original fixative but a formulation that is prepared with a copper or zinc base or other proprietary compounds. When fixatives are selected, it is important to know the contents in order to comply with disposal regulations (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0010">10</link>).

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0006">The purpose of the concentration method is to separate parasites from fecal debris and to concentrate any parasites present through either sedimentation or flotation (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0006">6</link>–<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0014">14</link>). The sedimentation concentration is the most common method used; all organisms will be found in the concentrated sediment. Use of flotation is more limited, since not all parasites will float, and centrifugation speeds and time are critical for success. The concentration method is specifically designed to allow recovery of protozoan cysts, coccidian oocysts, microsporidian spores (now classified with the fungi), and helminth eggs and larvae (<anchor id="ch0162s0000a0013"/><link linkend="ch0162s0000a0031">Table 2</link>). Any stool specimen that is fresh or preserved is acceptable for testing. Wet mounts prepared from concentrated stool are examined in the same manner as that used for the direct wet mount method (<anchor id="ch0162s0000a0014"/><link linkend="ch0162s0000a0037">Fig. 4</link>). The addition of too much iodine may obscure helminth eggs (the eggs may resemble debris); the use of iodine is an individual decision. Often, results from the concentration examination should be considered presumptive; however, some organisms (<emphasis>G. duodenalis</emphasis> [<emphasis>G. lamblia, G. intestinalis</emphasis>] cysts, <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> cysts, <emphasis>I. bütschlii</emphasis> cysts, helminth eggs and larvae, and <emphasis>C. belli</emphasis> oocysts) can be definitively identified.

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0007">The formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation concentration procedure is the most commonly used procedure, and the recommended centrifugation speed and time are 500 ×<emphasis>g</emphasis> and 10 min, respectively. In this procedure, the use of ether has been replaced with ethyl acetate. However, it is important to remember that ethyl acetate should not be used for liquid specimens or those containing a great deal of mucus. The ethyl acetate may pull the liquid or mucus specimen contents into the debris layer, which will be discarded. Although the recovery of parasites from a liquid specimen or one containing a great deal of mucus may not be successful, this simple centrifugation approach is still recommended. The standard zinc sulfate flotation procedure does not detect operculated or heavy eggs; when this method is used, both the surface film and sediment should be examined before a negative result is reported.</para>

Other options include Total-Fix (single-vial fixative with no mercury, formalin, or PVA) (Medical Chemical Corp.) and EcoFix (Meridian Biosciences, Cincinnati, OH). This figure provides three options for testing. In some cases, in-house validation procedures need to be performed prior to use.

Permanent stained stool smears are designed to allow examination and recognition of detailed organism morphology under oil immersion magnification (magnification, ×1,000).

Oil immersion examination of a minimum of 300 oil immersion fields is recommended; additional fields may be required if suspect organisms have been seen in the wet mounts. The use of a specific time for slide examination is not recommended, since each microbiologist screens the slides at a different rate. Based on their expertise, the patient population, and the percentage of positive specimens, different laboratories may approach the examination of permanent stained smears by using different guidelines. Some laboratories may use a 60× oil immersion objective for screening purposes (magnification, ×600); however, it is important to examine a sufficient number of fields at a total magnification of ×1,000 before reporting the specimen as negative (no parasites seen).</para>

        <para id="ch0162s0000p0022">Although the routine O&amp;P examination, consisting of the direct wet mount, the concentration, and the permanent stained smear, is an excellent procedure recommended for the detection of most intestinal parasites, several other diagnostic techniques are available for the recovery and identification of specific parasitic organisms (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0014">141</link>). Most laboratories do not routinely offer all of these techniques, but many can be performed relatively simply and inexpensively. Occasionally, it is necessary to examine stool specimens visually for the presence of scolices and proglottids of cestodes and adult nematodes and trematodes to confirm the diagnosis and/or for species identification (<anchor id="ch0162s0000a0040"/><link linkend="ch0162s0000a0090">Table 8</link>).

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0023">Nematode infections giving rise to larval stages that hatch in soil or in tissues may be diagnosed by using fecal culture methods to concentrate the larvae (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0014">14</link>). <emphasis>Strongyloides stercoralis</emphasis> larvae are the most common larvae found in stool specimens. Depending on the fecal transit time through the intestine and the patient’s condition, rhabditiform and filariform larvae may be present. Caution must be exercised when larval cultures are handled, because infective filariform larvae may be present. If there is a delay in the preservation of the stool specimen, embryonated ova as well as larvae of hookworm may be present. Culture of feces for larvae is useful for (i) revealing their presence when they are too scant to be detected by concentration methods; (ii) distinguishing whether the infection is due to <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> or hookworm on the basis of rhabditiform larval morphology by allowing hookworm egg hatching to occur, releasing first-stage larvae; and (iii) allowing the development of larvae into the filariform stage for further differentiation.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0024">Fecal culture methods are especially helpful for the detection of light infections with hookworm,<emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Trichostrongylus</emphasis> spp. and for the specific identification of parasites. Also, such techniques are useful for obtaining a large number of infective-stage larvae for research purposes. One enhanced recovery method, the agar plate culture for <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis>, and several culture techniques are described in this chapter. Since these procedures are less common, brief descriptions are included.</para>

Approximately 2 g of fresh stool (about 1 in. [25 mm] in diameter) is placed in the center of the agar plate, and the plate is sealed to prevent accidental infections and held for 2 days at room temperature. As the larvae crawl over the agar, they carry bacteria with them, thus creating visible tracks over the agar. The plates are examined under the microscope for confirmation of the presence of larvae, the surface of the agar is then washed with 10% formalin, and final confirmation of larval identification is made via wet examination of the sediment from the formalin washings. Although specific agar formulations are often provided, any agar plate where the bacterial colonies are easily seen can be used for this purpose. However, it is recommended that the plates be drier rather than very moist, to avoid bacterial swarming, which could obscure the tracking on the agar surface.</para>

        <para id="ch0162s0000p0027">Another method of examining a stool specimen suspected of having small numbers of<emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> larvae is the use of a modified Baermann apparatus. The Baermann technique uses a funnel apparatus and relies on the principle that active larvae migrate from a fresh fecal specimen that has been placed on a wire mesh with several layers of gauze, which are in contact with tap water (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>). Larvae migrate through the gauze into the water and settle to the bottom of the funnel, where they can be collected and examined. The main difference between this method and the Harada-Mori and petri dish methods is the greater amount of fresh stool used, possibly providing a better chance of larval recovery in a light infection. Besides being used for patient fecal specimens, this technique can be used to examine soil specimens for the presence of larvae. However, the agar plate method is considered a more sensitive method for the recovery of <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> larvae.</para>

The technique requires filter paper (a strip cut to fit into a 15-ml test tube); fresh fecal material (about the size of a raisin to a small grape) is added to the middle of the filter paper, and the filter paper is inserted into a test tube. Moisture is provided by adding water to the tube (within a half-inch of the stool, but not covering the stool), which continuously soaks the filter paper by capillary action. Incubation under suitable conditions favors hatching of ova and/or development of larvae. Fecal specimens to be cultured should not be refrigerated, since some parasites are susceptible to cold and may fail to develop after refrigeration. Also, caution must be exercised in handling the filter paper strip itself, since infective <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> larvae may migrate upward as well as downward on the paper strip.</para>

The presence of living miracidia within the eggs indicates an active infection that may require therapy. The viability of the miracidia can be determined in two ways: (i) the cilia of the flame cells (primitive excretory cells) may be seen on a wet smear by using high dry power and are usually actively moving, and (ii) the miracidia may be released from the eggs by the use of a hatching procedure (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>). The eggs usually hatch within several hours when placed in 10 vol of dechlorinated or spring water (hatching may begin soon after contact with the water). The eggs that are recovered in the urine (24-h specimen collected with no preservatives) are easily obtained from the sediment and can be examined under the microscope to determine viability.

Specimens should be collected without preservatives and should not be refrigerated prior to processing. Hatching does not occur until the saline is removed and nonchlorinated water is added. If a stool concentration is performed, saline should be used throughout the procedure to prevent premature hatching. The light must not be too close to the side arm or top layer of water in the Erlenmeyer flask. Excess heat kills the miracidia. The lamp light mimics the sun shining on a water source, and the hatched larvae tend to swim toward the light (<emphasis>S. mansoni</emphasis> more so than <emphasis>Schistosoma haematobium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Schistosoma japonicum</emphasis>). The absence of live miracidia does not rule out the presence of schistosome eggs. Nonviable eggs or eggs that failed to hatch are not detected by this method. Microscopic examination of direct or concentrated specimens should be used to detect the presence or absence of eggs. Egg viability can be determined by placing some stool or urine sediment (the same material used for the hatching flask) on a microscope slide. Low-power magnification (×100) can be used to locate the eggs. Individual eggs can be examined with high dry magnification (×400); moving cilia on the flame cells (primitive excretory system) confirm egg viability. <emphasis>S. mansoni</emphasis> eggshells will autofluorescence.</para>

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0040">A roundworm parasite that has a worldwide distribution and that is commonly found in children is<emphasis>Enterobius vermicularis</emphasis>, known as pinworm or seatworm. The adult female worm migrates out of the anus, usually at night, and deposits her eggs on the perianal area. The adult female (8 to 13 mm long) may occasionally be found on the surface of a stool specimen or on the perianal skin. Since the eggs are usually deposited around the anus, they are not commonly found in feces and must be detected by other diagnostic techniques. Diagnosis of pinworm infection is usually based on the recovery of typical eggs, which are described as thick-shelled, football-shaped eggs with one slightly flattened side. Often each egg contains a fully developed embryo and becomes infective within a few hours after being deposited. Commercial collection devices are available and can be used for specimen collection, similar to the approach with cellulose tape described below (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>). Many clinicians may treat patients on the basis of clinical symptoms without confirmation of the suspected diagnosis of pinworm infection.</para>

Specimens should be obtained in the morning, before the patient bathes or defecates. The tape is applied to the anal folds and is then placed sticky side down on a microscope slide for examination. At least six consecutive negative slides should be observed before the patient is considered free of infection. The use of up to six tapes is no longer considered practical; if children are symptomatic, pediatricians will usually treat without actual egg confirmation. The anal swab technique (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>) and Swube pinworm paddle (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>) are also available for the detection of pinworm infections; however, most laboratories prefer the cellulose tape method if one of the options is selected.</para>

A drop of material is mixed with a drop of 0.85% sodium chloride and is examined under low-intensity light for the characteristic movement of amebae.

In the majority of diagnostic laboratories, none of these procedures are routinely performed; their use is generally limited to relevant geographic areas and/or studies (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0027">27</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0162s0000p0064">A fresh, unpreserved specimen should be submitted to the laboratory; the amount may vary from &lt;0.5 ml to several milliliters of fluid. The specimen may be centrifuged (at 500 ×<emphasis>g</emphasis> for 10 min) (do not exceed this speed and/or time; unpreserved trophozoites are somewhat less stable than cysts) and should be examined immediately as a wet mount for motile organisms (iodine may be added later to facilitate identification of any organisms present). If the specimen cannot be completely examined within 2 h after it is taken, any remaining material should be preserved in one of the fecal fixatives for permanent staining.</para>

Therefore, centrifugation of the specimen is important, and the sedimented mucus should be examined.<emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> trophozoites may be caught in mucus strands, and the movement of the flagella on the trophozoites may be the only subtle motility seen for these flagellates. <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> larvae are usually very motile.

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0068">The identification of<emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> is usually based on the examination of a wet preparation of vaginal and urethral discharges and prostatic secretions or urine sediment and may require the testing of multiple specimens to confirm the diagnosis. These specimens are diluted with a drop of saline and are examined under low power and reduced illumination for the presence of actively motile organisms. As the jerky motility begins to diminish, it may be possible to observe the undulating membrane, particularly under high dry power (magnification, ×400). However, wet mounts are considered very insensitive for the confirmation of trichomoniasis (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>). Molecular test options are becoming more common and are considerably more sensitive.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0069">The use of stained smears is usually not necessary for the identification of<emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis>. The high number of false-positive and false-negative results reported on the basis of stained smears strongly suggests the value of confirmation by observation of motile organisms from the direct mount, from appropriate culture media (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0010">10</link>), or from direct detection with immunoassay reagents (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0070">While the membrane filtration technique can be used for the recovery of microfilariae, the examination of urinary sediment may be indicated in certain filarial infections.

        <para id="ch0162s0000p0079">Molecular methods may or may not be available for the individual organisms mentioned; certainly, molecular tests will generally be more sensitive, especially when the organisms present in the clinical specimen are rare. When routine testing methods have failed to demonstrate the organisms, the examination of aspirated material for the diagnosis of parasitic infections may be extremely valuable (<anchor id="ch0162s0000a0123"/><link linkend="ch0162s0000a0125">Table 11</link>). Specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately after collection. Aspirates include liquid specimens collected from a variety of sites as well as fine-needle aspirates and duodenal aspirates. Fine-needle aspirates are often collected by the cytopathology staff who process the specimens, or they may be collected and sent to the laboratory directly for slide preparation and/or culture. Fluid specimens collected by bronchoscopy include bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial washing fluids.</para>
        <para id="ch0162s0000p0080">Biopsy specimens are recommended for use in the diagnosis of parasitic infections in tissues (<link linkend="ch0162s0000a0125">Table 11</link>). In addition to standard histologic preparations, impression smears and teased and squash preparations of biopsy tissue from the following can be used: skin, muscle, cornea, intestine, liver, lung, and brain. Tissue to be examined as permanent sections or by electron microscopy should be fixed as specified by the laboratories that will process the tissue, and in certain cases, testing of a biopsy specimen may be the only means of confirming a suspected parasitic problem. Specimens that are going to be examined as fresh material rather than as tissue sections should be kept moist in saline and submitted to the laboratory immediately.</para>
        <para id="ch0162s0000p0081">Detection of parasites in tissue depends on specimen collection and the retrieval of sufficient material for examination. Biopsy specimens are usually quite small and may not be representative of the diseased tissue. Multiple tissue samples often improve diagnostic results. To optimize the yield from any tissue specimen, examine all areas and use as many procedures as possible. Tissues are obtained from invasive procedures, many of which are very expensive and lengthy: consequently, these specimens deserve the most comprehensive procedures possible.</para>
        <para id="ch0162s0000p0082">Tissue submitted in a sterile container on a sterile sponge dampened with saline may be used for cultures of protozoa after mounts for direct examination or touch or impression smears for staining have been prepared. If cultures for parasites will be made, sterile slides should be used for smear and mount preparation, or cultures should be inoculated prior to smear preparation.</para>
        <para id="ch0162s0000p0083">Detached ciliary tufts (ciliocytophthoria) have been seen in a variety of body fluids (especially peritoneal and amniotic fluids; also respiratory specimens). These tufts are the remnants of ciliated epithelium that are found as a part of normal cellular turnover in a number of sites: respiratory tract and sinuses, ventricles of the brain, central canal of the spinal cord, and epithelia of the male and female reproductive tracts. The tufts are motile, measure 10 to 15 μm in diameter, and can be confused with ciliated or flagellated protozoa. However, when they are carefully examined on a stained smear, there is no internal structure like that seen in protozoa (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0085">Generally, when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain aspirates or biopsy specimens are received, the most likely parasites include the free-living amebae<emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Balamuthia mandrillaris</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Naegleria fowleri</emphasis>. The use of nonnutrient agar (with bacterial overlays) cultures is recommended for <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis>; quality control cultures with known positive organisms are recommended as a basis for acceptable interpretation of patient culture results. The cysts of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> will exhibit autofluorescence. <emphasis>Sappinia</emphasis> spp. also grow in the culture system consisting of nonnutrient agar with a bacterial overlay. If free-living ameba cultures are ordered for central nervous system specimens, the agar plates should be incubated at 37°C (room air, no CO<subscript>2</subscript>) (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0010">10</link>). Do not refrigerate the CSF prior to culture; any trophozoites present may be killed. Unfortunately, cultures for <emphasis>B. mandrillaris</emphasis> are difficult to perform; consultation with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommended if this infection is suspected. The remaining specimen can then be processed for smear preparation and staining. Although <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> would also be seen in stained smears, one could also use immunospecific reagents, cell line culture, or PCR. Spinal fluid should not be diluted before examination. Impression smears or touch preparations from tissues should be prepared and stained with a blood stain. The material is pressed between two slides, with the smear resulting when the slides are pulled apart (one across the other). The smears are allowed to air dry and are then processed like a thin blood film (fixed in absolute methanol and stained with one of the blood stains).</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0086">Patients with primary amebic meningoencephalitis are rare, but the examination of spinal fluid may reveal the amebae, usually<emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis>. Unspun sedimented spinal fluid should be placed on a slide, under a coverslip, and observed for motile amebae; smears can also be stained with trichrome, Wright’s, or one of the blood stains. Spinal fluid, exudate, or tissue fragments can be examined by light microscopy or phase-contrast microscopy. Care must be taken not to confuse leukocytes with actual organisms and vice versa. The spinal fluid may be clear early in the infection or appear cloudy or purulent (with or without erythrocytes), with a cell count ranging from a few hundred to more than 20,000 leukocytes (primarily neutrophils) per ml. Failure to find bacteria in this type of spinal fluid should alert one to the possibility of primary amebic meningoencephalitis; however, false-positive bacterial Gram stains have been reported due to the excess debris. Isolation of these organisms from tissues can be done by using special media. When spinal fluid is placed in a counting chamber, organisms that settle to the bottom of the chamber tend to round up and look very much like leukocytes. For this reason, it is better to examine the spinal fluid on a slide directly under a coverslip, not in a counting chamber.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0087">Possible infection with microsporidia (the most likely organism is<emphasis>Encephalitozoon</emphasis> spp.; less common is <emphasis>Trachipleistophora anthropophthera</emphasis>) should also be considered. Specific methods include use of modified trichrome, acid-fast, and blood stains; use of a nonspecific optical brightening agent (calcofluor white); routine histology (methenamine silver, periodic acid-Schiff [PAS], and tissue Gram stains); and electron microscopy. Electron microscopy or immunospecific reagents are required to identify the microsporidia to the genus and species levels.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0088">Helminth parasite stages such as<emphasis>Taenia solium</emphasis> cysticerci and hydatid cysts of <emphasis>Echinococcus</emphasis> spp. are generally identified through examination of routine histologic slides; however, confirmation of hydatid disease could also be made from the hooklets seen in the hydatid cyst fluid contents.</para>

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0089">Eye specimens could include those from the cornea, conjunctiva, contact lens, or contact lens solutions. Although eye specimens are preferred,<emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> spp. have been cultured from patient contact lenses and opened lens solution. These specimens are acceptable; however, due to risk management issues, the laboratory should not accept unopened commercial lens care solutions. These solutions could be referred to laboratories or agencies, such as the FDA, that handle testing and authorization of commercial products. Also, the presence of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> in a lens solution does not automatically equate to <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> keratitis; it is only suggestive at best. A corneal scraping is recommended. After appropriate media have been inoculated, smears from acceptable specimens should be prepared and stained using a blood stain or trichrome stains. The <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> cysts will exhibit autofluorescence. Although <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> could be seen in stained smears, one could also use an immunospecific reagent or PCR for confirmation. Most individuals who are infected with <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> do not develop ocular disease; however, two populations are at risk, immunocompromised patients with HIV and neonates who have been exposed transplacentally to the mother’s acute infection.</para>

Electron microscopy or immunospecific reagents are required to identify the microsporidia to the genus and species levels, which could include <emphasis>Encephalitozoon</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Trachipleistophora</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Nosema</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Vittaforma</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Anncaliia</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Microsporidium</emphasis> spp. These eye infections are frequently seen in immunocompetent individuals with no underlying disease.

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0091">Ocular diseases caused by nematodes include onchocerciasis, loiasis, dirofilariasis, gnathostomiasis, theileriasis, and toxocariasis.

Aspirated fluid usually contains hydatid sand (intact and degenerating scolices, hooklets, and calcareous corpuscles). Some older cysts contain material that resembles curded cottage cheese, and the hooklets may be very difficult to see. Some of this material can be diluted with saline or 10% KOH or concentrated HCl; usually, scolices or daughter cysts will have disintegrated. However, the diagnosis can be made from seeing the hooklets under high dry power (magnification, ×400) or with special stains. The absence of scolices or hooklets does not rule out the possibility of hydatid disease, since some cysts are sterile and contain no scolices and/or daughter cysts.

Although for many years Giemsa stain has been the stain of choice, the parasites can also be seen on blood films stained with Wright’s stain, a Wright-Giemsa combination stain, or one of the more rapid stains, such as Diff-Quik (American Scientific Products, McGaw Park, IL), Wright’s Dip Stat stain (Medical Chemical Corp., Torrance, CA), or Field’s stain. It is more appropriate for personnel to use a stain with which they are familiar rather than having to use Giemsa stain, which is somewhat more complicated to use. PMNs serve as the quality control cell for any of the blood stains. Any parasites present stain with the same intensity and colors as the PMN nuclear and cytoplasmic material, regardless of the stain used. Delafield’s hematoxylin stain is often used to stain the microfilarial sheath; in some cases, Giemsa stain does not provide sufficient stain quality to allow differentiation of the microfilariae (<link linkend="ch0162s0000a0125">Table 11</link>). As with other clinical specimens, when blood is being handled, standard precautions should be observed (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0026">26</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0127">Microfilariae and trypanosomes can be detected in fresh blood by their characteristic shape and motility; however, specific identification of the organisms requires a permanent stain. Two types of blood films are recommended. Thick films allow a larger amount of blood to be examined, which increases the possibility of detecting light infections (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0013">13</link>). However, only experienced workers can usually make species identification with a thick film, particularly in the case of malaria, and the morphological characteristics of blood parasites are best seen in thin films.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0128">The accurate examination of thick and thin blood films and identification of parasites depend on the use of absolutely clean, grease-free slides for preparation of all blood films. Old (unscratched) slides should be cleaned first in detergent and then with 70% ethyl alcohol; new slides should additionally be cleaned with alcohol (use gauze, not cotton) and allowed to dry before use.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0129">Thick and thin blood films should be handled on a “stat” basis (ordering, collection, processing, examination, reporting). Blood films should be prepared when the patient is admitted or seen in the emergency room or clinic; typical fever patterns are frequently absent, and the patient may not be suspected of having malaria. If malaria remains a possible diagnosis, after the first set of negative smears, samples should be taken at intervals of 6 to 8 h for at least 3 successive days. However, after a day or two, other etiologic agents may be suspected, and often no additional blood specimens will be received. Another option is to collect blood immediately on admission; if the initial blood films are negative, daily specimens should be collected for 2 additional days (ideally between paroxysms if present; however, there is often no periodicity seen). With either collection option, quality patient care depends on the fact that both the physician and laboratory staff know that one negative set of blood films does not eliminate<emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> spp. as possible etiologic agents.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0130">After a finger stick, the blood should flow freely; blood that has to be “milked” from the finger is diluted with tissue fluids, which decreases the number of parasites per field. An alternative approach to the finger stick is collection of fresh blood containing anticoagulant (preferably EDTA) for the preparation of blood films. Ideally, the smears should be prepared within 1 h after the specimen is drawn. After that time, stippling may not be visible on stained films, and other morphologic changes will occur the longer the blood stands; however, the overall organism morphology may still be acceptable within 1 to 2 h. After 4 to 6 h, parasites may be lost.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0131">The time at which the specimen was drawn should be clearly indicated on the tube of blood and on the result report. The physician will then be able to correlate the results with any symptoms that the patient may have. There should also be some indication on the slip that is sent back to the physician that one negative specimen does not rule out the possibility of a parasitic infection.</para>

        <para id="ch0162s0000p0132">The thick film should be prepared as follows. Place 2 or 3 small drops of capillary blood directly from the finger stick (no anticoagulant) on an alcohol-cleaned slide. With the corner of another slide and using a circular motion, mix the drops and spread them over an area 2 cm in diameter. Continue stirring for 30 s to prevent the formation of fibrin strands that may obscure the parasites after staining. If blood containing an anticoagulant is used, 1 or 2 drops may be spread over an area about 2 cm in diameter; it is not necessary to continue stirring for 30 s, since there will be no formation of fibrin strands. If too much blood is used or any grease remains on the slide, the blood may flake off during staining. Allow the film to air dry (room temperature) in a dust-free area. Never apply heat to a thick film, since heat fixes the blood, causing the erythrocytes to remain intact during staining; the result is stain retention and an inability to identify the parasites. However, the thick films can be placed in a 37°C incubator for 10 to 15 min to dry; this seems to work quite well. Do not make the films too thick; one should be able to see newsprint through the wet film prior to drying. After the thick films are thoroughly dry, they can be laked to remove the hemoglobin. To lake the films, place them in buffer solution before staining for 10 min or directly into a dilute, buffered aqueous Giemsa stain. If thick films are to be stained at a later time, they should be laked before storage (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>). Although not as commonly used, other methods for the preparation of combination thick-thin blood films are available (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0007">7</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0162s0000p0133">The thin blood film is routinely used for specific parasite identification, although the number of organisms per field is much lower than the number in the thick film. The determination of parasitemia can also be performed from the thin blood film examination. The thin film is prepared exactly as one used for a differential count, and a well-prepared film is thick at one end and thin at the other (one layer of evenly distributed erythrocytes with no cell overlap). The thin, feathered end should be at least 2 cm long, and the film should occupy the central area of the slide, with free margins on both sides. Holes in the film indicate the presence of grease on the slide. After the film has air dried (do not apply heat), it may be stained. The necessity for fixation before staining depends on the stain selected.</para>

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0134">For accurate identification of blood parasites, a laboratory should develop proficiency in the use of at least one good staining method (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0006">6</link>–<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0012">12</link>). Since prolonged storage may result in stain retention, blood films should be stained on the same day as or within a few days of collection. If thick blood films are not prepared or received, it is possible to stain one of the thin blood films as a thick film and examine the thick portion of the thin film. During staining, the RBCs are laked, thus leaving the white blood cells, platelets, and any parasites present.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0135">Wright’s stain has the fixative in combination with the staining solution, so that both fixation and staining occur at the same time; therefore, the thick film must be laked before staining. In aqueous Giemsa stain, the fixative and stain are separate; thus, the thin film must be fixed with absolute methanol before staining.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0136">When slides are removed from either type of staining solution, they should be dried in a vertical position. After being air dried, they may be examined under oil immersion by placing the oil directly on the uncovered blood film. If slides are going to be stored for a considerable length of time for teaching or legal purposes, they should be protected with a cover glass by being mounted in a medium such as Permount. Blood films that have been stained with any of the Romanowsky stains and that have been mounted with Permount or other resinous mounting media are susceptible to fading of the basophilic elements and generalized loss of stain intensity. An antioxidant, such as 1% (by volume) 2,6-di-<emphasis>t</emphasis>-butyl-<emphasis>p</emphasis>-cresol (butylated hydroxytoluene; Sigma-Aldrich), can be added to the mounting medium. Without the addition of this antioxidant, mounted stained blood films eventually become pink; stained films protected with this compound generally remain unchanged in color for many years.</para>

If the blood cells appear to be adequately stained, the timing and stain dilution should be appropriate to demonstrate the presence of malaria and other parasites. The use of prepared liquid stain or stain prepared from the powder depends on personal preference; there is apparently little difference between the two preparations.</para>
        <para id="ch0162s0000p0138">The commercial liquid stain or the stock solution prepared from powder should be diluted approximately the same amount to prepare the working stain solution (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0005">5</link>). Stock Giemsa liquid stain is diluted 1:10 with buffer for both thick and thin blood films, with dilutions ranging from 1:10 to 1:50. Staining times usually match the dilution factor (e.g., 1:20 for 20 min or 1:50 for 50 min). Some people prefer to use the longer method with more dilute stain for both thick and thin films. The phosphate buffer used to dilute the stock stain should be neutral or slightly alkaline (pH 7.0 to 7.2). Phosphate buffer solution may be used to obtain the right pH. In some laboratories, the pH of tap water may be satisfactory and may be used for the entire staining procedure and the final rinse. During the Giemsa staining process, the pH should be maintained at 7.0 to 7.2 to demonstrate stippling within the parasites. This step is critical; the timing of the stain will be irrelevant if the stain pH is suboptimal.</para>
        <para id="ch0162s0000p0139">Giemsa stain colors the blood components as follows: erythrocytes, pale red; nuclei of leukocytes, purple with pale purple cytoplasm; eosinophilic granules, bright purple-red; and neutrophilic granules, deep pink-purple. In malaria parasites, the cytoplasm stains blue and the nuclear material stains red or purple-red. Schüffner’s dots and other inclusions in the erythrocytes stain red, but the color can vary. The nuclear and cytoplasmic staining characteristics of the other blood parasites, such as<emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> spp., trypanosomes, and leishmaniae, are like those of the malaria parasites and white blood cells.

Since Wright’s stain contains alcohol, the thin blood films do not require fixation before staining. Thick films stained with Wright’s stain are usually inferior to those stained with Giemsa solution. Great care should also be taken to avoid excess stain precipitate on the slide during the final rinse. Before staining, thick films must be laked in distilled water (to rupture and remove erythrocytes) and air dried. The staining procedure is the same as that for thin films, but the staining time is usually somewhat longer and must be determined for each batch of stain. Wright’s stain colors blood components as follows: erythrocytes, light tan, reddish, or buff; nuclei of leukocytes, bright blue with contrasting light cytoplasm; eosinophilic granules, bright red; and neutrophilic granules, pink or light purple.</para>

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0144">In cases where malaria parasites have not been indicated as the suspect organism, the initial screen of the thin blood film should be carried out with the low-power objective of a microscope, because microfilariae may be missed if the entire thin film is not examined. Microfilariae are rarely present in large numbers, and frequently, only a few organisms occur in each thin film preparation. Microfilariae are commonly found at the edges of the thin film or at the feathered end of the film, because they are carried to these sites during the process of spreading the blood. This approach to thin film examination is particularly important in cases where a suspect organism has not been indicated. The feathered end of the film where the erythrocytes are drawn out into one single, distinctive layer of cells should be examined for the presence of malaria parasites and trypanosomes. In these areas, the morphology and size of the infected erythrocytes are most clearly seen.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0145">In the case of a suspected malaria diagnosis, the request for blood film examination should always be considered a stat procedure, with all reports (negative as well as positive) being sent to the physician as soon as possible (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0005">5</link>). Examination of the thin film should include viewing of 200 to 300 oil immersion fields at a magnification of ×1,000. Although some people use a 50× or 60× oil immersion objective to screen stained blood films, there is some concern that small parasites such as <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> spp., or <emphasis>L. donovani</emphasis> may be missed at this lower total magnification (×500 or ×600), although they are usually detected at the total magnification of ×1,000 obtained with the more traditional 100× oil immersion objective. Because people tend to scan blood films at different rates, it is important to examine a minimum number of fields, regardless of the time that it takes to perform this procedure. If something suspicious has been seen in the thick film, often the number of fields examined on the thin film may be considerably greater than 300.</para>

Both malaria and <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> infections can be missed with these instruments, and therapy is therefore delayed. Because these instruments are not designed to detect intracellular blood parasites, any reliance on the automated systems for discrimination between uninfected erythrocytes and those infected with parasites may pose serious diagnostic problems.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0147">In the preparation of a thick blood film, the greatest concentration of blood cells is in the center of the film. A search for parasitic organisms on the entire thick film should be carried out initially at low magnification (10× objective) to detect microfilariae more readily. Examination of a thick film usually requires 3 to 5 min (approximately 100 oil immersion fields). The search for malarial organisms and trypanosomes is best done under oil immersion (total magnification, ×1,000). Close examination of the very periphery of the thick film may reveal intact erythrocytes; such cells, if infected, may prove useful in malaria diagnosis, since the characteristic morphology necessary to identify the organisms to the species level is more easily seen.</para>

      <para id="ch0162s0000p0148">Immunochromatography relies on the migration of liquid across the surface of a nitrocellulose membrane. Using monoclonal antibodies prepared against a malaria antigen target that has been incorporated onto the strip of nitrocellulose, these tests are based on the capture of parasite antigen from peripheral blood (<link linkend="ch0162s0000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0162s0000li0028">28</link>). Currently, the malaria antigens used for these rapid diagnostic tests are histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2), parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), and <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> aldolase (<anchor id="ch0162s0000a0192"/><link linkend="ch0162s0000a0173">Table 12</link>). These procedures offer the possibility of more rapid, nonmicroscopic methods for malaria diagnosis. The tests are easy to perform and interpret; however, there are a number of questions that remain concerning the relevant uses for this type of testing, especially considering the fact that the Binax Now malaria test (Abbott, Inc., Waltham, MA) is now FDA cleared. A positive-control specimen is also available.</para>
      <para id="ch0162s0000p0149">Sensitivity remains a problem, particularly for nonimmune populations. Parasite densities of &gt;100 parasites/μl (0.002% parasitemia) should be detected and are reasonable targets to expect from immunochromatographic assays for<emphasis>Plasmodium falciparum</emphasis> diagnosis. However, this level of sensitivity is at the lower end of the detection range of most devices using capture methods for HRP-2 or pLDH. This level of sensitivity is probably as good as that which clinical laboratory staff in nonspecialized laboratories with limited exposure to malaria cases could expect to provide using microscopy diagnosis. One of the potential benefits is for inexperienced staff, for whom the immunochromatographic assay identification of a life-threatening parasitemia with <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> could prevent a missed infection. However, a negative test cannot be accepted and requires confirmation by microscopic examination of both thick and thin blood films for the detection of parasitemia below the present threshold of detection by these rapid tests. Also, there are rare false positives for patients with certain rheumatologic disorders; this is noted in the package insert and has been confirmed by users in this patient population.</para>

Tubes precoated with acridine orange provide a stain that induces fluorescence in the parasites. This method automatically prepares a concentrated smear that represents the distance between the float and the walls of the tube. Once the tube is placed into the plastic holder (Paraviewer) and immersion oil is applied onto the top of the hematocrit tube (no coverslip is necessary), the tube is examined with a 40× to 60× oil immersion objective (it must have a working distance of 0.3 mm or greater).</para>
