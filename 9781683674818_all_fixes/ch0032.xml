      <para id="ch0032s0000p0001">Throughout recorded history, scholars have been investigating the underpinnings of disease with an almost singular focus on the human side of the equation. Microbes were not recognized as an important cause of disease until the inception of the “germ theory” in the late nineteenth century. During the first century of medical microbiology, research centered largely on the role of microbes as pathogens. Only recently has there been a resurgence of interest in understanding how commensal organisms—the bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archaea that make up the microbiota—impact human physiology. The idea that these microorganisms are vital to the well-being of humans has challenged our traditional notions of “self.” Indeed, a human being can most accurately be described as a holobiont: a complex assemblage of human cells and microorganisms interacting in an elaborate<emphasis>pas de deux</emphasis> that drives normal physiologic processes.</para>
      <para id="ch0032s0000p0002">Aimed at a better understanding of this relationship, a myriad of studies during the past decade have begun to catalog the microbiota at various body sites and in a multitude of disease conditions (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0005">5</link>). Diseases in virtually every organ system have been associated with changes in the microbiota. Indeed, the microbiota has been linked to intestinal disorders, disturbances in metabolic function, autoimmune diseases, and psychiatric conditions and has been shown to influence susceptibility to infection and the efficacy of pharmaceutical therapies. Knowledge of the specific mechanism(s) underlying most of these microbe-disease associations is lacking; it remains unclear whether the disease-associated alterations in the microbiota represent mere biomarkers of disease, a causal relationship, or a combination of the two. Although cause-and-effect relationships are still being elucidated for many diseases, humans clearly coexist in an intricate relationship with commensal organisms. Given the voluminous data regarding the microbiota and human health, this chapter focuses on exemplar data to highlight key findings that are often generalizable across body sites and disease states.</para>

        <para id="ch0032s0000p0003">Initial estimates from the 1970s suggested that there were ~10-fold more bacteria in the body than there were human cells (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0007">7</link>). However, a more recent estimate has suggested that there are only ~1.3 times more bacteria in the body than there are human cells (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0008">8</link>). Of note, this more recent study does not include the number of viruses (~10-fold more abundant than other microbes), fungi, or archaea. Including these additional classes of microbes likely makes correct the idea that microbes outnumber human cells by an ~10:1 ratio. With regard to genetic potential, the human contribution is even smaller: in contrast to the ~20,000 genes in the human genome, there are estimated to be &gt;2,000,000 genes in the microbiome—a 100:1 ratio in favor of microbes (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0009">9</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0032s0000p0004">In terms of overall diversity, more than 10,000 different bacterial species are present in the collective human microbiota; the intestines alone contain more than 1,000 species (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0009">9</link>). At any given time, the body of any given individual harbors 500 to 1,000 bacterial species (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0010">10</link>), with 100 to 200 bacterial species in the gut alone (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0009">9</link>). If one considers different strains of the same bacterial species, which may be functionally different from one another, the diversity of the microbiota is probably at least an order of magnitude greater (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0011">11</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0032s0000p0005">The Human Microbiome Project (HMP), a landmark study that cataloged the microbiome in multiple anatomic sites in healthy adults, found that the composition of the microbiota differs by body site, there is tremendous interindividual variation, and the microbial gene content is relatively conserved irrespective of the body site or individual (<anchor id="ch0032s0000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0032s0000a0006">Fig. 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0012">12</link>). In fact, the effect of the anatomic site on microbial composition is far greater than the effect of heterogeneity between individuals (i.e., all samples from a given body region [e.g., skin] were more similar to each other than they were to samples from a different body region [e.g., stool], even in the same individual) (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0012">12</link>). Taken together, these findings highlight the remarkable personalization of the human microbiome. While the human genome is typically &gt;99.5% identical in different people (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0013">13</link>), the microbiotas of two individuals may not overlap at all.</para>

        <para id="ch0032s0000p0006">As with other facets of microbiome studies, the factors that influence the microbial composition have been best studied in the context of the stool microbiota. Some studies have demonstrated that host genetics have a small but statistically significant effect on the microbiota’s composition (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0014">14</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0016">16</link>), but there is some controversy over this finding (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0018">18</link>). Moreover, the microbiota changes with age, with pronounced changes apparent particularly in early infancy and in the elderly (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0019">19</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0021">21</link>). In addition to these factors, which are difficult to control, an individual’s specific microbial configuration is quickly altered in response to subtle changes in the microenvironments in which the bacteria reside. On a day-to-day basis, these changes usually reflect alterations in the relative abundance of the various microbes. However, some exposures have a greater effect on the microbiota and can shift the microbial population to a new equilibrium via the loss of specific species and/or the acquisition of others; this new microbial equilibrium can be associated with either health or a disease state (<anchor id="ch0032s0000a0008"/><link linkend="ch0032s0000a0011">Fig. 2</link>). Diet is perhaps one of the largest drivers of the intestinal microbiota, as it provides nutrients needed not only by our own cells but also by the microbes living in the alimentary tract (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0023">23</link>). Other factors that can alter the microbiota in a dynamic manner include lifestyle choices (e.g., choice of household members, presence of pets, living in a rural or urban setting, and country of residence) and circadian rhythms (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0024">24</link>). Furthermore, virtually all drugs have the capacity to change the microbiota by altering the chemical landscape in which the microorganisms live (e.g., statins and bile acid sequestrants), modulating the host’s ability to recognize and react to microbes (e.g., immunosuppressants), and/or directly interfering with the microbiota’s constituents (e.g., antibiotics) (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0025">25</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0028">28</link>). While the microbiota can be altered through these various mechanisms, it is not yet clear whether—or to what extent—these changes impact disease states.</para>

        <para id="ch0032s0000p0007">Microbiome studies have come a long way from their austere beginnings, which relied completely on culture-based techniques and therefore missed the overwhelming majority of microbes that are not yet cultivable. With the knowledge that the 16S rRNA gene sequence can be used to identify bacteria without culturing them, as well as the advent of PCR, development of high-throughput sequencing techniques, and advancements in high-performance computers, investigators have been able to profile the bacterial component of the microbiota simply by isolating and sequencing DNA from relevant samples. Critical to these projects were the simultaneous development of robust databases of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences that could then be queried to identify the bacteria present in clinical samples. Importantly, 16S rRNA gene sequences, particularly when only a small portion of the gene is sequenced, do not always provide species-level taxonomic resolution. As the underlying technologies continued to improve, it became possible to sequence all the microbial DNA (shotgun metagenomics) or all the RNA (metatranscriptomics) present in a sample, though these techniques require more computational resources and greater sequencing capacity than does 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The latter approaches also provide insight into fungi, viruses, and archaea that are present, which facilitates understanding inter-kingdom microbial interactions. Unfortunately, the necessary reference databases for nonbacterial microbes are still in their infancy, which has limited the current understanding of how these classes of microbes are associated with health and disease; however, this work continues in earnest.</para>

        <para id="ch0032s0000p0008">The “hygiene hypothesis,” which was initially proposed in the 1980s (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0029">29</link>), has since evolved to hold that a combination of genetic susceptibilities and inadequate microbial exposures leads to alterations in homeostatic immune responses, thereby predisposing an individual to disease. These ideas laid the foundation for modern translational microbiome science—the notion that restoring these microbial exposures may therefore promote health and treat disease. To understand how these host-microbiota interactions can be harnessed to prevent and/or treat human diseases, studies over the past ~2 decades have begun characterizing the microbiota in health and disease, with an altered microbiome (dysbiosis) being found to be nearly universally present in disease. Although it is challenging to generalize findings over all these studies, which span numerous diseases and body sites, a few themes have emerged. Compared to healthy subjects, individuals with disease generally have a lower number of bacterial species (alpha diversity) and/or reduced microbial relatedness of the bacteria present (beta diversity). Moreover, inflammatory diseases are often associated with a decrease in the abundance of bacteria in the family <emphasis>Lachnospiraceae</emphasis> and an increase in taxa within the family <emphasis>Enterobacteriaceae</emphasis>. In the sections below, we highlight the microbiology and some leading microbiome-disease associations for various body sites.</para>

          <para id="ch0032s0000p0009">Early culture- and Sanger sequencing-based studies demonstrated that six phyla account for &gt;95% of the oral microbiota:<emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis> (e.g., <emphasis>Streptococcus, Veillonella</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Granulicatella</emphasis> spp.), <emphasis>Actinobacteria</emphasis> (e.g., <emphasis>Actinomyces, Atopobium, Corynebacterium</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Rothia</emphasis> spp.), <emphasis>Proteobacteria</emphasis> (e.g., <emphasis>Campylobacter, Cardiobacterium, Haemophilus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> spp.), <emphasis>Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes</emphasis> (e.g., <emphasis>Bergeyella, Capnocytophaga</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Prevotella</emphasis> spp.), and <emphasis>Spirochaetes</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0030">30</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0033">33</link>). In the Human Microbiome Project, nine niches within the oral cavity were characterized: saliva, dorsum of the tongue, lateral surfaces of the tongue, buccal epithelium, hard palate, soft palate, supragingival plaque, subgingival plaque, maxillary anterior vestibule, and tonsils (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0012">12</link>). Although the oral microbiome exhibits relatively low interindividual variability compared to other anatomic sites (e.g., skin), the microbial profiles of adjacent niches (e.g., the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue) are distinct, likely due to differences in the structure of the epithelium and underlying serous glands (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0034">34</link>). The salivary microbiome is believed to consist largely of microbes dislodged from different sites within the oral cavity, in particular the dorsum of the tongue (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0035">35</link>). The tonsils, followed by tooth surfaces, contain the highest number of species, while the maxillary anterior vestibule had the lowest bacterial diversity (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0034">34</link>). The composition of the oral microbiome is shaped largely by behaviors and environmental factors (e.g., diet, oral hygiene, geographical location, and tobacco use) with little to no impact from host genetics (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0036">36</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0039">39</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0032s0000p0010">The oral microbiota includes both adherent microbes, which form biofilms, and nonadherent microbes, which are removed by flushing, chewing, and talking (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0035">35</link>). Epithelial debris and food products are easily available as nutrients to oral microbes (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0035">35</link>). Polymicrobial interactions progress in a unique and established pattern, resulting in the production of polysaccharides and glycoproteins, which lead to the formation of mixed biofilms that contain both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0040">40</link>). After cleaning of the teeth, <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> spp. (e.g., <emphasis>Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. sanguinis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>S. mutans</emphasis>) are the first to colonize through interactions with salivary proteins (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0041">41</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0043">43</link>). These initial interactions result in the bacterial production of additional adhesins and pilus structures as well as host production of mucins, which together form the basis for a biofilm (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0041">41</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0044">44</link>). This nascent biofilm, with expression of fibrillar proteins by Gram-positive bacteria, facilitates the sequential adherence of Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., <emphasis>Veillonella</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Porphyromonas</emphasis> spp.), obligate anaerobes (e.g., <emphasis>Fusobacterium</emphasis> spp.), and yeasts (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0042">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0044">44</link>). <emphasis>Fusobacterium nucleatum</emphasis>, which is rarely present in the first 12 h after cleaning of teeth, bridges early- and late-colonizing microbes and pathogens (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0045">45</link>).

Gingivitis is a reversible form of periodontal disease characterized by bacterial overgrowth and microbe-induced inflammation at the gingival margin. When untreated, it can progress to chronic periodontitis, which may result in local tissue destruction and eventual tooth loss (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0046">46</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0048">48</link>).

Microbes shape immune development, maturation, tolerance, and inflammation through the production of microbial metabolites and the presentation of surface antigens. For example, SCFAs have a significant impact on host immunity by directly modulating cytokine production (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 10 [IL-10]) (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0129">129</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0130">130</link>).

In contrast to the ease with which the upper respiratory tract can be sampled, the lower respiratory tract requires more invasive techniques. Although patients with chronic lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and cystic fibrosis) were known to harbor organisms in their lungs, it was felt that these microbial communities were present only because of the underlying disease. Bronchoscopy samples from otherwise healthy individuals require the bronchoscope to pass through microbe-rich environments (e.g., the nasal or oral cavity); the results were notable in that very few microbes were present, and they were thought to be contaminants from these other sites (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0207">207</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0208">208</link>).

Host factors, including normal physiological processes, immune defenses, behaviors, and disease states, also impact the respiratory microbiome. As highlighted above, the lower respiratory tract microbiome is derived from microaspiration, which occurs in all individuals, with the mucociliary escalator helping to remove some of this microbial burden. As such, these normal physiological processes lead to a constant influx and efflux of microbes in the lower airways. Additionally, behaviors such as smoking can also influence the respiratory microbiome. Interestingly, although smokers are noted to have a dysbiotic oral microbiota (decreased abundance of <emphasis>Gemella, Porphyromonas</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> species in smokers), there is no significant impact on the microbiota present in the lungs (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0211">211</link>). This distinction may reflect the technical challenges in demonstrating differences in the low biomass present in the lungs, or it may simply indicate that the effect of smoking on bacterial communities is localized to the mouth.</para>

        <para id="ch0032s0000p0047">Given that the nares and nasopharynx are often the initial site of colonization for pathogenic bacteria and viruses, the nasal microbiota plays an important role in preventing these pathogens from gaining a foothold (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0216">216</link>). Consistent with this idea, there is often a substantial change in the nasal microbiota that precedes respiratory tract infections (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0217">217</link>). The microbiota regulates infectious risk both through direct interbacterial interactions and by regulating the local immune response (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0218">218</link>). For example, <emphasis>S. epidermidis</emphasis> produces bacteriocins, a type of antibacterial peptide that directly interferes with the ability of other bacteria to colonize the same niche (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0219">219</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0221">221</link>); <emphasis>Corynebacterium accolens</emphasis> produces free fatty acids that inhibit the growth of <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0222">222</link>); and <emphasis>Corynebacterium striatum</emphasis> secretes a yet-unidentified product that inhibits <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> colonization of epithelial cells (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0223">223</link>).

Of four identified microbiome trajectories in healthy children, a <emphasis>Staphylococcus</emphasis>-dominated nasopharyngeal microbiome in early life (&lt;6 months of age) was associated with asthma later in childhood.

        <para id="ch0032s0000p0049">As described above, the oropharyngeal microbiota translocates to the lower respiratory tract via normal microaspirations in healthy individuals. In addition, there are numerous clinical scenarios in which aspiration is more common and occurs in larger volumes. Examples include patients with a decreased level of consciousness, compromised airway defense mechanisms, dysphagia, vocal cord dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux, and recurrent vomiting. Regardless of the underlying cause, these macroaspirations induce a change in the microbiota of the lower respiratory tract and are often associated with lung inflammation and damage (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0231">231</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0032s0000p0050">Diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and COPD, that manifest with structural changes in the lungs are also associated with an altered microbiome in the lower respiratory tract. In cystic fibrosis, defective bacterial clearance occurs shortly after birth, and colonization of the lungs by some bacteria (e.g.,<emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>) can lead to long-term complications. Delayed acquisition of these pathogens is associated with improved patient outcomes (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0232">232</link>). For example, detection of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> in the oropharyngeal microbiota in patients with cystic fibrosis who are ≤2 years of age is associated with significantly increased mortality during the first 10 years after diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0233">233</link>). In contrast, patients with mild- to moderate-severity COPD have a lung microbiome that is largely similar to that in healthy adults; however, patients with severe COPD are noted to have an increased abundance of bacteria in the phyla <emphasis>Proteobacteria</emphasis> and <emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis>, with a decreased abundance of <emphasis>Bacteroidetes</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0234">234</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0237">237</link>).

          <para id="ch0032s0000p0051">Of the various human body sites and their respective microbial communities, the vaginal microbiome is perhaps the most homogenous. The bacterial component of the vaginal microbiome is generally thought to be dominated by<emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis>, which maintains vaginal health and prevents infection through the production of lactic acid and maintenance of an acidic environment (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0239">239</link>). Age, menstruation, and estrogen levels are significant factors in shaping the vaginal microbial community (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0240">240</link>). The increased estrogen during reproductive years promotes an accumulation of glycogen on the vaginal epithelium, which is the primary carbon source for lactic-acid-producing bacteria (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0240">240</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0242">242</link>). Microbial diversity and vaginal pH are therefore higher prior to puberty and following menopause (assuming no estrogen or hormonal replacement therapy) (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0240">240</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0243">243</link>). The vaginal microbiota of otherwise healthy women of child-bearing age has been categorized into five community state types (CSTs), four of which are characterized as having a specific <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> species (<emphasis>Lactobacillus iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri</emphasis>, or <emphasis>L. jensenii</emphasis>) as the most dominant member. A fifth CST is characterized by greater microbial diversity and a higher proportion of strict anaerobes (e.g., <emphasis>Prevotella, Dialister, Atopobium</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Gardnerella</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0244">244</link>). All communities described, including this fifth anaerobe-dominated CST, contain bacterial species known to produce lactic acid, a finding that indicates that this may be a key and conserved function of the vaginal microbiome (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0244">244</link>). Studies examining the role of lactic acid in vaginal health have demonstrated that it decreases proinflammatory-cytokine production and inhibits a wide variety of infections (e.g., <emphasis>Chlamydia trachomatis</emphasis>, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and herpes simplex virus [HSV] infections) (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0243">243</link>). In addition to producing lactic acid, <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> contributes to the maintenance of vaginal health and protection against pathogens through production of antimicrobial substances (e.g., bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxide) (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0243">243</link>). However, within <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis>-dominated CSTs, variations exist in pH, CST stability, disease susceptibility, and immune mediators (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0243">243</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0246">246</link>). While an <emphasis>L. crispatus</emphasis>-dominated CST is associated with lower levels of inflammation and increased pathogen protection (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0243">243</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0245">245</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0247">247</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0249">249</link>), the <emphasis>L. iners</emphasis>- and anaerobe-dominated CSTs are associated with higher microbial instability and higher concentrations of specific inflammatory cytokines relative to the <emphasis>L. crispatus</emphasis>-dominated CST (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0243">243</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0245">245</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0246">246</link>).

BV is most often due to <emphasis>Gardnerella vaginalis</emphasis>, though <emphasis>Prevotella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> species have also been implicated (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0243">243</link>). Virulent forms of <emphasis>G. vaginalis</emphasis> express sialidases and peptidases that break down the glycoprotein layer of the mucosa, which results in <emphasis>G. vaginalis</emphasis> adhering to the vaginal epithelium and forming the characteristic bacterium-coated “clue cell” that is diagnostic of BV on light microscopy (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0243">243</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0252">252</link>). The prominence of <emphasis>G. vaginalis</emphasis> in BV has led to the development of several direct probe assays to clinically detect the presence of <emphasis>G. vaginalis</emphasis> in vaginal fluid; however, these tests often have a poor specificity given that 36 to 55% of women have detectable <emphasis>G. vaginalis</emphasis> in the absence of clinical signs related to BV (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0253">253</link>). Nucleic acid amplification tests that simultaneously detect a few different indicator vaginal bacteria have been developed by several companies, each of which uses a slightly different combination of <emphasis>Atopobium vaginae, G. vaginalis, Megasphaera</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> spp., and BV-associated bacteria to diagnose BV (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0253">253</link>). Although several of these tests have reported positive and negative predictive values of &gt;90% compared with a combination of the Nugent score and Amsel’s criteria, it is not clear whether these tests simply delineate different CSTs that happen to be differentially associated with BV. High-diversity CSTs and BV have been associated with an increased risk of acquisition of viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as human papillomavirus, HSV, and HIV infections (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0254">254</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0258">258</link>). Vaginal dysbiosis may also predispose the host to trichomonal vulvovaginitis, an STI caused by the protozoal parasite <emphasis>Trichomonas vaginalis</emphasis>, which, similar to BV, is also associated with increased vaginal pH and degradation of mucosal glycoproteins (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0243">243</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0259">259</link>).</para>

Studies have demonstrated that this yeast-to-hypha transition may be inhibited by vaginal bacteria (particularly <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> spp.) through the secretion of acidic products and competition for binding to the vaginal epithelium (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0243">243</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0261">261</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0263">263</link>).

After the <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis>-dominated urotype, the next most common urotypes are dominated by <emphasis>Gardnerella, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Staphylococcus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0294">294</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0301">301</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0302">302</link>). If one compares the urinary microbiome in women of different ages, postmenopausal women not on exogenous hormones generally have a reduction in <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> and an increased prevalence of an <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> urotype; a <emphasis>Gardnerella</emphasis> urotype is more common in younger women. Both older age and higher body mass index are positively correlated with a more diverse urinary microbiome (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0298">298</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0032s0000p0059">Changes in the urinary microbiome have been investigated in several disease states, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), urinary incontinence, interstitial cystitis, and neurogenic bladder. For example, women with acute cystitis had a urinary microbiome characterized by<emphasis>Enterobacteriaceae</emphasis> and other commonly recognized uropathogens; in contrast, patients with recurrent cystitis had greater microbial diversity with a urinary microbiome that contained <emphasis>Sphingomonas, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Rothia</emphasis> spp., bacteria not identified in women with acute cystitis (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0303">303</link>). While acute urinary tract infection is typically caused by a single pathogenic organism, these findings suggest that recurrent cystitis may be associated with microbial dysbiosis (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0297">297</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0303">303</link>). Consistent with this idea, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated a moderate reduction in recurrent UTI symptoms after treatment with intravaginal <emphasis>Lactobacillus crispatus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0304">304</link>). Further research is needed to clarify the role of microbiome-based therapies for recurrent UTI. In contrast to UTIs, there remains controversy regarding whether there is any alteration in the urinary microbiome in patients with interstitial cystitis. While some studies have suggested alterations in the abundance of <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> spp. (albeit in different directions) (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0305">305</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0306">306</link>), others have indicated that there is no difference in the urinary microbiome between healthy controls and patients with interstitial cystitis (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0307">307</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0308">308</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0032s0000p0060">Altered bladder function also results in changes to the microbiome. In a cross-sectional study, patients with a neurogenic bladder had a greater abundance of<emphasis>Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Actinobaculum</emphasis> spp. with a higher likelihood of urinalysis demonstrating pyuria, bacteriuria, and a positive leukocyte esterase than asymptomatic patients with normal bladder function (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0309">309</link>). These findings help redefine what constitutes normal urinary microbiome and urine study findings in this patient population. Patients with urinary urgency incontinence have a more diverse urinary microbiome, with a higher predominance of 9 genera (<emphasis>Actinobaculum, Actinomyces, Aerococcus, Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Gardnerella, Oligella, Staphylococcus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis>) detected by EQUC (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0310">310</link>). While these patients also have a lower abundance of <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> spp. overall (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0298">298</link>, <link linkend="ch0032s0000li0311">311</link>), the <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> organisms that are present are more commonly <emphasis>L. gasseri</emphasis> than <emphasis>L. crispatus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0310">310</link>). Interestingly, baseline urinary microbial diversity is associated with responsiveness to solifenacin therapy for urge incontinence, with responders having lower baseline diversity than nonresponders (<link linkend="ch0032s0000li0311">311</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0032s0000p0061">The medical view of microbes has changed radically, moving from the early-twentieth-century notion that we are engaged in a constant struggle with microbes—an “us-versus-them” mentality that focused on the necessity of eradicating bacteria—to the more recent understanding that we live in a carefully negotiated state of détente with our commensal organisms. Instead of holding a simple view of bacteria as enemies to be eliminated with antibiotics, scientists are increasingly recognizing the critical role these organisms play in maintaining human health. Loss of these host-microbe interactions in the increasingly sterile environment typical of Western civilization may have predisposed the population to the increased incidence of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The field of microbiome research has made great strides over the past decade in cataloging the normal microbiota and is now on the cusp of being able to identify clinically actionable microbe-host relationships.</para>
        <para id="ch0032s0000p0062">The recent explosion of “-omics” technologies (e.g., metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics) has enabled the generation of vast amounts of data, but it is not yet clear how best to integrate data sets in order to gain useful insights into host-microbe relationships. The use of fecal microbiota transplantation has demonstrated that modulation of an individual’s microbiota can effectively treat certain diseases; however, models with which to predict specifically how a microbiota will change after modulation—and what potentially untoward effects these changes might have—are still lacking. Implicit in this limitation is our ignorance about what microbial configuration is optimal and how a given microbiota should be rationally altered to obtain an ideal outcome.</para>
        <para id="ch0032s0000p0063">Despite initial hyperbole and a few false starts, microbiome research now stands at the precipice of acquiring the ability to treat the fundamental basis of many diseases. As the field continues to mature, it will need to move beyond correlations and address causation. The identification of causal microbes and their mechanisms of action will create a “microbial toolbox” from which relevant bioactive strains and/or microbe-derived molecules can be chosen on a per-patient basis to correct specific underlying microbial dysbioses. Soon, our knowledge base regarding the microbiome and its relationship to health and disease will be robust enough that it will be critical to incorporate information about the patient’s microbiome when making treatment decisions.</para>
