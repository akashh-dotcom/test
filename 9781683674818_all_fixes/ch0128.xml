        <para id="ch0128s000000p0002">Polyomaviruses (PyVs) were discovered in the 1950s as infectious agents that pass bacterium-tight filters and form different tumors in rodents, hence their name (Greek<emphasis>poly</emphasis>, for many, and <emphasis>oma</emphasis>, for tumor) (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0009">1</link>). Although initially grouped together with papillomaviruses as the family <emphasis>Papovaviridae</emphasis>, the <emphasis>Polyomaviridae</emphasis> now constitute a separate family of more than 120 species (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0010">2</link>). PyV species infect a variety of vertebrates, such as bats, rodents, primates (including humans), birds, and fish (<anchor id="ch0128s000000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0128s000000a0007">Fig. 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0011">3</link>). Current consensus criteria defining PyV species include a complete circular double-stranded DNA genome ranging from 3,900 bp to 5,500 bp, the natural host, and a diversity in the large tumor antigen (<emphasis>LTAG</emphasis>) coding sequence of &gt;15% in nucleotides from the closest relative. Distinct properties, such as associated disease and tissue or host tropism, may serve as additional criteria. Currently, 116 PyV species have been provisionally assigned to 8 genera, designated <emphasis>Alphapolyomavirus</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 51), <emphasis>Betapolyomavirus</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 40), <emphasis>Gammapolyomavirus</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 9), <emphasis>Deltapolyomavirus</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 7), <emphasis>Epsilonpolyomavirus</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 3), <emphasis>Etapolyomavirus</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 1), <emphasis>Thetapolyomavirus</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 4), and <emphasis>Zetapolyomavirus</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 1) (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0010">2</link>). However, PyV taxonomy has been challenging due to an increasing number of PyV and PyV-like genome sequences, mostly detected by metagenomic studies of different hosts, biologic materials, or environments (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0012">4</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0017">9</link>). In addition, PyV sequences were identified in shotgun and transcriptome data sets obtained from vertebrates and from invertebrates such as insects and arachnids (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0018">10</link>), in sequence chimeras consisting of polyoma-papilloma or polyoma-adenoviral genomes, or in host chromosomes, possibly reflecting evolutionary ancient recombination or integration events (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0019">11</link>). Interestingly, the viral genome chimeras combined the regulatory polyoma <emphasis>LTAG</emphasis> sequence with the capsid sequences of other DNA virus origin (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0011">3</link>). Apparently, the multifunctional large tumor antigen (LTag) protein successfully maintained the bidirectional gene expression, which is a hallmark of the circular PyV genomes. Together, these observations also point to evolutionary scenarios, which involve recombination and integration events among host and viral DNA genomes (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0020">12</link>). Thereby, regulatory viral (sub)domains or structural (sub)domains are deposited or chimerized in a modular fashion. Accordingly, the diversity and evolutionary potential of PyVs impacts not only the construction of phylogenetic trees and evolutionary models (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0021">13</link>) but also intrahost divergence and switching of host and cell tropism (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0022">14</link>). The significance for humans and emerging human diseases is not clear but should not be underestimated.</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0003">Humans are the natural host for 14 different human polyomavirus (HPyV) species based on the detection of HPyV genomes and corresponding antibodies (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0023">15</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0036">28</link>). According to the <emphasis>LTAG</emphasis> sequences, six belong to the genus <emphasis>Alphapolyomavirus</emphasis>, four to the genus <emphasis>Betapolyomavirus</emphasis>, and four to the genus <emphasis>Deltapolyomavirus</emphasis> (<anchor id="ch0128s000000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0128s000000a0010">Table 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0023">15</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0036">28</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0004">However, midpoint-rooted phylogenetic trees of<emphasis>LTAG</emphasis> and <emphasis>VP1</emphasis> reveal relevant discordant classifications for several HPyVs. Whereas the taxonomic <emphasis>LTAG</emphasis>-based phylogeny places WUPyV and KIPyV in the genus <emphasis>Betapolyomavirus</emphasis> close to BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) and places HPyV6 and HPyV7 in the genus <emphasis>Deltapolyomavirus</emphasis> together with HPyV10 and STLPyV, the <emphasis>VP1</emphasis>-based phylogenetic tree clusters WUPyV and KIPyV in the vicinity of HPyV6 and HPyV7 (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0019">11</link>). These observations not only illustrate the taxonomic challenges but also point to potential diagnostic pitfalls. Thus, false-negative results and false-positive results may arise from sequence variation or genome fragmentation and from cross-detection of conserved genomic sequences, antigens, and antibody and T cell responses, respectively. As illustrated by the difference in relatedness of <emphasis>LTAG</emphasis> and <emphasis>VP1</emphasis>, this may involve closely or distantly related HPyVs. Thus, the discovery of known or novel PyV genomes in human materials merits careful consideration and development of stringent criteria to distinguish contamination versus mere exposure to PyV genome-containing matter such as water, foods, plants, and animal products, including cosmetics, versus actual infection, persistence, or replication in human cells (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0037">29</link>). Such considerations are key to suspected accidental zoonotic transmission (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0038">30</link>) and have been exemplarily discussed for the simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0039">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0040">32</link>), which was found as a contaminant agent in live polio vaccines produced in monkey cell lines (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0009">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0041">33</link>). Thereby, millions of children and adolescents were exposed to SV40 between 1955 and 1963, leading to multiple follow-up studies to examine potential associations with human disease and specifically cancer. The low detection rate and seroprevalence of HPyV12, New Jersey PyV (HPyV13), and Lyon IARS PyV (HPyV14) similarly raise questions about their origin, the relevant host reservoir and transmission routes. Only limited information is available about molecular detection of Quebec PyV, while serology data are still missing (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0042">34</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0128s000000p0005">Epidemiologic studies on HPyV are primarily based on detecting systemic antibodies in serum or plasma against the respective HPyV Vp1 capsid antigens (<link linkend="ch0128s000000a0010">Table 1</link>). As discussed in detail below, different methods have been used to this end; most recent comparative data are based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Despite differences in study population, age distribution, and assays used, HPyV exposure among adults as measured by determining levels of Vp1-binding antibody can be asssigned to five strata: very low (&lt;10%) for HPyV12 and LIPyV, low (10% to 20%) for HPyV9 and NJPyV, intermediate (30% to 70%) for JCPyV, HPyV6, and HPyV7, high (50% to 80%) for KIPyV, MCPyV, and STLPyV, and very high (80% to 99%) for BKPyV, WUPyV, and HPyV10 (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0043">35</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0051">43</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0006">Studies comparing different age groups including children indicate that approximately half of the respective HPyV infections commonly occur during early childhood and adolescence and independently of one another. The natural route of transmission has not been identified for any HPyV, but transmission likely occurs via mucosal surfaces in the respiratory, oropharyngeal, or gastrointestinal tract through direct contact or environmental exposure. Likewise, no specific symptoms or signs have been linked to primary HPyV infection in the general population, presumably because of a subclinical or nonspecific flu-like course. Until the seventh decade of life, smaller increases are observed for HPyVs, suggesting continued exposure and seroconversion during adulthood. These increases are most apparent for HPyVs with intermediate antibody rates, whereas the very high antibody levels for BKPyV tend to decline with age, especially among males.</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0007">The seroprevalence data also indicate an average exposure of 6 to 8 different HPyVs per adult. Thus, there seems to be no or little cross-neutralizing immunity preventing superinfection with another HPyV species. However, HPyV-specific T cells have been reported to cross-react to some extent due to shared peptide epitopes presented by HLA (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0052">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0053">45</link>), which may be more pronounced for homologous domains of the LTag (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0054">46</link>). Cross-reactive cellular immunity may play a role in the mitigation of clinical manifestations of <emphasis>de novo</emphasis> HPyV infections and provides the rationale for adoptive T cell therapy with BKPyV-specific T cells for JCPyV progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0055">47</link>).</para>

The preferential manifestation in certain immunocompromised patient populations suggests that specific aspects of HPyV biology and the clinical setting are crucial for HPyV pathogenesis in addition to insufficient immune control. Not all HPyV diseases are sufficiently explained by uncontrolled high-level HPyV replication causing a clinically relevant cytopathic loss of the infected host cells, but some entities are characterized by inflammation as the main driver of pathology and its clinical manifestation or by host cell proliferation or even malignant transformation (<link linkend="ch0128s000000a0010">Table 1</link>). Notably, the propensity of polyomaviruses to deposit their genome as a chromosome-like episome provides the opportunity for persistence under the radar of the immune system, from where reactivation of HPyV replication can occur. Thus, primary infection, exogenous re- or superinfection, and reactivation represent possible scenarios, which need to be considered when interpreting diagnostic tests of immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts (1, 48–51). Overall, the detection rates are substantially lower than the seroprevalence rates (<link linkend="ch0128s000000a0010">Table 1</link>). Nevertheless, codetection of several HPyVs in various specimens from healthy persons, such as urine, stool, and skin, has been reported, although the individual and combined detection rates are much lower than the antibody footprints of exposure observed in seroprevalence studies.</para>

        <para id="ch0128s000000p0009">Most virological information is derived from BKPyV, JCPyV, and MCPyV or extrapolated from SV40 because of the inability to propagate the newer HPyVs in cell culture and animal models. HPyV virions are nonenveloped particles with icosahedral symmetry and a diameter of 45 nm. The clinical and diagnostic implications are that HPyV virions remain infectious for prolonged times in the environment and can resist alcoholic hand disinfectants, radiation, heating to 56°C for 20 min, and DNase I digestion, distinguishing nonencapsidated viral loads from protected virions (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0060">52</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0064">56</link>). The outer surface of the virions is composed of 72 pentamers of Vp1, which is the main target of binding, opsonizing, or neutralizing antibodies. The minor capsid protein Vp2 is located inside the virion and in contact with the encapsidated DNA genome at a ratio of one Vp2 per Vp1 pentamer. The HPyV genome is organized in a chromatin-like fashion by nucleosomes built from octamers of two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 kidnapped from the host cell. Unlike MCPyV, certain HPyV virions like BKPyV or JCPyV also express Vp3, a shorter in-frame derivative of Vp2.</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0010">The host cell receptors are not yet known for all HPyVs. Where identified, differently branched carbohydrate structures, sialylated glycans, or glycosaminoglycans exposed on the cell surface from membrane lipids, proteins, or the extracellular matrix fit three-dimensional subdomains of Vp1 on virions or virus-like particles (VLPs) (1, 57–59). For some HPyVs, like BKPyV and JCPyV, this interaction has been used for determining virion titers and specific antibody titers by hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition assays, respectively (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0068">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0069">61</link>). Uptake of viral particles occurs via clathrin- or caveolin-mediated endocytosis (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0070">62</link>). Alternative attachment and entry routes have been described that involve proteinaceous receptors, receptor-independent fluid endocytosis, or even the cargo of exosomes or microvesicular bodies (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0070">62</link>). Specific examples include JCPyV uptake via the serotonin receptor hydroxytryptamine 2A (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0071">63</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0072">64</link>), which can be blocked in cell culture by the antidepressive drug mirtazapine and provides the rationale for adjuvant treatment for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0073">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0075">67</link>). Certain entry mechanisms may not be susceptible to neutralizing antibodies and have been proposed to explain the effective replication of JCPyV variants carrying the Vp1 point mutation L55F or S269F/Y (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0076">68</link>), which no longer hemagglutinate or bind to receptor gangliosides (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0077">69</link>). Intracellular acidification of endosomes and interaction with chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum are thought to facilitate virion export into the cytosol, stepwise uncoating, and release of the HPyV genome into the nucleus, all of which represent potential targets of antiviral compounds or drugs (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0073">65</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0011">The HPyV genome can be divided into three major functional regions (<anchor id="ch0128s000000a0013"/><link linkend="ch0128s000000a0018">Fig. 2</link>): (i) the small bidirectional noncoding control region (NCCR) of approximately 350 to 500 bp, (ii) the early viral gene region (EVGR), and (iii) the late viral gene region (LVGR), on the opposite DNA strand. EVGR and LVGR each constitute approximately half of the HPyV genome. Several HPyVs, like BKPyV, JCPyV, and MCPyV, also encode microRNAs downstream of the polyadenylation signal of the LVGR coding strand, inside the EVGR, and have been implicated in downregulating EVGR transcripts (1, 70–72).</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0012">The NCCR is specific to a given HPyV and its linear form is commonly designated the archetype (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0009">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0081">73</link>). The NCCR contains the origin of viral DNA replication (<emphasis>ori</emphasis>) and intertwined promoter/enhancer elements with different sets and orientations of transcription factor sites that control the bidirectional HPyV activity in concert with host cell-specific factors. Following nuclear entry, the HPyV nucleochromosome interacts with host cell proteins, including histone H1 and transcription factors targeting the NCCR. Depending on differentiation and activation of the infected host cell, the actual NCCR sequence either mediates silent HPyV genome persistence or activates viral reproduction, starting with EVGR expression, genome replication, LVGR expression, and virion release. Various activation states and signals have been identified, such as growth factors, corticosteroids, tacrolimus, cell division, and oncogenic transformation, as well as the intial binding of virions and VLPs to host cell receptors, promoting signal transduction events of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and mTOR pathways (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0082">74</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0086">78</link>). Notably, mutations and rearrangements of the BKPyV, JCPyV, and HPyV7 NCCRs have been identified in patients with HPyV diseases that activate EVGR expression, increase viral replication capacity in cell culture, and can broaden the host cell tropism. Prominent examples of HPyV NCCR rearrangements are JCPyV in the cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, BKPyV in plasma or allograft tissue of patients with nephropathy after kidney transplantation, or HPyV7 in skin tissue of patients with HPyV7-mediated hyperproliferative keratinopathy (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0087">79</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0095">87</link>). The direct detection of NCCR rearrangements by sequencing may serve as a virological marker of HPyV pathology. However, the high variability of NCCRs may interfere with HPyV detection using molecular assays targeting these sequences, as illustrated by the BKPyV genome conservation plot (<anchor id="ch0128s000000a0014"/><link linkend="ch0128s000000a0020">Fig. 3</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0128s000000p0013">The EVGR encodes two major regulatory proteins, small tumor antigen (sTag) and large tumor antigen (LTag), generated from one common mRNA by alternative splicing. In addition, smaller truncated T antigens have been detected in certain members of<emphasis>Betapolyomavirus</emphasis> (BKPyV and JCPyV), whereas members of <emphasis>Alphapolyomavirus</emphasis>, such as MCPyV and TSPyV, encode alternative or middle T antigens using a start codon in a +1 open reading frame (ORF) inside the <emphasis>LTAG</emphasis> sequence (<link linkend="ch0128s000000a0018">Fig. 2</link>). Although sTag and LTag share the amino-terminal domain of approximately 80 to 100 amino acids, their predominant intracellular locations and functions differ. The mostly cytoplasmic sTag modulates kinase signal transduction cascades, which includes binding to the protein phosphatase 2A complex. The LTag contains a nuclear localization signal and multiple functional domains, which interfere with pRb retinoblastoma and p53 protein functions, override cell division cycle control, and shift the host cell into S phase. Thereby, a hyperproliferative, transformed cell phenotype is assumed, which provides abundant enzymes and building blocks for efficient HPyV replication while inactivating programs of cell differentiation, DNA repair, danger signals, and apoptosis (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0009">1</link>). LTag contributes directly to HPyV genome replication by binding to the NCCR <emphasis>ori</emphasis>, assisting the separation of the double-stranded viral DNA by its helicase activity in two outwardly directed ATP-dependent molecular hexamer funnels and by recruiting the host DNA polymerase replication machinery to the viral replication forks. Moreover, LTag has been implicated in switching from EVGR to LVGR expression and subsequent capsid formation (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0096">88</link>). Changes in the viral genome, such as point mutations, truncations, chromosomal integrations, and NCCR rearrangements, may lead to uncoupling the EVGR expression from the LVGR expression and subsequent host cell lysis and thereby promote oncogenic transformation (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0097">89</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0098">90</link>). Clinical implications are the development of HPyV-associated neoplasms such as BKPyV-associated urothelial carcinoma and MCPyV-associated Merkel cell carcinoma (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0099">91</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0101">93</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0014">The functions of sTag and LTag are largely conserved among HPyVs and have the potential to complement or enhance genome functions from poorly replicating HPyVs. Notably, the monoclonal antibody PAb416 raised against the LTag of SV40 cross-reacts with LTag of BKPyV and JCPyV and has become the key immunohistochemistry tool for diagnosing BKPyV nephropathy or, less frequently, JCPyV-associated nephropathy and their associated malignancies. HPyV species-specific LTag antibodies have been described (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0102">94</link>). Since MCPyV LTag is not detected by PAb416 (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0103">95</link>), the diagnosis of MCPyV replication or its associated cancers depends on the use of other sets of antibodies detecting MCPyV LTag expression (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0104">96</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0105">97</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0015">The LVGR encodes the structural proteins Vp1 and Vp2/Vp3, which form the viral capsid. Each capsid protein contains its own nuclear localization signal, allowing it to enter the nucleus from the cytoplasm following translation or partial uncoating (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0009">1</link>). Capsid formation starts with Vp1 pentamers, their assembly with Vp2/Vp3, and the encapsidation of the nucleosomal viral DNA. Three-dimensional clusters of virions form the characteristic intranuclear inclusions, which appear as “ground-glass” areas in the enlarged nuclei. Transmission electron micrographs reveal nests of PyV particles (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0106">98</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0107">99</link>), often organized in regular, crystalline arrays that marginalize cellular chromatin (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0108">100</link>). Progressive viral replication eventually leads to cell exhaustion and lysis of the virion-laden cells to release viral progeny from the nucleus. The microRNAs are complementary to the EVGR transcript and may contribute to downregulation of <emphasis>LTAG</emphasis> expression and evasion of cytotoxic T cells. In addition, a number of smaller ORFs in sense and antisense orientations have been described, which require further characterization. Certain HPyVs, like BKPyV and JCPyV, encode a small regulatory LVGR leader protein called agnoprotein (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0109">101</link>), which increases the efficacy of viral replication by interfering with innate immune activation and disrupting the mitochondrial network surrounding the nucleus and the nuclear membrane (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0110">102</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0111">103</link>), thereby facilitating the lytic release of virions alone or in clusters by cell lysis (1, 104–107).</para>

So far, all HPyV diseases affect patients with inherited, acquired, or iatrogenic immunodeficiency. Given the lack of effective antiviral therapies, HPyV diseases represent significant complications for already vulnerable patient populations. Current interventions aim at improving HPyV-specific immunity. Though seemingly necessary, immunodeficiency is not sufficient for HPyV disease manifestation. Prominent examples are heart and lung transplant recipients, who rarely develop BKPyV nephropathy despite more intense immunosuppression than kidney transplant patients (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0116">108</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0119">111</link>). Kidney transplant patients rarely develop hemorrhagic cystitis, in contrast to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, despite equally high urine BKPyV loads of &gt;100 million copies/ml. Treatment of multiple sclerosis patients with the integrin-blocking monoclonal antibody natalizumab increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy by JCPyV to 10 cases per 1,000 patient-years but not the risk of other opportunistic infections. Similar rates of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy are observed in HIV/AIDS but the disease arises late after several other opportunistic diseases, such as pneumocystis pneumonia, toxoplasma encephalitis, chronic herpes simplex ulcerations, and Kaposi sarcoma. Together, the observations suggest that (co)factors specific to the clinical setting, the patients, or the target organ are important for the respective HPyV pathogenesis in addition to immunodeficiency. Accordingly, molecular and serological tests for screening and monitoring modalities have been established for some HPyV diseases, like BKPyV nephropathy in kidney transplant recipients or JCPyV progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in multiple sclerosis patients receiving natalizumab. For other HPyV diseases, the focus remains on optimized case-based diagnosis guided by symptoms, signs, and a high index of suspicion in immunocompromised patients.</para>

Thus, BKPyV is one of the most prevalent human viruses overall.

        <para id="ch0128s000000p0018">BKPyV-associated nephropathy results from immunologically insufficiently controlled BKPyV replication in renal tubular cells, leading to progressive damage of the affected nephron and progressive decline in renal function (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0121">113</link>). BKPyV nephropathy primarily affects kidney transplants and only rarely native kidneys in other immunocompromised patients (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0122">114</link>). In line with the persistence of BKPyV in the reno-urinary tract, the replicating virus mostly matches the one transplanted with the donor renal allograft, but rare cases result from allograft infection with recipient virus or from <emphasis>de novo</emphasis> transmission. Natural history studies indicate that 20% to 40% of kidney transplant recipients develop high-level BKPyV viruria in the first 3 to 6 months posttransplant, defined by urine BKPyV DNA loads of &gt;10 million copies/ml or by shedding of BKPyV-replicating epithelial cells, known as decoy cells. Approximately half of patients with high-level viruria (i.e. 10%–20% of all kidney transplant patients) develop detectable BKPyV DNAemia within 1 to 2 months, followed by declining renal allograft function over the next 1 to 6 months, which provides an indication for obtaining a renal allograft biopsy (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0123">115</link>). Biopsy-proven BKPyV nephropathy has been diagnosed in 1% to 15% of kidney transplant patients, but the rates depend on local biopsy policies. Notably, viral replication during early involvement is highly focal, affecting single nephrons, which may be missed by needle biopsy sampling (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0124">116</link>). Nevertheless, if a rate of only 10% BKPyV DNAemia/nephropathy cases is assumed for kidney transplant programs in North America and Europe, which have approximately 100,000 transplants per year, at least 10,000 patients per year are at risk for premature renal allograft failure and return to renal replacement therapies before the average time of 15 years, with dire prospects while waiting for retransplantation, all of which significantly increases health care costs (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0125">117</link>).</para>

The differential diagnosis includes other viral diseases presenting with intranuclear inclusions, such as JCPyV nephropathy, which also cross-reacts with the anti-SV40 LTag, human adenovirus (HAdV)-associated interstitial nephritis, or, rarely, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus infections.</para>

For simplicity, cost considerations, and specificity, most centers use plasma BKPyV loads for both, screening and monitoring. Observational studies suggest that clearance of BKPyV DNAemia/nephropathy is achieved in 50% to 80% of cases when immunosuppression is reduced early, at a stage of limited allograft involvement, before baseline serum creatinine concentrations are increased (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0131">123</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0133">125</link>).

        <para id="ch0128s000000p0025">BKPyV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis results from high-level BKPyV replication causing cytopathic denudation of the rarefied bladder uroepithelium, which results from subclinical conditioning damage, and hemorrhagic inflammation. BKPyV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis arises in 5% to 25% of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients within 6 weeks after engraftment, and it is rare in other immunodeficiency states despite similarly high urine BKPyV loads (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0059">51</link>). The diagnosis requires the triad of dysuria, macrohematuria of grade 2 and higher, and urine BKPyV loads of &gt;10 million copies/ml, as well as the exclusion of other significant etiologies. Approximately 60% of patients have detectable BKPyV DNA in plasma or serum, with viral loads between 1,000 and 10,000 copies/ml, which increases with the duration and the severity of the disease. Macrohematuria complicates the clinical course due to anemia requiring transfusions, clot formation (grade 3), and postrenal obstruction (grade 4). The latter can also result from ureteric inflammation and needs to be distinguished from renal involvement due to hematopoietic cell transplant-related renal toxicity or actual BKPyV nephropathy. BKPyV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis resolves after a median time of 3 weeks. However, 25% of patients remain symptomatic after 6 weeks, and 10% have died with active disease 10 weeks after onset (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0139">131</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0026">The pathogenesis of BKPyV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is incompletely understood and partly confounded by different case definitions and diagnostic procedures. Repeatedly reported risk factors include conditioning with cyclophosphamide, busulfan, or total body irradiation; unrelated or HLA-mismatched donors; and prophylaxis and treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0140">132</link>). Unlike BKPyV nephropathy, in which the donor’s virus is mainly implicated, BKPyV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation results primarily from the recipient’s virus during the immune gap after conditioning, which is followed by inflammatory exacerbation during engraftment of the innate immune effectors and delayed reconstitution of virus-specific immunity. Antiviral drugs, including quinolones, leflunomide, cidofovir, and brincidofovir, have not been found to have efficacy for prevention or therapy (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0073">65</link>). Reducing immunosuppression is often not possible because of the risk of precipitating or exacerbating GvHD in this setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Current management relies on uroprotection by hyperhydration to reduce urotoxic exposure, supportive therapy with analgesics, bladder irrigation as well as urologic intervention for clot removal, fulguration, nephrostomy, or even cystectomy (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0059">51</link>).

The risk of such genetic accidents is increased during high-level BKPyV replication due to insufficient proofreading and DNA damage repair favoring viral genome alterations and chromosomal integration (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0147">139</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0148">140</link>). These events may occur rather frequently in BKPyV-replicating cells, but cancer is not observed in immunocompetent populations. Therefore, insufficient immune control has been implicated in BKPyV-associated urothelial carcinoma, particularly the lack of sTag- or LTag-specific cytotoxic T cell immunity. It is therefore not surprising that BKPyV-associated urothelial cancers were identified in kidney transplant patients with prolonged BKPyV DNAemia/nephropathy (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0100">92</link>). BKPyV-associated urothelial cancers affect approximately 0.1% of kidney transplant patients and arise 5 to 10 years after transplantation. The clinical manifestations are similar to other urothelial cancers. Micro- and macrohematuria are often accompanied by an abnormal voiding sensation, intermittent obstruction, hydronephrosis, and lymphadenopathy triggering urologic and radiologic evaluation. BKPyV-associated urothelial carcinomas consist of carcinoma <emphasis>in situ</emphasis>, locally invasive carcinoma, metastasizing carcinoma of the urothelium (transitional-cell carcinoma), or less frequently tumors of the collecting duct (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0149">141</link>). Both the primary cancer and metastasis tissue show expression of the viral tumor antigens using the cross-reactive anti-SV40 LTag. The cancer cells are typically of donor origin and lack genetic driver alterations characteristic of BKPyV-negative cancers, such as mutations in fibroblast growth factor 3 and related downstream tyrosine kinase signaling or inactivating mutations of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and p53 function (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0150">142</link>). Ongoing BKPyV replication as well as cancer tissue turnover can contribute to BKPyV DNA loads in urine and plasma (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0151">143</link>), especially when EVGR sequences are targeted. This, together with abnormal urine cytology and decoy cells, may confound or delay the diagnosis of cancer (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0152">144</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0153">145</link>), but its potential as a laboratory follow-up marker is suggested. Treatment by surgical removal and chemotherapy is performed as for BKPyV-negative urothelial cancers, but recurrence is frequent. However, discontinuing immunosuppression and abandoning the kidney transplant may be life-saving.

HIV-1/AIDS and rituximab-treated patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy show only little histologic or radiologic evidence of inflammation.

Ten- to 1,000-fold-higher rates have been observed in patients with conditions or treatments that profoundly interfere with T and B cell immunity. The incidence among HIV/AIDS patients in the era before combination antiretroviral therapy has been estimated at 2.4 cases per 1,000 patient-years and 2.13 to 11.1 per 1,000 patient-years among JCPyV-seropositive multiple sclerosis patients treated for &gt;24 months with natalizumab (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0076">68</link>). The symptoms and signs of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy depend on the location and the extent of the lesions in the brain. Most patients develop some form of motor weakness, speech abnormalities, cognitive deficits, headache, ataxia, aphasia, and cranial nerve deficits but only rarely seizures. Notably, screening of multiple sclerosis patients by magnetic resonance imaging has led to the identification of early stages in asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0158">150</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0160">152</link>). Detection of JCPyV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of immunocompromised patients with compatible symptoms and signs is sufficient for a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (presumptive progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Identifying NCCR rearrangements and Vp1 mutations, such as L55F or S269T mutations, in the JCPyV genome can strengthen the laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0077">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0161">153</link>).

MCPyV is part of the normal human skin virome, with detection rates ranging from 30% to 80% (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0028">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0173">165</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0174">166</link>) (<link linkend="ch0128s000000a0010">Table 1</link>). The seroprevalence increases from less than 40% in children to more than 80% in adults over 60 years of age, arguing for continued lifetime exposure. Merkel cell carcinoma presents as rapidly growing shiny bluish-pink nodules located preferentially on sun-exposed body areas. The key features are summarized by the acronym AEIOU (asymptomatic, expanding, immunocompromised, older, UV light). The histopathology reveals dense cells with basophilic nuclei and minimal cytoplasm organized in trabecular, intermediate, small-cell, and mixed-type structures which stain positive for cytokeratin CK20 and for MCPyV LTag using MCPyV-specific antibodies. The incidence in the United States increased from 0.15 case per 100,000 person-years in 1986 to 0.7 per 100,000 person-years in 2013 (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0175">167</link>). The key risk factors are fair skin, chronic sun exposure, increasing age, and immunodeficiency, including HIV/AIDS, hematological malignancy, and transplantation. Among persons of white ethnicity, an approximately 3-fold rise is seen between the 4th decade and the 8th decade of life, reaching 10/100,000, with twice as many males than females. Presumably, extensive viral replication in systemically immunocompromised hosts synergizes with local effects of UV light inactivating resident immune cells and inducing mutations and accidental chromosomal integration of truncated MCPyV genomes (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0027">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0176">168</link>). Lytic viral replication is abrogated, while the transforming functions of sTag and LTag remain (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0104">96</link>), resulting in lasting inactivation of pRB, genomic instability, and Merkel cell carcinoma formation with rapid growth, local invasion, and metastasis. However, up to 20% of Merkel cell carcinoma lack detectable MCPyV genome integration and LTag expression, suggesting that other oncogenic pathways exist and can replace MCPyV-transforming functions. In MCPyV-negative Merkel cell carcinoma, a number of functionally equivalent genetic alterations are found, such as pRB-inactivating mutations (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0177">169</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0178">170</link>). Treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma is guided by staging at the time of diagnosis using clinical and pathological staging and consists of cancer and regional lymph node resection, local radiation, improving the underlying immunodeficiency, and chemotherapy (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0179">171</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0180">172</link>). Immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T cell transfer are being explored in clinical trials. The prognosis is poor, as the rapidly invasive and metastasizing tumor growth reduces the 5-year survival rates from 80% to &lt;20%. MCPyV serology for the shared N-terminal domain of small and large tumor antigen and MCPyV-specific T cells have been proposed as markers for predicting recurrence of Merkel cell carcinoma even before radiological or clinical signs appear (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0181">173</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0184">176</link>).</para>

Detection of HPyV7 DNA is not pathognomonic because of widespread asymptomatic colonization of the skin, but high viral loads and NCCR rearrangements support an etiologic attribution (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0095">87</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0187">179</link>).

The disease is also called pilomatrix dysplasia or calcineurin inhibitor-associated folliculodystrophy and shows painless folliculocentric papular eruptions on the face, spicule formation with distention of skin pores, loss of hair formation, which is most prominently visible by disappearance of eyebrows and eyelashes, and progressive thickening of the skin. Of the fewer than 100 cases in the literature, most patients suffered from hematological malignancies or were receiving immunosuppressive medication. The follicular keratinocytes are characterized by hyperproliferation with enlarged eosinophilic trichohyaline granules, enlarged cell nuclei with intracellular inclusions, prominent staining for the proliferation markers Ki67, LTag, and Vp1, and densely packed PyV particles, observed by electron microscopy (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0192">184</link>). Molecular testing reveals high TSPyV DNA loads of several million copies per microgram of DNA. The disease represents a replicative HPyV disease with transforming hyperproliferative features promoting spicules while interfering with hair formation.</para>
      <para id="ch0128s000000p0036">The high seroprevalence of 70% to 90% and the low disease manifestation in immunocompromised patient populations suggest the need for additional factors. In two cases, high TSPyV loads and seroconversion were documented, suggesting that the disease was the result of primary TSPyV infection rather than reactivation (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0193">185</link>). The diagnosis is based on the typical clinical features in an immunocompromised patient and skin biopsy, whereby immunohistochemistry and detection of high TSPyV loads represent adjunct tests. Treatment aims at improving the underlying immunodeficiency, reducing immunosuppression, topical cidofovir, and physical removal of spicules, whereas intravenous immunoglobulin administration may be of potential interest for modulating primary infection, but this has not been reported so far.</para>

In view of the high and very high seroprevalence of KIPyV and WUPyV, respectively, reactivation under inflammatory conditions seems likely, but the viral sites of persistence and the link between viral DNA detection and disease are presently still unresolved.

Important HPyV-specific aspects to be considered are contamination, degradation, fragmentation, and inhomogeneity of the submitted sample.</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0039">Contamination concerns arise from the fact that natural colonizers of external and mucosal body surfaces may be picked up when swabs, aspirates, body fluids, or tissues are analyzed qualitatively by sensitive NAT which may detect natural colonizers or bystanders rather than etiological pathogens. Examples are the detection of HPyV6 and MCPyV in skin biopsy samples from patients with HPyV7-associated hyperproliferative keratinopathy. In such cases, additional tests must be considered, such as determination of the (semi)quantitative genome viral load by quantitative nucleic acid testing (QNAT), assessment of the NCCR architecture, or performing complementary tests such as immunohistochemistry for specific viral proteins. For BKPyV and JCPyV, urine viral loads are extremely high in patients with nephropathy or hemorrhagic cystitis and frequently range from 10 million to 10 billion copies/ml. Thus, the risk of contamination is high at all steps of specimen acquisition, transport, aliquoting, and analysis. Patients, health care workers, and laboratory staff should have procedures in place to minimize the risk of transmission and contamination. Conversely, the detection of low-level BKPyV or JCPyV viruria is of little importance for most patients but is potentially important when assessing kidney donors.</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0040">Degradation of specimens may be avoided by following general good laboratory practices, keeping transport times short, ensuring cooling to 4°C, and avoiding drying as well as multiple freezing and thawing cycles. Urine for cytology to detect decoy cells is particularly susceptible to disintegration and requires direct near-patient processing by simple centrifugation and transferring the pellets into stabilizing buffers before shipment to the cytology laboratory (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0201">193</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0128s000000p0041">Fragmentation of viral DNA genomes may account for &gt;90% of the BKPyV loads in blood and increases the susceptibility to enzymatic degradation (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0062">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0064">56</link>). This explains the gradual loss of BKPyV loads after freezing and thawing of plasma (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0062">54</link>) and is expected to be even more important after coagulation and release of enzymes into serum, in whole blood, or in specimens with inflammatory cells, including cell-rich cerebrospinal fluids. As has been shown for cytomegalovirus (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0202">194</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0203">195</link>) and for BKPyV (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0062">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0064">56</link>), the analytical underquantification by QNAT using larger amplicons is further accentuated when unprotected genome fragments are subject to degradation during suboptimal preanalytical procedures. Although virions are considered stable in urine and in sewage, more than 90% of BKPyV genome loads in patients with high-level viruria correspond to nonencapsidated DNA susceptible to DNase I digestion (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0064">56</link>).

        <para id="ch0128s000000p0042">Inhomogeneity of the specimen is a concern when cells and debris, lipids, or autoantibodies, including cryoglobulins, are present, which can increase variability. For example, QNAT of urine or CSF will generate different viral loads if equal volumes are extracted from freshly resuspended material, postcentrifugation supernatants, or sediments. Once properly extracted, the HPyV DNA is considered stable for up to 1 year in clean, sterile, properly sealed, low-binding plastic tubes when refrigerated at temperatures between 4°C and 8°C or longer when frozen at −20°C or −80°C. However, inhomogeneity of DNA solutions also occurs due to clumping. This becomes particularly obvious when the number of molecules in the extract is very low or when limiting dilution standards are generated, and gives rise to stochastic, disproportionally higher copy numbers next to replicas with undetectable viral loads. Addition of commercially available unrelated nucleic acids, such as salmon sperm DNA and yeast tRNA, have been used to counter this effect, for example when preparing reference standards of low copy number. However, this needs to be judiciously balanced against unknown contaminants, and may confound results of massive parallel sequencing and microbiome approaches.</para>

Cytology of urine usually prepares sediments for simple smears or proper cytospins, which can be screened for enlarged cells with intranuclear opacities by phase contrast. The characteristic decoy cells (<anchor id="ch0128s000000a0041"/><link linkend="ch0128s000000a0044">Fig. 4</link>) can be conveniently identified by staining according to Papanicolaou or Sternheimer-Malbin (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0115">107</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0205">197</link>). Establishing standard operating procedures in the clinics defining optimal sample acquisition, prompt processing, and initial fixation before transport to the laboratory is key to the success of this technique in routine diagnostics. Automated reading is becoming available, and this facilitates higher throughput and reduces hands-on time. Cytospin preparations can also be examined upon hematoxylin-and-eosin staining or special stain combinations. Less frequently, urine cytospins are analyzed for HPyV antigen expression by the more costly immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence using HPyV-specific antibodies to Vp1, the cross-reactive anti-SV40 LTag antibody for detecting BKPyV or JCPyV replication, or the viral DNA by <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0206">198</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0207">199</link>).

In rare cases, cytospin preparations of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) have been reported to detect cytopathic changes compatible with HPyV replication.

This includes information about cell morphology, anatomic integrity, signs and markers of inflammation, immune deposits, and acuity or chronicity, and their semiquantitative extent of the lesions as well as any findings of an unexpected nature which trigger ancillary diagnostic procedures. Tissue can be obtained from procedures guided by ultrasound, endoscopy, computed tomography (CT), or digitally assisted stereotactic biopsy or from surgical explant or postmortem materials. Depending on the tissue or organ involved, hematoxylin-and-eosin staining is used first to obtain information about nuclear, cytoplasmic, and proliferative features and the overall extent of involvement. An organ-specific set of additional stains is used to address specific pathological features. For example, chronic fibrotic and vascular changes in renal tissue are visualized by Mason’s trichrome stain to detect collagen, muscle, and fibrin or glomerular and tubular structures, with emphasis on polysaccharides, which are visualized by periodic acid-Schiff stain (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0100">92</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0121">113</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0124">116</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0208">200</link>). Staining of specific markers assists in the evaluation, for example, staining for myelin or myelin-basic protein in neurological tissue samples.

Because of the high homology between BKPyV and JCPyV of &gt;70%, the specificity of the detection requires adequate stringency of the hybridization and washing conditions, which should be documented by negative controls consisting of the respective other virus.</para>
      <para id="ch0128s000000p0048">Nucleic acid testing (NAT) is the most widely used diagnostic approach to detect viral DNA genomes in specimens from patients with suspected HPyV infection. Although most assays are based on the amplification of defined target sequences, it should be noted that a generic term is preferred over “PCR” or “NAAT,” since there are numerous other commercially available methods for this purpose. These include ligase chain reaction, loop-mediated or strand displacement isothermal amplification, rolling-circle amplification, and combinations with lateral flow for near-patient testing but also signal amplification, for instance using novel biosensor approaches or CRISPR-Cas diagnostics (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0221">213</link>). CRISPR-Cas is particularly promising because of its high sensitivity and specificity, and it is amenable to quantification and multiplexing for generating infectious, cellular, or inflammatory profiles (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0222">214</link>). In the coming years, a multitude of novel NAT technologies are expected to undergo clinical and diagnostic studies to evaluate their utility (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0223">215</link>). This includes massive parallel sequencing and array approaches for RNA and DNA profiling of patient specimens, which will be combined with genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics and require algorithm- and artificial intelligence-assisted interpretation to integrate clinical and laboratory results (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0224">216</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0225">217</link>).

      <para id="ch0128s000000p0051">Relevant factors are the homogeneity of the specimen, the distribution of the HPyV genomic material at the time of collection, and the potential inhibition of extraction and amplification, which affect the proportionality, the reproducibility, and the comparability of the results. Specimens with a high cell count and correspondingly high cellular DNA content should not exceed the DNA-binding capacity of the binding matrices of magnetic beads or silica columns. The DNA concentration in the extracted eluates can be measured using spectroscopy or Nanodrop technology, and the integrity and size distribution can be measured by gel electrophoresis or by automated systems (TapeStation; Agilent;<ulink url="https://www.agilent.com/en/product/automated-electrophoresis/tapestation-systems/tapestation-dna-screentape-reagents">https://www.agilent.com/en/product/automated-electrophoresis/tapestation-systems/tapestation-dna-screentape-reagents</ulink>). This is recommended for cell-rich specimens to avoid overloading of the amplification reaction but is rarely necessary for the routine extraction of plasma or urine performed by automated methods. A rule-of-thumb approximation estimates that 150,000 diploid human cells corresponds to 1 μg of chromosomal DNA. Depending on the reaction volume, standard NAT samples of 25 μL or 50 μL should not exceed 25 ng or 50 ng of total DNA. Cryopreservation of viable PBMCs typically aims at 1 to 3 million cells per ml cryopreservation fluid, but cell counts reveal a viability of 50% to 80% at 12 h (6 h to 18 h) after thawing, providing a total DNA content between 3 μg and 20 μg. Cryopreservation for later qualitative DNA testing uses cell pellets of less than 1 million cells, which are directly stored at −80°C until extraction. Commercial sampling and buffer kits are available for cryopreserving DNA or RNA in diverse specimens for metagenomic and transcriptomic assessments. Skin and other tissue biopsy samples often require mechanical separation using sterile single-use materials, such as petri dishes, scalpels with appropriate security handling measures applicable to sharps, or sterile ground-glass bead-free enzyme and nucleic acids. Most such materials are extracted individually by hand according to laboratory-developed standard operating procedures using commercial kits providing extraction buffers, proteinase K, magnetic beads, or silica spin columns and the corresponding loading, washing, and elution buffers.</para>

Similarly, urine and plasma from allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation patients are tested for BKPyV DNA loads for diagnosis and follow-up. Serum is considered equivalent to EDTA-plasma, but the potential effects of coagulation and cell disintegration releasing proteases and nucleases may be difficult to control. Anticoagulation by citrate has been assumed to be equivalent to that by EDTA, whereas heparin is not accepted for routine diagnostics because of the significant inhibition of most currently employed NAT protocols.</para>
      <para id="ch0128s000000p0053">Depending on the clinical program, testing of the same specimen, such as plasma or whole blood, is also requested for other DNA viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), or HAdV. To achieve the numbers and volumes for comprehensive virological testing of transplant patients and to ensure comparability and reproducibility between follow-up results, clinical virology laboratories rely on automated nucleic acid extraction. Contrary to expert expectations and initial studies (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0228">220</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0229">221</link>), automated DNA extraction procedures in plasma are associated with significant differences in yield according to the molecular size and form of the viral target DNA. This was initially reported for plasma CMV loads (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0202">194</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0203">195</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0230">222</link>) but was later also confirmed for BKPyV loads (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0062">54</link>). The impact of DNA fragment size was addressed by a multicenter study comparing 11 commercial extraction procedures using chemically synthesized random sequences sharing the same NAT target, which were quantified by limiting dilution using digital droplet NAT. The DNA fragments ranged from 50 bp to 1,500 bp at copy numbers of 1 million, 100,000, and 10,000 per ml before extraction (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0231">223</link>). The automated extraction included systems widely used across different clinical virology laboratories (Qiagen QIAsymphony, Roche MagnaPure 96, Abbott m2000, and bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMag). Overall, poor yield and high coefficients of variation of &gt;16% were observed for DNA fragments of &lt;200 bp at the lowest input of 10,000 copies/ml. At 1 million copies/ml, the coefficient of variation was only 1% to 6%. Since international standards for viral load calibrators are based on larger DNA molecules, the effect of subproportional extraction of small viral DNA fragments of &lt;200 bp and ensuing assay variability will go largely unnoticed. However, NAT targets of &gt;200 bp will underestimate the viral DNA loads and hence the replicative capacity and viral burden, while providing results in the expected range for the international standards. The data point to a previously underestimated deficiency in proportionally extracting smaller DNA fragments.</para>
      <para id="ch0128s000000p0054">An international multicenter study on plasma CMV loads demonstrated that variability between laboratories can be abrogated if all centers apply the same fully automated procedure covering all steps from aliquoting and extraction to generation of results, including conversion into international units (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0232">224</link>). A similar fully automated approach to measure BKPyV loads in plasma using the cobas 6800/8800 instrumentation from Roche, which has been widely used to measure severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA loads in respiratory swabs, was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0233">225</link>). While this provides a novel opportunity for central laboratories and clinical studies, it also follows that extraction modalities, fragmentation, and NAT target size represent obstacles to the commutability of results from otherwise well-performed viral load assessments. Therefore, patient follow-up should be done by the same laboratory to ensure that the same extraction procedures and the same QNAT are performed with appropriate controls to allow identification of meaningful changes.</para>

Ideally, internal controls should have physicochemical properties similar to those of the actual viral target and should be run through the same processing and measuring steps in order to serve as a qualitative or quantitative indicator validating the results. Many commercially available and laboratory-developed NATs or QNATs use unrelated plasmids, phagemids, or viruses of unrelated species as internal controls, which are added in a copy number corresponding to the expected range of the results, e.g., from 10,000 copies/ml up to 10 million copies/ml. The internal controls can then be detected simultaneously with the viral target. If the copy number of the internal control is lower than a predefined threshold, usually 4-fold or &gt;0.5 log<subscript>10</subscript>, or is undetectable, insufficient extraction, degradation, and/or amplification inhibition must be suspected, and results must be flagged as potentially too low or as false negatives.

      <para id="ch0128s000000p0059">Commercial NATs or QNATs often divide the diagnostic runs into multiples of 8 or 12 tests, of which at least three slots per run are taken for the controls (one negative, one low-positive, and one high-positive control). Laboratory-developed QNATs typically use 96-well microtiter plates in order to ensure sufficient replicates of negative controls, extraction controls, quantification standards, and patient samples, usually in duplicates or in triplicates. Some laboratories also run patient samples spiked with a low-positive target amplification control of, e.g., 5,000 copies to rule out significant inhibition operationally defined for example as &gt;4-fold-lower or undetectable results. Pipetting schemes in data work sheets allow convenient planning of controls and replicates and calculation of volumes needed. In a generic approach to NAT or QNAT, the universal master mix containing the heat-resistant polymerase, deoxynucleotides, primers, probes, and nuclease-free water can be placed first using multichannel pipettes up to a volume of 20 μL, followed by the addition of 5 μL of the respective analytes, using all contamination precautions, including filter tips. Enzymatic decontamination with uracil-<emphasis>N</emphasis>-glycosylase represents a key barrier against amplicon contamination and requires replacing dTTP with dUTP, preincubation for 20 min prior to the hot-start denaturation, and up to 45 amplification cycles. Of note, uridine-containing amplicons cannot be rescued by direct cloning into plasmid vectors but need reamplification with deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) under special contamination precautions and preferably in laboratory locations outside the diagnostic units.</para>

      <para id="ch0128s000000p0061">Most qualitative NAT reports today are based on semiquantitative NAT assay formats that do not include all standards and procedures needed for attempting quantification. The diagnostic value of qualitative NATs in the clinical routine resides primarily in the analysis of sterile or NAT-negative human materials, which must be obtained by clean invasive procedures. For example, detecting JCPyV DNA in CSF or brain tissue has a very high positive predictive value for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immunocompromised patients with compatible neurological and radiologic abnormalities (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0240">232</link>). Conversely, primary testing of JCPyV in blood or urine is not informative for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy because of poor negative and positive predictive values (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0241">233</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0243">235</link>). The CSF assays for JCPyV DNA are recommended to have a limit of detection of &lt;50 copies/ml, but JCPyV DNA is undetectable despite repeated sampling in 10% to 30% of patients with eventually proven disease (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0244">236</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0245">237</link>). The detection rate depends on poorly understood factors, such as size and location of the pathology in the central nervous system (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0246">238</link>), but also on preanalytic processing and validated robust tests. The detection rate can be increased if the CSF is not cleared by centrifugation prior to nucleic acid extraction and if a sufficiently large volume, e.g., 1,000 μl, of native CSF is extracted and eluted into 100 μL, corresponding to a 10-fold concentration. If assay issues are excluded (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0247">239</link>), the impact of a false-negative CSF result is limited, since it is well documented that undetectable JCPyV DNA in CSF cannot rule out progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in an immunocompromised patient. In such cases, a stereotactic brain biopsy should be considered for histopathology and molecular testing (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0248">240</link>). Conversely, a false-positive result may have significant adverse consequences for patient management. Repeat sampling and sequencing may provide additional support if the JCPyV NCCR is found to be rearranged.

However, the absolute target copy number requires approaches, such as diligent, statistically supported limiting dilution, or techniques, such as digital-droplet NAT, which currently are not available or (cross)validated in the routine virology laboratory. Nevertheless,<emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>T</emphasis></subscript>and relative copy numbers are considered in the clinical validation, since they flag results relative to the standard curve as being in the high, intermediate, or low range of the assay. If the linearity of the assay is documented, results can be classified as detectable/positive above the limit of detection (LOD) but below the lower level of quantification (LLOQ) or as above the upper level of quantification (ULOQ). While the latter can be approached by retesting dilutions, the latter can trigger a careful evaluation of all run parameters and controls, if clinically meaningful, and repeat testing using fresh reagents or even new sampling, especially when replicates are discordant. For directly obtained biological fluids such as urine, plasma, serum, whole blood, and CSF, a normalization proxy is obtained by expressing the copy numbers per initial volume undergoing extraction. However, normalization to volume is problematic, since extraction procedures differ and the nucleic acid eluate may not be proportional, and it is even less straightforward for tissues or specimens with highly variable cellularity, such as whole blood, urine, BALF, and fluid obtained via puncture. The variability can be extreme, affect some cell types more than others, and change during the clinical course due to the underlying or coexisting medical condition or the respective treatment (e.g., sepsis, chemotherapy, drug toxicity, or hematopoietic cell transplantation). In addition, the content and fragmentation of cell-free DNA may further increase the variation coefficient. In some laboratories, the results are related to the internal control or to the copy number of human diploid genes, such as beta-actin, beta-globin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and aspartoacylase genes. Similarly, the urine composition is subject to physiological and pathological changes in protein, cellularity, electrolytes, and volume depending on hydration and fasting state. For virus-specific T cells, circadian changes have been reported, and midday samples may be most likely to yield reproducible results.

Independent studies using a different laboratory-developed assay reported similar plasma BKPyV DNA load results in kidney transplant patients (125, 258–262).

The Basel <emphasis>LTAG</emphasis>-(2.1)-133bp assay showed excellent precision in pooled urine samples containing subtypes III and IV but appeatred to underquantify the plasmid-derived comparator of subtypes Ia and Ib-2 by up to 10-fold (1 log<subscript>10</subscript> copies/ml). As more BKPyV genome sequences have become available, two exemplary updates of the Basel BKPyV-QNAT assay have been made available, which improve the quantification of subtypes and rare polymorphisms with frequencies of 1% (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0252">244</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0271">263</link>) and shorten the amplicon size from 133 bp to 88 bp to reduce the negative effect of BKPyV genome fragmentation on BKPyV DNAemia quantification (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0062">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0064">56</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0128s000000p0085">Despite the overall correlation of plasma BKPyV DNA loads in kidney transplant patients, the variability in the copy numbers of different assays and laboratories represents an obstacle to defining one uniform cutoff of 10,000 copies/ml (or equivalent). Several factors impact the quantification and the actual numbers of copies per milliliter of plasma, such as choice of viral gene target, extraction procedure, standards and standard curves, viral subtypes, and lack of robust calibrators and representation of BKPyV subtypes (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0272">264</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0275">267</link>). A study by Tan et al. (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0275">267</link>) compared conversion factors from copies to international units and reported that they are highly assay dependent, ranging from 1.09 for the Altona Real-Star BKV assay to 0.28 for a laboratory-developed BKV-Vp1 QNAT. Depending on which assay is being used, patients diagnosed with presumptive BKPyV nephropathy based on plasma BKPyV loads of &gt;10,000 copies/ml in one assay may have BKPyV DNAemia levels below the 10,000-copy/ml level in another assay. However, the 2019 AST-IDCOP guidelines recommend interventions for probable BKPyV nephropathy if plasma BKPyV loads persist above 1,000 copies/ml for &gt;2 weeks (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0121">113</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0276">268</link>). Another study of &gt;20 laboratories in 2013 and 2014 compared the performance of 5 commercial and 5 laboratory-developed BKPyV QNATs and reported a relevant variability, which was attributable to sequence polymorphisms in genotype IV and in the rare genotype II (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0277">269</link>). The qualitative agreement was high, &gt;99.3%, and all samples with BKPyV DNA loads of &gt;10,000 copies/ml were correctly identified as positive. The standard deviation of the viral loads ranged from 0.45 to 1.07 log<subscript>10</subscript> copies/ml with 68% being less than ±0.5 log<subscript>10</subscript>, but some outliers deviated by more than ±2 log<subscript>10.</subscript> Commercial tests such as the R-gene kit (bioMérieux), the RealStar kit (Altona), and the Artus-RG kit tended to perform better than the laboratory-developed QNATs. Notably, additional variability was introduced by the different nucleic acid extraction procedures, whereby the QIAsymphony and NucliSENS easyMag extractors showed a better performance for plasma and urine than the Roche MagnaPure 96 (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0277">269</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0128s000000p0086">The choice of the viral target gene sequence is key to the performance of the HPyV QNATs. Whereas the primer-probe design is conveniently assisted by a number of prediction programs, the challenge resides in the limited number of HPyV sequence data, which also applies to BKPyV and JCPyV, though they are among the top database entries. In addition, a reporting bias in the available sequences cannot be excluded, because they mostly originate from dedicated research in specific patient populations that test positive, while molecular studies on false negatives are rare. Similar to the early days of molecular HIV testing, the HPyV sequences may not be representative of the general population. This situation is expected to change as more next-generation sequencing (NGS) results from diverse study populations are generated and uploaded to public databases (7, 270–275).</para>
      <para id="ch0128s000000p0087">The design of a robust assay covering all relevant viral variants naturally focuses on highly conserved genome targets, for example, in the viral<emphasis>LTAG</emphasis> and <emphasis>STAG</emphasis> sequences, but must be highly specific to avoid the competing risk of cross-detecting other closely related HPyVs present in the same matrix, such as HPyV6, HPyV7, TSPyV, and MCPyV in skin samples (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0284">276</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0286">278</link>). This is also exemplified by testing urine (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0252">244</link>), which may contain both, BKPyV and JCPyV and hence requires the assessment of potential effects of excess target copy numbers, leading to occasional mispriming and loss of specificity. As expected from the low general serological cross-reactivity of HPyV VLPs, <emphasis>VP1</emphasis> targets in the outer loop contain very specific sequences. However, <emphasis>VP1</emphasis> sequence differences between subtypes or variants can lead to underquantification and detection failure (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0247">239</link>). Such sequence changes may also emerge during monitoring of patients as a result of intrapatient evolution (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0093">85</link>) and falsely suggest declining or cleared viral loads due to impaired detection efficacy. Such changes may also affect the immunological determinants of neutralizing antibodies in <emphasis>VP1</emphasis> (56, 279–282) and cytotoxic T cell epitopes in <emphasis>LTAG</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0064">56</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0291">283</link>). Genotype- and serotype-specific sequences and variants can contribute to the heterogeneity of the currently available standardization reagents and the international standards (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0292">284</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0293">285</link>) and thereby negatively affect attempts to optimize the calibration and commutability of BKPyV DNA load results across different patients, laboratories, studies, and clinics (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0062">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0064">56</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0274">266</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0275">267</link>). A recent compilation of 64 HPyV QNATs for 14 HPyVs was subjected to an <emphasis>in silico</emphasis> evaluation of 1,781 available sequences with respect to off-target and on-target detection while accounting for sequence variations (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0249">241</link>). Potential improvements were suggested through degenerate primers and adapting the annealing temperature in order to balance sensitivity and specificity of detection, but their clinical validation requires dedicated studies (<link linkend="ch0128s000000a0058">Table 2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0128s000000p0088">To increase the robustness of HPyV QNAT, dual-target assays have been developed in duplex format that combine the detection of two independent regions in one NAT reaction (called duplex), for example, one in the EVGR (<emphasis>LTAG</emphasis> or <emphasis>STAG</emphasis>) and one in the LVGR (<emphasis>VP1</emphasis> or <emphasis>VP2/VP3</emphasis>). QNATs for dual EVGR and LVGR target detection of BKPyV are able to detect most viral deletion variants, including the first WHO-approved international BKPyV NIBSC standard carrying a genome mixture with substantial deletions in the <emphasis>LTAG</emphasis> sequences (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0292">284</link>), whereas a single EVGR target assay leads to underquantification of patient BKPyV loads in plasma (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0062">54</link>). If the same fluorophore label is used and both targets are present in equimolar amounts and amplified with the same efficiency and without negative interference, then the average cycle threshold is expected to be reached one cycle earlier than with either target alone. This ideally 2-fold increase corresponds to the 0.3 log<subscript>10</subscript> copies/ml generally accepted for intra-assay variation. By the same token, more variability may be introduced sporadically, leading to a &lt;4-fold over- or underquantification which is not traceable if the same fluorophore is used. Further variability due to higher viral load results can be expected when dual-target assays with short amplicons (&lt;100 bp) effectively produce more than 4-fold (&gt;0.5 log<subscript>10</subscript> copies/ml)-higher viral loads than the average of chosen reference assays having amplicon sizes of &gt;150 bp (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0064">56</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0128s000000p0089">Recently, the cobas BKV kit became the first FDA-cleared, commercial BKPyV QNAT for plasma and urine BKPyV load quantification. The assay is based on TaqMan technology and uses the cobas 6800/8800 instrumentation from Roche for aliquoting, extraction, amplification, and result interpretation. Numbers of copies or international units per milliliter were established using the BKPyV genotype Ib from cell culture supernatants or the BKPyV WHO-approved standard. The linearity over 7 orders of magnitude was demonstrated with five BKPyV subtypes; the lower and upper limits of quantification in urine were determined as 200 IU/ml to 100 million IU/ml and the limit of detection as 12.2 IU/ml (95% confidence interval, 9.2 to 18.3 IU/ml). The assay was compared with unspecified laboratory-developed dual-target assay and showed high concordance in the range of 1,000 to 20 million IU/ml. In the Deming regression revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.98, a constant of 0.231 and approximately 2-fold higher values but in the acceptable &lt;0.5-log<subscript>10</subscript> range. Independent reports are pending that compare the performance of this assay with that of other BKPyV QNATs in the clinical routine. In summary, testing for genome loads of HPyVs such as BKPyV has become essential in today’s clinical virology laboratory but is challenged by many factors, including the lack of commutability and clinical validation. Nevertheless, BKPyV DNA loads in plasma have the potential to be used as biomarkers and clinical endpoints of BKPyV nephropathy, similar to HIV loads for determining the risk of the progression to AIDS (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0134">126</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0128s000000p0090">The isolation and propagation of HPyVs in cell culture are not a routine diagnostic procedure, since most viruses grow poorly or not at all in a variety of primary cells or cell lines. Except for BKPyV and JCPyV (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0023">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0024">16</link>), all HPyVs have been identified by molecular methods. Subsequent attempts to develop cell culture models have been largely unsuccessful outside dedicated research settings, where specific steps of the virus (patho-)biology of MCPyV, TSPyV, and WUPyV were investigated. Even for BKPyV and JCPyV, cell culture of clinical isolates is demanding because of the very slow replication of natural viruses with archetype NCCRs (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0294">286</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0295">287</link>) compared to variants with rearranged NCCRs, which confer significantly higher replication capacity (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0093">85</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0296">288</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0297">289</link>). This can be only partly overcome for some HPyVs by the expression of complementing functions of transgenes such as the SV40 LTag in cell lines such as COS-7 (ATCC CRL-1651 [<ulink url="http://www.atcc.org">www.atcc.org</ulink>]), 293T (ATCC CRL-3216), or 293TT (0508000 NCI-Frederick Repository Service, Frederick, MD, USA). The medium requirements and culture conditions are available from the suppliers. Although no data on the replicative capacity of HPyVs are available, NCCR rearrangements identified in HPyV diseases seem to also increase the EVGR expression compared to archetype NCCRs (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0081">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0298">290</link>). For BKPyV, the role of NCCR rearrangements became obvious, as they gave rise to more rapidly replicating, dominant majority species in cell culture after inoculation of archetype virus from urine specimens (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0294">286</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0295">287</link>). In fact, the currently available Gardner strain consists of a mixture of virus genomes with differently rearranged NCCRs. NCCR rearrangements are characterized by multiple deletions and duplications/insertions in the previously denoted transcription control region. NCCR rearrangements are thought to result from replication errors favored by impaired proofreading and nonhomologous end joining repair, while DNA damage responses are inactivated following LTag expression (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0009">1</link>). The rate of emergence appears to be modulated by host cell features, as certain transformed cell lines seem to facilitate faster emergence than slowly dividing near-normal diploid cells (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0299">291</link>). Cell culture-adapted variants like the BKPyV-Dunlop strain appear to be relatively stable, which is likely due to the fact that its NCCR rearrangements convey the near-maximal replicative capacity by short duplications and large deletions that cannot be optimized further. However, the corresponding plasmid, pBKV (34-2; ATCC 45025), contains 12 point mutations relative to the GenBank sequence, rather than the originally known 4 point mutations, which may impact diagnostic research and development (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0300">292</link>). BKPyV can be propagated in African green monkey kidney epithelial (Vero) cells (ATCC CCL-81) in COS-7 (ATCC CRL-1651) or in primary human proximal tubular epithelial cells (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0301">293</link>), which have become a model for BKPyV nephropathy (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0084">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0093">85</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0143">135</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0128s000000p0091">JCPyV cell culture is more demanding and is available in specialized research laboratories (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0302">294</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0304">296</link>), as it requires specific cell preparations such as human fetal brain progenitor-derived astrocyte cells (PDA) (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0305">297</link>). Naturally occurring rearrangements of the JCPyV NCCR similarly increase the EVGR expression and convey a higher replication capacity (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0094">86</link>). Glia cell line derivatives have been used with varying degrees of success, such as Hs683 (ATCC HTB-138), or rely on expressing the SV40 LTag, such as SVG-A (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0306">298</link>).

Interestingly, large deletions were noted in the NGS analysis of the BKPyV strain UT, suggesting that the transacting function of SV40 LTag expression permitted propagation of otherwise defective viral genomes.

Transfection of cell lines constitutively expressing the MCPyV sTag and LTag, e.g., 293-4 T, can be used for production of native MCPyV virions and analysis of MCPyV infectivity (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0309">301</link>). Although MCPyV is detectable on skin, the exact host cell reservoir is still poorly defined. Thus, new approaches to assessing MCPyV infection, replication, and carcinogenesis are warranted (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0220">212</link>). This also applies to identifying roadblocks of the secondary host cell tropism attributed to the lack of cellular factors needed for NCCR activation as well as to viral restriction mechanisms, which seem to favor MCPyV latency over lytic replication (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0310">302</link>). In the future, such information may be included in help to develop diagnostic profiling to assist in the definition of viral pathology and potential biomarker development.</para>

      <para id="ch0128s000000p0093">The available data on small-molecule compounds and drugs interfering with HPyV replication have been reviewed according to the steps of the HPyV life cycle and include targeting virus adsorption, uptake, transport, uncoating, gene expression, genome replication, processing, encapsidation, and release (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0073">65</link>). HPyVs encode only 5 to 7 viral proteins, which lack the obvious antiviral targets established for other DNA viruses. In fact, only the EVGR-encoded LTag has a direct function in the viral genome replication through its NCCR binding and its helicase activity. The clinical development of the herpes simplex virus helicase/primase inhibitor pritelivir could be a precedent for developing similarly specific compounds for the ATP-dependent helicase function of HPyV LTag (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0311">303</link>). However, a note of caution may be warranted, since inhibition of LTag-assisted viral genome replication is expected to block the subsequent (onco)lytic host cell lysis, needed to release the virions, and might therefore promote malignant transformation in an immunocompromised patient. In any case, novel approaches which target essential viral functions by interfering with protein-protein interaction, viral transcript abundance, and translation by using antisense RNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA), or microRNA or by targeting host cell functions should be explored. Once the drug target is defined, phenotypic and genotypic characterization of reduced susceptibility is expected to quickly follow by using up-to-date genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches.</para>

Therefore, phenotypic testing of antiviral susceptibility remains a research tool to identify antiviral compounds and support the development of antiviral drugs. Cell culture is largely limited to BKPyV in primary human renal tubular epithelial cells and urothelial cells or other cell lines, such as Vero or COS-1. JCPyV replication is more demanding, as outlined above, and usually requires hybrid NCCRs with SV40 or provision of LTag function in <emphasis>trans.</emphasis> However, novel developments are awaited that allow the complete viral life cycle and propagation of all other HPyVs, including MCPyVs. Antiviral drug testing usually starts with serial dilution of the drug or compound in order to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<subscript>50</subscript>) and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<subscript>50</subscript>). Dividing the CC<subscript>50</subscript> by the IC<subscript>50</subscript> provides the 50% selectivity index (SI<subscript>50</subscript>), which is an approximation of the treatment range. SI<subscript>50</subscript>s of more than 100 and a broad antiviral range identify promising candidates. Last, but not least, identifying specific inhibitors that block the oncogenic activity of sTag or LTag may provide a paradigm for treating hyperproliferative diseases and outright cancers. The characterization of brincidofovir (CMX001) illustrates potential approaches to antiviral drug susceptibility for HPyV in cell culture (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0312">304</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0316">308</link>).

Testing for HPyV-specific antibodies includes hemagglutination inhibition, indirect immunofluorescence, neutralization, and ELISA. Currently, commercial testing is available only in specialized laboratories using VLP-based ELISAs for BKPyV or JCPyV.

HAI titers is based on antibodies to viral capsid that inhibit the interaction with sugar structures on red blood cells and correlate with neutralizing-antibody titers.

Currently, neutralizing-antibody assays are not commercially available and require a dedicated research laboratory.

HPyV antigens are typically expressed as recombinant proteins in<emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>, yeast <emphasis>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</emphasis>, cell lines, or baculovirus-infected insect cells. Protein tags such as glutathione <emphasis>S</emphasis>-transferase (GST), streptavidin, 6×His, and Flag have been used for convenient purification, but nonmodified VLPs can be purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation. VLPs present a three-dimensional surface indistinguishable from virions or empty capsids generated during HPyV replication. Recombinant Vp1 spontaneously assembles into 72 pentamers, forming VLPs. VLPs are released by mechanical lysis and purified by ultracentrifugation. Smaller Vp1 assembly structures consisting of single or several pentamers are depleted, as their density is less than that of VLPs.</para>

Nonreactive sera, blocking reagents, and coated tags either alone or linked to an unrelated nonreactive protein from the expression system serve as negative controls. A preidentified reactive plasma/serum serves as a positive control, preferably in one or two predetermined dilutions in the range of optical density (OD) at 405 nm of 0.3 to 1.0 for normalization. Preincubation with the coating antigen or a related recombinant antigen serves to investigate specificity and cross-reactivity.</para>
      <para id="ch0128s000000p0101">VLPs are most widely used for the detection of HPyV-specific antibodies and can be used to coat the solid phase of a 96-well or 384-well plate. Following washing and blocking, serial dilutions of plasma or serum are added, and then unbound material is removed by a second washing step, followed by addition of the enzyme-coated secondary anti-antibody, a third washing step, and addition of the colorimetric reagents. The reaction is stopped, and the OD is measured at 405 nm (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0340">332</link>). Importantly, both the dilution of plasma or serum and the conformation of the HPyV VLPs influence the sensitivity and specificity of the results. Several studies indicate that intact HPyV VLPs show little cross-reactivity, but coating the solid phase may be associated with some deformation and exposure of masked internal epitopes with cross-reactive potential, as shown for the closely related pairs BKPyV and JCPyV, HPyV6 and HPyV7, and others (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0341">333</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0345">337</link>). The impact of the cross-reactivity can be assessed by preadsorption of the diluted plasma with intact VLPs. Preadsorption with the same HPyV VLPs will cause a significant decline of the specific antibodies and make it possible to determine the magnitude of the remaining reactivity.</para>

The 1:200 dilution was recommended for screening of unknown sera, whereas the 1:100 dilution proved to be very sensitive, making it possible to rule out reactivity at ODs of &lt;0.1, and the 1:400 dilution provided good specificity, making it possible to rule in reactivity at ODs of &gt;0.1 (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0340">332</link>).

        <para id="ch0128s000000p0110">The reporting of laboratory results requires the evaluation of all aspects of the preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical phases. The preanalytical review starts with assessing the type of specimen, its acquisition and modality of transport, its integrity upon arrival, aliquoting, and storage until processing. This process is defined in the respective standard operating procedures and allows handling of the most frequently submitted specimens, such as EDTA-blood, with greatest routine. As outlined above, special materials need special attention with regard to their processing and biosafety concerns. Deviations or abnormalities are recorded for traceability, judged for potential effects on the analysis or test results, and flagged with comments as deemed necessary. The analytical steps are cleared according to the performance of the predefined controls and the results evaluated in the context of the expected range for the matrix and the analytes. Outliers defined by the LOD, the LLOQ, the ULOQ, or the qualitative or quantitative discordance require special attention. Technical replicates of the same analyte and matrix represent independent measures of the noise associated with the protocol or equipment and should yield reproducible results. An obvious challenge are samples with low concentrations of the analyte, since stochastic detection occurs in replicative measurements. Accordingly, decisions are taken as to whether the analysis has to be repeated or whether additional procedures are indicated, such as independent confirmation by different test or obtaining new and/or additional patient materials. Technically validated results with sufficient medical plausibility are submitted to clinicians with all due comments regarding test performance, interpretation, or caveats. If possible, earlier results should be considered and reported to provide comprehensive information on the patient’s condition and follow-up. While the technical aspects are key to the laboratory expertise, the interpretation of unusual results benefits from a joint conference with the clinic to facilitate clinical decision-making, including further diagnostic procedures. The evaluation and interpretation of HPyV diagnostics is challenged by viral persistence, the possibility of primary and secondary viral replication, and replicative and nonreplicative pathology and disease.</para>

There is currently no established role of BKPyV-specific serology in the clinical routine laboratory pending further clinical studies, commercial availability, and licensing by health care authorities. Similarly, there is currently no role of measuring BKPyV-specific cellular immunity in the clinical routine laboratory, but corresponding studies are eagerly awaited.</para>

In the absence of brain tissue, the detection of JCPyV DNA by QNAT in CSF is sufficient for the laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of JCPyV progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (presumptive JCPyV nephropathy). The sensitivity of JCPyV QNATs is critical, and they should have a LOD of 10 to 50 copies/ml (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0252">244</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0375">367</link>).

A sufficiently large volume of 1,000 μl native CSF not cleared by centrifugation prior to nucleic acid extraction, and a 10-fold enrichment increases the sensitivity and makes it possible to reach the target LOD. In cases with undetectable JCPyV DNA in CSF, or other suspected etiologies, stereotactic brain biopsy should be considered if clinically feasible.

The specific detection of HPyV DNA has been reported using laboratory-developed HPyV QNATs (<link linkend="ch0128s000000a0058">Table 2</link>) (<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0043">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0062">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0128s000000li0250">242</link>–<link linkend="ch0128s000000li0255">247</link>). However, the detection or nondetection of HPyV DNA in a specimen may be difficult to interpret with respect to a given illness and usually requires a careful review of all available results, including histopathology, organ tissues, and distribution in specimens from healthy persons as well as an appreciation of the (semi)quantitative genome viral load, the NCCR architecture, and the detection of HPyV genome by <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization, or viral proteins if the respective tools are available in dedicated research or reference laboratories. Of note, in approximately 20% of cases, MCPyV DNA cannot be detected in Merkel cell carcinoma, but it may be detected in the normal skin virome. Similarly, assessment of HPyV-specific humoral and cellular immunity needs to be interpreted on a case-by-case basis and, if sufficiently well documented, may be worth communicating as referenceable reports.</para>

          <para>Histopathologic evidence of anti-SV40 LTag reactivity is found in a renal allograft biopsy, but BKPyV DNA is undetectable in plasma. In such a case, we consider three scenarios after ruling out any preanalytic issues with labeling, shipment, degradation, or storage. First, this is a very early focus of BKPyV replication that is not yet represented in the blood. This scenario is very rare and more likely if only one of several biopsy cores shows only one or few viral replication foci, if only medullary tissue is concerned, if little or no inflammatory infiltrates are seen (AST-IDCOP PyVAN-A), and if the biopsy sample was taken for surveillance according to protocol (e.g., 3 to 4 months posttransplant) and not for cause (e.g., declining renal function). In such cases, independent urine and plasma samples should be requested to test for BKPyV DNA by QNAT. If BKPyV DNA remains undetectable in plasma and the urine viral loads are low or undetectable, JCPyV nephropathy should be suspected and JCPyV QNAT should be performed to demonstrate high-level JCPyV viruria of &gt;10 million copies/ml. Notably, plasma JCPyV DNAemia is usually low or undetectable. Confirmatory evidence of JCPyV nephropathy can be obtained by JCPyV-specific immunohistochemistry or<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization or by demonstrating JCPyV DNA by QNAT in the biopsy material, while BKPyV DNA remains undetectable. Third, failure of molecular tests to detect BKPyV and JCPyV DNA loads in the expected range raises the question of false-negative QNATs because of mutations in the primer and probe sequences or the involvement of another HPyV. The former requires an independent assay targeting another genome region unless QNAT is already in a dual-target format. The latter would require an independent approach, such as metagenomics.</para>

          <para>Very high BKPyV or JCPyV loads of 10 to 1,000 million copies/ml (7 to 9 log<subscript>10</subscript>) are found in a plasma sample. Such high values are rarely seen in plasma. In the absence of earlier samples, the submitted specimen might actually be a urine sample indicative of possible BKPyV or JCPyV nephropathy. Mislabeling is indirectly supported if a corresponding time-matched “urine” sample has significantly lower or undetectable viral loads. This is a trivial but not an infrequent occurrence when urine and plasma from the same patient are used for screening or monitoring in kidney transplant or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant programs and can arise in the clinic as often as in the laboratory. If available, the results should be compared with those from earlier urine or plasma samples. Additional analyses of proteins, electrolytes, creatinine, or osmolarity make it possible to distinguish urine and plasma samples. However, these efforts are usually resource- and time-consuming and cannot replace the ordering of an independent repeat sample to provide actual results. If mislabeling can be ruled out and the result is confirmed, significant BKPyV or JCPyV pathology must be assumed and searched for in the reno-urinary tract, the central nervous system, and other sites (e.g., liver, lung, and gastrointestinal tract). One example is the rare case of metastasizing BKPyV-associated urothelial carcinoma in patients having corresponding risk factors, including a history of prolonged HPyV replication.</para>

          <para>JCPyV DNA loads are found in urine of multiple sclerosis patients evaluated for natalizumab treatment. As outlined above, JCPyV-specific serology using the Stratify-2 assay is recommended for this objective. Moreover, the interpretation of urine JCPyV DNA load is limited to a qualitative interpretation of “detectable” as meaning that the patient is infected with the virus, whereas a result of “undetectable” cannot rule out JCPyV infection; this also applies to plasma JCPyV loads. Multiple sclerosis patients with detectable JCPyV viruria must be considered to be at risk for developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, but the risk cannot be ruled out in cases of “undetectable” results. Also, higher urine JCPyV loads do not predict an increased risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. In fact, the rate of detectable JCPyV DNA in urine among patients with proven JCPyV progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is not significantly different from that in the general population. Thus, the positive and negative predictive value of JCPyV DNA loads in urine and blood require further study.</para>

The results are further compromised if the CSF sample is precleared by centrifugation. The limited sensitivity and very low negative predictive value need to be communicated, and an appropriate sample, consisting of at least 1,000 μl of representative native CSF, should be requested.

Since a false-positive result may have dramatic consequences for the patient, including therapy decisions regarding the underlying disease, particular scrutiny of the reagent control and contamination control is highly advisable. Since contamination can be manifested as a stochastic event, a repeat analysis of the analyte using entirely new and unopened reagents has become our principal practice, and an independent CSF sample is requested because of the consequences associated with the diagnosis of presumptive progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.</para>
