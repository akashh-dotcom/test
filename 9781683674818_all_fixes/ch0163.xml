        <para id="ch0163s0000p0002"><emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> are intraerythrocytic protozoan parasites that cause malaria and babesiosis, respectively. Both are transmitted through the bite of an infected arthropod and cause significant human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although they differ in their epidemiology and life cycle, there is overlap between both clinical and diagnostic features of these two parasites, and for these reasons, they are discussed together in this chapter.</para>

          <para id="ch0163s0000p0003"><emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> are apicomplexan parasites within the supergroup SAR, clade Alveolata (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0001">1</link>). Within the Alveolata, these two genera belong to the clade Apicomplexa (formerly Sporozoa), a large complex group of eukaryotic single-celled parasites characterized by a specialized apical complex used for host cell penetration and an apicoplast (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0002">2</link>). The apicoplast is a plastid organelle thought to have been acquired by an ancient secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga and its chloroplast. Unlike its chloroplast precursor, the apicoplast is not involved in photosynthesis and instead is thought to be involved in the synthesis of heme, lipids, and isoprenoids (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0002">2</link>). Within the Apicomplexa, <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> is located within the Haemosporida (SAR: Alveolata: Apicomplexa: Aconoidasida: Haemosporida: <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis>) and <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> falls within the Piroplasmorida (SAR: Alveolata: Apicomplexa: Aconoidasida: Piroplasmorida: <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis>). See <ulink url="ch0159#ch0159s10001">chapter 136</ulink> for further information about these taxonomic placements.</para>

Despite there being at least 200 named <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species, only four are considered major causes of human malaria: <emphasis>Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0004">4</link>). These species designations were originally based on morphologic characteristics, with <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> being one of the last to be described due to its morphologic similarities to <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0005">5</link>). Multilocus genetic analysis identified the presence of polymorphisms in <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis>, leading to the description of classic and variant strains (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0006">6</link>). It is now widely accepted that <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> comprises two closely related subspecies that coexist in the same geographic regions without interbreeding: <emphasis>Plasmodium ovale curtisi</emphasis> (classic strain) and <emphasis>P. ovale wallikeri</emphasis> (variant strain) (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0007">7</link>).

Individual cases have also been reported from western travelers to Southeast Asia, including individuals from Finland, Sweden, Austria, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0014">14</link>).

        <para id="ch0163s0000p0006">Malaria is arguably one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly half of the world’s population is at risk of acquiring this disease (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0004">4</link>). Extensive global control efforts have reduced malaria incidence from 81 cases per 1,000 population in 2000 to 56 in 2019. Unfortunately, the incidence increased to 59/1,000 in 2020 due, in large part, to disruption in health care and preventive services during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0015">15</link>). There were an estimated 241 million new cases and 627,000 deaths in 2020 (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0004">4</link>). Approximately 96% of deaths occur in the WHO African region, where a close link between malaria mortality and poverty is observed. Eighty percent of deaths occur in children less than 5 years of age (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0004">4</link>).</para>

The Office of Malaria Control in War Areas was established in the United States in 1942 to control malaria and other vector-borne diseases in the country (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0018">18</link>). This Office was the precursor to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which was founded in 1946 with the primary mission of preventing malaria from spreading across the country (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0018">18</link>). Malaria was eliminated as a significant public health problem in the United States and Europe by the mid-20th century (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0018">18</link>). Competent anopheline vectors remain in both countries, but the risk for reintroduction is low due to rapid diagnosis and treatment of imported cases in conjunction with robust public health disease surveillance and vector control measures (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0019">19</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0163s0000p0014">The<emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> parasite is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected <emphasis>Anopheles</emphasis> mosquito (<anchor id="ch0163s0000a0015"/><link linkend="ch0163s0000a0016">Fig. 1</link>), and competent mosquito vectors are found throughout the world. A list of countries with endemic malaria is available through the CDC Yellow Book (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0020">20</link>). Today, cases of malaria in the United States and Europe are almost exclusively imported by individuals traveling from countries with ongoing malaria transmission, although occasional autochthonous cases have been reported (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0021">21</link>–<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0024">24</link>). In the United States, most imported malaria is detected in individuals who travel to countries of endemicity to visit friends and relatives (so-called VFRs) (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0025">25</link>). These individuals often do not consider themselves to be at risk for malaria and do not commonly seek travel advice from their physician or take malaria prophylaxis (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0026">26</link>). They also demonstrate behavioral and travel patterns which place them at heightened risk for infection, including travel to remote regions, extended stays, and failure to use insect repellent and insecticide-treated bed nets (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0026">26</link>). The CDC reported 1,724 cases of malaria with symptom onset in 2014, with five fatalities (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0025">25</link>). This is similar to the number of cases observed in 2013 (1,741) (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0025">25</link>). In cases where the purpose of travel was known, VFRs accounted for the largest group of infected individuals (44.9%), followed by refugees/immigrants (8.5%), business representatives (6.6 %), missionaries and their dependents (6.0%), students/teachers (3.9%), and tourists (3.7%) (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0025">25</link>). <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> was responsible for most cases (66.1%), followed by <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> (13.3%), <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> (5.2%), and <emphasis>P. malariae</emphasis> (2.7%). The species was not determined in 202 (11.7%) cases, and less than 1% had infections due to two species (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0025">25</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0163s0000p0015">Less common means of malaria transmission are blood transfusion and transplacental transmission. In 2014, the CDC detected no transfusion-related cases of malaria and one congenitally acquired case, making these extremely rare means of transmission in the United States (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0025">25</link>). In most countries where malaria is not endemic, the blood supply is partially protected through use of screening questionnaires that defer individuals from donating blood if they have recent travel to countries where malaria is endemic or have had malaria recently. In the United States, the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) previously recommended that individuals traveling to areas of endemicity be deferred from donating blood products for 1 year after their return, while previously infected patients and those living in regions of endemicity for 5 years or more be deferred for 3 years after successful treatment (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0027">27</link>). In the light of significant blood shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these guidelines were recently updated to shorten the deferral period from 1 year to 3 months after traveling to an area of malaria endemicity (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0028">28</link>).

Sporozoites infect hepatocytes (step 2) and undergo asexual reproduction to form schizonts (step 3) in a process called exoerythrocytic schizogony (A). After 5 to 15 days, liver schizonts rupture to release hundreds of thousands of merozoites into the blood (step 4), which then infect erythrocytes (step 5). <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> have a dormant hypnozoite stage which may remain in the liver and cause relapsing disease weeks to months later, while other human <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species do not have this stage. In erythrocytes, merozoites undergo asexual reproduction to form trophozoites and then schizonts in a process called erythrocytic schizogony (B). Schizonts rupture to release merozoites, which then infect other erythrocytes (step 6). This process is repeated every 1 to 3 days, resulting in the production of thousands to millions of infected erythrocytes in several days. Some merozoite-infected erythrocytes do not undergo asexual reproduction but instead develop into male microgametocytes and female macrogametocytes (step 7). When ingested by a female <emphasis>Anopheles</emphasis> mosquito during a blood meal (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0008">8</link>), microgametocytes exflagellate to release microgametes, which penetrate macrogametes and form zygotes (step 9) via sexual reproduction in the sporogonic cycle (C). Zygotes become motile and elongated to form ookinetes (step 10), which invade the mosquito’s midgut wall and develop into oocysts (step 11). Over a period of 8 to 15 days, oocysts grow, rupture, and release thousands of sporozoites (step 12), which travel to the mosquito’s salivary glands to be inoculated into a new human host during the mosquito’s next blood meal (step 1).

        <para id="ch0163s0000p0016">Patients are asymptomatic for the initial 7- to 30-day (or longer) incubation period, during which parasites replicate in the liver (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0029">29</link>–<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>). It is only with the emergence of parasites from the liver and into the bloodstream that symptoms occur due to destruction of host erythrocytes, release of parasite antigens, and subsequent host cytokine production (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>). The classic malarial fever paroxysm lasts 6 to 10 h and begins with rigors and chills, followed by an abrupt onset of fever (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>). The paroxysm resolves with profuse sweating and a return to normal temperature. With time, infected cells may begin to rupture in synchrony, producing the classic (but infrequently observed) tertian or quartan fever cycles (<link linkend="ch0163s0000a0006">Table 1</link>). Fever is commonly preceded or accompanied by severe headache, malaise, and myalgias (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0163s0000p0017">The signs and symptoms of malaria are nonspecific and may mimic those of many other febrile conditions. Therefore, malaria must always be in the differential diagnosis when patients with exposure to regions of malaria endemicity are evaluated, even when the primary presenting manifestations are respiratory or gastrointestinal in nature (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>). Infection can range from mild or asymptomatic disease, usually in individuals with preexisting immunity, to severe, life-threatening disease. Severe malaria is associated with high mortality and is defined by the presence of one of more features, including impaired consciousness, multiple convulsions, respiratory distress, shock, abnormal bleeding, jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, severe anemia, renal impairment, hyperlactatemia, and hyperparasitemia (more than 100,000 parasites/μl of blood) (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>). Young children, nonimmune individuals, and pregnant women and their fetuses are at greatest risk of severe disease (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0163s0000p0018"><emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> infection has the highest morbidity and mortality of the four human <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species, being responsible for nearly all cases of severe malaria and malaria deaths worldwide (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>). <emphasis>P. knowlesi</emphasis> and, less commonly, <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> can also cause fatal infections (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>). The high morbidity and mortality of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> infection are attributed in part to the parasite’s ability to infect and destroy all stages of erythrocytes, leading to high levels of parasitemia and resultant severe anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice. In contrast, the other <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species preferentially infect older erythrocytes (<emphasis>P. malariae</emphasis>) or young erythrocytes (<emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis>) and cause a lesser degree of total erythrocyte destruction (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0029">29</link>–<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0163s0000p0019"><emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> virulence is also attributed to a phenomenon called cytoadherence, accomplished through insertion of parasite-derived adhesion molecules from the <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (<emphasis>Pf</emphasis>EMP1) family onto the surface of infected erythrocytes during later stages of parasite development. The <emphasis>Pf</emphasis>EMP1 molecules allow clumping of uninfected erythrocytes around infected erythrocytes (rosetting) and receptor-mediated cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells (sequestration) (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0033">33</link>). Accumulation of infected erythrocytes within the microvasculature is associated with metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, and release of detrimental inflammatory cytokines, particularly in the lung, kidney, and brain. During pregnancy, a special form of cytoadhesion occurs between infected erythrocytes and syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0033">33</link>). Symptoms resulting from the high <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> parasitemia and sequestration in the microvasculature include acute renal failure, respiratory distress, abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, mental status changes, coma, and death. Other <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species do not sequester and generally cause less severe disease (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0030">30</link>). Prior to the advent of highly effective artemisinin combination treatments (ACT), even uncomplicated falciparum malaria was associated with a case-specific mortality rate of 0.1%, and delays in treatment or drug resistance increased the mortality rate to approximately 1%. Today, the mortality rate associated with uncomplicated falciparum malaria is less than 1% when ACT is used (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0034">34</link>). Rapid treatment is essential for patients with severe malaria, as the mortality approaches 100% without effective antimalarial treatment, particularly in patients with cerebral involvement. With prompt treatment, the mortality rate of patients with cerebral malaria is approximately 10 to 20% (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0163s0000p0021">Since<emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> infection can cause rapidly progressive, fatal disease, blood collection and testing for malaria should always be performed on a stat basis (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0035">35</link>–<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0037">37</link>). Preparation of thick and thin blood films is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of malaria. If a laboratory does not have the expertise to perform examination of thin and thick blood films, then consideration should be given to use of rapid antigen tests for preliminary screening (see “Clinical and Laboratory Diagnosis,” below) or rapid transport to a neighboring laboratory that can receive and test the blood shortly after it is drawn. Testing options for malaria should be available 7 days a week on a 24-h basis (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>–<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0038">38</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0163s0000p0022">Blood may be collected via finger prick with immediate (bedside) preparation of thick and thin smears. However, it is more common in settings where malaria is not endemic to collect blood by venipuncture for rapid transport to the laboratory (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>). EDTA is the preferred anticoagulant, as the use of other anticoagulants such as heparin may cause significant parasite distortion (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>). Prolonged storage in EDTA may also cause parasite distortion, parasite maturation into sexual life cycle stages, and loss of diagnostic features such as stippling; therefore, blood films should be prepared within 1 h of collection (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0038">38</link>). A single set of blood films may be insufficient to detect <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> parasites. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommends preparation of two thin and two thick blood films upon initial evaluation of the patient, with preparation and examination of repeat films every 6 to 8 h if necessary for up to 3 days before excluding malaria from the clinical differential diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>). Similarly, the CDC recommends that repeat blood films be examined for nonimmune individuals every 12 to 24 h for a total of three evaluations before malaria is ruled out (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>).</para>

Accurate interpretation of this time-honored method relies on the availability of trained and experienced microscopists, high-quality reagents, and well-maintained light microscopes. The thick film contains 1 or 2 drops of blood that have been lysed (laked) on the slide by placement into a hypotonic solution (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0038">38</link>). This releases intracellular parasites and allows examination of 20 to 30 layers of blood. The thick blood film is approximately 10 to 20 times more sensitive than the thin film, with a reported detection threshold of 10 to 50 parasites/μl of blood, or approximately 0.0002 to 0.001% parasitemia, assuming a total erythrocyte count of 5 × 10<superscript>6</superscript>/μl of blood (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0041">41</link>). Given this high sensitivity, the thick film is ideal for screening and parasite detection. Under field conditions, the estimated sensitivity may be somewhat lower (100 to 500 parasites/μl of blood) (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0042">42</link>).</para>
            <para id="ch0163s0000p0026">Given the greater sensitivity of the thick film than the thin film, efforts should be made to quickly prepare and examine a thick film so that it can be used as the primary screening method. A common mistake is to use too much blood on the slide, thus requiring longer times for the film to dry. A well-made thick film should be approximately 1.5 to 2.0 cm in diameter and of such a thickness that newsprint can barely be read through it (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>). Drying of the thick film can be enhanced by placing the slides in a laminar flow hood or under the gentle breeze from a fan. Exposure to heat is not recommended, since it may cause fixation of the blood and interfere with the laking process (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>). Gently scratching grooves into the carrier slide with the edge of another glass slide while spreading the blood to the appropriate diameter will facilitate adhesion to the slide and obviate extended drying times without negatively impacting the microscopic morphology (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0043">43</link>); films may be safely stained as soon as the film is visibly dry (generally within 30 min).</para>

            <para id="ch0163s0000p0028">Staining of thick and thin films is best performed with Giemsa stain at a pH of 7.0 to 7.2 to highlight potential stippling and other features of the parasites (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>) (see <ulink url="ch0161#ch0161s0001">chapter 138</ulink> for further information on malaria stains). Wright-Giemsa stain may also be used, but such staining is typically performed at a pH of 6.8, which will not adequately highlight Schüffner’s stippling and Maurer’s clefts. The Field stain is useful for rapid diagnosis but is not recommended for routine use in settings of nonendemicity (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0040">40</link>). The CDC provides additional guidance for processing specimens when hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Ebola virus are suspected (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/laboratories/safe-specimen-management.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/laboratories/safe-specimen-management.html</ulink>). After staining, a well-prepared thick film should have a relatively clean background of lysed erythrocytes, leukocyte nuclei, and platelets, while thin films will demonstrate pale blue-gray to light pink erythrocytes and a well-formed feathered edge. Parasites will have pale to deep blue cytoplasm and pink-red chromatin (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>).</para>

Examination of 200 to 300 microscopic fields on thick and thin films using the 100× objective should be performed before a specimen is reported as negative (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>).

The species of the infecting organism can be determined using the thick film, but this is best accomplished using the thin film. Thin films provide ideal erythrocyte and parasite morphology for species determination, since they are fixed in methanol prior to staining, thus maintaining the structure of the erythrocytes and intraerythrocytic parasites (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>).

Stippling and Maurer’s clefts are most commonly seen when smears are made shortly after blood collection and the pH of the Giemsa stain is 7.0 to 7.2 (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>–<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0038">38</link>).</para>
            <para id="ch0163s0000p0031">The life cycle stages present are also very useful for species identification. Infection with<emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> usually consists solely of early trophozoites (rings) and, less commonly, gametocytes; intermediate stages (maturing trophozoites and schizonts) are only rarely seen, since they are sequestered in the microvascular beds. When intermediate stages of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> are present, they may indicate severe, overwhelming infection. In contrast to <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis>, a spectrum of forms including late stage trophozoites and schizonts are commonly seen with other species (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0040">40</link>).</para>
            <para id="ch0163s0000p0032">When peripheral blood films are examined, it is important to remember that mixed malaria infections are occasionally seen and that<emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> may be found in conjunction with less virulent species in the same patient. It is also important to remember that other microorganisms may be seen on peripheral blood films such as <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> intraerythrocytic parasites (see the section on <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> below) and extracellular microfilariae (<ulink url="ch0171#ch0171s0001">chapter 148</ulink>), trypanosomes (<ulink url="ch0164#ch0164s0001">chapter 141</ulink>), and <emphasis>Borrelia</emphasis> spirochetes (<ulink url="ch0079#ch0079s0001">chapter 62</ulink>). Intraleukocytic <emphasis>Ehrlichia</emphasis>/<emphasis>Anaplasma</emphasis> morulae may also be seen on the peripheral blood film, although PCR is the preferred method for detection of these bacteria (see <ulink url="ch0085#ch0085s0001">chapter 68</ulink>).</para>
            <para id="ch0163s0000p0033">When<emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species are identified, it is important to quantify the degree of parasitemia to help guide initial therapy, predict patient prognosis, and monitor response to treatment. This may be done using either the thin or thick film, and formulas for this purpose are widely available (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0044">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0047">47</link>). When the thick film is used for quantification, it is common practice to express the number of parasites in relation to a standard number of leukocytes per microliter of blood (8,000/μl), although it is preferable to substitute the patient’s actual leukocyte count when known. Results are reported as the number of parasites per microliter of blood. When the thin film is used, results are reported as the percent infected erythrocytes in the fields examined (number of infected cells counted/total number of erythrocytes counted × 100). When calculating the degree of parasitemia with either the thick or thin film, it is important to not include parasite sexual stages (gametocytes) in the total count, since they are not infectious to humans and are not killed by most antimalarial drugs. With the thin film, it is also important to count consecutive fields, even if they do not include parasites, and to not count extracellular parasites. Erythrocytes containing more than one parasite are counted as only a single infected cell. Regardless of the method used for calculating the degree of parasitemia, it is important to use the same method for initial and posttreatment specimens (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0042">42</link>). Given the possibility of interobserver variability, it may be prudent to limit the number of individuals performing the assessment on sequential specimens from the same patient.</para>

            <para id="ch0163s0000p0034">Other microscopic methods are less commonly used for the identification of malaria parasites in whole blood, including stains for nucleic acid and hemozoin (<anchor id="ch0163s0000a0035"/><link linkend="ch0163s0000a0052">Table 3</link>). Of these, the most commonly used is acridine orange (AO), a DNA-binding fluorescent dye that is excited at 490 nm, producing a yellow or apple green fluorescence (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0042">42</link>). Use of this method requires a fluorescence microscope or light microscope with appropriate adaptor. Identification of infected cells is relatively straightforward, since mature erythrocytes lack DNA and do not produce a fluorescent signal, while parasites contain DNA and fluoresce brightly. However, leukocyte nuclei and Howell-Jolly bodies within erythrocytes will also fluoresce, occasionally making identification of low parasite levels challenging. A number of studies found AO staining to have a similar sensitivity and specificity to traditional Giemsa-stained thick films, with the ability to reliably detect &lt;100 parasites/μl, or 0.002% parasitemia (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0042">42</link>). This method may also allow more rapid screening than traditional Giemsa-stained films (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0042">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0048">48</link>). Another technique that uses AO staining is the centrifugal quantitative buffy coat (QBC) technique (Drucker Diagnostics, Philipsburg, PA). In this method, whole blood is stained with AO and spun in a microhematocrit tube that contains an internal float. The buffy coat and adjacent red blood cell layer in the microcentrifuge tube are then directly examined using a fluorescence microscope with a specialized long-focal-length objective (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0042">42</link>). Clinical studies using the QBC show the best sensitivity and specificity for detecting <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis>, since the early trophozoites are easily identified within the red-cell layer (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0042">42</link>). Lower sensitivities have been reported for other species, since mature trophozoites, schizonts, and gametocytes of these parasites may be hidden in the granulocyte layer. Also, the early trophozoites of all species may be indistinguishable, and thus, definitive species identification is not always possible. When any of the DNA-binding fluorescent dyes are used, it is important not to mistake positively staining nuclear debris and Howell-Jolly bodies for parasites (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0042">42</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0163s0000p0038">In general, malaria RDTs perform almost as well as microscopy for detection of<emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> at moderate or high parasite levels but suffer from lower sensitivity for detection of non-<emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> infections and low levels of parasitemia for all species (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0050">50</link>). While parasite levels of 100 parasites/μl (0.002% parasitemia) are commonly seen in the clinical setting, many RDTs cannot reliably detect parasites at this level, even when the infecting species is <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0050">50</link>). The WHO, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), and the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) launched a massive study in 2006, comparing commercial RDTs for their ability to detect <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> at high (2,000 to 5,000 parasites/μl) and low (200 parasites/μl) concentrations. Their eight published rounds of product testing clearly demonstrated that RDT performance varies widely by kit, manufacturer, and even lot number (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0050">50</link>). In one of the initial evaluations, the FDA-approved BinaxNow malaria test had 100% sensitivity for detection of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> at high levels but sensitivities of 91.1%, 85%, and 10% for detection of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> at low levels, <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> (high levels), and <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> (low levels), respectively (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0051">51</link>).

Of these, the most commonly used method is PCR, with the 18S small-subunit rRNA gene being the most common target (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0039">39</link>). Numerous conventional (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0056">56</link>–<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0058">58</link>) and real-time PCR formats, including digital droplet and reverse transcription PCR (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0059">59</link>–<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0063">63</link>), have been described for <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> detection, species/subspecies differentiation (including <emphasis>Plasmodium ovale curtisi</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. ovale wallikeri</emphasis>), and identification of parasite markers of resistance to antimalarial drugs (see “Treatment and Prevention” below). Most PCR assays are laboratory developed, although some CE-marked commercial test kits exist, including the artus malaria RG PCR kit (Qiagen, Helsinki, Finland), RealStar malaria PCR kits (altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany), Geno-Sen’s malaria real-time PCR kit for <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> (Genome Diagnostics, New Delhi, India), and the malaria RealAMP kit (OSANG HealthCare, Anyang, Republic of Korea). The Loopamp malaria Pan/Pf detection kit (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) and Illumigene malaria (Meridian Bioscience, London, United Kingdom) are also CE marked and use LAMP for detection of <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species to the genus level. The Loopamp kit also has primers for specific detection of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. vivax.</emphasis> Unfortunately, no nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been approved or cleared by the FDA for <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic use.</para>
          <para id="ch0163s0000p0052">Although there is tremendous variability between published assays, PCR-based tests are generally recognized as having improved sensitivity over the traditional thick film, with detection limits below 10 parasites/μl of blood. Some tests have also been validated for use with dried blood spots (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0064">64</link>). Scientists at the National Institute for Medical Research in London, United Kingdom, have described a nested conventional PCR capable of detecting at least 6 parasites/μl (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0065">65</link>), while a reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR has a reported detection limit of 0.002 parasite/μl (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0039">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0066">66</link>). A quantitated <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> standard is available through the WHO (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0067">67</link>) which can be used to determine the analytical sensitivity of new and existing molecular assays. Saliva and urine have also been investigated as a less invasive source for malaria detection by PCR but have generally shown lower sensitivity than PCR when whole blood is used (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0068">68</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0163s0000p0053">PCR-based tests for detection of<emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> nucleic acid are primarily limited to specialized reference or public health laboratories and are not generally suited for rapid diagnosis in the clinical setting. However, they may be useful for detection of low parasitemia, confirmation of suspected infection, differentiation of <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> from <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> parasites, <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species determination (e.g., when morphologic expertise is lacking or low parasite burden precludes definitive species identification), and sensitive detection of mixed infections (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0037">37</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0163s0000p0054">Despite the potential advantages of PCR assays, implementation in resource-limited settings where the disease is endemic poses many challenges due to the associated expense and need for highly specialized equipment and facilities. Isothermal amplification techniques such as NASBA and LAMP offer simpler and less expensive tests for detection of<emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> DNA and RNA, respectively, but these tests play only a small role in routine clinical care (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0070">70</link>).

          <para id="ch0163s0000p0055">When positive results are obtained with malaria nucleic acid tests, thick or thin blood films should be examined so that the percent parasitemia can be determined. Quantitative PCR may one day replace the subjective manual parasite counts, which suffer from lack of interobserver reproducibility, but it is important to note that the results do not correlate well with the conventionally obtained percent parasitemia. This is because conventional counts do not include gametocytes and extracellular forms, and multiply infected cells are counted only once; in contrast, PCR detects nucleic acid from each parasite in the specimen.</para>

Treatment decisions are based on several factors, including the clinical severity of disease, the region where the infection was acquired, drug resistance (when known), the species of the infecting parasite, patient age and pregnancy status, the ability of the patient to take oral medications, previous antimalarial use, and other drugs that the patient is receiving. When infection is with either <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> or <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis>, primaquine or tafenoquine must be administered in addition to a standard antimalarial agent in order to eradicate the dormant liver hypnozoite forms of these parasites, thus underscoring the need for accurate species identification by the laboratory (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>). The glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) status should be checked prior to administering primaquine or tafenoquine, due to the known hemolytic complications of treatment with these agents in G6PD-deficient individuals (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>).</para>

Chloroquine was a mainstay of treatment and prophylaxis for many years, but due to widespread <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> resistance, ACTs are now the front-line therapy for <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> malaria (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0084">84</link>). A key driver of resistance is substandard therapies, including counterfeit drugs, poorly administered antimalarial drugs, and use of artemisinins without a complementary combination drug (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0084">84</link>). Country-specific information on circulating <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species and associated drug resistance can be found in the CDC’s Yellow Book (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0020">20</link>) and malaria web page (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>).

Artemisinin compounds (e.g., artesunate and artemether) have been recognized as superior drugs for malaria treatment and are now recommended as first-line therapy for both uncomplicated and complicated disease by the WHO in combination with other antimalarial agents (ACTs) (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>). Unfortunately, decreased <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> susceptibility to artemisinin compounds was detected in <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> strains more than a decade ago along the Thai-Cambodian border (greater Mekong subregion), a historic site for emerging resistance to antimalarial agents, and these strains are now prevalent across this region (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0088">88</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0089">89</link>).

Outside the greater Mekong subregion, significant levels of ACT failure are primarily due to resistance to the partner drug rather than the artemisinin component.

        <para id="ch0163s0000p0062">Detection of malaria parasites by any diagnostic method is considered a critical result and must be reported to the clinical team immediately. The final report for blood smear evaluation should include the<emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species and calculated degree of parasitemia. It is important to convey when a mixed infection or late-stage forms of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> are suspected, since these findings may have treatment implications. Similarly, parasite loads above 100,000 parasites/μl (approximately 2% parasitemia) in nonimmune individuals is indicative of severe disease requiring urgent therapy (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0032">32</link>). Parasite levels above 10% may suggest a role for exchange transfusion, although this is no longer recommended by the CDC (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0083">83</link>).

It is important to note that asexual forms of the parasites may be seen in repeat blood films for 2 to 3 days following appropriate treatment and that the degree of parasitemia may rise during the first 12 to 24 h of treatment. However, if the level of parasitemia does not fall by 75% in the first 36 to 48 h of treatment or parasites are still present after day 3, then parasite resistance or lack of patient compliance with treatment should be considered. Gametocytes may circulate for 2 weeks or more, since they are not killed by most antimalarial drugs, and therefore, they should be excluded from the parasite count or reported separately (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0031">31</link>).</para>

National U.S. surveillance was begun in 18 states where babesiosis is endemic and in New York City on 1 January 2011 (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0112">112</link>), with 1,124 probable and confirmed cases reported in the first year. The majority of cases were reported by just seven states; in increasing order, these were Minnesota, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and New York. The majority of patients were ≥60 years of age (range, 1 to 98 years), and most did not recall a tick bite (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0112">112</link>). Babesiosis is now a reportable disease in 40 states and the District of Columbia (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0111">111</link>).

In nature, disease is maintained between invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Humans readily become infected but are considered dead-end hosts. <emphasis>Ixodes scapularis</emphasis> (the blacklegged or deer tick) and <emphasis>Ixodes ricinus</emphasis> (the castor bean tick or sheep tick) are the most common vectors in the United States and Europe, respectively (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0093">93</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0114">114</link>). The primary vertebrate host in the life cycle of <emphasis>B. microti</emphasis> in the United States is the white-footed mouse, <emphasis>Peromyscus leucopus</emphasis>, and other rodents and shrews may serve as the host for <emphasis>B. microti</emphasis> cases in Europe (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0093">93</link>). The primary hosts for <emphasis>B. divergens</emphasis> and <emphasis>B. venatorum</emphasis> in Europe are cattle and deer, respectively. Following a tick bite, <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> sporozoites enter the blood and directly infect circulating erythrocytes to form trophozoites resembling malarial parasites. There is no liver stage as seen in malaria and thus no latent exoerythrocytic forms. Trophozoites divide asexually via budding, rather than schizogony as in malaria, to form similar-appearing merozoites and gametocytes (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0107">107</link>). Lysis of infected erythrocytes releases merozoites into the blood, where they infect new erythrocytes. As with malaria, sexual reproduction with fertilization of the gametes occurs in the gut of the arthropod host. Fertilized gametes migrate across the intestinal wall and travel to the salivary glands to develop into sporoblasts. The final step in maturation occurs when the tick takes a blood meal; sporozoites develop from the sporoblasts and are injected into the host during the final hours of feeding. The seasonality of babesiosis corresponds with the activity of the tick vectors, with most cases occurring in the spring, summer, and fall (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0093">93</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0163s0000p0070">Less commonly, human babesiosis is acquired through receipt of infected blood products (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0116">116</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0117">117</link>) or by vertical transmission across the placenta (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0118">118</link>).

Significantly fewer cases of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis have been reported in Europe (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0116">116</link>). As expected, most implicated blood donations were collected during times of the year when ticks are active; however, a number of cases occurred from blood donated in the winter. In the latter cases, the original infections were presumably acquired by donors during the tick biting season and remained dormant in the blood for months without causing symptoms. Most transfusion-transmitted cases have been associated with the receipt of whole blood, but cases associated with whole-blood-derived platelets have also been reported (<link linkend="ch0163s0000li0116">116</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0119">119</link>, <link linkend="ch0163s0000li0121">121</link>). There are now several FDA-licensed assays for use in blood donor screening.

I. scapularis</emphasis> has a four-stage life cycle that generally lasts 2 years and includes vertebrate hosts (including rodents, deer, and humans), where each mobile tick stage has a blood meal on a different individual host. During the first year, mated adult female ticks detach from the vertebrate host to overwinter (step 1) and lay eggs in the spring. Eggs hatch in spring (step 2), and larvae attach to their first vertebrate host, usually small rodents or birds (step 3). The six-legged larvae feed on the first host, generally in late summer, and may become infected with <emphasis>B. microti</emphasis> while taking a blood meal. Engorged larvae leave the host, overwinter, and molt into nymphs (step 4). In the spring of the second year, nymphs attach to a second vertebrate host (e.g., rodents, deer, and humans) (step 5) and in the fall leave the second host to molt into adults and attach to a third vertebrate host, such as deer and humans (step 6). <emphasis>B. microti</emphasis> has a two-host life cycle including <emphasis>I. scapularis</emphasis> as the definitive host and a vertebrate intermediate host. In the tick (step 7), gametes ingested while taking a blood meal undergo sexual reproduction, leading to the eventual formation of infectious sporozoites. In the mammalian host (e.g., rodents or humans) (step 8), sporozoites initiate the erythrocytic cycle, resulting in the formation of trophozoites that divide asexually by budding. Subsequently, trophozoites transform into merozoites and perpetuate the erythrocytic cycle or into gametes, which are ingested by ticks during a blood meal to initiate the sexual cycle. All mobile stages of <emphasis>I. scapularis</emphasis> may acquire <emphasis>B. microti</emphasis> parasites from infected first or second vertebrate hosts, but only nymphs and adults transmit parasites.
