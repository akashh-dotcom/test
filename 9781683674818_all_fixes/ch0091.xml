      <para id="ch0091s0000p0001">Determination of the antimicrobial susceptibilities of significant bacterial isolates is one of the most important functions of the clinical microbiology laboratory. From the physician’s pragmatic point of view, the results of susceptibility tests are often considered as important as or more important than the identification of the pathogen involved. This is particularly true in the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, in which treatment options are at times limited to more toxic or newer, more costly antibacterial agents. As a result, the laboratory must give high priority not only to rapidly producing technically accurate data but also to reporting those data to physicians in an easily interpretable manner.</para>
      <para id="ch0091s0000p0002">The main objective of susceptibility testing is to predict the likely outcome of treatment with the antimicrobial agents tested. Results are generally reported as categories of susceptibility (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0002">2</link>). The implication of the result category “susceptible” is that there is a high probability that the patient will respond to treatment with the appropriate dosage regimen for that antimicrobial agent. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) category “susceptible—dose dependent” and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) category “susceptible—increased exposure” indicate that a higher or more frequent dosing of the drug or a modified drug infusion time may be required to obtain appropriate antibiotic exposure for the organism tested (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0002">2</link>). The result “resistant” implies that treatment with the antimicrobial agent is likely to fail due to inadequate drug exposure.</para>
      <para id="ch0091s0000p0003">CLSI methods also include an “intermediate” category of susceptibility, which can have several meanings (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0004">4</link>). With agents that can be safely administered at higher doses (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins), this category may imply that higher doses may be required to ensure efficacy or that the agent may prove efficacious if it is normally concentrated in an infected body fluid (e.g., fluoroquinolones in urine). Conversely, for body compartments where drug penetration is restricted even in the presence of inflammation (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid), it suggests that extreme caution should be taken in the use of the agent. For CLSI, it also represents a test buffer zone that prevents truly resistant strains from being incorrectly categorized as susceptible, and vice versa. The EUCAST methods have a special category for the buffer zone, called the area of technical uncertainty, which for their breakpoints is required for only a small number of bacterium/antimicrobial combinations and is not reported to the physician. It serves as a prompt to consider further testing (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0002">2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0091s0000p0004">A further aim of susceptibility testing is to guide the clinician in the selection of the most appropriate agent for a particular clinical problem. In most clinical settings, susceptibility test results are usually obtained 24 to 48 h or more after the patient has been given empirical treatment. The test results may confirm the susceptibility of the organism to the drug initially prescribed or may indicate resistance, in which case alternative therapy will likely be required. Where possible, the report describing the susceptibility testing results should provide the clinician with alternative agents to which the organism is susceptible. These alternatives also may be useful if the patient subsequently develops an adverse reaction to the initial antimicrobial agent. There is a growing emphasis from professional societies, managed-care organizations, and institutional stewardship programs on the use of susceptibility test results to direct therapy toward the most narrow-spectrum, least toxic, and least expensive agent to which the pathogen should respond. This is particularly true for hospitalized patients, because the rate of antimicrobial resistance tends to be higher in such patients and because it is easier to make therapeutic changes for inpatients than for outpatients. This makes the accuracy of susceptibility testing critical for effective patient care.</para>
      <para id="ch0091s0000p0005">In recent years, there have been advances in rapid detection of important resistance genes or phenotypic resistance in organisms recovered in blood cultures by use of molecular tests or phenotypic methods. Commercial molecular systems have been developed which use PCR or microarray techniques with results available in 1 to 2 h (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0005">5</link>–<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0009">9</link>). Phenotypic methods can produce results in 2 to 6 h, and they indicate not only microbial resistance to some drugs but also drugs to which an isolate is susceptible (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0010">10</link>). There are several ways this has been accomplished, either directly from a positive blood culture or from reducing the time of a subculture.</para>

      <para id="ch0091s0000p0006">The clinical microbiology laboratory should routinely perform susceptibility testing only with pathogens for which well-standardized methods are available and pathogens whose resistance is known or suspected to be a clinical problem; susceptibility testing should not be performed on normal microbiota or colonizing organisms. Currently, routine susceptibility testing methods are best standardized for rapidly growing common aerobic and facultative bacteria and systemic antibacterial agents. For some uncommon or highly fastidious bacteria and for most topical antibacterial agents, simple routine test methods have not been standardized. Taking into account this limitation, the CLSI has released recommendations on how some anaerobic (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0011">11</link>) or uncommon or fastidious (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0012">12</link>) bacteria may be tested and the results interpreted. EUCAST provides recommendations for disk testing for some common anaerobic bacteria (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0013">13</link>). With some pathogens (e.g., <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> and invasive fungi), routine testing is important for patient management, but testing is best performed by specialized laboratories in which test volumes are sufficient to maintain technical proficiency and where unusual or inaccurate results are likely to be recognized. Susceptibility testing methods for certain other pathogens (e.g., mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, legionellae, spirochetes, viruses, protozoa, and helminths) may not be well established at present and/or are limited to a few specialty laboratories. A number of choices exist in antibacterial susceptibility testing with respect to methodology and selection of agents for routine testing.</para>

        <para id="ch0091s0000p0007">Clinical microbiology laboratories can choose from among several conventional and novel methods for the performance of routine antibacterial susceptibility testing. These test methods include the broth microdilution, disk diffusion, antimicrobial gradient, and automated instrument methods. Commercial broth microdilution and automated instrument methods are often used instead of the disk diffusion procedure. There are numerous advantages to commercially available automated microdilution methods, including the ability to test a large number of drugs, ease of use, and automated reading of MIC tests. However, there remains interest in the disk diffusion test because of its inherent flexibility in drug selection, its ability to test new drugs or those with changed breakpoints prior to this testing becoming available in commercial test systems, and in some cases its low cost. While most commercial test systems provide a reasonable number of choices of antibacterial agents to test, the diversity of antimicrobial agent formularies of different institutions has made it difficult for manufacturers of commercial test systems to provide standard test panels that fit every laboratory’s needs perfectly. The inherent flexibility in drug selection that is provided by the disk diffusion test is an undeniable asset of the method. The test is also one of the most established and best proven of all susceptibility tests and continues to be updated through annual CLSI (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0001">1</link>) and EUCAST (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0014">14</link>) publications. Instrumentation, although not frequently employed, is available for reading and interpreting zone diameters as well as storing this information, and it may reduce interobserver reading errors (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0016">16</link>). It is common for laboratories to use both commercial systems and disk diffusion and/or gradient strips to meet all of their antimicrobial susceptibility testing needs.</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0008">Advantages of the microdilution and agar gradient diffusion methods include the generation of a quantitative result (i.e., an MIC) rather than a category result, the ability to test accurately some anaerobic or fastidious species that may not be accurately tested by the disk diffusion method, and the ancillary benefits of computer systems and other forms of laboratory automation that accompany many of the microdilution and automated systems (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0017">17</link>). Indeed, computerized management systems are very important in laboratories that may have limited or inflexible laboratory information systems. Generating an MIC is necessary for interpretation of the activity of a few drugs with certain organisms (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins with pneumococci, and vancomycin with staphylococci) (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0003">3</link>). However, an MIC method should not be chosen on the basis that MICs are routinely more useful to physicians (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0018">18</link>). There is no clear evidence that MICs are more relevant than susceptibility category results to the selection of appropriate antibacterial therapy for most infections (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0018">18</link>), although the integration of MIC results into a more detailed and patient-focused report has been suggested (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0019">19</link>). In addition, caution is required when using any MIC generated by a single test to make dosage adjustments based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0020">20</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0009">A laboratory may choose to perform rapid detection of some resistance mechanisms by molecular testing or by rapid phenotypic testing. Several methods have been described for rapid phenotypic testing. Studies on disk diffusion using inoculation directly from positive blood cultures are ongoing and have been described by both CLSI and EUCAST. Some microorganism/antibiotic combinations can be read at an earlier time frame (e.g., 6 to 8 h), while others require the normal overnight incubation for disk diffusion (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0021">21</link>). Direct susceptibility testing from positive blood cultures has also been accomplished on a limited basis in the past by rather laborious processing of blood culture broth sediment and direct inoculation into a susceptibility testing instrument with a shorter incubation time (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0012">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0013">13</link>). There have also been limited studies showing that inoculation of commercial overnight susceptibility panels directly from positive blood cultures with no processing of the blood culture broth, as opposed to inoculation from a subculture, yields acceptable results (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0022">22</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0010">More recently, studies have examined reducing the time a culture or subculture is incubated before setting up disk diffusion testing, and comparable results were obtained when the culture (or subculture) had 6-h growth and when an overnight culture was used to set up the test (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0023">23</link>). Commercial systems, such as the Accelerate Pheno, are available (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0010">10</link>), and more rapid phenotypic susceptibility systems are under development in order to generate results for bacteremic patients faster than routine growth-based methods. The provision of susceptibility results one or more days sooner than that provided by conventional growth-based methods seems a logical advance in patient care, especially in cases of bacteremia (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0025">25</link>). The impetus for more rapid susceptibility tests has been boosted by the introduction of very rapid (same-day) identification of bacterial pathogens into routine laboratories using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0027">27</link>). Also evolving are whole-genome sequencing technologies capable of detecting critical or unusual resistances that can impact antimicrobial treatment (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0029">29</link>). Several studies have demonstrated both the clinical and economic benefits derived from the use of rapid susceptibility testing and reporting (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0030">30</link>–<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0034">34</link>), while one earlier study did not show such a benefit (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0035">35</link>). However, rapid susceptibility testing results may not have a substantial impact unless the appropriate antibiotics are available to be tested on the rapid system employed and the laboratory uses more intensive means of communication to make physicians aware of the results (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0036">36</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0091s0000p0011">The laboratory has the responsibility to test antimicrobial agents and report those that are most appropriate for the organism isolated, the site of infection, and the clinical practice setting in which the laboratory functions. The battery of antimicrobial agents routinely tested and reported by the laboratory will depend on the characteristics of the patients under care in the institution and the likelihood of encountering highly resistant organisms. A laboratory serving a tertiary-care medical center, which specializes in the care of immunosuppressed patients, may need to routinely test agents that are broader in spectrum than those tested by a laboratory that supports a primary-care outpatient practice in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are less commonly encountered.</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0012">When a laboratory’s routine susceptibility testing batteries are determined, several principles should be followed. First, the specific antimicrobial agents that are included in the institution’s formulary and that physicians prescribe daily should be tested whenever possible. Second, the species tested strongly influences the choice of antimicrobial agents for testing. The CLSI publishes tables that list the antimicrobial agents appropriate for testing against various groups of aerobic and fastidious bacteria (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0012">12</link>). The guidelines indicate the drugs that are most appropriate for testing against each organism group and for treatment based upon the specimen source (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine, or feces). The lists also include a few agents that may be tested as surrogates for other agents because of the greater ability of a particular agent to detect resistance to closely related drugs (e.g., the use of the cefoxitin disk test to predict β-lactam resistance in staphylococci) (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0001">1</link>). This initial list of agents must be tailored to an individual institution’s specific needs through discussions with infectious disease physicians, pharmacists, and committees concerned with infection control, antimicrobial stewardship, and the institutional formulary (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0001">1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0013">A third important step in defining routine testing batteries is ascertaining the availability of specific antimicrobial agents for testing by the laboratory’s routine testing method. Certain methods (e.g., the disk diffusion, gradient diffusion, and in-house-prepared broth and agar dilution methods) allow the greatest flexibility in the selection of test batteries. In contrast, a commercial microdilution panel of test agents may have less flexibility in agent selection, but the large diverse array of antimicrobial agents and the ease of use may compensate for this. Some commercial systems may experience delays in adding the latest antimicrobial agents approved for clinical use. However, practicality limits the maximum number of drugs that can be tested simultaneously with an isolate by any susceptibility testing method. Most commercial microdilution test panels attempt to resolve this problem by testing a larger array of antimicrobial agents, although some may be in a limited concentration range.</para>

        <para id="ch0091s0000p0014">There is general agreement that the MIC is the most basic laboratory measurement of the activity of an antimicrobial agent against an organism. It is defined as the lowest concentration of an agent that will inhibit the growth of a known concentration of a test organism (approximately 5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml [range, 2 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> to 8 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml]) over a defined interval related to the organism’s growth rate, most commonly 18 to 24 h. The MIC is the fundamental measurement that forms the basis of most phenotypic susceptibility testing methods and against which the levels of drug observed over time in human body fluids may be compared to determine breakpoints for defining susceptibility.</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0015">The conventional technique for measuring the MIC involves exposing the test organism to a series of 2-fold dilutions of the antimicrobial agent in a suitable culture system (e.g., broth or agar for bacteria). The 2-fold dilution scheme was originally used because of the convenience of preparing dilutions from a single starting concentration in broth or agar. Subsequently, this system proved to be meaningful because an antimicrobial’s MICs for a single bacterial species in the absence of resistance mechanisms have a statistically normal distribution when plotted on a logarithmic scale. This provides investigators with the opportunity to examine the distributions of MICs for bacterial populations and distinguish isolates for which the MICs are abnormally high (above the epidemiological cutoff value) (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0037">37</link>) from those for which MICs are normal (i.e., the wild type) (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0038">38</link>) (see <ulink url="https://mic.eucast.org/search/">https://mic.eucast.org/search/</ulink>).</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0016">MIC measurements are influenced<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> by several factors, including the composition of the medium, the size of the inoculum, the duration of incubation, and the presence of resistant subpopulations of the organism. The <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> test conditions also do not encompass other factors that can have an influence on <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> antimicrobial activity. These include sub-MIC effects (measurable antibacterial effects below the MIC), postantibiotic effects, protein binding, effects on organism virulence or toxin production, variations in redox potential at sites of infection, and the pharmacokinetic differences in drug level profiles in blood and at the site of infection over time. Nevertheless, if determined under standardized conditions, MIC measurements provide a reference point for the determination of PK/PD target values with the power to predict efficacy <emphasis>in vivo.</emphasis> Provided that assay variation is accounted for (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0020">20</link>), PK/PD target values can be applied directly to routine dilution testing methods that generate MICs, such as broth microdilution, agar dilution, gradient methods, and some methods using automated instruments. MICs also provide reference values for deriving breakpoints for disk diffusion methods. To permit calibration with all forms of susceptibility testing, CLSI and EUCAST both describe broth microdilution procedures (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0038">38</link>) which are effectively the same as the International Organization for Standardization reference method, ISO 20776-1 (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0039">39</link>). The reference broth microdilution method is the basis for comparison for all commercially available broth microdilution susceptibility tests. The standard ISO 20776-2 (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0040">40</link>) provides guidance for the acceptable performance of antimicrobial susceptibility tests and is focused on comparison of assay performance and not the application of assay interpretive criteria. Regulatory agencies in many countries, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, have different regulatory requirements for commercial systems.</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0017">Breakpoints (or interpretative criteria) are the values that determine the categories of susceptibility (in CLSI tables: susceptible, susceptible—dose dependent, intermediate, and resistant; in EUCAST tables: susceptible, susceptible—increased exposure, and resistant). The approach to setting breakpoints varies by organization or regulatory body. Depending on the approach taken, up to four sources of data can be examined in establishing breakpoints (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0041">41</link>).</para>

These distributions may aid in the recognition of new resistance mechanisms by highlighting isolates for which the MICs fall outside the wild-type distribution. However, distributions of MICs have limited direct application in routine susceptibility testing, since they vary between species, and for some isolates for which the MICs are above the normal range, the MICs may be below clinically derived breakpoints. Recent evidence suggests that such isolates are still likely to respond to treatment, a position agreed to by both CLSI and EUCAST, although it is still controversial for some resistance mechanisms (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0042">42</link>).</para>

These parameters are initially determined using healthy volunteers, although for newer agents, pharmacokinetic data from participation in treatment studies is preferred. A drug’s MICs can be compared with the exposure to the drug achievable in blood or other body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid). In the past, breakpoints were generally chosen such that the MICs for susceptible pathogens would be exceeded by the drug level for most or all of the dosing interval.

For antimicrobial agents, the desired action is pathogen eradication.<emphasis>In vitro</emphasis> pharmacodynamic studies have revealed that agents fall into three classes: those with principally time-dependent antimicrobial action and no or short postantibiotic effects, those with time-dependent action and long postantibiotic effects, and those with prominent concentration-dependent action (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0043">43</link>). For drugs with time-dependent action and no or short postantibiotic effects, the critical determinant of bacterial killing <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> is the percentage of time in a dosing interval that the drug concentration is above the MIC. For the other two classes, the important determinant is the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve to the MIC and/or the ratio of the peak concentration to the MIC. For β-lactams, short-acting macrolides, and clindamycin, the relevant measure is percentage of time that the drug concentration is above the MIC, and the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve or of the peak concentration to the MIC is the relevant parameter for aminoglycosides, long-acting macrolides, tetracyclines, glycopeptides, and fluoroquinolones (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0043">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0044">44</link>).

      <para id="ch0091s0000p0022">Once the MIC breakpoints are selected, disk diffusion breakpoints can be chosen by plotting the inhibition zone diameters against the MICs derived from the testing of a large number of isolates of various species (<anchor id="ch0091s0000a0012"/><link linkend="ch0091s0000a0014">Fig. 1</link>). A statistical approach that uses the linear regression formula was used in the past to calculate the appropriate zone diameter intercepts for the predetermined MIC breakpoints, but it is no longer recommended. The usual, pragmatic approach to deriving disk diffusion breakpoints is the use of the error rate-bounded method, in which the zone diameter criteria are selected on the basis of the minimization of the disk interpretive errors, especially the very major errors (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0048">48</link>) (<link linkend="ch0091s0000a0014">Fig. 1</link>). Newer statistical techniques are being studied to improve the correlation with MICs (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0049">49</link>). The newest CLSI approach focuses on the rate of interpretive errors near the proposed breakpoint versus those involving MICs more than a single log<subscript>2</subscript> dilution from the MIC breakpoints (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0045">45</link>). The concept is that errors that occur with isolates for which MICs are very close to the MIC breakpoints are less of a concern than errors with more highly resistant or susceptible isolates. Statistical modeling techniques have recently been shown to have similar or better performance (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0050">50</link>), and these have been implemented in an online tool (<ulink url="https://dbets.shinyapps.io/dBETS/">https://dbets.shinyapps.io/dBETS/</ulink>).</para>

      <para id="ch0091s0000p0023">Breakpoints derived by professional groups or regulatory bodies in various countries are often quite similar. For instance, there are a small number of breakpoint discrepancies between the CLSI and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which are under review by both groups. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recognizes many, but not all, of the CLSI breakpoints. However, there can be some differences in the breakpoints between CLSI and EUCAST for the same agents. The reasons for the differences may be that certain regions of the world use different dosages or administration intervals for some drugs. In addition, some countries are more conservative in assessing the susceptibility to antimicrobial agents and place greater emphasis on the detection of emerging resistance, noted primarily by examination of microorganism population distributions. Technical factors such as the inoculum density, atmosphere of incubation, and test medium can also affect MICs and zone diameters, thereby justifying different interpretive criteria in some countries. These technical differences are summarized in<ulink url="ch0092#ch0092s0001">chapter 74</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>.</para>

        <para id="ch0091s0000p0029">The reporting of results is the crucial final step in susceptibility testing. There are no universally agreed-upon practices for generating reports, but the following elements should be considered. Categorically reporting the test results, that is, as susceptible (S), susceptible—dose dependent (SDD) (CLSI), intermediate (I) (CLSI) or susceptible—increased exposure (I) (EUCAST), or resistant (R), is standard practice and widely understood by clinicians. When available, MIC data may be reported, but they should appear along with a categorical interpretation. Susceptibility test reports should be formatted in such a way that the results are unambiguous in either printed or electronic form, especially if results for more than one organism are being reported. Most importantly, so-called cascade reporting is recommended to reduce the chance of the clinician choosing a broader-spectrum antimicrobial agent inappropriately (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0058">58</link>). Cascade reporting involves the withholding of results for broader-spectrum antimicrobials from the report when the isolate tested is susceptible to narrower-spectrum agents, for example, withholding a vancomycin result when an isolate of <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> tests susceptible to oxacillin or cefoxitin.

        <para id="ch0091s0000p0030">In recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis on approaches to control and limit antimicrobial resistance in bacteria and fungi. The microbiology laboratory plays a central role in these efforts. The laboratory has the essential data on antimicrobial resistance rates from local laboratory tests and should be working collaboratively with various institutional committees and departments (infection prevention, pharmacy and therapeutics, infectious disease service, and pharmacy) to document resistance rates and to develop policies that strive to reduce the evolution of resistance. An area of current intense effort is antimicrobial stewardship programs. These represent collaborative efforts between institutional (inpatient and outpatient) constituents to develop local policies that monitor the prescribing of antimicrobial agents. Ideally, this represents an institutional working committee led by a member of pharmacy with a special interest and advanced training in stewardship, an infectious disease physician (possibly part-time), the leadership of the microbiology laboratory, an infection preventionist, and possibly other members of the medical staff and nursing service (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0062">62</link>). Working together, they should develop, disseminate, and monitor compliance with institutional policies for antimicrobial prescribing (to include drug selection, appropriate dosage, and duration of therapy). It has been shown that such efforts optimize outcomes for individual patients and play an important role in containing antimicrobial resistance in institutions (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0063">63</link>–<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0067">67</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0031">In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a group of core program elements necessary for a successful stewardship program (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0068">68</link>). These include the commitment of the institutional administration to stewardship efforts and provision of needed resources for the program, a description of the program and delineation of its leadership to include the accountability of a single leader, description of the expertise and commitment of the individual members, a plan to ensure action and conformance with the stewardship policies, methods for tracking prescribing patterns and ensuing antimicrobial resistance trends, a plan for reporting back to organizational leadership and providers on progress made by the stewardship program, and a plan for education of providers regarding important elements of the plan. These points have been codified in rules for participation of all American institutions that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2019 (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0069">69</link>). These rules apply to all acute-care hospitals and have recently been extended to nursing homes that participate in Medicare and Medicaid funding (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0070">70</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0071">71</link>). The final published rules emphasize the CDC’s seven core elements of a stewardship program described above. Although not necessarily codified by law as in the United States, most other developed countries (including the United Kingdom and those in the European Union) have promulgated very similar guidelines on stewardship programs (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0072">72</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0032">Details of the CMS final rule have placed an emphasis on documenting an evidence-based use of antimicrobials in all departments and services of an institution. It is suggested that this be measured through reduction in antimicrobial resistance among key pathogens in all departments and also reductions in<emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> infections (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0070">70</link>). Antimicrobial stewardship represents a powerful tool for control of antimicrobial resistance through improvements in prescribing patterns by all providers.

        <para id="ch0091s0000p0033">Antimicrobial resistance is becoming widespread among a variety of clinically significant bacterial species (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0075">75</link>). Therefore, the microbiology laboratory plays a key role in the patient management process by providing accurate data on which physicians can base therapy decisions. Susceptibility testing results, however, are also used by investigators in surveillance studies and by infection control practitioners to detect and control the spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0076">76</link>). Surveillance can be performed at the laboratory, local, regional, national, and international levels through direct interchange of data from laboratory information systems to centralized databases. Thus, the accuracy of stored results becomes almost as important as the accuracy of test performance and interpretation.</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0034">To meet these challenges and responsibilities, clinical microbiologists must continuously assess and update their susceptibility testing strategies. The first priority is to use accurate and reliable methods, whether they are conventional or newer molecular methods. Then, careful monitoring of test performance with well-characterized control strains that challenge the capability of the testing methods becomes essential. Today, laboratories must use a variety of testing methods, each tailored specifically to a particular species or group of organisms. It is unlikely that a single method, whether conventional or commercial, will be optimal for all antimicrobial agents, organisms, and resistance mechanisms. This will require increased education and training for clinical microbiologists in the future. Some assistance may be sought from the computer-based “expert” systems that allow a rapid and accurate view of antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and recognition of potentially aberrant results or novel resistance mechanisms (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0057">57</link>). Rapid progress is also being made on molecular methods that have increasing practical application in the routine clinical laboratory (see <ulink url="ch0098#ch0098s0001">chapter 80</ulink>).</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0035">More effective means of conveying critical antimicrobial susceptibility testing information to clinicians in a time frame that allows efficient and effective management of patients, and in a format that is unambiguous to clinicians in various practice specialties, are still needed. Clinical microbiologists should become more proactive in the reporting of antimicrobial susceptibility results and in cross-linking that information to other databases (e.g., those for pharmacy prescriptions) to ensure that patients receive the most efficacious cost-effective therapy.</para>
        <para id="ch0091s0000p0036">Finally, the advent of more readily available molecular techniques, especially whole-genome sequencing, opens up the possibility of a major shift in the diagnostic laboratory, from phenotypic susceptibility testing to genotypic prediction of resistance (<link linkend="ch0091s0000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0091s0000li0076">76</link>). More studies correlating genotype to phenotype are needed before this transition can occur, and reliable, reproducible phenotypic testing will always be required to detect new resistances as they emerge.</para>
