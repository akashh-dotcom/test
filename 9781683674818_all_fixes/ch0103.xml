        <para id="ch0103s000000p0002">When the first edition of the<emphasis>Manual of Clinical Microbiology</emphasis> was published in 1970, traditional virologic methods, namely, conventional cell cultures, neutralization tests with antisera for virus identification, manual serologic techniques, and light and electron microscopy, were the mainstay. Diagnostic virology was a distinct discipline that was practiced primarily in public health, research, and academic settings. The time to results was slow, and it was often said that the patient was dead or better by the time the result was received. Over the past 50 years, change has been driven by advances in medical care and diagnostics, the increased number of immunosuppressed hosts, recognition of sexually transmitted viruses, emergence of epidemics and pandemics, and importantly, the development of antiviral therapies.</para>

        <para id="ch0103s000000p0003">Besides the clinical drivers of change, scientific advances have been essential to the transformation of diagnostic virology. Early technological improvements in the laboratory included enzyme immunoassays, IgM class capture assays, monoclonal antibodies for identification, rapid centrifugation cultures, and direct detection of viral antigens in clinical specimens by immunofluorescence. At the point of care (POC), lateral-flow immunochromatography tests were introduced to detect viral antigens or antibodies in 10 to 20 min without equipment or reagent additions, allowing immediate impact on clinical decisions. More recently, chemiluminescence immunoassays have transformed serology, permitting random access instead of batch testing, as well as shortening turnaround time and improving accuracy. The most transformative, however, was the introduction of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), which are both rapid and sensitive, can be automated, high-throughput, or random access, and can detect viruses not amenable to routine culture.</para>
        <para id="ch0103s000000p0004">Initially, NAAT was confined to a limited number of specialized molecular laboratories, using multistep, technically demanding laboratory-developed methods, and required separate assays optimized for each pathogen. For decades, only a handful of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared or -approved commercial NAATs were available. With each new edition of this<emphasis>Manual</emphasis>, the transition to molecular methods has accelerated, due to advances in technology, real-time amplification methods, and user-friendly, FDA-approved or -cleared devices. For years, viral culture was considered the gold standard because it could detect a variety of pathogens and reveal an unexpected virus. With the development of NAAT-based syndromic panels, first for respiratory pathogens and then for agents responsible for meningitis/encephalitis and gastrointestinal disease, the relevance of viral culture to clinical management has receded further. Not only are these panels faster, requiring only several hours to generate a result, but also they detect more viruses than culture and may include nonviral pathogens that can have a similar presentation. They also require less technical skill than viral culture. Some require the simple addition of a sample into a device and insertion into the instrument. When a more limited diagnosis is sought, another option is the multiplexed minipanel for two or three key pathogens. An additional benefit of nonculture methods is safety, since some viruses (e.g., HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS CoV-2], and monkeypox virus) require biosafety level 3 for propagation.</para>
        <para id="ch0103s000000p0005">For quantitative monitoring of viral load in blood, more tests continue to be FDA approved, and substantial effort has been invested in the development of international quantitative standards that will permit cross-institutional comparisons and interpretive guidelines. Other recent innovations include greater flexibility, the ability to accommodate multiple assays simultaneously in a flexible and automated manner, elimination of the need for separate RNA or DNA extraction, and shorter turnaround times.</para>

                <entry>NAAT and IgM are useful in acute infection, depending on day of illness and clinical disease. However, NAAT is not commercially available for most neurotropic arboviruses, except WNV. Serologic cross-reactivity is problematic, especially Zika and dengue viruses. More specific PRNT available at CDC. Rapid antigen tests available for dengue. Most arboviruses are readily cultured, but may require BSL-3 or -4 facilities.</entry>

                <entry>NAAT is the primary test available for diagnosis. Antigen tests available in Europe. Persistence of bocavirus DNA in respiratory tract after acute infection is common, leading to diagnostic uncertainty. High viral load and positive antigen tests have a higher correlation with disease.</entry>

Viral antigens can be detected by a variety of immunoassays. Virus isolation includes conventional cell culture and rapid centrifugation culture with detection of viral antigens by immunostaining. Antibody detection involves measurement of total or class-specific immunoglobulins directed at specific viral antigens. Pathology involves the visualization of virus-induced changes in tissue or cytology smears (including inclusions and multinucleated cells), immunohistochemistry or <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization, or visualization of viral particles by electron microscopy.</para>

        <para id="ch0103s000000p0009">In 2015, a paradigm shift occurred when the first NAAT was approved for POC use, providing results for influenza virus in 15 min, or in as little as 5 min for positives. Subsequently, additional Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-waived NAATs were introduced, with results in 20 to 30 min for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using real-time PCR and in 60 min for 14 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial pathogens using nested PCR. As an indication of how far the field has come, these POC tests can be as sensitive as the best laboratory-performed assays.</para>

        <para id="ch0103s000000p0010">Despite these advantages, some pitfalls of molecular testing have become apparent as the tests are more widely used. The sensitivities and specificities for detecting the same virus often vary between assays. In addition, despite targeting conserved regions of the genome, strain variability and mutations can lead to underquantification of viral load, or even false-negative results. Furthermore, as tests become more sensitive, low levels of clinically irrelevant or nonviable viruses may be detected and can be misleading to clinicians. Similarly, interpreting the clinical relevance of multiple viral pathogens in the same sample, especially when relative quantification is not available, is often problematic.</para>

        <para id="ch0103s000000p0011">With the arrival of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, ongoing trends accelerated. The use of respiratory viral culture was eliminated by many laboratories. Molecular platforms of every type were redirected to SARS-CoV-2 testing. Due to concerns regarding SARS-CoV-2 mutations, almost all NAATs incorporated an unprecedented 2 or 3 viral gene targets to avoid false-negative results. Though stretched to their limits, manufacturers and diagnostic laboratories have done their best to meet the demands created by repeated waves of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Of necessity, acceptable specimen types expanded, self-collection of nasal swabs and saliva was embraced, and a broad array of test platforms was employed in order to meet clinical needs. Unexpectedly, both existing and new lateral-flow rapid antigen detection methods saw a tremendous surge in demand, as their value for POC and home testing for SARS-CoV-2 became evident. Even NAATs were developed and commercialized for home use.</para>
        <para id="ch0103s000000p0012">Four years ago, we wrote that next-generation sequencing (NGS) for resistance testing, outbreak management, and characterization and surveillance of pathogens, as well as metagenomics to discover unexpected etiologies of disease, would be the next wave of technological advances moving from the research laboratory to the clinical arena. This has indeed come to pass, as NGS has been critical to understanding and responding to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, there remain significant challenges in the implementation of NGS for clinical diagnosis, including the expertise required, cost of instrumentation and personnel, turnaround time, bioinformatics, and result interpretation.</para>
        <para id="ch0103s000000p0013">Through this period of transition, it is clear that viral diagnosis is no longer confined to small, specialized laboratories with highly skilled staff but is increasingly performed in multiple venues, including large, highly automated laboratories, at the point of care in clinics and pharmacies, and, for SARS-CoV-2, even at home. With this expansion comes concern that clinical virology expertise in test selection and result interpretation may be diminishing. Going forward, linking best practice guidelines to specific test orders and results should be encouraged if the full benefits of an accurate and rapid diagnosis are to be realized. Selecting the appropriate test will depend on the virus(es) sought, sample site, clinical presentation, clinical purpose (e.g., screening, confirmation, diagnosis, or monitoring), patient characteristics, and disease prevalence. This<emphasis>Manual</emphasis> should serve as a key resource for accomplishing these tasks. <anchor id="ch0103s000000a0014"/><link linkend="ch0103s000000a0004">Table 1</link> provides a concise overview for each virus group; however, the reader is referred to the specific chapters for more detailed discussions.</para>
        <para id="ch0103s000000p0014">While the pace of change can be daunting for laboratories, it is extremely gratifying to witness the impact of state-of-the-art testing on patient care. As we move forward, it is critical that laboratorians communicate with each other to address problems, including the optimization and standardization of methods, and, in addition, that they encourage input and feedback from clinicians. Due to the speed of technological advancements and the continuing discovery of new viruses and new therapies, keeping abreast of the most recent literature is strongly recommended.</para>
