        <para id="ch0125s000000p0003">The HHV-8 genome is double-stranded DNA approximately 160 kb long and contains over 85 genes, including several genes of host derivation (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0002">2</link>). All herpesviruses consist of an icosahedral capsid surrounded by a membrane envelope. The capsid contains the viral DNA. HHV-8 is the most recently discovered human herpesvirus. In the 1960s, viruslike particles were cultured from biopsy material from Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0003">3</link>). Subsequently, investigators analyzed genetic material from KS lesions to identify what they termed Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0004">4</link>), also referred to as HHV-8 because of its association with diseases other than KS. As with all herpesviruses, HHV-8 infection is lifelong. Following primary infection, herpesviruses enter a state of viral latency with minimal gene expression. Latency is an effective adaptation to escape the host antiviral response and it presents diagnostic challenges.</para>

        <para id="ch0125s000000p0004">The most common disease associated with HHV-8 infection is KS, for which there are four recognized epidemiologic categories: (i) epidemic KS, associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, the predominant form of KS in the United States and Europe; (ii) classical KS, seen in older Mediterranean men; (iii) endemic KS, which occurs in sub-Saharan Africa; and (iv) iatrogenic KS, which occurs in organ transplant recipients. A new category of KS, nonepidemic KS, has been proposed to characterize KS diagnosed in men who have sex with men (MSM) but who are not HIV positive (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0006">6</link>). HHV-8 infection alone is not sufficient to cause KS. The main cofactor appears to be immunosuppression, which can be caused by immune senescence, malnutrition, intercurrent illnesses, antirejection agents, or AIDS (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0007">7</link>). HHV-8 stands out as the only human herpesvirus with low prevalence in most of the world. Very low HHV-8 seroprevalence (&lt;5%) is seen in North America and Northern and Western Europe, where the occurrence of KS is almost entirely limited to MSM with AIDS and in a portion of organ transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0008">8</link>). Higher global HHV-8 seroprevalence rates appear to parallel current (sub-Saharan Africa) or historic (Mediterranean Europe) areas where malaria is endemic, as there may be a synergistic relationship between KS and <emphasis>Plasmodium falciparum</emphasis> malaria (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0009">9</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0125s000000p0005">Transmission of HHV-8 appears to be via saliva for both casual and sexual transmission. In regions of Africa where HHV-8 is endemic, transmission is horizontal and casual, beginning early in childhood. In countries where the virus is not endemic, including the United States, HHV-8 transmission is primarily sexual and concentrated among MSM. Heterosexual transmission appears to be rare, for reasons that are not understood (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0010">10</link>). HHV-8 can be transmitted by injection drug use (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0011">11</link>). Transmission by blood transfusion has been documented only in countries where HHV-8 seroprevalence is high and blood is not leukoreduced, such as Uganda (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0012">12</link>). The frequency of HHV-8 transmission by organ transplantation increases with the HHV-8 prevalence in a region (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0013">13</link>), which is a growing area of interest in the field of HHV-8 diagnostics due to an increase in the number of HIV-positive patients receiving transplants and serving as donors (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0014">14</link>). Additionally, the opioid crisis has resulted in an increasing proportion of organ donors who had substance use disorder, which may increase the risk of HHV-8 transmission to transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0015">15</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0125s000000p0006">HHV-8 is in the small group of DNA viruses that cause cancer in humans, along with EBV, human papillomavirus, and hepatitis B virus. HHV-8 causes KS, which commonly manifests as red-purple to brown-black lesions on the skin or mucous membranes. Lesions vary in appearance from substantially raised and nodular (<anchor id="ch0125s000000a0008"/><link linkend="ch0125s000000a0013">Fig. 1</link>) to flat and plaque-like (<anchor id="ch0125s000000a0009"/><link linkend="ch0125s000000a0015">Fig. 2</link>). The lower extremities tend to be a preferred area of cutaneous involvement, often with associated lymphedema; the result can be painful and disfiguring. Lymph nodes as well as visceral organs (lung, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and bone) can also be affected; pulmonary KS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased KS disease activity has been associated with concurrent infections, such as pneumocystis pneumonia (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0016">16</link>). Although combined antiretroviral therapy is the cornerstone for management of KS in persons living with HIV (PLWH), some patients can present with an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with sudden progression of KS that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0017">17</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0125s000000p0007">Pathologically, KS lesions are characterized by the presence of spindle cells, an irregular blood vessel network, and a cellular inflammatory infiltrate. The associated extravasated red blood cells are the source of the hyperpigmentation that the clinician recognizes as KS (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0018">18</link>). Long-term remissions from KS can be achieved with immune reconstitution. The incidence of KS among persons living with AIDS (PLWA) in North America and Europe has declined substantially with the use of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0019">19</link>); however, the benefit has not been universally realized due to socioeconomic, geographic, and racial disparities. Nondecreasing KS incidence trends have been observed in some states and among younger African American PLWH and likely represent poorer access to health care (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0021">21</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0125s000000p0008">Less common HHV-8-associated diseases are primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS). PEL is a rare, aggressive, non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in body cavities but usually does not present with distinct tumor masses. Typically occurring in PLWA, PEL has also been observed in other immunodeficiency states. PEL comprises only about 4% of all AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0022">22</link>). Virtually all cases of PEL harbor HHV-8, and half are coinfected with EBV (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0023">23</link>). MCD is characterized by constitutional symptoms and diffuse lymphadenopathy. HHV-8 is associated with the plasmablastic variant of MCD, more commonly seen in HIV-infected individuals. MCD is diagnosed by histopathology, and KS is often codiagnosed on lymph node biopsies (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0023">23</link>). Abnormal laboratory results include anemia, pancytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and elevated inflammatory markers (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0023">23</link>). KICS is another HHV-8-associated inflammatory syndrome that presents similarly to MCD but lacks the histopathology diagnostic features of MCD. KS is often clinically present with KICS where HHV-8 and inflammatory cytokines levels are elevated (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0024">24</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0125s000000p0009">It is important to note that HHV-8 diagnostic tests are of limited value in the diagnosis of HHV-8-related diseases. The clinical presentation of cutaneous lesions, fevers, lymphadenopathy, cytopenia, and/or abnormal liver tests in the setting of immunosuppression would raise the specter of HHV-8-related diseases and warrant further investigation with biopsy. The diagnosis of KS, PEL, and MCD requires histologic examination of affected tissue for characteristic pathologic features and demonstration of HHV-8 involvement by<emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization (ISH).</para>

      <para id="ch0125s000000p0013">Most HHV-8-infected individuals do not have detectable viral DNA in their blood; therefore, PCR is not a useful test to establish HHV-8 infection. HHV-8 DNA is detected by PCR in the blood of 30 to 50% of AIDS patients with KS and in 5 to 20% of HIV-infected, HHV-8-seropositive individuals without KS, and is rarely detected at all in HHV-8-seropositive, HIV-negative individuals (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0027">27</link>–<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0029">29</link>). The clinical value of PCR testing is to provide information on disease risk, transmission, and response to antiviral therapy (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0030">30</link>). Engels and colleagues performed HHV-8 PCR testing on blood collected from 132 HIV-infected MSM without KS, 31 of whom developed KS later (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0030">30</link>). They showed that men with HHV-8 viremia 1 year prior to KS diagnosis had 10 times the risk for developing KS than men without viremia (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0030">30</link>). Laney and colleagues monitored 96 HIV-infected, HHV-8-infected MSM for 2 years at 4-month intervals; 47 of the men had KS. They found a significant association between changes in KS disease severity and HHV-8 viral load. The data were insufficient to confirm a threshold viral load for disease risk; however, patients with progressing disease were eight times more likely to have viral loads greater than 10,000 genome copies per million cells than patients with regressing disease (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0029">29</link>). Several smaller studies cited in the Engels and Laney papers reported similar associations between HHV-8 viremia and KS disease severity.</para>

        <para id="ch0125s000000p0035">KS is normally a clinical diagnosis that does not involve laboratory testing other than possible histological examination of a lesion biopsy. When laboratory tests are warranted, serology is the preferred method to identify HHV-8 infection because of the low, usually undetectable, viral load. The main application of HHV-8 serologic testing has been to establish the presence of HHV-8 infection for epidemiologic or clinical research. PCR is not used to establish HHV-8 infection due to extremely low levels of viremia that are undetectable by PCR in most people without disease. Most published serologic tests for HHV-8 have been developed by research laboratories and are not commercially available. The two main test formats are immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) based on human B-cell lines, naturally infected with HHV-8 that express either lytic or latent viral antigens, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on individual viral proteins or peptides. Several studies have compared the performance of HHV-8 serologic tests, and the majority of them show 80 to 95% concordance and sensitivity with sera from patients with AIDS-associated KS but show considerable discordance (&lt;50% agreement) with sera from various risk groups without KS or from blood donors (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0035">35</link>). The biological challenge with HHV-8 serology is the weak antibody response in immunocompetent people, which can involve different subsets of antigens between individuals (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0036">36</link>). Another challenge is identifying truly negative serum panels to establish assay specificity, when most HHV-8 infection is asymptomatic without detectable viremia.</para>
        <para id="ch0125s000000p0036">Assay comparison studies have consistently shown that the lytic antigen IFA is the most sensitive HHV-8 test (&gt;95%), with reasonable specificity (&gt;95%) when used by experienced laboratories (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0037">37</link>). However, the IFA is labor-intensive and subject to variable interpretation and is therefore not suitable for clinical use or high-throughput testing. Numerous HHV-8 epidemiologic studies have been conducted using two ELISAs developed by the National Cancer Institute; however, the combined estimated sensitivity on samples from the U.S. population was 80% to 90% (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0034">34</link>), and clinical use would require improved performance. To address the shortcomings of individual tests, most research laboratories use combinations of HHV-8 assays to achieve higher sensitivity and specificity (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0035">35</link>), but multiple test algorithms are not practical for clinical use.</para>

The limited options for HHV-8 serologic testing underscore the need for a convenient and validated test.</para>
        <para id="ch0125s000000p0038">HHV-8 serologic testing in the setting of organ transplantation is a growing area of interest despite the lack of a suitable test. Serologic screening of donors and recipients in regions where HHV-8 is endemic, and possibly of high-risk individuals (MSM and intravenous-drug users) in regions where the virus is not endemic, may be warranted (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0125s000000li0039">39</link>). The transplant community has seen the gradual acceptance of liver and kidney transplantation in HIV-positive patients (<link linkend="ch0125s000000li0014">14</link>), who are at higher risk for HHV-8 infection and therefore for posttransplant KS.</para>

Diagnosis of HHV-8 infection is done mainly with serologic testing due to the low detectability of viral DNA in most infections. Most serologic tests have been developed in-house by research laboratories and are used for research purposes only. There is currently no consensus on which serologic tests are the most accurate. HHV-8 PCR testing is generally more straightforward, but its applications are less useful for diagnosing HHV-8 infection and are limited to studies on transmission, disease risk, and response to therapy.</para>
