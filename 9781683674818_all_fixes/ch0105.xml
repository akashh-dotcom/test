        <para id="ch0105s0000p0002">Human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) are members of the<emphasis>Deltaretrovirus</emphasis> genus in the <emphasis>Retroviridae</emphasis> family (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0001">1</link>). HTLVs likely originated from cross-species transmission of simian T-cell lymphotropic viruses (STLVs); combined, this group of viruses is also referred to as primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>). While the close phylogenetic relationships of HTLV-1 and STLV-1 indicate a simian origin for HTLV-1, HTLV-2 and STLV-2 are only distantly related, so the exact simian origin of HTLV-2 is unknown. More recently, two novel HTLVs were identified in hunters in Cameroon and Gabon and were called HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0008">8</link>). HTLV-3 likely originated from monkeys infected with highly related STLV-3 viruses (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0006">6</link>). HTLV-4 is equidistant from all other HTLVs and was found to have a gorilla reservoir in Cameroon (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0010">10</link>). HTLVs and STLVs are distinct from the <emphasis>Lentivirus</emphasis> genus, which includes human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency viruses (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0001">1</link>). Classification of HTLV groups using Roman numerals was replaced over a decade ago with Arabic numerals, following the guidelines of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0001">1</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0003">HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3 are enveloped viruses about 80 to 110 nm in diameter; they contain an electron-dense, centrally located nuclear core with less prominent envelope spikes than HIV and they bud from the cell surface (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0011">11</link>). Electron micrograph studies have not been performed on HTLV-4, but they likely possess morphologies comparable to HTLV-1, -2, and -3. Within the core are two positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. Once a cell is infected, the RNA genome is converted by reverse transcriptase to DNA and integrates into the host genome. Hence, HTLV infection is persistent and infected persons will continue to be seropositive and PCR positive during their lifetime.</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0004">HTLVs are complex retroviruses with regulatory genes in addition to the structural and enzymatic<emphasis>gag, pol</emphasis>, and <emphasis>env</emphasis> genes found in all classical retroviruses (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0012">12</link>). HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HTLV-3, and HTLV-4 all have similar genomic organization: group-specific antigen (<emphasis>gag</emphasis>), protease/polymerase (<emphasis>pro/pol</emphasis>), envelope (<emphasis>env</emphasis>), and accessory gene region (<emphasis>pX</emphasis>), flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs) (<anchor id="ch0105s0000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0105s0000a0007">Fig. 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0014">14</link>). Each HTLV group is highly divergent, sharing about 60% nucleotide identity (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0014">14</link>). The <emphasis>gag</emphasis> gene encodes the structural proteins: matrix (p19), capsid (p24), and nucleocapsid (p15). The <emphasis>pro</emphasis> and <emphasis>pol</emphasis> genes encode the protease and the reverse transcriptase enzymes, respectively. The <emphasis>env</emphasis> gene encodes the transmembrane and external or surface envelope glycoproteins, i.e., gp21 and gp46, respectively.</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0005">HTLVs use alternative splicing and internal initiation codons to produce several regulatory and accessory proteins encoded by at least four open reading frames located in the<emphasis>pX</emphasis> region of the viral genome between <emphasis>env</emphasis> and the 3′ LTR (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0012">12</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0014">14</link>). The <emphasis>pX</emphasis> region encodes the spliced, regulatory proteins Tax and Rex and several additional open reading frames, some of which are also believed to be involved in viral replication and transport (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0007">Fig. 1</link>). Unlike other retroviruses, HTLVs also encode a protein on the antisense strand, called antisense protein of HTLV (APH), that is a repressor of Tax-mediated viral transcription (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0007">Fig. 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0015">15</link>). APH was first discovered in HTLV-1; it contains a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) motif and was thus originally called HBZ (HTLV-1 bZIP protein) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0017">17</link>). HBZ is also believed to control cellular replication, optimize cell-to-cell transmission, and promote T-lymphocyte proliferation associated with leukemia as seen in some HTLV-1-infected people (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0018">18</link>). HBZ has also been implicated in inflammatory diseases in HTLV-1-infected people, including HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0018">18</link>). Antisense proteins of HTLV have now been identified in all primate T-lymphotropic virus groups, suggesting the evolutionary and biological importance of these proteins (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0014">14</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0006">HTLV-1 uses a receptor complex with three different molecules, glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT-1), VEGF-165 receptor neuropilin 1 (NRP1), and heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) for cellular entry (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0019">19</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0021">21</link>). HTLV-2 utilizes GLUT1 and NRP1 but not HSPGs (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0012">12</link>). HTLV-1 preferentially infects CD4<superscript>+</superscript> T cells, especially C-C chemokine receptor type 4-positive (CCR4<superscript>+</superscript>) CD25<superscript>+</superscript>CD4<superscript>+</superscript> T cells, whereas CD8<superscript>+</superscript> T cells are the primary target for HTLV-2 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0019">19</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0021">21</link>). <emphasis>In vitro</emphasis> studies have shown that HTLV-3 can infect both CD4<superscript>+</superscript> and CD8<superscript>+</superscript> T cells and also uses glucose transporter type 1, but does not need heparin sulfate proteoglycans or neuropilin 1 for cellular entry, suggesting that it may use a different complex of receptor molecules (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0020">20</link>). Cell receptor studies for HTLV-4 have not been reported yet. HTLVs are cell-associated viruses and persist within hosts via infectious spread (<emphasis>de novo</emphasis> infection) and mitotic spread (infected cell proliferation), creating a population structure of multiple clones (infected cell populations with identical genomic proviral integration sites) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0022">22</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0007">Meta-analyses of reliable epidemiologic data from about 1,100 papers published since the discovery of HTLV in 1981 showed that 5 to 10 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with HTLV-1, with endemic foci in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean and surrounding islands, large parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America, some rare areas in Melanesia, the Middle East (northern part of Iran), and Romania (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>). The seroprevalence rate in adults ranges from 2 to 17% in the Caribbean islands, with similar rates (1.7 to 17.4%) observed in southern Japan (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0025">25</link>). A recent meta-analysis study showed the overall prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa was 3.19% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.36–4.12%) based on studies up to 2019, with higher rates observed in Central Africa (4.16%; 95% CI 2.43–6.31%) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0024">24</link>). A large study in China using samples from 2016 to 2018 reported a very low overall prevalence in blood donors (5.172/100,000 persons), with varied prevalence across different provinces (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0026">26</link>). Confirmatory tests in this study showed that most persons were infected with HTLV-1, with small numbers of infections not typeable. HTLV-2 is less prevalent than HTLV-1, with an estimated 800,000 HTLV-2 infections worldwide, and is endemic in Native Amerindian tribes and highly prevalent in people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States, comprising about 400,000 to 500,000 infections. HTLV-2 is also endemic in Amerindians in Brazil and other South American countries, comprising about 200,000 to 250,000 infections (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0012">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0027">27</link>) and is endemic in PWID in Western Europe (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0028">28</link>). HTLV-2 has also been reported in a few Pygmy tribes in Central Africa, with seroprevalences of about 3% in Pygmies (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0029">29</link>). HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 have only been found in a few primate hunters in Cameroon and do not appear to have spread locally or globally, though screening has been limited to only certain non-African populations (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0030">30</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0032">32</link>). In all areas of endemicity, HTLV-1 and -2 seroprevalence increases with age, especially in women (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0012">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0034">34</link>). In the United States and Europe, the seroprevalence for both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 among low-risk populations is less than 1% (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0036">36</link>). However, high-risk populations such PWID in the United States and Europe, in whom HTLV-2 infection predominates over HTLV-1 infection, are reported to have seroprevalences from 0.4 to 20% (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0012">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>). African-American PWID populations, especially in New Orleans, are at increased risk for HTLV-2 infection (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>). PWID in South Vietnam showed a very high prevalence (&gt;60%) of HTLV-2 infection, which is believed to have been introduced and spread by American military personnel during the Vietnam War (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0038">38</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0008">HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections are transmitted sexually (mainly male to female), vertically (mother to child, mostly by prolonged breast-feeding), and parenterally (intravenous drug use and blood transfusion) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0039">39</link>). While it is generally considered that intrapartum and transplacental transmission is rare (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0039">39</link>), a recent study showed HTLV-1 infection of <emphasis>ex vivo</emphasis> placental cells and <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> susceptibility of placental trophoblasts to HTLV-1 infection, suggesting transplacental transmission may be more common than previously understood (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0040">40</link>). One recent study reported self-flagellation as a potential transmission route among 10 persons from Pakistan, India, and Iraq (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0041">41</link>). In nonendemic populations, intravenous drug use and sex with PWIDs are the most important risk factors for HTLV-2 transmission (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>). Both cross-sectional and prospective studies support sexual transmission, and there was a strong concordance of seropositivity between spouses in an area where HTLV-2 is endemic (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>). Recently, a meta review identified an increased rate of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection in sex workers, further highlighting the importance of prevention measures in this group (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0042">42</link>). One study showed that transmission mode can affect viral evolution rates, with HTLV-2 strains transmitted between PWID evolving 150 to 350 times faster than in mother-to-infant transmission (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0043">43</link>). The increase in the viral transmission rate between PWID, which can be many transmissions per year, was proposed to account for the increase in the HTLV-2 evolutionary rate, whereas vertical transmission would be expected to occur just once every 14 to 30 years for a given viral lineage and thus would evolve more slowly (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0043">43</link>). This increased rate of transmission and evolution among PWID may increase the risk for the emergence of HTLV-2 strains with a higher virulence.</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0009">Over the past 3 decades, highly effective screening programs for volunteer blood donors have been implemented in Japan, China, Australia, the United States, Canada, and several Caribbean and European countries to reduce the risk of transfusion-related HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 transmission (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>). For example, in the United States between 1991 and 1996, the incidence rate of seroconversion associated with HTLV in blood donors was estimated to be 1.59 per 100,000 people per year, and the residual risk of transmitting HTLV infection by transfusing screened blood was estimated to be 1 in 641,000 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>). From 1998 to 2001, the estimated incidence of new infections among repeat blood donors to the American Red Cross was 0.239 per 100,000 person years, and the estimated risk of collecting blood during the infectious window period was 1:2,993,000 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0044">44</link>). The American Red Cross found that the HTLV incidence and residual risk of transfusion-transmissible HTLV infection among repeat donors during 2007 to 2008 decreased to 0.21 per 100,000 person years and 1:3,394,086, further demonstrating the success of universal blood screening (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0045">45</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0010">Many molecular epidemiologic studies have shown HTLV proviruses to be remarkably stable genetically, which has allowed strong resolution of HTLV phylogenies and molecular dating of these viruses (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0045">45</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0049">49</link>). The differing evolution rates for HTLV-1 and HIV-1 are due to clonal expansion of HTLV-infected cells versus active replication of HIV-1 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0051">51</link>). While the overall genome of HTLV is highly conserved, nucleotide divergence in the LTR, <emphasis>tax, pol</emphasis>, and gp21 <emphasis>env</emphasis> genes has been exploited to genotype HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and more recently, HTLV-3 and -4 (3, 52–54). The impact of diversity and emerging variants continues to challenge HTLV serology. An understanding of phylogenetic relationships is therefore useful. There are at least seven major geographic HTLV-1 subtypes, which evolved from STLV-1 through several independent interspecies transmissions between simian and human hosts at different geographic locations, which spread from person to person, and became endemic in some areas prior to establishment of screening programs (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0055">55</link>): (i) subtype A (cosmopolitan, distributed globally and consisting of six subgroups); (ii) subtype B (Central African); (iii) subtype C (Australo-Melanesian); (iv) subtype D (Central African, mainly among Pygmy tribes); (v) subtype E, found in an Efe Pygmy from the Congo; (vi) subtype F, from people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and (vii) subtype G, from primate hunters in Central and West Africa (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0055">55</link>). To date, the cosmopolitan subtype A HTLV-1 does not have a known STLV-1 counterpart, suggesting that that specific simian species has not yet been sampled or is extinct. One study recently identified genetic recombination in the <emphasis>pol/env</emphasis> and LTR genomic regions in a small number of HTLV-1 infections in North Africa, but it is unknown what effect these changes have on the transmissibility and pathogenicity of these variants (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0056">56</link>). Detailed phylogenetic analyses inferred that HTLV-1 was introduced into South America via the slave trade starting in the 16th century, whereas HTLV-2 came via ancient human migrations from Asia across the Bering Strait (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0027">27</link>). HTLV-2 has three subtypes, named 2a, 2b, and 2d (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0057">57</link>), whose primate origin has been linked to a single primate, STLV-2 in bonobos (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0010">10</link>). Subtype 2a is commonly found among PWID worldwide, whereas subtype 2b is found primarily among Amerindians and in some Pygmies from Cameroon. Subtype 2d has been found in only one Pygmy from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Earlier studies proposed subtype 2c in one Amerindian tribe from Brazil; however, subsequent analysis of complete genomes confirmed this to be a subtype 2a variant (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0027">27</link>). HTLV-3 most likely originated from recent cross-species transmission in people exposed to nonhuman primates in Cameroon (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0014">14</link>). Phylogenetic analysis has identified HTLV-3 infection originating from at least four highly divergent STLV-3 subtypes such that there are also four HTLV-3 subtypes (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0014">14</link>). Subtypes A and C include the original STLV-3 identified in a baboon from East Africa and STLV-3 in spot-nosed monkeys (<emphasis>Cercopithecus nictitans</emphasis>) from Cameroon, but human infection has not been reported yet with either subtype (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0058">58</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0061">61</link>). Subtype B includes both STLV-3 and HTLV-3 from West-Central Africa, while subtype D has occurred in both monkeys and a human from Cameroon (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0060">60</link>). A fifth human infection with HTLV-3, another subtype D strain, was reported in a farmer in Cameroon who was also infected with HIV-1 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0008">8</link>). HTLV-4 was originally identified in a single hunter from Cameroon (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>), but more recently, two additional HTLV-4-infected hunters were identified in Gabon (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0007">7</link>). HTLV-4 was found to have a simian reservoir in gorillas in Cameroon, called STLV-4 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0009">9</link>). These studies suggest that cross-species transmission of a wide range of STLV lineages to humans is ongoing and not limited to rare historical events. It is currently unknown whether HTLV-3 and -4 represent dead-end infections in humans or have the potential to spread regionally or globally. A new STLV group, STLV-5, has been proposed for a macaque STLV originally classified as STLV-1 since detailed phylogenetic analysis showed that it is highly divergent from STLV-1 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0062">62</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0063">63</link>). A human counterpart of STLV-5 has not yet been found. The genetic heterogeneity within HTLV has provided valuable information on geographic clustering, movement of ancient populations, and viral transmission.</para>

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0011">HTLV-1 has been associated with two major diseases: adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HAM/TSP. HTLV-1 causes HAM/TSP in 0.3 to 3.8% of infected persons, while ATLL is seen in about 2 to 5% of infected persons (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0064">64</link>). ATLL exists in four forms: acute, chronic, smoldering, and T-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The chronic form has been further subclassified into the favorable and unfavorable subtypes (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0066">66</link>). The acute, lymphoma, and unfavorable chronic type ATL forms, and the favorable chronic and smoldering type ATL types, have also been defined as aggressive and indolent ATL, respectively (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0066">66</link>). The indolent types have a better short-term prognosis but poorer long-term survival (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>). The acute form comprises about 55 to 60% of all ATLLs and can be rapidly fatal. ATLL is characterized by severe malignant proliferation of CD4<superscript>+</superscript> CD25<superscript>+</superscript> T-lymphocytes, diagnosed biologically by seropositivity for HTLV-1, the presence of morphologically distinct CD3<superscript>+</superscript>/4<superscript>+</superscript>/25<superscript>+</superscript> lymphocytes with cleaved nuclei (flower cells), and clonal integration of HTLV-1 proviruses in the tumor cells, as detected by Southern blotting, inverse PCR, or newer technologies such as ultra-deep sequence analysis (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0068">68</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0071">71</link>). Patients with acute ATLL can also have hepatosplenomegaly, systemic lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, hypercalcemia, and high LDH (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>). Chronic ATLL is seen in 10 to 20% of cases presenting with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, high leukocytosis, normal to elevated levels of LDH, and the absence of visceral involvement and hypercalcemia (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>). Smoldering ATLL accounts for 5 to 10% of patients who have normal leukocyte counts with very few flower cells seen, some skin and lung involvement, and normal LDH and calcium levels (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>). Lymphoma ATLL accounts for about 20 to 25% of patients who can present with symptoms similar to the acute form, but do not have lymphocytosis, with less than 1% of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>). Persons classified with the unfavorable form of chronic ATLL have high LDH, low serum albumin, and high serum urea levels (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>). Both Tax and HBZ are believed to be involved in ATLL development (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0069">69</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0012">The clinical features of the chronic neuromyelopathy HAM/TSP are muscle weakness in the legs, hyperreflexia, clonus, extensor plantar responses, sensory disturbances, various urinary manifestations, impotence, and low-back pain (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0064">64</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0072">72</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0073">73</link>). These symptoms begin insidiously and progress slowly (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0064">64</link>). Spasticity of the lower legs is the main disability of HAM/TSP, with patients often requiring wheelchairs. The main biological diagnosis includes the presence of high titers of HTLV-specific antibodies in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Research studies have shown that levels of HTLV-1-infected cells in the cerebrospinal fluid are over twice those found in the peripheral blood for HAM/TSP patients compared to levels in HTLV-1-infected people with other neurological disorders, and PCR determination of proviral loads in these compartments thus has diagnostic value (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0073">73</link>). The estimated lifetime risk of developing HAM/TSP among HTLV-1-infected people is 0.2 to 4% but can vary according to the geographical area, and the disease occurs more frequently in people over 40 years old (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>). Women develop HAM/TSP more frequently than men, with a female-to-male ratio from 2:1 to 4:1 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0064">64</link>). Other uncommon inflammatory disease associations include infective dermatitis, uveitis, polymyositis, thyroiditis, alveolitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonitis, and HTLV-associated arthropathy (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0073">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0074">74</link>). In research studies, increased viral load has been identified in both ATLL and HAM/TSP patients, compared to asymptomatic infected people, and is one of the best predictors for disease development, though patients with high proviral loads can remain asymptomatic for decades (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0073">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0074">74</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0013">HTLV-2 has not been definitively associated with malignancy; however, it has shown rare association with a neurological disease resembling HAM/TSP that progresses more slowly and with milder symptoms (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0075">75</link>). The estimated lifetime risk of disease development for HTLV-2-infected people is unknown but appears to be less than that estimated for individuals with HTLV-1 infection (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>). While most HTLV-2-infected people remain asymptomatic (&gt;95%), recent studies report an increased incidence of infectious diseases (such as bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and kidney and/or bladder infections) in HTLV-2-infected people (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0075">75</link>). A recent study also found a higher association of all-cause cancer and cancer mortality in a cohort of HTLV-2-infected patients in the United States, suggesting that more research is needed to understand the pathogenic potential of HTLV-2 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0076">76</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0014">HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 have only been identified in small numbers of bushmeat hunters in Central Africa. Limited studies have not identified evidence of disease in these persons at the time of specimen sampling (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0005">5</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0008">8</link>). Longitudinal studies of these infected hunters are required to further evaluate the disease-causing potential of these novel HTLVs. Limited studies of patients receiving care at outpatient clinics in Europe or individuals with some cancers in the United States have also not identified evidence of HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 infection (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0030">30</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0032">32</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0015">HTLV coinfection with HIV can occur in high-risk groups, such as people from areas of HTLV endemicity and PWID (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0077">77</link>). HIV-1 and HTLV-1 coinfection prevalence varies by geographic area but can be as high as 10.9% (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0077">77</link>). To date, a few studies evaluating the impact of HIV-1 coinfection with HTLV have shown that there is an increased frequency of HTLV-1-associated clinical outcomes (lymphoma and neurological disease), especially in individuals with high CD4<superscript>+</superscript> T-cell counts caused by HTLV-1-induced proliferation of CD4+ lymphocytes (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0077">77</link>). These limited number of studies suggest that HIV-1 coinfection may increase the morbidity of HTLY-1-infected patients. In contrast, a delayed progression to AIDS is seen in some HTLV-2/HIV-1-coinfected people (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0078">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0079">79</link>). Moreover, antiretroviral HIV therapy in HIV-1/HTLV-2-coinfected people does not affect HTLV-2 proviral burden but has been reported to provide a protective effect from AIDS progression (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0080">80</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0081">81</link>). A recent study also showed that the Tax proteins of both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 inhibited HIV-1 replication <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>, suggesting a protective effect of HTLV in HIV-1 infection (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0078">78</link>). However, additional studies are needed to determine if HIV-1 coinfection affects the mortality of HTLV-infected patients. HTLV-1 coinfection with other pathogens has also been reported, including <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium, Strongyloides stercoralis</emphasis>, hepatitis B and C viruses, cytomegalovirus (CMV), <emphasis>Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis>, herpes zoster, <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Treponema pallidum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0074">74</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0083">83</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0084">84</link>). Although HTLV and SARS-CoV-2 infections have not been reported, special care for SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations has been recommended for coinfected persons since HTLV can cause immune dysfunction and they may be on immunosuppressive therapy.</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0016">Treatment options for HTLV-associated diseases remain limited. For ATLL treatment, strategies have been selected by clinical subtype (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>). For aggressive ATLL, the standard of care is multiagent chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation when possible (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0066">66</link>). However, chemotherapy has not proven effective against aggressive forms of ATLL (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0066">66</link>). For indolent ATLL, a watch-and-wait strategy is recommended until progression to aggressive ATLL, which consists of skin-directed therapy if skin lesions exist, and alpha interferon and zidovudine (AZT) combination therapy if the patient is symptomatic (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>). Although AZT and alpha interferon yield some responses and improve prognosis for indolent and some acute ATLL cases, alternative therapies are critically needed (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>). New drugs such as arsenic trioxide, proteasome inhibitors, retinoids, and angiogenesis inhibitors, as well as cellular immunotherapy, are under investigation (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0083">83</link>). The anti-CCR4<superscript>+</superscript> antibody mogamulizumab and the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide have shown some promise for treatment of aggressive ATLL in clinical trials (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in one-third of transplant patients has provided some improvement in survival rates for aggressive ATLL, but few patients are transplanted (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0085">85</link>). Antiretroviral treatments such as lamivudine and high-dose alpha interferon and beta interferon have been evaluated with HAM/TSP patients and resulted in decreases in proviral loads, alterations in T-cell phenotypes, and anti-<emphasis>tax</emphasis> cytotoxic T-cell frequency changes (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0085">85</link>). However, results of further follow-up on immunomodulatory therapies have been disappointing, and monotherapy and combination antiretroviral therapies (AZT and lamivudine) have been discouraging because of only partial or temporary success in decreasing proviral loads (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0087">87</link>). One study using STLV-1-infected baboons treated with AZT and sodium valproate showed significant viral load reduction, but clinical trials in HTLV-1-infected humans using both therapeutic agents have not been reported (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0087">87</link>). Another STLV-1 study showed reduced proviral loads using AZT and histone deacetylase inhibitors, but viral rebound occurred upon cessation of treatment (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0088">88</link>). Symptomatic or targeted treatments are still the foundation of HAM/TSP therapy, with corticosteroids commonly used for treatment, and were effective mostly for patients with short disease duration and high inflammation (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0064">64</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0072">72</link>). For progressive HAM/TSP, a meta review supported the use of high-dose pulsed methyl prednisolone for induction and low-dose oral prednisone as maintenance therapy (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0072">72</link>). The same study reported insufficient evidence for using alpha interferon as a first-line therapy (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0072">72</link>). The integrase inhibitor raltegravir was shown to have potent <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> anti-HTLV-1 activity (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0072">72</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0089">89</link>). However, the clinical effects of raltegravir treatment are not clear. Small studies of persons with HAM/TSP did not show any sustained reduction in proviral load after treatment with raltegravir (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0067">67</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0072">72</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0090">90</link>). Treatment of HAM-TSP patients in a clinical trial with the anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab reduced HTLV-1 proviral loads and improved the neurological symptoms, leading to a multicenter trial in Japan (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0064">64</link>). For uveitis, topical and systemic corticosteroids appear to improve sight, whereas infective dermatitis responds well to antibiotic treatment (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>). Recently, an <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> study showed that the use of infliximab as an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antibody was successful in inhibiting TNF-α for treatment of HTLV-1-related inflammation in the eye (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0091">91</link>).</para>

A subunit vaccine composed of recombinant surface proteins was successful in robustly activating cell-mediated cytotoxic responses and neutralized viral infectivity in mouse models (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0092">92</link>). While these studies are promising for the development of potential HTLV vaccines, more research is needed to determine their antiviral and prophylactic efficacy.

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0019">Serum or plasma is suitable for use in serologic assays for HTLV detection and can be drawn at the time of presentation. Samples should be redrawn at 3 months from seronegative patients who are suspected of having HTLV infection, or those with seroindeterminate Western blot (WB) patterns, and should be retested to detect potentially infected people during the seroconversion window period (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0096">96</link>). Alternatively, persons with seroindeterminate WB results can also be tested by qualitative PCR to investigate possible infection; although these assays are not FDA approved, they are clinically validated and available at commercial reference laboratories. Serum and plasma specimens can be stored at 4°C or frozen for later use. Package inserts should be consulted for storage limitations and limitations on the number of freeze-thaw cycles permitted. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples prepared from fresh whole blood collected in EDTA or acid citrate dextrose, and not plasma or serum, are the appropriate specimen for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) and virus isolation since HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are cell-associated viruses. PBMCs are typically isolated from fresh whole blood on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (discussed in <ulink url="ch0102#ch0102s0001">chapter 83</ulink>) or by using CPT mononuclear cell separation Vacutainer tubes. Heparin as an anticoagulant is not recommended in blood samples collected for NAAT because it interferes with the enzyme used in PCR. DNA is prepared using standard methods and can be stored at –20°C until needed. For virus culture, whole blood is collected in acid citrate dextrose, EDTA, or heparin tubes, and PBMCs isolated on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient are placed in coculture as described below.</para>

Qualitative PCR procedures utilizing primers in the <emphasis>pol, env</emphasis>, or <emphasis>tax</emphasis> genes and the LTR have been used to confirm and differentiate between HTLV-1 and -2, and more recently HTLV-3 and -4 infections (<anchor id="ch0105s0000a0019"/><link linkend="ch0105s0000a0021">Table 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0052">52</link>−<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0096">96</link>). These assays utilize HTLV consensus primers that allow amplification of all four viruses, with typing achieved either by hybridizing the product to an HTLV-specific probe or by sequence analysis. A second approach employs type-specific primers and probes in separate amplifications. The PCR products can be detected with labeled internal probes by Southern blot hybridization and with sequencing (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0053">53</link>). Most of these assays are performed for research use only, but some are now offered by commercial laboratories. Blood PCR tests offered at commercial reference laboratories are validated to detect only HTLV-1 and -2. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid specimens in the United States at commercial laboratories is limited to the Mayo Clinic Laboratories (<ulink url="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/overview/604934">https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/overview/604934</ulink>; last accessed 4/5/22).

      <para id="ch0105s0000p0021">Viral detection and quantification of proviral DNA can be performed simultaneously using real-time PCR; RNA viral load estimation from plasma is not feasible in HTLV infection since these viruses are cell associated (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0097">97</link>). Noncommercial, quantitative real-time PCR assays have excellent sensitivity and specificity and a broad dynamic range, from 10 to 10<superscript>6</superscript> copies/reaction, and have been used to define the relationship between proviral load and both pathogenesis and person-to-person transmission risks (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0098">98</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0099">99</link>). For example, proviral load is higher among HAM/TSP and ATLL patients than among asymptomatic carriers, suggesting that it can be a prognostic indicator for future disease development (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0098">98</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0100">100</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0103">103</link>).

Thus, quantification of HTLV proviral load in research studies has provided a better understanding of correlates of transmission and disease progression (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0097">97</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0098">98</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0100">100</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0104">104</link>). Since these differences in HTLV proviral loads among asymptomatic and sick patients have been determined in various research studies and a standardized quantitative PCR is currently not available at commercial laboratories, there have been about 5-fold variations in the proviral loads reported across these studies (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0105">105</link>). In general, healthy carriers have a proviral load of &lt;3 copies/100 PBMCs compared to 5 to 10 copies/100 PBMCs in people with ATLL (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0105">105</link>). A meta-analysis for HAM/TSP patients from the United Kingdom and United States showed all had proviral loads of &gt;100 copies/100 PBMCs, though a definitive cutoff has not been established (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0101">101</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0103">103</link>). High systemic proviral loads have also been associated with development of HTLV-1-associated pulmonary disease (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0074">74</link>).

Nevertheless, cocultivation of HTLV-infected PBMCs with activated, allogeneic HTLV-negative PBMCs or cord blood cells is used to obtain viral isolates. Tissue culture supernatants are collected weekly for up to 4 to 6 weeks, and the presence of HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 p19 Gag antigen in the supernatant is tested using a research-use-only antigen capture assay (Zeptometrix Corp., Buffalo, NY). Alternatively, PCR methods can be used to monitor infection in tissue culture cellular DNA.

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0024">Testing for antibodies to HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 should be performed for all blood donors and patients presenting with relevant clinical signs and symptoms. In the United States, since 1988 all blood donors have been screened for antibodies to both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 using assays that include both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 antigens (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0096">96</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0108">108</link>). A study in the United States from over 14 million blood donations between 2011 and 2012 reported a confirmed positive HTLV-1/2 rate of 0.34/10,000 donations (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0109">109</link>). Testing for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 should also be offered to people who are from areas where HTLV is endemic, who engage in high-risk behaviors such as needle sharing, and who have had sexual contact with persons from either group. Currently, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 testing is not routinely performed for fertility or pregnancy testing in the United States. This is different from some European countries, as well as some islands in the West Indies, where recommendations have been made to test pregnant and breast-feeding women originating from areas of HTLV-1 endemicity such as Japan (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0110">110</link>). Pregnancy has been shown to not interfere with HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 serologic and molecular diagnostic testing (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0111">111</link>). In addition, in the United States all donors of viable, leukocyte-rich cells or tissue (e.g., hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and semen) are screened for HTLV-1 and -2 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0112">112</link>). HTLV-1 infection transmitted from solid organ donors to recipients has resulted in rapid development of subacute myelopathy in 40% of these patients, raising concerns for increased disease risk following this procedure from infected donors (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0113">113</link>). Subsequently, HTLV screening of organ donors and recipients was mandated. However, since favorable outcomes for recipients of HTLV-1/2-positive organs in the United States and Europe have been reported, and given the low prevalence of HTLV-1 in the United States, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing Committee in 2009 eliminated the requirement for pretransplant deceased-donor HTLV-1/2 testing (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0112">112</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0114">114</link>). Organ procurement organization laboratories can continue routine donor screening, including living donors and testing of donors at increased risk of HTLV infection. Organ recipients should also be offered HTLV testing if presenting with any symptoms of HTLV infection. Nonetheless, it may still be prudent to prescreen organ donors from areas with high HTLV endemicity, as has been recommended in Japan (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0115">115</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0025">The most common screening assays detect antibodies to HTLV in serum or plasma (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0096">96</link>). The immunodominant regions of structural and regulatory proteins are well characterized and are used in diagnostic assays that detect and differentiate HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. The major test types for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are described in <link linkend="ch0105s0000a0021">Table 1</link>. The serologic testing algorithm consists of a primary screening assay followed by testing for confirmation and identification of HTLV type (<anchor id="ch0105s0000a0027"/><link linkend="ch0105s0000a0011">Fig. 2</link>). Assays for the specific detection and discrimination of HTLV-3 and -4 are not currently available (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0116">116</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0026">Primary screening assays include enzyme immunoassay (EIA), chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), particle agglutination (Fujirebio America, Fairfield, NJ), and immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0021">Table 1</link>). EIAs are sensitive and simple colorimetric tests that use purified HTLV-infected cell lysates and/or recombinant antigens or synthetic peptides. CLIA is like EIA but uses chemiluminescence for the detection step. A newer version of CLIA called electrochemical CLIA (ECLIA) uses electrochemical reactions for chemiluminescent signal detection (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0117">117</link>). ECLIA reportedly provides wider dynamic ranges and higher sensitivity. CLIAs and ECLIAs both require costly immunoassay analyzers for use and are more appropriate for high specimen volume testing at commercial laboratories, blood donation centers, and hospitals. The addition of HTLV-2 antigens to screening tests significantly improved the detection of antibodies to HTLV-2 compared with results using tests that contained only HTLV-1 antigens (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0118">118</link>). The EIA and CLIA can be automated and performed on a large scale (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0118">118</link>). However, neither EIAs nor CLIAs can differentiate between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection because of significant sequence identity of the structural proteins between the two viruses; therefore, these screening assays are referred to as tests for HTLV-1/2. Particle agglutination tests and IFAs are no longer commonly used for diagnostic testing.</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0027">Comparative analysis of various commercial screening assays containing both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 antigens indicates that sensitivity ranges from 98.9 to 100% for confirmed HTLV-1-positive specimens and 91.5 to 100% for confirmed HTLV-2-positive specimens. Specificity ranges from 90.2 to 100% (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0119">119</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0120">120</link>). Currently, one HTLV-1/2 EIA (Avioq HTLV-I/II Microelisa System; Avioq, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC) and two HTLV-1/2 CLIAs (Abbott Prism HTLV-I/HTLV-II and Abbott Alinity HTLV I/II reagent kit; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) are licensed by the FDA and are available for use in the United States. The Avioq assay was previously called the Vironostika HTLV-I/II Microelisa System and was manufactured by bioMérieux but was not commercially available in the United States for a period of time. The reported overall sensitivity estimate for all three EIAs is 100% (95% CI of 99.97 to 100% for Avioq, 99.89 to 99.96% for Abbott Prism, and 99.48 to 100.00% for Abbott Alinity). Specificities of 99.99% (95% CI, 99.95 to 100%) for Abbott Alinity, 99.93% (95% CI, 99.89 to 99.96%) for Abbott Prism HTLV-I/HTLV-II, and 99.95% (95% CI, 99.89 to 99.98%) for Avioq were reported from clinical trial data that supported the licensure of these tests. An independent study by the American Red Cross also showed that the Abbott Prism had a 100% assay sensitivity (95% CI, 99.48 to 100%) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>). All three EIAs can be used for blood donor screening and as an aid in clinical diagnosis of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection and related diseases. The Abbott Alinity EIA can also be used to screen organ donors when serum and plasma specimens are collected while the donor’s heart is still beating, and for testing of serum samples to screen cadaveric donors. The Avioq EIA can be used with serum and plasma collected from cadaveric donors. The Elecsys HTLV-I/II, the only available ECLIA, is CE-licensed but has not received FDA approval. The reported sensitivity and specificity of the Elecsys HTLV-I/II ECLIA are 100% and 99.95%, respectively. Further attempts have been made to develop a dual EIA algorithm to increase the predictive values of HTLV tests (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0011">Fig. 2</link>) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0121">121</link>). Pooling of samples for seroepidemiologic studies has been proposed; however, pooled testing is not recommended for blood donor testing (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0122">122</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0028">While most screening assays are highly sensitive, specimens containing low titers of antibodies to HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 from certain areas of HTLV endemicity, or specimens from early seroconverters, may be missed by EIA screening. NAAT can be used to detect infected individuals either with low antibody titers or within their window period prior to the development of an antibody response. Studies from blood donors in the United States. in 2011 indicated a median window period of 51 days with a range of 36 to 72 days) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0109">109</link>). However, while validated NAAT assays may be commercially available, they are not licensed by the FDA nor are they CE-marked for use in Europe. A more recent small blood donor study from Japan that used longitudinal specimens indicates window periods for assays used in that study to be 2.2 ± 0.6 months for particle agglutination, 2.6 ± 1.7 months for CLIA, 4.8 ± 6.5 months for IFA, 6.3 ± 8.7 months for WB, 2.2 ± 6 months when using both CLIA and a line immunoassay (LIA), and 4.1 ± 7.8 months for real-time PCR (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0123">123</link>).

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0029">Supplemental confirmatory or differentiation tests for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection include WBs containing viral lysates supplemented with recombinant proteins, LIAs (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium), and IFAs (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0021">Table 1</link>). Although WB assays using purified viral lysates are highly sensitive for detecting p24 and p19 Gag antibodies, they do not always detect antibodies to native Env glycoproteins. An alternative approach used in a second-generation confirmatory assay is a modified WB that contains type-specific gp46 Env recombinant proteins from HTLV-1 and -2 and a truncated form of recombinant p21 Env (r21e) that reduces nonspecific reactivity, improves performance (specificity and sensitivity), and allows differentiation between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 (MP Diagnostics WB 2.4; MP Biomedicals, Science Park, Singapore) (<anchor id="ch0105s0000a0029"/><link linkend="ch0105s0000a0033">Fig. 3</link>) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0124">124</link>).

IFAs that detect binding of antibodies from a specimen to HTLV-1- or HTLV-2-infected cells can also be used to discriminate HTLV-1/2 infections and to determine antibody titer (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>).

If the initial screening immunoassay (EIA or CLIA) is reactive, a repeat assay on the same specimen is performed in duplicate. If one or both of the repeat tests are reactive, the specimen is classified as repeatedly reactive (RR). The RR specimens are subjected to confirmatory supplemental testing that is typically done by WB when available (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0033">Fig. 3</link> and <link linkend="ch0105s0000a0021">Table 1</link>). Based on the data available in 1992, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended that the diagnostic criteria for confirmation of HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 seropositivity by supplemental tests include demonstration of antibodies to p24 Gag and to native gp46 Env and/or r21e (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0096">96</link>). Subsequent data with more sensitive assays suggest that alternative patterns of WB reactivity may be considered. The second-generation modified WB is the most used research-use WB assay worldwide (MP Diagnostics WB 2.4). Specimens with reactivity to p19 Gag (with or without p24 Gag), r21e, and rgp46<superscript>I</superscript>are referred to as HTLV-1 positive (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0033">Fig. 3A</link>). Sera with reactivity to p24 Gag (with or without p19 Gag), r21e, and rgp46<superscript>II</superscript> are referred to as HTLV-2 positive (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0033">Fig. 3B</link>). Specimens without immunoreactivity to any antigens (no bands on the WB) are considered negative for antibodies to HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 (false-positive EIA specimens). Specimens reacting with p24 Gag (with or without p19 Gag) and r21e, but with no reactivity to either rgp46<superscript>I</superscript>or rgp46<superscript>II</superscript>, are considered HTLV positive but untypeable (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0033">Fig. 3C</link>) since PCR analysis of untypeable specimens has identified the presence of HTLV-specific sequences in some cases (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0097">97</link>). This type of reactivity could indicate the presence of divergent HTLV such as HTLV-3 and HTLV-4. However, to date, HTLV-3 and -4 have been found only in Cameroon and Gabon (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0003">3</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0097">97</link>).

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0033">Both the WB assays and LIA can give indeterminate results (immunoreactivity to a single HTLV gene product or multiple bands not defined as positive above, conditions that do not meet the criteria for seropositivity [<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0033">Fig. 3D</link>]). Antibody to only Gag proteins (p24, p19) is the most common indeterminate pattern that is observed in EIA-reactive specimens and is an area of intense investigation (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0127">127</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0130">130</link>). Extensive PCR analyses using primers to detect multiple gene regions have failed to detect HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 proviral sequences in low-risk seroindeterminate people, thus indicating that these individuals are not likely to be infected with HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0127">127</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0131">131</link>). The possibility that such indeterminate WB results may represent a novel retrovirus with partial homology to HTLV has been explored; however, no DNA amplification was observed using generic PCR primers that would detect HTLV-related viruses (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0128">128</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0130">130</link>), with the exception of HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 (3–8, 97). Limited studies have established that individuals with indeterminate WB profiles generally do not have risk factors for HTLV infection (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0127">127</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0131">131</link>). Indeterminate WB results among low-risk people may represent antibodies to different viral, microbial, and cellular antigens that cross-react with HTLV proteins (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0127">127</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0131">131</link>) (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0033">Fig. 3E</link>). The predictive value of positive WB results is increased in patients with a history of any potential HTLV risk factor, including residence in areas of endemicity, history of a blood transfusion before 1988 or PWID, having multiple sexual partners without condom protection, or having sexual partners or parents from a region of endemicity (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0101">101</link>). A new study from Japan found that LIA gives significantly fewer indeterminate results when compared to WB (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0126">126</link>). In rare instances, specimens with confirmed HTLV infection have an indeterminate WB pattern of reactivity to p19 Gag (in the absence of p24 Gag) and r21e (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0101">101</link>). Likewise, in some instances, antibody to r21e may represent an early antibody response during seroconversion (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0096">96</link>). Individuals with such reactivity should be retested in 3 months by EIA and/or PCR (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0096">96</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0034">Recent data suggest that a very small number of U.S. patients with chronic progressive neurological disease with HTLV-indeterminate WB patterns may be infected with a defective HTLV or have HTLV-1 in low copy numbers (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0127">127</link>). More recently, studies in Japan and Argentina have also reported an association of low proviral loads and HTLV-1 WB-indeterminate results (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0131">131</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0132">132</link>). Furthermore, both studies also identified genetic mutations that could impact antigen detection, including large deletions, possibly resulting in indeterminate WB patterns. People who have clinical neurological symptoms or are from high-prevalence areas (e.g., African, Asian, South American, and Caribbean countries) with HTLV-1/2-indeterminate reactivity should be further investigated by NAAT and to exclude HTLV-3 and HTLV-4.</para>
        <para id="ch0105s0000p0035">Currently, in the United States decisions to accept blood donations and defer blood donors are based on results of a screening test using CLIA with reactive specimens tested using a second licensed screening test and the licensed HTLV WB assay. People who are ultimately confirmed to be antibody positive to HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 will be permanently deferred from donating blood (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0045">45</link>). Blood donors with plasma specimens that are RR on screening but not confirmed as seropositive for HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 (including false EIA-reactive and supplemental test indeterminate specimens and specimens for which supplemental testing was not performed) should be notified and deferred if the same test result is obtained on two separate donations (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0096">96</link>). Screening tests are weighted toward better sensitivity than specificity because of the public health implications of false-negative results (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0133">133</link>). Therefore, in the absence of known risk factors for a given blood donor, RR results from a single-test kit most likely represent false-positive reactions. The positive predictive value of a test result is always a function of the prevalence of disease in the screened population, which for HTLV is extremely low in blood donors following implementation of screening in 1988 in the U.S. (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0109">109</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0121">121</link>). The lower the prevalence, the lower the positive predictive value of a test. Thus, blood specimens are routinely tested using the dual-screening test algorithm (<link linkend="ch0105s0000a0011">Fig. 2</link>) to increase the probability of detecting actual infection (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0121">121</link>). Since sensitivities are similar in each individual screening test and nonspecific reactivity is not, specimens reactive in both tests are likely true positives (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0121">121</link>). Nonetheless, WB-indeterminate results are seen in RR U.S. blood donors but have been shown by PCR to be HTLV negative in nearly all cases (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0053">53</link>). Thus, additional testing either by PCR or from specimens collected at a later time point is required to resolve infection in these people. Many studies have reported high concordance between WB and PCR results of infected and uninfected U.S. blood donors (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0133">133</link>–<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0135">135</link>). Using NAAT instead of WB has also been suggested for confirmation of RR specimens but requires whole blood or PBMCs and is not a rapid test (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0136">136</link>). Studies in 2011 and 2012 showed that testing of donors deferred with initial RR results using historic and now discontinued screening EIAs, but without confirmed HTLV infection, could be reconsidered for donation eligibility if a current sample tests negative using the more sensitive and specific CLIA test (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0105s0000li0045">45</link>). More recently, the use of the dual-test algorithm using two different EIAs was validated with the licensed supplementary WB test (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0137">137</link>). In 2020, the FDA updated its guidance for requalification for donors with reactive HTLV-1/2 test results (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0138">138</link>). The recommendation includes donation reentry for persons who were indefinitely deferred for having negative or indeterminate test results with an investigational or licensed supplementary test or a research-use supplemental algorithm before the licensed supplemental test was available, or for those not further tested for HTLV-1/2 before the licensed supplemental test was available. Previous donors with these reactive test results can reenter donation after testing negative with a new specimen collected at least 6 months following the deferral date.</para>

        <para id="ch0105s0000p0036">Individuals with HTLV-1- or HTLV-2-positive or indeterminate test results are counseled according to the guidelines established by the U.S. Public Health Service Working Group at the CDC (<link linkend="ch0105s0000li0094">94</link>). Though published in 1993, the guidelines remain effective because the epidemiology of HTLV transmission has not changed. These guidelines state that people should be informed that HTLV is not HIV and that their risk of developing HTLV-related diseases is low. HTLV-1- or HTLV-2-infected people are asked not to donate blood, semen, organs, or other tissues and not to share needles or syringes. To prevent transmission of HTLV, the infected person is counseled to use protective measures during sexual activity, and women are counseled to refrain from breast-feeding. Although the person-to-person transmissibility of HTLV-3 and -4 are unknown, they likely spread like HTLV-1 and -2 and thus persons with these infections should be counseled similarly. People who have indeterminate results on two separate occasions at least 3 months apart should be advised that their specimens were reactive in screening for HTLV-1/2 but that these results could not be confirmed by more specific tests. Further, they should be reassured that indeterminate results are very rarely caused by HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 infection. Repeat serologic and/or PCR testing should be offered to people with indeterminate test results.</para>
