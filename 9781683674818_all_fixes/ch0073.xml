        <para id="ch0073s000000p0001">The genus<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> comprises obligately anaerobic (or occasionally aerotolerant), Gram-positive rods commonly found in soil, water, and gastrointestinal tracts of insects and animals, as well as humans. Currently, &gt;150 species and subspecies are published. A number of species originally designated to the genus <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> have been reclassified in different genera and families, mainly based on the 19 clusters provided by the analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0018">1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0002">Cluster I forms the basis of the genus<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> and is analogous to group I proposed by Johnson and Francis more than 45 years ago (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0019">2</link>). The type species, <emphasis>Clostridium butyricum</emphasis>, and most of the clinically relevant <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species cluster within rRNA homology group I (reviewed in reference <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0020">3</link>). Lawson and Rainey proposed to restrict the genus <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> to <emphasis>C. butyricum</emphasis> and related species (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0021">4</link>). According to the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN, <ulink url="http://www.bacterio.net">www.bacterio.net</ulink>), the genus name <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> is now indeed limited to this group; however, for the species outside the group, the name <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> remains as synonym. One of the clinically significant species, <emphasis>Clostridium difficile</emphasis>, was shown to be phylogenetically distant from RNA clostridial cluster I and was located in cluster XI. The most recent designation is <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0022">5</link>) within the family <emphasis>Peptostreptococcaceae.</emphasis> In Table 1 the new taxomic classification of <emphasis>Clostridium sensu lato</emphasis> is given for clinical and nonclinical human isolates. Human isolates are present in 4 families of the 17 classified in the order <emphasis>Eubacteriales</emphasis> (former <emphasis>Clostridiales</emphasis>) and 1 in the order <emphasis>Tissierellales.</emphasis> Since new species are published according to the latest correct name, it is not possible to maintain only the synonym <emphasis>Cl</emphasis><emphasis>ostridium</emphasis>.</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0003">The genus<emphasis>Sarcina</emphasis> and the species <emphasis>Clostridium putrificum</emphasis>, both rejected as <emphasis>nomen periculosum</emphasis>, are still used in literature and commercial systems. The taxonomic rules are not always applied strictly, so the nontoxic <emphasis>Clostridium tepidum</emphasis> is still considered a correct name, while the nontoxic <emphasis>C. putrificum</emphasis> is rejected (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0023">6</link>), to avoid confusion with <emphasis>Clostridium botulinum</emphasis>, and named <emphasis>Clostridium sporogenes.</emphasis> Several members of the different Botulinum groups (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0018">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0021">4</link>) have their own correct name, but <emphasis>Clostridium argentinense</emphasis> is sometimes referred to as <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> type G.</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0004">Since 2014, in addition to 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, reclassification of genera and species is supported by whole-genome sequence data. The most commonly used criterion is the average nucleotide identity (ANI), as a substitute for DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) experiments (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0024">7</link>). The whole-genome analyses are, however, not generally applied to all taxa. For the genera associated with humans (Table 1)—<emphasis>Asacchoraspora, Hathewaya, Intestinibacter, Hungatella, Anaerotrucus, Clostridioides</emphasis>, and the majority of the <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species—the phylogeny is based only on 16S rRNA gene similarity (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0021">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0022">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0025">8</link>–<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0027">10</link>). The type species of these genera, except <emphasis>Hathewaya</emphasis> and <emphasis>Hungatella</emphasis>, are included in a genome-wide analysis with some of the other genera within the <emphasis>Eubacteriales</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0028">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0029">12</link>). Besides the limitation in studied genera, the insight genome-based taxonomy is clouded by the use of different methods. 16S rRNA gene similarity is combined not only with ANI but also with similarities to housekeeping genes such as <emphasis>rpoB</emphasis>, DNA gyrase A, ATPase synthase, <emphasis>hsp60</emphasis>, and ribosomal protein genes, as well as other overall genome-related indices such as classical and digital DDH, the average amino acid identity (AAI), and percentages of conserved proteins (POCP) (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0028">11</link>–<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0034">17</link>). Despite a broad range of genome-wide analyses, the genus <emphasis>Hungateiclostridium</emphasis>, including <emphasis>H. straminisolvens</emphasis>, was rejected according to the taxonomic rules of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes; the legal name is <emphasis>Acetivibrio</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0035">18</link>). For phenotypical arguments, <emphasis>Clostridium hastiforme</emphasis> was renamed <emphasis>Tissierella praeacuta</emphasis> in 1986 (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0036">19</link>); confirmation by 16S rRNA gene sequencing followed in 2004 (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0037">20</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0073s000000p0005">Clostridia belong to the phylum<emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis> and comprise a heterogeneous (paraphyletic) group consisting of at least 12 lineages.

Morphological and phenotypic properties that have traditionally been used to define the genus include (i) the formation of endospores, (ii) anaerobic energy metabolism, (iii) an inability to reduce sulfate to sulfide, and (iv) a Gram-positive cell wall structure. The recently described new genera are based on genetic features; the phenotypical characteristics play almost no role (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0038">21</link>–<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0040">23</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0073s000000p0006">Vegetative cells of<emphasis>Clostridium sensu lato</emphasis> species are pleomorphic, rod shaped, and arranged in pairs or short chains; the cells have rounded or sometimes pointed ends (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0024">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0041">24</link>). Rods may join to form tight helical coiled configurations in species such as <emphasis>C. cocleatum, C. ramosum, C. saccharogumia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. spiroforme</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0042">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0043">26</link>). Clostridia stain Gram positive in early stages of growth, although some species, such as <emphasis>Enterocloster</emphasis> (<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis>) <emphasis>clostridioformis, Hungatella</emphasis> (<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis>) <emphasis>hathewayi, C. innocuum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. ramosum</emphasis>, may appear Gram negative. Several species (e.g., <emphasis>C. tetani</emphasis>) appear Gram negative by the time that spores have formed. Endospores are often wider than the vegetative organisms, imparting characteristic spindle shapes to clostridia. Most strains are motile by means of uniformly distributed flagella. Nonmotile species include <emphasis>C. perfringens, C. ramosum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. innocuum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0024">7</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0007"><emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species are metabolically diverse. As currently designated (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0018">1</link>), most species are chemoorganotrophic; some species may be chemoautotrophic and chemolithotrophic. They can be saccharolytic, proteolytic, neither, or both; they do not carry out dissimilatory sulfate reduction. They usually produce mixtures of organic acids and alcohols from carbohydrates, proteins and peptides, or purines and pyrimidines.</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0008">Most species are obligately anaerobic, although the tolerance to oxygen varies widely; some species (e.g.,<emphasis>C. tertium</emphasis>) grow, but do not sporulate, in the presence of air, and a few aerotolerant species, such as <emphasis>C. carnis, H.</emphasis> (<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis>) <emphasis>histolytica</emphasis>, and occasional strains of <emphasis>C. perfringens</emphasis>, grow on solid media incubated under 5 to 10% CO<subscript>2.</subscript> Aerotolerant clostridia and certain <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> species may be distinguished by several means: (i) clostridia usually form spores only under anaerobic conditions, (ii) they grow better anaerobically than in air, (iii) they usually do not produce catalase, and (iv) they have straight-chain, saturated, and monounsaturated cellular fatty acid compositions, whereas <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> species have branched-chained cellular fatty acids. Although <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species are usually catalase and superoxide dismutase negative, trace amounts of these enzyme activities may be detected in some strains, such as <emphasis>C. perfringens.</emphasis> In addition, clostridia lack a cytochrome system and are thus oxidase negative. Clostridia often occur in nature and in infections as consortia of mixed species, wherein aerobic and facultative organisms utilize oxygen, provide nutrients or other factors, and create an environment favorable for clostridial growth.</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0009">Clostridia produce the highest number of toxins of any type of bacteria. Interestingly, some toxins are useful pharmacological and biological tools. Most of the clostridial toxins are pore-forming toxins, responsible for gangrenes and gastrointestinal diseases. Three groups of clostridial toxins have the ability to enter cells: large clostridial glycosylating toxins, binary toxins, and neurotoxins (reviewed in reference<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0044">27</link>). At least 15 species of <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> cluster I produce protein toxins, and new toxins and virulence proteins have been discovered through traditional isolation techniques and genomic analyses (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0045">28</link>). These proteins include neurotoxins, enterotoxins, cytotoxins, collagenases, permeases, necrotizing toxins, lipases, lecithinases, hemolysins, proteinases, hyaluronidases, DNases, ADP-ribosyltransferases, neuraminidases, and some others that are simply known as lethal toxins. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) are the most potent toxins known, with lethal doses of 0.2 to 10 ng per kg of body weight for various animals, including humans (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0045">28</link>). BoNT-like toxins are also discovered in <emphasis>Enterococcus faecium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Weissella oryzae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0046">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0047">30</link>). Epsilon toxin is a 33-kDa protein produced by <emphasis>C. perfringens</emphasis> type B and D strains, and in animals it causes edema and hemorrhage in the brain, heart, spinal cord, and kidneys. It is among the most lethal of clostridial toxins and is considered a potential bioterrorism agent (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0045">28</link>). Some pathogenic clostridia, such as <emphasis>C. botulinum, Clostridioides difficile, C. perfringens</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. spiroforme</emphasis>, employ a binary protein mechanism for intoxicating the intestine. These binary proteins form a complex of ADP-ribosyltransferase and cell-binding components that intoxicate cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0048">31</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0073s000000p0010"><emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species are widespread in nature due to their ability to form resistant endospores. They are commonly found in soil, feces, sewage, and marine sediments. The ecology of <emphasis>C. perfringens</emphasis> in soil is greatly influenced by the degree and duration of animal husbandry, and this has relevance to the incidence of gas gangrene caused by contamination of wounds with soil. For example, the incidence of clostridial gas gangrene was higher in agricultural lands in Europe than in the Sahara Desert of Africa. Similarly, the incidences of tetanus and foodborne botulism are also clearly related to the presence of clostridial spores in soil, water, and many foods. Outbreaks of hospital-acquired enteric <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> infections (CDI) are often traceable to environmental sources and other typical background factors for health care-related infection, though it has been suggested that asymptomatic carriers also play a role. Clostridia are present in large numbers in the indigenous microbiota of the intestinal tracts of humans and animals, in the female genital tract, and in the oral mucosa as well.</para>

Endogenous clostridia, in association with non-spore-forming anaerobes and facultative or aerobic organisms, also cause severe infections in diabetic patients and in patients in whom the mucosal integrity of the bowel or respiratory system has been compromised. Head and neck infections, brain abscesses, sinusitis, otitis, aspiration pneumonia, lung abscesses, pleural empyemas, cholecystitis, intra-abdominal infections, gynecologic and obstetric infections, soft tissue infections, myonecrosis, and septic arthritis and bone infections all may involve clostridia. Common predisposing factors are surgical procedures, trauma, vascular stasis, bowel obstruction, malignancy, immunosuppressive agents, diabetes mellitus, prior aerobic infection, and use of antimicrobial agents with poor activity against clostridia (see the section on <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> below).</para>

Life-threatening soft tissue infections caused by <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species are characterized by their fulminant nature, distinctive clinical presentations, and complex management issues. The <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species <emphasis>C. perfringens, C. septicum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>H.</emphasis> (<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis>) <emphasis>histolytica</emphasis> are the principal causes of trauma-associated gas gangrene, and their incidence increases dramatically in times of war, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other mass casualty conditions (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0051">34</link>). In contrast, cases of nontraumatic or spontaneous clostridial myonecrosis have been reported in both adults and children. The source of the <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species is usually the gastrointestinal tract, where the most frequently found <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species are <emphasis>C. perfringens</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0052">35</link>). Higher mortality rates are seen when <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> is the causative agent. <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> is isolated only rarely from the feces of healthy individuals, but may be found in the appendixes of normal individuals. It is associated with spontaneous gas gangrene in association with gastrointestinal abnormalities and neutropenia (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0041">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0052">35</link>). More than 50% of patients whose blood cultures are positive for this organism have some gastrointestinal anomaly, such as diverticular disease, or an underlying malignancy, such as carcinoma of the colon.

Patients with diabetes mellitus, severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or anaerobic myonecrosis (gas gangrene) may also develop <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> bacteremia (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0054">37</link>). The clinical importance of recognizing <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> bacteremia and starting appropriate treatment immediately cannot be overemphasized. Patients with this condition are usually gravely ill and may have metastatic spread to distant anatomic sites, resulting in spontaneous myonecrosis (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0053">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0054">37</link>).

In <emphasis>C. perfringens</emphasis> foodborne disease, the food vehicle is typically improperly cooked meat or a meat product that has cooled slowly after being cooked or may have been inadequately reheated. However, other sources have also been reported, such as leeks in cheese sauce (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0066">49</link>). Because the spores of some strains are resistant to temperatures as high as 100°C for more than 1 h, spores surviving the initial cooking germinate, and vegetative cells proliferate at temperatures of 12 to 54°C during slow cooling or insufficient reheating. Illness results from the ingestion of food containing about 10<superscript>8</superscript> or more viable vegetative cells, which sporulate in the alkaline environment of the small intestine, producing an enterotoxin (<emphasis>C. perfringens</emphasis> enterotoxin [CPE], a pore-forming toxin) in the process (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0067">50</link>).

The beta toxin gene is located on a plasmid (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0069">52</link>), and this toxin is mainly responsible for pathogenesis (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0070">53</link>). Enteritis necroticans is a life-threatening infection causing ischemic necrosis of the jejunum, which occurs in developing countries and is rare in developed countries. In Papua New Guinea during the 1960s, it was found to be the most frequent cause of death in children; it has been associated with pig feasts and occurs both sporadically and in outbreaks. Immunization against the beta toxin decreased the incidence of the disease in New Guinea (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0071">54</link>). Enteritis necroticans has also been recognized in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other developed nations, especially involving adults who are malnourished or who have diabetes, alcoholic liver disease (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0072">55</link>), or neutropenia (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0073">56</link>).</para>

The etiology and pathogenesis of this disease have remained an enigma for more than 4 decades (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0074">57</link>). The exact pathophysiology is not yet elucidated, though prematurity, use of formula feeding, and altered intestinal microbiota are supposed to induce an inflammatory response of the immature intestine (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0075">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0076">59</link>).

In contrast to human botulism, animal botulism is not rare and can occur in outbreaks among wild and domesticated animals (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0126">109</link>). There are more than 40 different BoNT types. BoNTs consist of three primary domains: two of these domains enable binding to nerve terminals and translocation of the toxin into the neuronal cytosol, and the third domain comprises a metalloprotease that inhibits the release of neurotransmitter by peripheral nerve terminals, which causes the flaccid paralysis and autonomic dysfunctions that are typical of botulism (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0126">109</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0127">110</link>).There are eight serotypically distinct BoNTs (A through H) (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0127">110</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0128">111</link>), which serve as useful clinical and epidemiological markers (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0129">112</link>).

        <para id="ch0073s000000p0044">Regardless of the category of botulism, the toxin enters the bloodstream at a peripheral site (e.g., gut, wound, or lung) and is transferred to the neuromuscular junctions of motor neurons, where it binds irreversibly to the presynaptic membranes. The site of action of all serotypes of BoNT is the presynaptic terminal of motor neurons (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0139">122</link>–<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0141">124</link>).

Elucidation of the three-dimensional structures of botulinum and tetanus toxins and their constituent domains has provided considerable insights into their mechanisms of action (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0140">123</link>). BoNT penetrates the plasma membrane by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the light chain of 50 kDa (the catalytic domain) is internalized into the nerve cell through a protein channel (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0140">123</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0141">124</link>). Once internalized, BoNT specifically cleaves proteins involved in vesicle trafficking of neurotransmitters to the membrane (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0141">124</link>). Exocytosis of acetylcholine is prevented at the nerve terminal to the neuromuscular junction, with consequent blockage of innervation of muscle activity (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0141">124</link>). The clinical hallmark of botulism is an acute flaccid paralysis, which begins with bilateral cranial nerve impairment involving muscles of the eyes, face, head, and pharynx and then descends symmetrically to involve muscles of the thorax and extremities. Botulinum toxin, unlike TeNT, probably does not enter the central nervous system (CNS). In naturally occurring foodborne botulism, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [more often constipation or obstipation]) may precede the neurologic signs of descending flaccid paralysis. Death results from respiratory failure caused by paralysis of the tongue or muscles of the pharynx, leading to occlusion of the upper airway, or from paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0139">122</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0142">125</link>).

The first sign of illness is usually constipation, which is often overlooked. Infants develop lethargy and mild weakness, with feeding difficulties, pooled oral secretions, and an altered cry. They eventually lose head control and may go on to develop ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, flaccid facial expression, dysphagia, other signs of cranial nerve deficits, generalized muscular weakness, and finally respiratory insufficiency and the inability to swallow. There is likely a spectrum of clinical features in infant botulism, ranging from mild illness not requiring hospitalization to severe botulism requiring intensive care.

The light chain, a zinc endopeptidase, enters the cytoplasm and traverses from the nerve terminal to the nerve cell body by retrograde axonal transport (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0141">124</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0159">142</link>), eventually reaching neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem, where it affects glycinergic and GABA (γ-amino-<emphasis>n</emphasis>-butyric acid)-ergic neurotransmission (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0141">124</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0159">142</link>). Inhibitory impulses to CNS neurons are blocked, while uninhibited firing of motor nerve transmission continues, resulting in prolonged muscle spasms of both flexor and extensor muscles that can persist for weeks. The mechanism by which exocytosis of neurotransmitter release is inhibited is analogous to that of BoNT; in fact, TeNT cleaves the vesicle-associated membrane protein at the same peptide bond as BoNT B (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0140">123</link>). Unlike with the pathophysiology of botulism, TeNT is retrogradely transported in neurons to the CNS and its site of action (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0141">124</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0159">142</link>).</para>

Multiple tissue specimens should be sampled from the active sites of infection when gas gangrene is suspected, because clostridia are often not distributed uniformly in pathologic lesions.

Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) to detect <emphasis>C. perfringens</emphasis> enterotoxin directly in fecal material are more sensitive and specific than Vero cell assay and RPLA and are preferred at the Gastrointestinal Bacteria Reference Unit (GBRU) of Public Health, London.

The optimum diagnostic assay or algorithm remains a matter of debate, but methods can be stratified into three major categories: those that detect toxin A and toxin B (EIAs and cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assays [CCCNAs]), those that detect the organism (anaerobic culture or glutamate dehydrogenase [GDH] testing), and those that detect the gene(s) for toxin(s) (nucleic acid amplification tests [NAATs]) (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0178">161</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0179">162</link>).

In the study by Dubberke et al. (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0182">165</link>), when clinical parameters were used to assess assay performance, NAATs had the lowest specificity among diagnostic assays. This was in part due to inappropriate test ordering, as 36% of patients tested did not have diarrhea and 20% of tested patients had received a laxative (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0182">165</link>). Likewise, in a very large prospective multicenter study in the United Kingdom, the authors found that results that were positive by a NAAT but negative for toxin by CCCNA correlated with neither mortality nor prolonged length of stay (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0180">163</link>). The authors concluded that the use of NAATs leads to overdiagnosis of CDI, since NAATs did not differentiate between the carrier state and disease. They suggested that NAATs could be used as first-stage tests to exclude the presence of toxigenic <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>, followed by a test for toxin (protein) to identify patients most likely to have <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> disease. This two-step algorithm with a direct toxin detection test is also recommended by the ECDC for CDI surveillance in Europe (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0179">162</link>). An alternative is to include the quantity of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> in the stool specimen in the judgment of colonization versus disease, since low cycle threshold values as assessed by quantitative PCR correlate with free toxin concentrations in stool specimens (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0183">166</link>). The major limitation to algorithms that begin with either a GDH assay or a NAAT is that a sensitive assay for detection of toxin does not exist, though new single-molecule array technology has been recently developed (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0184">167</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0185">168</link>).

CCCNAs involve inoculating a filtrate of stool onto a monolayer of an appropriate cell line and observing for cytopathic effect after 24 to 48 h of incubation at 37°C. A number of different cell lines with various sensitivities for toxins A and B, such as human foreskin fibroblasts, Vero cells, and MRC-5 lung fibroblasts, among others, have been used. Once cytopathic effect is observed, neutralization is required to assess the specificity of cytopathic effect and can be performed using <emphasis>P.</emphasis> (<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis>) <emphasis>sordellii</emphasis> or <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> antisera. The cytopathic effect of infections associated with TcdA-negative, TcdB-positive strains differs from that of infections with strains that produce both toxins and may be difficult to recognize. The need for neutralization of the cytopathic effect marks a limitation of the test. Performance characteristics of CCCNAs vary considerably, likely related to the comparative method and also to technical factors that can affect accurate performance (reviewed in references <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0178">161</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0179">162</link>). However, in a large prospective study in the United Kingdom, a CCCNA performed using Vero cells showed the best correlation with clinical outcome (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0180">163</link>) compared to assays that detected the presence of the organism. As laboratories embrace molecular techniques for viral diagnostics, many have abandoned cell culture facilities, making CCCNAs less attractive assays for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> diagnosis. In addition, the length of time required to complete testing has also limited their utility (Table 2).</para>
          <para id="ch0073s000000p0068">New single-molecule array (SIMOA) technology has been recently developed for toxin detection (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0184">167</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0185">168</link>). It consists of toxin capture by specific anti-toxin A and B antibodies coated on paramagnetic beads, followed by detection with specific antibody conjugated to an enzyme β-galactosidase. Beads are then incubated with enzyme substrate and individually isolated in microwells of an array for digital imaging. The analytical sensitivity of the SIMOA assay is higher than those of the cytotoxicity assay and EIA, with a limit of detection of approximately 1 pg/ml. The specificity to diagnose CDI is not well known, since toxin concentrations did not differentiate patients with CDI from asymptomatic carriage (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0185">168</link>). SIMOA technology has the potential to improve and simplify the CDI diagnosis, but further studies are required and FDA approval has not been acquired.</para>

These assays detect both toxins A and B using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies embedded in rapid immunochromatographic or lateral-flow membranes or in microwell and solid-phase devices. The result of toxin testing is the declaration that the sample is toxin positive or negative, without any differentiation of TcdA and TcdB. Testing using assays that detect TcdA alone is not recommended, since some epidemic strains (RT 017) produce only TcdB (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0086">69</link>). Immunoassays generally show lower sensitivities and specificities (31 to 99% and 84 to 100%, respectively) than CCCNAs (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0178">161</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0179">162</link>), though test performances markedly improved after 2010 (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0179">162</link>). The variability in performance led to the common practice of submitting multiple specimens to the laboratory (“stools for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> times three”), adding expense and reducing the PPV of such testing. Due to the poor sensitivity and specificity of these tests, EIAs are considered only suboptimal for the diagnosis of CDIs, and many laboratories have replaced them with GDH- or NAAT-based testing algorithms. In summary, a variety of diagnostic test methods are available for the diagnosis of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> disease (Table 2).</para>

According to the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), a two-step algorithm predicated on the initial results for GDH or NAAT followed by a sensitive toxin test is the best option at present (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0179">162</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0186">169</link>). EIAs as stand-alone tests for toxin detection lack sensitivity and specificity. Positive CCCNA results seem to correlate the best with poor patient outcomes. Patients with a first positive NAAT test and a negative second test for toxins should be clinically evaluated: they can be either truly infected (with a toxin level below the threshold detection of the toxin EIA) or simply carriers of a toxigenic strain. If GDH was the initial test, then an optional third step can be toxigenic culture or NAAT to distinguish toxigenic from nontoxigenic strains (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0179">162</link>). A three-step algorithm may delay diagnosing CDI and may be less cost-effective. Diagnostic accuracy will be enhanced by restricting testing to patients with appropriate clinical symptoms regardless of the method. As an alternative to the two-step algorithm, IDSA/SHEA (Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America) guidelines recommend that NAAT alone be used when pretest probability is improved by preventing testing of patients on laxatives or patients without diarrhea (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0187">170</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0073s000000p0108">Typing of<emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> fosters understanding of the epidemiology of infections and has become increasingly important with the emergence of outbreaks caused by hypervirulent strains. To study the epidemiology of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>, a typing method must have sufficient discriminatory power, typing ability (the ability to type isolates unambiguously), reproducibility, and transportability (the ability to perform the method reproducibly in a fully compatible fashion in different laboratories at different times) and must be relatively easy to perform (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0241">224</link>). In the event of a pattern of an increase in the number of severe cases of disease in human (or animal) communities or increased transmission in hospitals, typing of strains may provide useful information on a dominant, potentially more transmissible clone. This may occur locally; for example, it resulted in detection of newly identified <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> PCR ribotype 826 at a small outbreak in an academic hospital (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0242">225</link>). Additionally, national hospital-based CDI surveillance may reveal the spread of new hypervirulent types between hospitals, such as type 176 in Poland (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0243">226</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0244">227</link>). PCR ribotyping can also be used to compare the distribution of various <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> types isolated from animals, humans, and food, which can suggest a trend towards foodborne disease or zoonotic potential of specific PCR RTs. For instance, the emerging <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> type 078 in humans is found in high numbers in animals, especially piglets and calves, and can be considered the cause of a zoonosis (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0245">228</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0246">229</link>). Physicians should be aware of their local <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> situation and should know whether hypervirulent strains are circulating in the community, as this allows risk assessment for patients and perhaps heightened infection control practices. It is obvious from investigations of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> strains that every region may have its particular pattern of strains, with ribotypes differing between different countries in Europe but also between different regions of a single state (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0243">226</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0247">230</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0248">231</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0073s000000p0109">To resolve endemic-disease situations, to monitor the spread of infection, and to assess the genetic relatedness of the associated strains, the successful cultivation of<emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> is required. Starting with the pure culture, several approaches have been used for such analyses. Restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), PFGE, PCR ribotyping, toxinotyping, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) represent the most common methods used in epidemiologic studies (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0241">224</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0249">232</link>–<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0251">234</link>). For example, the initial epidemic North American hypervirulent isolates were typed as 027 by PCR ribotyping, designated toxinotype III by typing the toxin A and B genes of the PaLoc, and designated NAP1 by PFGE and type BI by REA (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0094">77</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0095">78</link>). The typing methods are briefly discussed here, as each has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Various tools (Simpson’s index of diversity, Rand coefficients, and Wallace coefficients) have been used to assess the congruence between results of various typing methods (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0251">234</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0252">235</link>). In general, the more cumbersome and time-consuming restriction digestion methods are being replaced by PCR and sequencing-based methods. Restriction endonuclease DNA analysis of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> using HindIII restriction digestion of total genomic DNA was one of the earlier molecular methods to be adopted for strain characterization (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0249">232</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0253">236</link>). Several studies over a decade describe it as a sensitive, discriminating, and reproducible method, but currently, few laboratories employ this method of strain typing for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>, likely because of the complexity involved in its performance and interpretation.</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0110">PFGE has been the major method used for strain characterization of<emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> in North America. SmaI has been the infrequently cutting restriction enzyme most often used for this purpose. While this method has excellent discriminatory power, it is laborious and expensive to perform and may yield patterns that cannot be assigned to existing NAP types (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0241">224</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0111">PCR ribotyping has been used globally to define the epidemiology of<emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> and has become the reference method in Europe (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0241">224</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0254">237</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0255">238</link>). PCR ribotyping is done with two specific primers that amplify the spacer region between the 16S and the 23S rRNAs. The spacer region is known for its heterogeneous nature, as opposed to the highly conserved rRNA genes themselves. <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> contains 10 rRNA copies, and variations in the spacer regions are seen between different strains but also between different rRNA copies of a single strain. Gel-based PCR ribotyping has been replaced by a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method which is better standardized (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0254">237</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0255">238</link>). A website (WEBRIBO; <ulink url="https://webribo.ages.at/">https://webribo.ages.at/</ulink>) is freely available to automatically analyze and compare <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> capillary sequence-based PCR ribotyping data and simplifies laboratory PCR ribotyping methods. CE-PCR ribotyping is less complex than PFGE and REA and has shown good interlaboratory agreement (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0241">224</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0251">234</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0254">237</link>). Currently, more than 900 ribotypes exist. Similar to what was done in The Netherlands, the Health Protection Agency in the United Kingdom created the <emphasis>Clostridium difficile</emphasis> Ribotyping Network as part of an enhanced national surveillance program (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0256">239</link>). National CDI surveillance programs have now been established in various European countries with the ECDC as the coordinator and CE-PCR ribotyping as the standard typing method (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0248">231</link>). Prospective <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> typing results provided an understanding of regional and national prevalence of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> ribotypes and their associated complication rates, particularly with respect to so-called “hypervirulent” ribotypes 027 and 078 (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0248">231</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0256">239</link>). It was believed that access to these data would contribute to heightened infection control and clinical interventions.</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0112">MLST involves partial amplification and sequencing of several housekeeping genes. Data generated with this and other sequence-based methods are unambiguous compared to those obtained by fragment-based methods and thus may be more easily compared between laboratories (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0241">224</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0251">234</link>). The costs with MLST are high compared with PCR methods.</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0113">The availability of next-generation sequencing technologies currently allows laboratories to use rapid whole-genome data in routine epidemiologic investigations. The two main approaches to study genomic variations are single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and methods based on gene-by-gene comparison (core genome MLST [cgMLST] or whole genome MLST [wgMLST]) (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0257">240</link>). SNP analysis provides the highest resolution, but it is relatively slow, requires extensive bioinformatic tools, is reference dependent, and is difficult to standardize, and typing nomenclature is missing. Two commercial software packages (BioNumerics [bioMérieux, Marcy l’Étoile, France] and Ridom SeqSphere+ [Ridom Bioinformatics, Münster, Germany]) and an open source database (EnteroBase) for allele and sequence type determination are currently available for cg/wgMLST. Various studies show that cgMLST is concordant with CE-PCR ribotyping, but only a restricted number of different ribotypes were analyzed and outbreaks were not included. Seth-Smith and colleagues showed that cgMLST predicted 36 ribotypes using nearly 300 well-characterized clinical strains from Switzerland (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0258">241</link>). However, some ribotype complexes (RT 078/126) have a low genomic difference, whereas other ribotypes (e.g., RT 023) were very disperse. Nevertheless, cgMLST has the potential to be an alternative to CE-PCR ribotyping. The method is reproducible and easy to standardize and offers higher discrimination.</para>

Now that more laboratories are identifying anaerobes by MALDI-TOF MS, more accurate species identification will be available and more reliable susceptibility data can be generated. In the past, antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobes showed predictable patterns and empirical therapy could be safely administered, but recently a steady and clear increase in the resistance to several important drugs (β-lactams, metronidazole, and clindamycin) has been observed worldwide (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0271">254</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0272">255</link>). For this reason, antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobic isolates for patient treatment or surveillance purposes is of paramount importance. In addition, because of the inherent difficulty of performing susceptibility studies in anaerobes, new methods using phenotypic and molecular techniques are being developed (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0269">252</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s000000li0271">254</link>).</para>

Surveillance studies from Europe, the United States, and Australia show that reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole was scarce and varied per PCR ribotype (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0273">256</link>–<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0276">259</link>). Rifampin, moxifloxacin, and clindamycin resistance was evident in multiple ribotypes in Europe and the United States, but less frequently in Australia. A new form of reduced susceptibility to metronidazole has been found, located on plasmids and present in the heme-responsive gene <emphasis>hsmA</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0277">260</link>–<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0279">262</link>), but its prevalence is still very low.

        <para id="ch0073s000000p0119">The clostridia are variably resistant to cephalosporins and tetracyclines, and they are usually resistant to the aminoglycosides.

        <para id="ch0073s000000p0121">The isolation of a<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species from a clinical specimen, even a blood culture, may or may not be significant clinically, and culture results should be interpreted in relation to the clinical findings for the patient. Spores of clostridia from the patient’s own intestinal microbiota may be present on the skin and may contaminate blood samples or other specimens. Bacteremia may be transient or clinically insignificant. In addition, most clostridia currently encountered in wounds, exudates, blood, and other normally sterile body fluids are opportunistic and may not cause serious or progressive disease unless conditions are suitable in the host. As discussed above, one exception to this generalization is <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis>, which is rarely encountered in blood cultures except from patients who have an underlying malignancy or neutropenic sepsis. <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> sepsis is an infectious disease emergency that requires prompt and clear communication between the laboratory and the clinician in order to institute early surgical measures and treatment with antimicrobial agents to improve outcomes (<link linkend="ch0073s000000li0054">37</link>). <emphasis>C. tertium, C. perfringens</emphasis>, and other clostridia, to a lesser extent, may be involved in serious infections that require emergency measures. The best approach for preventing tragic consequences that may be avoidable is good communication between microbiologists and clinicians.</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0122">The accurate and timely reporting of preliminary results (e.g., findings from direct microscopic examinations of clinical specimens and direct MALDI-TOF MS analysis from signaled blood culture bottles), as well as early culture results (after 24 and 48 h of incubation), can be extremely valuable to the physician. The colony characteristics and microscopic features of some clostridia (e.g.,<emphasis>C. perfringens, P.</emphasis> [<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis>] <emphasis>sordellii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. sporogenes</emphasis>) may be distinctive, so preliminary or presumptive reports may be released before aerotolerance studies are completed. The application of MALDI-TOF MS has reduced the time for identification considerably. Accurate, definitive identification is needed to better define the role of clostridia in disease, to aid the clinician in selecting optimal treatment, and for public health purposes (e.g., hospital-acquired <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> disease).</para>
        <para id="ch0073s000000p0123">Potentially life-threatening diseases due to<emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species or their toxins, such as botulism, tetanus, or severe cases of CDI, should be carefully examined by the physician and the microbiologist together to ensure optimal sample collection and transport, immediate processing, and initiation of specific therapy. Furthermore, health care institutions require accurate and rapid diagnosis for early detection of possible outbreaks and to implement effective control measures.</para>
