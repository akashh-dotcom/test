In addition, FDA approval has been obtained for one SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, and Emergency Use Authorization has been obtained for several others (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0006">6</link>). When antiviral drugs are used over long periods of time, inconsistently, or with inadequate dosing, variants may be selected which may become drug resistant and are no longer susceptible to therapy (see <ulink url="ch0135#ch0135s0001">chapter 115</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). Determining whether the virus may be drug resistant is a critical step in the treatment strategy.</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0001p0003">Testing for viral susceptibility, primarily via genotypic drug resistance mutation testing, is now standard practice for the management of viral infections for optimum patient care. FDA-cleared assays for viral susceptibility testing are limited to sequencing assays for HIV-1 (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0007">7</link>). However, there is demonstrated clinical utility in antiviral susceptibility testing for other viruses; this testing is typically performed using laboratory-developed tests (LDTs).</para>

      <para id="ch0136s0002p0001">Antiviral resistance is expressed as a drop in the efficacy of a drug to inhibit viral replication. Resistance is demonstrated clinically by an increase or no change in the amount of circulating virus in the infected individual despite active treatment. The loss of susceptibility can be measured by<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> testing, which evaluates the phenotypic activity of drug-virus combinations. If the decrease in drug effect is related to specific mutations in the virus genome, affecting function of the protein which the drug targets, then the resistance to that drug may be an inherently transmissible feature of the virus. This genotypic and phenotypic expression provides combined evidence for the loss of drug activity against the virus and is documented during drug development. Independent confirmation of these correlations is made by antiviral testing of viral isolates obtained from participants in clinical drug trials. Diagnostic assays may then be developed that measure the change in response of the virus to a drug and/or identify the presence of the specific viral mutations associated with the observed loss of susceptibility. Interpretations of the data from these assays are used to clinically manage viral infections.</para>

      <para id="ch0136s0003p0001">The failure to respond to therapy may occur even if the infecting virus does not harbor any mutations associated with antiviral susceptibility. Host physiologic factors can interfere with a successful clinical response. For example, the genetic background of the host may lessen the effect of the drug, as host polymorphisms, such as those identified in the IL28b gene, are associated with the likelihood of sustained virologic response to pegylated interferon (peg-IFN)–ribavirin for HCV, the therapeutic option that preceded direct-acting antivirals (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0008">8</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0003p0002">Another nonviral factor is the potential for drug-drug interactions. Protease inhibitors and some non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used for HIV-1 therapy, as well as the pharmacokinetic enhancers ritonavir and cobicistat, inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for drug metabolism and may impact the levels of other antivirals (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0009">9</link>). These interactions are particularly important for individuals who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV, but drug-drug interactions should be considered in other contexts as well. As an example, the anti-CMV drug maribavir, which inhibits the kinase activity of the UL97 phosphotransferase, should not be coadministered with ganciclovir or valganciclovir, which require UL97 phosphorylation for their activity against the CMV UL54 polymerase (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0011">11</link>).</para>

For instance, physiologic and psychological side effects associated with antiretroviral drugs may occur, fueling patient intolerance for the drug. The acute and long-term symptoms, as well as complexities of the treatment, such as pill burden and timing, may also initiate problems with adherence. Consequently, the patient may choose to suspend treatment on his or her own. In addition, consistent access to and follow-through of therapy may be difficult for some individuals due to socioeconomic factors and deficiencies within the health care system. This results in treatment gaps, which foster the selection of genetically resistant viral populations, and may render entire classes of drugs ineffective.</para>

        <para id="ch0136s0004s0001p0001">It is important to determine when the lack of effective response to treatment with an antiviral drug is the result of true antiviral resistance, i.e., genetic changes in the patient’s virus, rather than other nonviral factors. The failure to recognize this difference could result in the inappropriate use of more toxic drugs and/or potentially less effective drugs, leading to higher morbidity and mortality. For example, a transplant patient may show increasing plasma CMV DNA levels during the first few weeks of antiviral therapy with ganciclovir or valganciclovir. This rise is less likely to be evidence of development of drug resistance, as it is unusual for CMV to acquire resistance within the initial 6 weeks of treatment (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0013">13</link>), and empirically switching to foscarnet or cidofovir would not be warranted.</para>
        <para id="ch0136s0004s0001p0002">The clinical category and status of the patient are important in determining whether antiviral resistance testing is indicated.<anchor id="ch0136s0004s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0136s0005a0005">Table 1</link> presents instances for both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients for whom resistance testing should be considered. In general, sustained or increasing viral load with a worsening clinical condition is a reliable indicator for the presence of emerging drug resistance. If these markers of resistance are present, it may be prudent to test the virus directly for drug resistance. Antiviral susceptibility test methods can be phenotypic or genotypic. The choice will rely on the specific virus being tested. Interpretation of the testing data may be more complex for individuals on combination therapy.</para>

      <para id="ch0136s0005p0001">The standard method of antiviral susceptibility testing is the plaque reduction assay (PRA) (<anchor id="ch0136s0005a0003"/><link linkend="ch0136s0005a0009">Fig. 1</link>). The PRA test principle relies on the ability of the antiviral agent to inhibit the production of viral plaques at a predetermined drug concentration. A 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<subscript>50</subscript>) is then calculated and subsequently reported in micrograms per milliliter or micromolar units. The threshold for resistance is typically determined by testing isolates from successfully treated patients and comparing the IC<subscript>50</subscript> values to those of isolates from patients who failed therapy with the antiviral of interest (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0014">14</link>). For HSV, acyclovir resistance is also correlated with the absence of herpes thymidine kinase activity (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0015">15</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0005p0002">PRA is especially useful for the herpesviruses (e.g., HSV, VZV, and CMV) but is time-consuming and exhibits an extended turnaround time, first requiring the isolation of a high-titer stock and subsequent serial dilution to the challenge concentration. The method then takes at least an additional 2 to 3 days for HSV, 4 to 7 days for VZV, and 21 to 28 days for CMV (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0016">16</link>–<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0018">18</link>). Note also that the cell line used for PRA may impact the results (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0019">19</link>), and method standardization is a substantial challenge.</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0005p0003">The PRA involves two testing phases. The first entails growing the clinical isolate in susceptible cells to obtain a viral stock whose titer can be determined for infectivity. For a slowly growing virus such as CMV, generation of the stock could take 3 to 4 weeks. The titration of the stock is performed by plaquing serial dilutions to quantitate the relative numbers of infectious virus particles, which for CMV takes about 10 days.</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0005p0004">The second testing phase determines the susceptibility of the virus stock to an antiviral drug using the PRA. Here, an inoculum containing a defined number of infectious virus particles from the stock (for instance, 100) is incubated in the presence of serial dilutions of the antiviral drug of interest. If the virus is susceptible to that drug, there will be a reduction in the number of plaques as the concentration of the drug increases. Resistance will be evident by minimal plaque reduction compared to growth in the absence of drug. The PRA for CMV could add another 10 days to the protocol, so that the total time to assess drug resistance could be 4 to 6 weeks. Results for a faster-growing virus, such as HSV, may take less time to obtain. There is also the question of PRA method standardization, for which an approved standard document from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for HSV has been published (M33A).</para>

      <para id="ch0136s0007p0001">Recombinant viral assays (RVAs) for drug susceptibility have also been developed for clinical use. These assays monitor phenotypic behavior in the presence of an antiviral drug that can be attributed to specific genes on the virus genome, which may contain mutations known to correlate with antiviral resistance. RVAs have been used primarily to measure HIV-1 phenotypic resistance (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0025">25</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0007p0002">In the RVA strategy, the gene of interest (e.g., the HIV-1 protease, reverse transcriptase, or integrase gene) is amplified directly from virus in the patient specimen. Afterwards, the PCR product is ligated into a retroviral vector from which the protease or RT gene was removed. The concept is that the ligation adds back the protease or RT activity associated with the gene from the patient’s virus. The vector also has the<emphasis>env</emphasis> gene, which codes for the receptor binding protein, replaced with a reporter gene coding for a light-emitting protein, such as luciferase. This vector, which now contains the HIV-1 gene of interest, is then cotransfected into a susceptible cell line along with a different plasmid. However, this plasmid contains a gene to provide a non-HIV receptor-binding protein able to attach to and infect the chosen test cells. After transfection, the newly assembled chimeric virus, called a pseudotype, incorporates the gene for the non-HIV receptor-binding protein, the genome from the retroviral vector containing the added HIV-1 protease or RT gene from the patient virus, and the reporter gene. The pseudotype virus can now infect the cells of choice to start replication for a single round. This RVA strategy allows the activity of the protease or RT derived from patient HIV to be tested in cells in the presence of antiretroviral drugs. Measurements of the replication efficiency of the engineered virus can be monitored by light emission of the luciferase expressed in the cells only during successful replication of the virus. Chimeric virus containing a protease or RT susceptible to the antiviral drug would then not emit light from infected cells, while virus containing a protease or RT resistant to the antiviral drug would emit measurable light.</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0007p0003">RVA utilizes cell culture, so the method is labor-intensive and time-consuming and requires a long turnaround time. However, the use of a standard cell line also provides assay consistency that is not possible with the use of primary cells, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells. An advantage of a recombinant assay over conventional culture is that it provides direct evidence of the antiviral activity associated with a specific gene derived from the virus population in a patient specimen. Also, if an RVA is linked with genotyping of the patient’s virus to show the presence of known resistance mutations, a direct correlation between the levels of phenotypic resistance and the mutations observed could be made, especially in patients on a complex treatment regimen (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0026">26</link>). This information may allow a more accurate snapshot of HIV-1 resistance and could offer the clinician a more accurate choice of antiretroviral drugs available if a change in treatment is contemplated.</para>

      <para id="ch0136s0008p0003">Nucleic acid amplification tests, including real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR), have also been developed for antiviral susceptibility testing. For example, RT-qPCR assays have been developed for detection of neuraminidase resistance mutations in influenza virus A (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0037">37</link>). This approach allows more than one mutation to be multiplexed in a single reaction (typically up to 4 mutations), or, alternatively, multiple reactions targeting different single mutations can be performed in parallel, to identify the complete set or subset of clinically actionable mutations for a particular virus. These assays are LDTs and are more likely to be performed by academic medical center laboratories or large commercial reference laboratories.</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0008p0004">Viral genomes with multiple, clustered resistance mutations are commonly analyzed using targeted sequencing assays based on Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing or next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0038">38</link>–<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0040">40</link>). In the case of Sanger sequencing, raw data are displayed in chromatograms, which can show the presence of low-level variants at ~10 to 20% of the predominant base. The operator should evaluate the chromatograms and proofread the data manually to determine that the quality of the sequence chromatogram produced is of acceptable resolution. Every consensus sequence developed should include sequencing of the PCR-derived template in both the forward and reverse directions to ensure sequence accuracy by verifying the presence of the identical mutation(s) in both strands of the sequencing template. This process will validate true nucleotide change as opposed to an artifact generated during the sequencing protocol (i.e., a breach in the enzyme proofreading or inconsistencies during the preparation of the sequencing sample). Sanger sequencing is useful in monitoring longer contiguous regions of the genome. High-quality sequencing reactions can yield 600 to 700 high-quality nucleotides per sequencing primer.</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0008p0005">NGS methods have also been applied to genotypic antiviral drug resistance testing and can detect minor populations typically between 1 and 5%, or in some cases less than 1% (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0038">38</link>–<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0040">40</link>). These technologies, also referred to as ultradeep, high-throughput, or massively parallel sequencing, can detect much lower levels of variants in mixed samples because of the number of genomic reads that are obtained by parallel sequencing of amplified clones or single molecules. Though NGS technologies continue to evolve, current NGS methods for genotypic antiviral resistance testing commonly use targeted PCR amplification to enrich for the resistance genes of interest. In addition, sequencing library preparation involves the addition of platform-specific adapter sequences and sequence barcodes for multiplexing, as well as the generation of fragments or amplicons of the appropriate size to be sequenced. Short-read NGS technologies, such as Illumina, yield sequence data ranging from approximately 150 to 300 bases in length. NGS genotyping workflows and implementation requirements are described in references <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0038">38</link> and <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0041">41</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0008p0006">No matter the sequencing method, interpreting the large volume of raw sequence data is challenging and requires laboratories to place the data into a bioinformatics pipeline for analysis and alignment to identify the sequence variants present in a clinical sample. Once the variants are identified, a database of drug resistance mutations that accounts for their association with phenotype, treatment, and clinical outcomes, as well as their interactions with one another, if known, should be used to render an interpretation. Though clinical sequencing assays are used to detect well-characterized drug resistance mutations, they are also capable of identifying novel mutations that may require additional characterization to confirm association with antiviral resistance. As library preparation techniques, sequencing methods, bioinformatics approaches, and resistance databases improve and automation of the entire process becomes more common, NGS is likely to serve as an important tool for the diagnosis and management of viral resistance. Nevertheless, as laboratories consider the implementation of NGS technology, many outstanding questions remain, including those concerning the clinical impact of low-level drug resistance mutations and the threshold at which mutations should be reported.</para>

The DNA polymerase inhibitor ganciclovir/valganciclovir requires phosphorylation by UL97 for activation, and therefore resistance may be identified by sequencing the UL97 gene, including the region covering the conserved domains linked to phosphotransferase activity. Mutations that confer resistance to the UL97 inhibitor maribavir, which was FDA approved in 2021, also occur in the UL97 gene (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0047">47</link>).

Sequencing methods for CMV genotypic antiviral resistance testing typically include both the UL97 and UL54 genes, while reference testing for UL56 may require a separate order or different test code (see Eurofins-Viracor and University of Washington). If testing is being submitted to evaluate for maribavir resistance, it may also be worthwhile to confirm that the assay amplifies the UL97 regions encoding the relevant mutations and that these mutations are included in the genotypic interpretation database. CMV resistance mutations are associated with different levels of phenotypic resistance; however, this information is typically not included in current clinical reports.

This test targets the UL23 herpes thymidine kinase (TK) gene, whose gene product is required to activate these nucleoside analogs by phosphorylation.

      <para id="ch0136s0013p0002">There are currently no FDA-approved or -cleared tests available to determine SARS-CoV-2 genotypic antiviral resistance. There is, however, one Emergency Use Authorized SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic test (SARS-CoV-2 NGS Assay, Twist Bioscience Corp.) whose intended use includes the identification and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak (PANGO) lineages and the identification of specific SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutations. While other companies have obtained emergency use authorization for sequence-based SARS-CoV-2 tests (Illumina and Clear Labs, for example), these tests are not authorized for variant detection. Nevertheless, academic medical centers and reference laboratories have validated laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing assays for clinical purposes. These tests may be used to inform monoclonal antibody selection, particularly during the transition from one variant to another, for example, delta to omicron or omicron/BA.1 to BA.2. A Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, 87913, is available to bill for such testing. SARS-CoV-2 genotyping by amplicon enrichment and hybridization capture whole-genome sequencing (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0104">104</link>, <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0105">105</link>), as well as by mutation-specific RT-PCR (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0106">106</link>, <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0107">107</link>), is widely used for epidemiologic surveillance.</para>

      <para id="ch0136s0014p0001">FDA-cleared genotypic antiviral resistance tests include software to analyze the raw sequence and render a resistance interpretation. A clinical laboratory wishing to perform in-house sequence-based genotypic antiviral resistance testing is required to implement their own sequence analysis pipelines using open-access or commercially available software for sequence alignment and variant calling. Another consideration is access to adequate space for secure storage of raw sequence and the results of analysis. The amount of sequencing data can be massive, particularly for NGS approaches. Finally, the availability of specialized “expert systems” is necessary to complete the interpretation (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0108">108</link>). These systems are interactive, complex databases that use rules-based algorithms for individual drugs and associated mutations to infer the significance of the sequence data (<anchor id="ch0136s0014a0003"/><link linkend="ch0136s0015a0005">Table 2</link>). The algorithms are guided by knowledge-based systems which associate primary and secondary mutations, phenotypic data, and clinical outcomes based on the Antivirogram (Virco; acquired by Jannsen Diagnostics). Sequence data from clinical specimens were analyzed and interpreted by comparison against a private database that linked genotype with phenotype and clinical outcome (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0108">108</link>, <link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0109">109</link>). The Virtual Phenotype system was discontinued December 31, 2013. The GenoSure MG and GenoSure PRIme tests (Monogram/Labcorp) compare sequence obtained from clinical samples to a proprietary database of linked genotypes and phenotypes. Another offering, GenoSure Archive, uses sequence analysis to examine proviral HIV-1 DNA from virologically suppressed patients.</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0014p0002">Sequence data can also be submitted through noncommercial and commercial interactive websites that provide a virtual phenotype (<link linkend="ch0136s0015a0005">Table 2</link>). These sites are useful but are not regulated or standardized at this time. They employ different algorithms for different virus-drug combinations and allow different levels of operator input (30, 110–114). Most of these sites can examine consensus sequences to detect relevant mutations linked to resistance, and some can provide interpretations of the significance of the observed mutations to drug efficacy. Some of the sites also provide additional tools for further analyses. These sites analyze data derived by Sanger sequencing or consensus sequences derived from NGS methods, and more recently, tools have been added to analyze NGS data directly or codon tables derived from NGS data (for example, see <ulink url="https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-reads/">https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-reads/</ulink>).</para>

      <para id="ch0136s0015p0001">There is often minimal or no standardization among the various antiviral testing methods at a technical level, but required proficiency testing provides some assurance of quality. It is critical that the laboratory should follow good laboratory practices, adhering to the stringency of defined use and separation of space to control the possibility of contamination. This is especially important when the viral nucleic acid burden of the patient sample is low. The early commercial kits for HIV-1 were optimized for EDTA plasma with a minimum concentration of 1,000 to 2,000 copies/ml of viral RNA, and additional safeguards to reduce the effects of contamination were added within the protocol by using non-nested PCR to produce the sequencing template. Typically, ~200 to 500 μl of plasma was used for extraction. However, in situations where the initial starting volumes are lower, such as genotyping from dried blood spots, or when the virus load is reduced to near undetectable, many genotyping tests incorporate nested PCR into the protocols, an approach which is vulnerable to contamination. Generation of quality data in these circumstances can still occur if the assay is performed under rigorous conditions.</para>
      <para id="ch0136s0015p0002">The analysis software provided with FDA-cleared diagnostic sequencing assays incorporates algorithms to accurately provide interpretations generated from test results. Updates to the algorithms are also FDA cleared before they are released. Alternatively, non-FDA-cleared genotyping assays developed as LDTs rely upon the individual laboratory to establish test performance and to provide useful interpretations. The sources for such interpretations may be the literature, testing by the laboratory, established online databases, or other sources. Though there is no standardization or oversight of the interpretation algorithms used, the inferred clinical significance of the data may be very similar regardless of the algorithm used. Ultimately, the use of these results and the interpretations provided by the laboratory in care of the patient are the responsibility of the laboratory medical director and primary health care provider.</para>

      <para id="ch0136s0015p0093">NGS-based genotypic antiviral resistance tests have the capability to identify variants at very low levels: 1%-of-population level or lower. For these tests it is particularly important to determine the error rate at different viral nucleic acid concentrations in order to be able to accurately distinguish a true low-level mutation from an error introduced during reverse transcription, PCR, library preparation, or the sequencing process itself (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0115">115</link>–<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0117">117</link>). Further analysis of the sequence data in an established bioinformatics pipeline program will also be essential to accurate interpretation of the mutations identified (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0118">118</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0136s0015s0001p0001">Methods for antiviral susceptibility testing have dramatically evolved over recent years in parallel with emerging molecular technologies. Genotypic testing methods utilizing nucleic acid amplification and sequencing have become invaluable tools for detecting resistance in viruses that are difficult to culture or are noncultivatable, and are now performed routinely for the clinical management of viral infections. Genotypic resistance testing is possible because the genes and nucleotide positions of the variants responsible for antiviral resistance to many antiviral therapies have been identified and characterized. As virus culture-based methods are phased out in clinical virology laboratories, clinical phenotypic resistance assays are primarily limited to rapidly replicating viruses (e.g., HSV) and cases in which resistance is suspected but the genotypic testing is inconclusive (e.g., HIV-1). From a research perspective, phenotypic assays remain critical for the detection of emerging resistance and confirmation of newly identified resistance-associated mutations (e.g., SARS-CoV-2).</para>
        <para id="ch0136s0015s0001p0002">The pharmaceutical industry is actively investigating and developing new antiviral drugs. Concurrently, antiviral resistance assays must be developed for detecting and monitoring resistance to these novel therapeutics. This is particularly important due to the high cost of such new antivirals and the potential for long-term use, which facilitates the development of resistance. An important goal is to develop assays that predict the likelihood of emerging resistance. Such assays may be possible using NGS technologies, which can detect resistance-associated variants at levels of &lt;5%. However, the clinical significance of these low-level mutations remains to be determined. Also, as previously mentioned, there are logistical concerns with data management and storage, as well as with proficiency and consistency in expertise, which should be addressed in parallel with assay development.</para>
        <para id="ch0136s0015s0001p0003">In addition, there is an increasing interest in the use of alternative specimen types, such as dried blood spots, whose ease of collection and transport may facilitate the availability of viral genotyping, particularly for HIV-1, in remote, underserved populations (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0119">119</link>). While many genotypic assays utilize sequencing technologies for their broad coverage of drug resistance mutations, simpler, less costly screening tests for a limited number of well-characterized mutations may also be used to guide treatment strategies when sequencing is unavailable and the treatment regimens in use result in a narrow spectrum of mutations (<link linkend="ch0136s0015s0002li0120">120</link>). Such targeted allele-specific mutation assays could be used in the clinical laboratory setting or adapted for use in sample-to-answer systems for near-care or point-of-care testing.</para>
        <para id="ch0136s0015s0001p0004">It is very likely that antiviral susceptibility testing applications will evolve quickly as new technology is introduced and the characteristics of viral infection and treatment change. Evaluation of the clinical significance of the data acquired from these new technologies will need to keep pace.</para>
