Most genus members are facultatively intracellular bacteria that parasitize erythrocytes, endothelial cells, and/or sometimes other mammalian host cells, causing persistent bacteremic infections and illnesses. All known <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> species have small genomes, averaging 1.8 Mbp and ranging from 1.4 Mbp for <emphasis>Bartonella bacilliformis</emphasis> to 2.9 Mbp for <emphasis>B. apis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0005">5</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0068s0001s0001p0002">The genus<emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> is named in honor of Dr. Alberto Leonardo Barton Thompson (1871 to 1950), a Peruvian physician who discovered <emphasis>B. bacilliformis</emphasis>, the causative agent of Carrion’s disease, in 1905. Currently, there are 37 fully characterized species and 3 subspecies with validly published names, including species formerly in the genera <emphasis>Bartonia, Rochalimaea</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Grahamella.</emphasis> There are an additional 40 <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> designations, 32 with <emphasis>Candidatus</emphasis> status (<ulink url="http://www.bacterio.net/bartonella.html#r">www.bacterio.net/bartonella.html#r</ulink>) (<anchor id="ch0068s0001s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0068s0004s0001a0005">Tables 1</link> and <anchor id="ch0068s0001s0001a0005"/><link linkend="ch0068s0004s0001a0012">2</link>). Twenty species, 16 with validly published names, are associated or suspected to be associated with human diseases (<link linkend="ch0068s0004s0001a0005">Table 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0007">7</link>). <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> species infect a variety of mammals, and their prevalence is greatest in warm and humid climates (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0008">8</link>). Members of this genus can be categorized into 3 groups: (i) human-specific species, (ii) zoonotic species, and (iii) animal-specific species (<link linkend="ch0068s0004s0001a0005">Tables 1</link> and <link linkend="ch0068s0004s0001a0012">2</link>). Phylogenetic analyses shed light on the evolutionary history of <emphasis>Bartonella. Bartonella apis</emphasis>, the honeybee gut symbiont, was shown to form a monophyletic clade with the human pathogen <emphasis>B. tamiae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0009">9</link>), which diverged before the eubartonellae were formed and separated into four deep-branching lineages (lineages 1 to 4). Species in lineage 1 infect humans, lineage 2 infects mainly ruminants, and lineages 3 and 4 infect a wide range of mammals (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0010">10</link>). The three most extensively studied <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> species are <emphasis>B. bacilliformis</emphasis>, which is the type species, <emphasis>B. quintana</emphasis>, and <emphasis>B. henselae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0012">12</link>).</para>

The disease is characterized by two distinct phases, an acute febrile phase with hemolytic bacteremia, known as Oroya fever, and a chronic vasoproliferative form with cutaneous nodular vascular eruptions, known as verruga peruana (bloody warts). Until 1885, these two clinical entities were recognized as two distinct diseases. In 1885, Daniel Alcides Carrión, a Peruvian medical student, hypothesized that these two clinical entities are caused by the same etiologic agent. He therefore inoculated himself with blood aspirated from a verruga, and eventually developed Oroya fever and died after 21 days, proving his hypothesis (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0013">13</link>). <emphasis>B. ancashensis</emphasis> is another species recently associated with verruga peruana-like clinical manifestations (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0006">6</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0068s0002p0001">The association between regional lymphadenopathy and cat contact has been known for more than a century; however, CSD was recognized as a syndrome by Debré et al. only in 1950 (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0021">21</link>), long before <emphasis>B. henselae</emphasis> was identified as the principal causative agent. Other <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> spp. (<emphasis>B. clarridgeiae, B. quintana</emphasis>, and <emphasis>B. grahamii</emphasis>) and <emphasis>Afipia felis</emphasis> have been rarely associated with CSD (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0022">22</link>–<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0024">24</link>). CSD is the most common <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis>-associated disease among humans. Two retrospective studies in the United States, one of them among patients younger than 65 years of age, have estimated an annual incidence of 4.5 to 9.3 outpatient diagnoses/100,000 population and 0.19 to 0.80 inpatient admission/100,000 population (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0026">26</link>). Incidence of CSD is highest among those who live in the southern United States (6.4 cases/100,000 population) and among children 5 to 9 years of age (9.4 cases/100,000 population) (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0026">26</link>). Based on these estimates, 12,000 to 25,000 cases are diagnosed annually in the United States and approximately 5% to 10% of patients are hospitalized, although higher proportions of hospitalization may occur (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0026">26</link>; M. Giladi, unpublished data). CSD occurs worldwide, though it is more prevalent in warm and humid climates.

CSD usually follows contact with cats (especially kittens), but other animals (e.g., dogs) have been implicated as possible reservoirs in rare instances. Intrafamilial clustering is rare, probably due to the inefficient cat-to-human transmission. Person-to-person transmission does not occur.</para>

The human body louse, <emphasis>Pediculus humanus</emphasis>, has been identified as the vector, and humans are the only known reservoir for human infections.

(ii) Extranodal CSD, also known as atypical CSD, is the collective designation for several syndromes and numerous extranodal manifestations involving various organs, with or without lymph node involvement (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0073">73</link>–<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0075">75</link>).

After recovery, immunocompetent CSD patients develop lifelong immunity, and reinfection is essentially nonexistent. <emphasis>B. henselae</emphasis> endocarditis should not be considered part of CSD and is discussed separately.</para>

It is unclear whether encephalopathy and other CSD neurological manifestations are the result of direct <emphasis>B. henselae</emphasis> invasion or host immune response. Persistent headache is a common complaint, but fever may be absent. Approximately half of patients develop seizures. Regional lymphadenopathy, if present, is an important clue for diagnosis. Although most patients fully recover within days, intellectual impairment, ataxia, and seizures can persist. Death is extremely rare (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0080">80</link>). CSD encephalopathy remains predominantly a clinical diagnosis, confirmed mostly by antibody testing and occasionally by molecular tests when infected tissue (e.g., lymph node) is available.

CSF measurements range from normal to elevated protein concentration and/or pleocytosis with lymphocytic predominance, without hypoglycorrhachia (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0077">77</link>).

Silver-based stains, including Warthin-Starry and Steiner stains, are recommended for microscopic detection of organisms in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, but such staining is difficult to perform, not highly specific, and relatively insensitive when lymph node biopsy specimens from CSD patients are examined. In patients with bacillary angiomatosis, a larger number of bacilli, some in clumps, can often be visualized by Warthin-Starry silver staining of tissues (Fig. 2) (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0125">125</link>).</para>

Considering the increasing number of novel <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> spp., DNA sequencing of PCR products is recommended to confirm <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> species identity when results are ambiguous or are not in accordance with the clinical presentation. Many conserved and housekeeping loci have been developed as targets for detection of <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> DNA, including the genes for citrate synthase (<emphasis>gltA</emphasis>), RNA polymerase β-subunit (<emphasis>rpoB</emphasis>), heat shock protein (<emphasis>groEL</emphasis>), riboflavin synthase (<emphasis>ribC</emphasis>), a cell division protein (<emphasis>ftsZ</emphasis>), and the 17-kDa antigen and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region located between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0131">131</link>). The 16S rRNA gene was first used by Relman et al. in 1990 for the identification of the causative agent of bacillary angiomatosis. It is considered useful for detection of <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> but does not discriminate among all <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> species (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0128">128</link>).

        <para id="ch0068s0015s0001p0003">The clinical sensitivity of the PCR assays varies among studies, ranging between 45% and 95%, because of either poor performance of the assays, types of clinical specimens used, or lack of consensus regarding a CSD case definition (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0129">129</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0134">134</link>–<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0143">143</link>). A recent retrospective study of 390 CSD patients and 482 PCR tests, using a national CSD registry in Israel and a uniform case definition, found that specimen type rather than PCR assay type had a major impact on the performance of molecular diagnosis of CSD. The highest PCR sensitivity was achieved with lymph node pus aspirates (96%), followed by primary lesions (88%), lymph node fine-needle aspirates (85%), lymph node biopsy specimens (73%), and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lymph nodes (59%) (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0144">144</link>). It was hypothesized that the unexpected low sensitivity of the lymph node biopsy specimens was due to sampling errors or the presence of inhibitory factors (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0129">129</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0134">134</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0144">144</link>). PCR performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lymph node biopsy specimens is notorious for low sensitivity, possibly due to the various steps of fixation and embedding of the tissues as well as deparaffinization, which are known to damage DNA (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0137">137</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0145">145</link>). It has also been postulated that because during the fine-needle aspiration process, the needle is inserted and withdrawn several times in different directions, cells from multiple locations within the lymph node are obtained, resulting in a higher sensitivity than with biopsy specimens. It should also be noted that <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> DNA can persist in tissues for long periods of time, even with appropriate treatment.</para>
        <para id="ch0068s0015s0001p0004">While real-time PCR is often the diagnostic assay of choice, it does not necessarily have a higher rate of detection of<emphasis>B. henselae</emphasis> DNA from clinical CSD specimens compared to conventional PCR (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0144">144</link>); 100% agreement between conventional and real-time PCR is reported (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0142">142</link>).

        <para id="ch0068s0015s0002p0001">Although sometimes challenging to interpret, serological assays, both immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detection of anti–<emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> antibodies are the mainstay of diagnosis for many <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis>-associated diseases. However, serology has limitations, including frequent lack of anti-<emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> IgM even in documented acute infection; variable sensitivity, ranging from lower than 50% to 95%; late seroconversion, 3 weeks or more after presentation; and cross reactivity between <emphasis>B. henselae, B. quintana</emphasis>, and other <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> sp. antibodies, as well as with serum of patients with Q fever or <emphasis>Chlamydia pneumoniae</emphasis> infections. Due to these limitations, the FDA has not cleared any serological assay for diagnosing <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> infection. A number of IFA assays and EIAs have been described, primarily for detection of anti-<emphasis>B. henselae</emphasis> and anti-<emphasis>B. quintana</emphasis> antibodies (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0147">147</link>–<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0156">156</link>). In 1992, Regnery et al. described an IFA test for IgG (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0019">19</link>). Since then, IFA testing has become the most commonly used diagnostic test for <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> infections, as either a homemade or commercial product, performed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the French National Reference Center for Rickettsial Diseases, among others (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0045">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0157">157</link>). <emphasis>B. henselae</emphasis> and <emphasis>B. quintana</emphasis> bacteria cocultivated with Vero cells or a human endothelial cell line are utilized as antigens by the CDC and the French reference laboratory IFA assays, respectively. In both assays, with the exception of endocarditis, a fluorescent reaction at a <emphasis role="underline">&gt;</emphasis>1:64 dilution is considered positive. The CDC assay was designed for IgG detection only, while the French IFA assay reports IgM results as well. For many EIAs, a result at a <emphasis role="underline">&gt;</emphasis>1:100 dilution is considered positive. As with other serologies, seroconversion or a 4-fold increase strongly supports a diagnosis of active <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> infection (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0149">149</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0157">157</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0158">158</link>). In comparison with EIA, the IFA assay has several disadvantages: Preparation of antigen requires cultivation of <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> spp. in Vero cells or other cell lines. Attempts to use agar-derived antigens have resulted in autoagglutination of the <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> bacilli, which interferes with the IFA (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0019">19</link>). In addition, IFA assays in general suffer from interobserver variation and are not suitable for automation or for screening large numbers of specimens. Earlier studies showing that EIA-based CSD serodiagnosis was inferior to that obtained with IFA assays were flawed by not providing sufficient data to evaluate the assay or to interpret sensitivity and specificity (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0139">139</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0152">152</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0159">159</link>).

Identification of<emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> isolates has mainly relied on the sequencing of conserved and housekeeping genes. Phenotypic characteristics of <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> growth include long incubation of 8 to 45 days before primary isolation. Colonies of <emphasis>B. henselae</emphasis> have two morphological types that can grow simultaneously from the primary culture: (i) irregular, raised, off-white, dry, rough (cauliflower-like) colonies that pit and adhere to the agar, and (ii) small, circular, tan, and moist colonies that are more easily scraped from the agar surface (<link linkend="ch0068s0015s0003a0005">Fig. 3</link>). <emphasis>B. quintana</emphasis> colonies are usually smooth, flat, and shiny; they are more tan-colored than those of <emphasis>B. henselae</emphasis> and do not pit the agar (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0110">110</link>).

The endothelium lining blood vessels, considered the primary niche of <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> spp., serves as a protective reservoir, leading to persistent infection and relapses. Technical obstacles extend to the clinical laboratory, particularly related to the fastidious and slow-growing nature of these organisms on traditional media. Neither the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) nor the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) has established guidelines, criteria, or clinical breakpoints for <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> antimicrobial susceptibly testing. Nevertheless, several studies, using different methodologies, antibiotics, and culture conditions <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>, have attempted to determine MICs for <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> spp., which serve as an empiric baseline for drug choice (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0188">188</link>–<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0193">193</link>). Many antibiotics tested <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> have low MICs (&lt;0.5 μg/ml). Accordingly, <emphasis>Bartonella</emphasis> spp. are consistently highly susceptible to doxycycline, macrolides, rifampin, and most beta-lactams.

Giemsa staining may show characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusions within endothelial cells, referred to as Rocha-Lima inclusions (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0095">95</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0096">96</link>, <link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0212">212</link>). Blood cultures may be positive for <emphasis>B. bacilliformis</emphasis> in patients with verruga peruana; however, this finding is difficult to interpret, since transient or chronic bacteremia has been reported in asymptomatic patients (<link linkend="ch0068s0020s0001li0040">40</link>).</para>
