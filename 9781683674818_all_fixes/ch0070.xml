          <para id="ch0070s0000p0001">Anaerobic bacteria (anaerobes) can cause infections in all tissues and organs of the human body. They are often (in &gt;70% of cases) found in all types of abscesses, in deep oral, intra-abdominal, soft tissue, and female genital tract infections, and in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0002">2</link>). Most anaerobic infections are mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections due to the predominance of anaerobes in the normal human microbiota at various mucosal body sites, such as the oral cavity, intestinal tract, and lower female genital tract. Knowledge of the role of anaerobes as causative agents of infections is constantly expanding. Recently, <emphasis>Cutibacterium acnes</emphasis> has emerged as an important pathogen in orthopedic implant-related infections (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0003">3</link>). Moreover, some clostridial species may cause exogenous infections, such as gas gangrene, tetanus, and botulism. Importantly, anaerobic infections can be severe and sometimes life-threatening.</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0002">Thus, full-service microbiology laboratories must have protocols to detect, identify, and determine antibiotic susceptibility of anaerobes. However, all microbiology laboratories should, at the minimum, be able to culture and perform basic identification of anaerobes and refer uncommon isolates to a reference laboratory. This chapter focuses on important requirements of anaerobic microbiology and methods and techniques used in the diagnostic workflow.</para>

          <para id="ch0070s0000p0003">Importantly, anaerobic bacteria require special transport conditions and handling. A comprehensive guideline document and an article cover syndrome-based specimen collection and handling procedures (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0005">5</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0004">Both clinicians and laboratory staff should be familiar with the requirements for collection and transport of clinical samples for anaerobic microbiology. Whenever possible, specimens should be collected prior to initiating antibiotic treatment or just before the next antibiotic administration. Contamination with normal microbiota should be avoided by using sterile equipment and aseptic techniques, such as a thorough skin decontamination with iodine and 70% alcohol. In general, aspirates and tissue biopsies are more appropriate than are swabs and surface material; the specimens should be placed in anaerobic transport medium, and the optimal time for transport is 2 h at room temperature. Anaerobic blood cultures may be selectively used in patients at increased risk for anaerobic infections, such as those with oral, intestinal tract, or gynecologic diseases or surgery, immune suppression, or immunosuppressive therapy (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0006">6</link>). The highest risk of mortality in anaerobic bacteremia was linked to patients in intensive care units and those with septic shock or malignant diseases (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0007">7</link>); therefore, anaerobic blood cultures are highly important in this group of patients. There is a good review article providing specific recommendation details (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0002">2</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0005">Some important recommendations for specimen collection and handling for diagnosing anaerobic infections are summarized here. The volume of blood for blood cultures is usually 8 to 10 ml for anaerobic blood culture bottles, while catheter specimens are unsuitable. Specimens from the head and neck can be obtained by percutaneous aspiration of fluid or pus or surgically. Specimens from the oral and nasal cavities and the throat are not appropriate. For periodontal infections, needle aspirates from abscesses can be used, and for subgingival pocket plaque, sterile paper points inserted into the canals or scaler samples can be placed in an anaerobic transport medium. For lung infections, appropriate specimens are pleural fluid aspirates and lung biopsy specimens; however, bronchial aspirates should be obtained by protected or double lumen catheters to avoid contamination by oropharyngeal anaerobes, whereas sputum is not acceptable for anaerobic microbiology. For joint infections, joint fluid aspirates taken with a needle and syringe in anaerobic blood culture bottles can be investigated. For prosthetic-joint infections, periprosthetic biopsy specimens are the most appropriate samples. For intra-abdominal infections, peritoneal, bile, or ascites fluid aspirates can be taken, and samples obtained during surgery are the specimens of choice for anaerobic culture. For infections of the female genital tract, samples taken during culdoscopy and culdocentesis, endometrial aspirates taken with a protective collector, abscess aspirates, surgical material, and intrauterine devices for<emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> spp. or <emphasis>Eubacterium nodatum</emphasis> can be examined. All tissue biopsy samples, regardless of the site of infection, should be taken during surgery. Since anaerobes are prevalent in the intestinal tract, stool specimens are not appropriate, except for <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile.</emphasis> For closed abscesses, needle aspirates should be collected. For soft tissue and wound infections, deep wound aspirates from the advancing wound edge or deep biopsy specimens should be taken after surface cleaning (see above) and, if necessary, debridement (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0002">2</link>). Urinary tract infections caused by anaerobic bacteria may be detected first by Gram staining (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0008">8</link>). When urinary tract infections persist and aerobic cultures remain negative, prolonged incubation in 5% CO<subscript>2</subscript> or an anaerobic atmosphere should be considered. Molecular analysis of urine has shown previously unsuspected anaerobes in large numbers; these methods may be standard in the future (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0009">9</link>). However, anaerobes are part of the normal microbiota of the urethra and lower female genital tract; therefore, suprapubic bladder aspiration can provide reliable results, unlike voided urine specimens (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0002">2</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0070s0000p0006">The optimal anaerobic transport media are the prereduced and anaerobically sterilized (PRAS) media in which the specimen is placed on the surface; if they are not available, homemade transport media such as Stuart transport medium may be prepared, and the samples should be placed deep in the tube, where a white color indicates the lack of oxygen and a blue color indicates the presence of oxygen. Nylon-flocked swabs such as ESwab (Copan Diagnostics, Italy) are also appropriate and can retain viability of most anaerobic species for at least 8 h at room temperature, whereas if a longer storage is unavoidable, it is recommended to keep the swabs at 4°C (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0010">10</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0070s0000p0008">Direct Gram staining is an important step in anaerobic microbiology. For severe or chronic infections, such as abscess, bacteremia, actinomycosis, or gas gangrene, direct Gram stains can display morphotypes characteristic of anaerobic species, such as the large boxcar-shaped Gram-positive rods of<emphasis>Clostridium perfringens</emphasis>, branched rods of <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> spp., needle-shaped Gram-negative rods of <emphasis>Fusobacterium nucleatum</emphasis>, pleomorphic Gram-negative rods with vacuoles of <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> and <emphasis>Parabacteroides</emphasis> spp., etc. (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0013">13</link>). Bacterial vaginosis can be detected by direct Gram staining as well by the reduction in the lactobacilli and the presence of clue cells and numerous Gram-variable coccobacilli (see also <ulink url="ch0035#ch0035s0001">chapter 19</ulink>). Moreover, not all species involved in bacterial vaginosis can be recovered in culture (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0015">15</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0009">Generally, media for isolation of anaerobes are richer than those usually used to isolate aerobic and facultative bacteria. The media for anaerobic bacteria are prepared with bases such as brucella broth and agar, Schaedler agar, CDC anaerobic sheep blood agar, Wilkins-Chalgren broth and agar, fastidious-anaerobe agar, and anaerobe basal agar. The latter two agar bases contain numerous supplementations for the growth of fastidious anaerobes. The agar bases are often supplemented with 5% sheep or horse blood,<phrase role="small">L</phrase>-cysteine hydrochloride (0.25 g/liter) as a reducing agent, and hemin (0.005 to 0.01 g/liter), and vitamin K1 (0.0005 to 0.001 g/liter) as growth factors for <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> and <emphasis>Porphyromonas</emphasis> spp. In addition, some bases contain sodium pyruvate (1 g/liter) to support the growth of Gram-negative anaerobic cocci, sodium succinate (0.5 g/liter) for enhancement of <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> and <emphasis>Prevotella</emphasis> growth, starch (1.0 g/liter) as a detoxifying substance, and other agents. Thioglycolate broth enriched with vitamin K1 and hemin serves as a backup and should be subcultured if it exhibits turbidity despite no growth on the primary culture medium. If there is no visible turbidity, the broth is incubated for 7 days. Thioglycolate broth better supports the initial growth of anaerobes, while chopped meat broth is more suitable for prolonged storage of anaerobes (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0016">16</link>). Some laboratories may also use selective media, such as nalidixic acid-Tween agar for non-spore-forming Gram-positive anaerobes, nalidixic acid- and vancomycin-containing media for Gram-negative anaerobes, or <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> bile esculin agar for <emphasis>Bacteroides fragilis</emphasis> group species (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0017">17</link>). Phenylethyl alcohol agar is a selective medium that can be useful for inoculation of purulent materials and in mixed infections with facultative aerobic bacteria. The active agent, phenylethyl alcohol, inhibits the growth of Gram-negative facultative aerobes as well as the swarming of <emphasis>Proteus</emphasis> spp. or some clostridial species, such as <emphasis>Clostridium septicum.</emphasis> Chromogenic media for different aerobic and facultative bacterial species are available, while for anaerobes, so far there is a chromogenic medium only for <emphasis>C. difficile.</emphasis> The media and algorithm for detection and isolation of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> are given in detail in <ulink url="ch0073#ch0073s0001">chapter 56</ulink>.</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0010">Immediately after inoculation, the plates should be incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere, which can be attained by several physical or chemical methods. The optimal method is the use of an anaerobic chamber. Some companies providing anaerobic chambers are Coy Laboratory Products (Grass Lake, MI, USA), Don Whitley Scientific Limited (Bingley, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom), and Anaerobe Systems (Morgan Hill, CA, USA). Anaerobic chambers are large boxes with a gas mix free of oxygen, a palladium catalyst to remove oxygen residues, a set of gloves, and an airlock transfer chamber to bring items in without contact with oxygen. Working with gloves with cuffs guarantees that the atmosphere remains constantly anaerobic. The cost of anaerobic chambers is high, but this method ensures optimal growth of even the most fastidious anaerobes; moreover, it allows laboratory staff to check the growth every day. Another physical system for anaerobic incubation is the commercially available Anoxomat system (Mart Microbiology, Drachten, The Netherlands). This system uses an automatic jar evacuation-replacement technique, which is controlled by a microprocessor and creates anaerobic conditions in about 5 to 15 min in one or several jars.</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0011">Chemical methods for creating an anaerobic atmosphere involve envelopes for jars or bags for single or multiple petri dishes. The envelopes contain chemical substances to remove the oxygen, such as sodium borohydride (BBL GasPak; Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD, USA), iron powder (Anaerocult A system; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), or ascorbic acid (Oxoid Anaero-Gen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United Kingdom) (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0018">18</link>). Some systems, such as the AnaeroGen system, do not require water addition and a catalyst. Jars and boxes should not be opened until after 48 h of incubation to prevent premature death of some slower-growing microbes by exposure to air during their logarithmic growth phase. The time required to create the anaerobic atmosphere by the chemical methods is longer than that for evacuation-replacement systems, and it is also important to avoid prolonged (more than 1 h) exposure of the cultures to oxygen. All anaerobic plates should be incubated for at least 5 days before being considered negative.</para>

          <para id="ch0070s0000p0012">Notably, a longer incubation may be required for the growth of species such as<emphasis>Actinomyces israelii</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> (obtained from orthopedic implant infections), for some species such as <emphasis>Parvimonas micra</emphasis> and <emphasis>Porphyromonas</emphasis> spp., and for specimens from treated patients. Although <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> isolation from orthopedic implant infections may take up to 14 days of incubation, in a recent study, anaerobic Schaedler agar and thioglycolate broth provided 2- to 4-day-faster detection than blood cultures (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0003">3</link>).</para>

If the clinical situation or initial Gram stain suggests this microbe, it may be prudent to incubate plates individually in plastic anaerobic envelopes (GasPak EZ anaerobe pouch system [Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD] or AnaeroPack [Mitsubishi Gas Chemical America, Inc., New York, NY]) so that the plates may be examined early (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0019">19</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0070s0000p0015">Direct Gram staining of the clinical specimen is among the important requirements in anaerobic microbiology and should not be avoided. Direct Gram staining may reveal the presence of anaerobes such as Gram-positive anaerobic cocci in specimens from normally sterile sites when the bacteria are microscopically observed but there is no growth on the aerobically incubated media. The direct Gram staining may also suggest the need for emergency attention when the<emphasis>C. perfringens</emphasis> morphotype (see above) is observed in suspected gas gangrene. To improve the observation of Gram-negative anaerobes by Gram staining, safranin can be replaced by 0.1% basic fuchsin (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0013">13</link>). It is better to interpret Gram stains well and report relevant results quickly than to perform inadequate cultures, which will lead to misleading results.</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0016">Initial examination of colonies should be performed using a stereomicroscope or at least a strong magnifying glass. Colony morphologies that appear similar when observed at a distance can be differentiated when magnified; otherwise, the presence of tiny colonies near larger ones can be missed. Colony morphology can be suggestive for some anaerobes, such as large colonies exhibiting double zone hemolysis for<emphasis>C. perfringens</emphasis>, swarming growth for some clostridial species, dark brown to black colonies for pigmented <emphasis>Prevotella</emphasis> or <emphasis>Porphyromonas</emphasis> spp., breadcrumb-like colonies of <emphasis>F. nucleatum</emphasis>, dark red colonies of <emphasis>Actinomyces odontolyticus</emphasis>, etc.</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0017">If the laboratory does not have the capacity to perform matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), it is useful to perform a subculture of the anaerobic colonies with special potency disks, including at least kanamycin (1,000 μg), vancomycin (5 μg), colistin (10 μg), and metronidazole (5 μg). The results are read as susceptibility (inhibitory zone diameters are ≥10 mm) or resistance (&lt;10 mm) to the agent. This can help with distinguishing Gram-negative anaerobes, identified as vancomycin resistant (except for<emphasis>Porphyromonas</emphasis> spp.), from the Gram-positive strains (usually vancomycin susceptible); to confirm that the strains are strict anaerobes (metronidazole susceptible, although metronidazole resistance has been found in some species, such as <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> group and <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>); and to detect some characteristic susceptibility patterns, such as the kanamycin, vancomycin, and colistin resistance pattern of <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> group species (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0020">20</link>).</para>

The chocolate agar plate is incubated in 5% CO<subscript>2</subscript> to test a large number of anaerobes in a pie plate format for aerotolerance. Those that are not strict anaerobes can be identified using routine methods. A few anaerobic species can be identified by using only the Gram stain and spot test. An example is <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> among <emphasis>Cutibacterium</emphasis>/<emphasis>Propionibacterium</emphasis> spp. if both catalase and indole tests are positive.</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0019">Once the suspected causative agent is isolated as a pure colony, several options are available for identification (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0022">22</link>). Conventional methods developed in the 1960s used several different prereduced biochemical tests in combination with the detection of short-chain fatty acids with gas-liquid chromatography for identification of anaerobes to the genus or species level (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0022">22</link>). These methods were time-consuming and could take up to 1 week for a correct identification. Several commercial identification kits have also been developed over the years. The API 20A (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Étoile, France) strip needed an incubation time of 24 to 48 h under anaerobic conditions and was shown to be useful for a number of saccharolytic species. The RapID ANA II (Remel, Lenexa, KS), the Rapid ID 32A (bioMérieux), and the Vitek ANI card (bioMérieux), which detect preformed enzymes, give results within 4 to 6 h. The multiparameter anaerobic (and corynebacteria) identification card for the Vitek system (ANC ID card; bioMérieux, Durham, NC) has acceptable performance for common anaerobic genera and would be a good choice for laboratories without MALDI-TOF MS or molecular assessment capability (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0021">21</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0020">The commercial kits have been evaluated in numerous studies, and problems with the identification of Gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, Gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and some clostridia were reported (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0024">24</link>). Classical methods and commercial kits have been supplanted by MALDI-TOF MS in laboratories that have acquired the platforms.</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0021">Use of MALDI-TOF MS is a tremendous advance in anaerobic microbiology providing numerous advantages: a highly accurate identification comparable to that of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the speed of identification, the need for little bacterial biomass, and the possibility of detecting some antibiotic resistance (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0026">26</link>). The method is based on comparison of a large-molecule spectrum of the clinical isolate with those in the available database. Several MALDI-TOF MS identification systems are commercially available, such as Microflex LT (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), Vitek MS (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France), and Shimadzu MS (Axima; Shimadzu Corporation) (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0025">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0028">28</link>). Therefore, MALDI-TOF MS, requiring 30 min to ≤1 h for identifying the strain, can save more than 2.5 days compared to subculturing colonies and using rapid identification kits. Although the initial price of MALDI-TOF MS is high, accuracy and speed of identification establish it as the best identification method for the anaerobic bacteria (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0029">29</link>–<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0031">31</link>).</para>

One of the future directions in anaerobic microbiology can be the implementation of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS; based on all nucleic acid detection directly from clinical specimens) for diagnosis of the causative agents of infections. mNGS provides higher (11.5%) identification rates of anaerobes in skin and soft tissue infections than culture (1.0%) (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0044">44</link>).

Clinically significant isolates include those isolated from blood cultures, brain abscesses, heart valve or vascular graft tissue, bone biopsy specimens from patients with osteomyelitis, joint aspirates, and isolates from prosthetic device infection sources. Other isolates to be tested include possible pathogens from normally sterile body sites and those from patients who failed initial therapy. Important data about current antimicrobials for anaerobes and susceptibility testing methods have been published elsewhere (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0049">49</link>) as well as in <ulink url="ch0096#ch0096s0001">chapter 78</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>.</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0030">Antibiotic susceptibility of the anaerobes can be assessed by the agar dilution method (this is the reference method; however, it is not appropriate for single-isolate testing and thus for everyday use), broth microdilution (commercially available but suitable only for<emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> and <emphasis>Parabacteroides</emphasis> spp.), or the gradient strip method with Etests (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0050">50</link>). The Etest (bioMérieux) has been used to test individual anaerobic organisms, but its correlation with the agar dilution method is still imperfect (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0051">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0052">52</link>). Another similar gradient strip method, involving the M.I.C. Evaluator device (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lenexa, KS), has also been evaluated with inconclusive results. Compared to agar dilution, essential agreement was low and major errors were observed for metronidazole (13 to 14%) and penicillin (8 to 9%) with isolates from the <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> group and <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0052">52</link>).

          <para id="ch0070s0000p0031">Other systems include a spiral gradient endpoint system (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0049">49</link>). Broth dilution performed in an anaerobic chamber is also acceptable, but interpretation of results may be difficult, and current guidelines recommend its use only for members of the <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> group (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0055">55</link>). For laboratories with limited resources, a modified agar dilution method involving only two breakpoints (susceptibility and resistance) for a given antibiotic can be used (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0002">2</link>). A new automated susceptibility testing system has been developed. The commercially available broth microdilution method (Micronaut-S Anaerobes MIC test plate) has been reported to provide overall and categorical agreements of &gt;95% with the results of a gradient diffusion method (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0056">56</link>).</para>

A European group (EUCAST Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Anaerobe Bacteria) is working on protocols (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0057">57</link>). So far, good results have been obtained for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> with vancomycin (5 μg) and metronidazole (5 μg) disks as well as for the <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> group with imipenem (10 μg), metronidazole (5 μg), and clindamycin (10 μg) disks (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0002">2</link>). In a recent CA-SFM (Committee of the Antibiogram of the French Society of Microbiology) document, inhibitory zone diameters indicating resistance to 6 antibiotics in anaerobes were compared with those of the agar dilution method with EUCAST breakpoints, and those of 2 μg clindamycin and 4 μg metronidazole were determined to be &lt;15 mm (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0050">50</link>). In this large study, the inoculum used was 1 McFarland, the media used were brucella broth and brucella blood agar with hemin and vitamin K supplementation, and the incubation times were 24 h for the <emphasis>B. fragilis</emphasis> group and other rapidly growing species and 48 h for the more slowly growing species (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0050">50</link>).

          <para id="ch0070s0000p0033">Another important issue that should be addressed is the difference in breakpoints for resistance to some antibiotics between EUCAST and CLSI (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0059">59</link>). In general, EUCAST provides lower breakpoints, such as those for penicillin and metronidazole, than CLSI.

Additional details concerning the resistant breakpoint differences between CLSI and EUCAST can be found in <ulink url="ch0096#ch0096s0001">chapter 78</ulink>.

          <para id="ch0070s0000p0034">In brief, anaerobic infections can occur in all body tissues and organs and may endanger the patient’s life. Moreover, since antibiotic resistance in anaerobes and the proportion of patients with immunosuppressive diseases or immunosuppressive therapy are constantly increasing, anaerobic microbiology is becoming increasingly important and must not be neglected in any hospital center or country. All hospitals have to anticipate, maintain, or optimize means for carrying out anaerobic microbiology in their laboratories at a contemporary level or, if this is not possible, must be in constant contact with reference laboratories.</para>
          <para id="ch0070s0000p0035">At present, MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing are techniques providing both rapid and highly accurate identification of anaerobes. In short, automation will gain more and more ground in anaerobic microbiology. However, a level of in-depth knowledge is needed for both clinicians and microbiologists to decide when, why, and how to test for anaerobic bacteria. This also involves considering taxonomy changes such as<emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Clostridium difficile</emphasis>), <emphasis>Cutibacterium acnes</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Propionibacterium acnes</emphasis>), and <emphasis>Pseudopropionibacterium propionicum</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Propionibacterium propionicum</emphasis>) as well as clinically significant new species, such as <emphasis>Solobacterium moorei</emphasis> and <emphasis>Phocaeicola dorei</emphasis> and the putative novel species <emphasis>Clostridium neonatale</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0070s0000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0000li0061">61</link>). Many recent studies have focused on the importance of the anaerobes in microbiome-gut-brain axis and thus in numerous neurological diseases, and this has become an important research direction in this field.</para>
