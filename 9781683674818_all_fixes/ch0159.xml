        <para id="ch0159s000000p0002">The eukaryotic parasites of medical importance are classically known as protozoan, arthropod, and helminthic parasites; the last includes nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, and acanthocephalans. Historically, fungi such as microsporidia and<emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> were included among the parasites, but they are placed among the fungi herein. The previous edition of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> carried the classical taxonomy as far as was possible despite the modern transformation of eukaryote classification. In this edition, we have adopted the system already used in research and by biologists for over a decade. To facilitate the transition for clinical microbiologists who are unfamiliar with these changes, we provide the names from the previous edition alongside the modern ones.</para>
        <para id="ch0159s000000p0003">The modern classification of biological species intends to reflect an evolutionary history of living organisms. The Linnaean hierarchical classification system continues to be used in botany and zoology, governed by the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and the International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants (no longer botany), each with its overseeing body. That was fine when the biology of eukaryotes was divided into plants (and fungi) and animals, but since this is no longer the case, a new approach was necessary to accommodate the diversity of protists from which all other groups diverge. Rules and established practice of both systems of nomenclature are irreconcilably in conflict, so they can be applied to all eukaryotes only if one ignores rules, or if one develops two parallel classifications. In contrast, the modern system allows parasitologists, as well as botanists and zoologists, to keep classical traditions and incorporates them into the classification of protist diversity. For those who are interested in further in-depth reading, works by Adl et al. (<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0159s000000li0002">2</link>) provide an adequate summary of the background for the system currently used. Additional discussion has also been provided by Adl et al. (<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0003">3</link>). The biggest change with the modern system is that most of the artificially rigidly named higher-ranked levels of complexity (e.g., kingdom, phylum, class, and order) are no longer formally assigned among the protists, and only genus and species designations are formally retained. However, the higher levels are often retained among animal taxonomists. In the zoological code, the higher ranks are not required, and there is little agreement about which level these ranks apply to. The hierarchy in the classification described herein reflects our current understanding of how monophyletic lineages (i.e., clades) are related, as indicated by phylogenetic trees (<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0001">1</link>). Clades are defined simply as groups of organisms believed to have evolved from a common ancestor. Many of the familiar clade names, like Apicomplexa, Endamoebidae, and Trypanosomatidae, retain their original endings for ease of communication, but they are no longer linked to named hierarchy descriptors like order, class, or phylum.</para>
        <para id="ch0159s000000p0004">One might ask why all the fuss about classification is necessary if it is just a way of organizing species. The reason is that there are patterns inherited through species lineages. When the sequence of lineages derived from other lineages (phylogenetics) is correctly deduced, it will reflect the genetic information carried with modification into successive taxonomic groups. When species are correctly placed in the classification, one can deduce a great amount of information from their position in the classification. It is not dissimilar from the classification of elements in the periodic table. That is how the periods (or patterns) are identified, and it helps with learning and remembering. The patterns discernible in the biological classification include those related to organisms’ ecological function, the biochemistry of metabolic pathways, cell biology and cell membrane chemistry, host cell penetration, and the ability to evade host immune response. For example, if a species is incorrectly placed in the classification, then group-specific pharmacology will be ineffective until research is directed at its metabolism according to its correct placement in the classification. So how should a clinical microbiologist use this new system, especially when teaching future generations of technologists, residents, and fellows? One recommendation that is commonly adopted is to provide a brief discussion of the highest level of organization, the supergroups, and then reference the familiar names of the other clades (e.g., Apicomplexa). The names for the lowest clades—genus and species—are retained, thus simplifying communication with clinicians and other microbiologists. This approach can be illustrated using the well-known parasites causing malaria. For most purposes, one could state that these are parasites in the clade Apicomplexa (i.e., apicomplexan parasites), genus<emphasis>Plasmodium.</emphasis> This is essentially the wording used today, with the exception that the clade Apicomplexa is no longer referred to as a phylum. When it is desirable to provide the full lineage as it is currently understood based on genetic analyses, one lists the clades in order of highest (supergroup) to lowest (species) separated by a colon (e.g., SAR: Apicomplexa: Aconoidasida: Haemosporida: <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis>).</para>

          <title>MODERN CLASSIFICATION OF EUKARYOTES</title>

          <para id="ch0159s000000p0005">Eukaryotes are now divided into five monophyletic lineages called supergroups, of which four include human parasites: SAR, Excavata, Amoebozoa, and Opisthokonta (<anchor id="ch0159s000000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0159s000000a0006">Fig. 1</link>). As discussed above, these supergroups replace the previous kingdoms that encompassed the eukaryotes (the plants, animals, and fungi). Protists are clades within the eukaryotes and are defined as species with a unicellular organization without cell differentiation into tissues (i.e., all eukaryotes without an embryology) (<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0002">2</link>). Using this definition, protists include what were known as protozoan parasites, free-living protozoa, fungi, and most algae. Thus, clades that encompass the multicellular organisms are the animals, plants, and the brown macro-algae. Where cell differentiation occurs in protists, it is limited to sexual cells with complementary mating types, an alternate vegetative morphology (such as a trophozoite), and quiescent or resistant stages such as cysts or spores. Dispersal occurs by cysts (from mitosis and vegetative reproduction) or by spores (from meiosis and sexual reproduction); the classical literature did not use these terms consistently. The morphology of protists is varied, including cells with a cell wall or without, with motility or without. Motile cells can move by gliding on surfaces, by amoeboid crawling locomotion, or by swimming in liquid with a motility organelle called a cilium (commonly but incorrectly referred to as a flagellum). Unfortunately, the term “flagellum” continues to be applied indiscriminately to the motility organelle in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the molecular structures and mechanisms of motion generation of the bacterial flagellum and the eukaryotic cilium are unrelated and dissimilar. Thus, they are sensitive to different pharmaceuticals. For the purposes of this chapter, we use the correct terminology. Unlike bacterial flagella (with assembled flagellin monomers and an anchoring molecular motor), the eukaryotic cilium consists of tubulin monomers in a complex assembly, with additional cytoskeletal and regulatory molecules, and a very complex anchor that includes basal bodies and fibrous roots made of diverse families of cytoskeletal molecules that are phylogenetically relevant and diverse in their morphology. Most protists have one or more cilia in at least part of their life cycle; the cilia are absent (secondarily lost) in many Amoebozoa and in families scattered across the supergroups. Ameboid locomotion occurs in diverse phyla, not only in the Amoebozoa. Gliding locomotion occurs in species with or without cilia, and it is observed in many taxa.</para>

          <para id="ch0159s000000p0006">Here, we outline the composition of the five supergroups of protists with examples that might be familiar. The multicellular worms that are parasitic to humans are also described. Genus- and species-level taxa follow the recent checklist by Mathison and Sapp (<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0004">4</link>). The Opisthokonta include the fungi, the animals, and several protist clades that are key to understanding the origin of animal and fungal metabolism and the origin of multicellularity in animals. The Amoebozoa include primarily genera with amoeboid locomotion, but some include ciliated stages in their life cycle. Important examples in this supergroup are the genera <emphasis>Entamoeba, Endolimax, Iodamoeba, Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Sappinia</emphasis> (<anchor id="ch0159s000000a0007"/><link linkend="ch0159s000000a0008">Table 1</link>). The Amoebozoa and the Opisthokonta have a common origin and are called the Amorphea (Greek, “without form”) due to their ancestrally unconstrained cell shape. The Excavata include many parasitic lineages. Many are well known to clinical microbiologists, such as <emphasis>Giardia, Trichomonas</emphasis>, trypanosomes, and <emphasis>Leishmania.</emphasis> The Archaeplastida include the green algae and the red algae and, with the exception of <emphasis>Prototheca</emphasis>, a green alga which has lost its photosynthetic ability, do not contain any human parasites; they are not discussed further here.</para>

The Alveolata include the Ciliophora (e.g., <emphasis>Balantioides</emphasis>), the Dinoflagellata, and the Apicomplexa (parasitic genera historically called the Sporozoa). The Apicomplexa have the remnant of a chloroplast that has retained a small number of coding genes in most species. This plastid was of green algal origin; therefore, the enzymes differ from those of the mitochondrion and of the nuclear eukaryotic genes. This organelle has become a potential candidate for new pharmaceuticals targeted at these gene products. Important apicomplexan parasites include <emphasis>Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, Cyclospora, Sarcocystis, Babesia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Plasmodium.</emphasis> The last lineage in the SAR supergroup is the Rhizaria, which does not include any human parasites.</para>

The mitochondrion has a characteristic mass of DNA that consists of multiple copies of the circular chromosome entangled like chain mail (catenated). There are two types, maxicircles and minicircles. Maxicircles are catenated replicated copies of the mitochondrial circular chromosome, numbering in the dozens, each 20 to 40 kb in size. The minicircles are 0.5 to 1 kb in size, number in the thousands, and code for guide RNA. The mitochondrial pre-mRNA from the maxicircles requires substantial editing of the genetic code before the mRNA can be usefully translated into a protein. The editing occurs by insertion or deletion of uridine by the guide RNA from the minicircles. The complexity of RNA editing in the mitochondria of Euglenozoa is perplexing.</para>

Unlike other flukes, which are monoecious (hermaphroditic), <emphasis>Schistosoma</emphasis> organisms are dioecious, with separate male and female sexes, although they live together <emphasis>in copula</emphasis>, with the female residing in a gynecophoral canal that runs along the body of the male.</para>

        <para id="ch0159s000000p0028">Commonly called tapeworms, all Cestoda (Platyhelminthes: Neodermata) are obligate enteric parasites. There are at least 19 orders that can be distinguished by molecular phylogenies (<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0020">20</link>–<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0022">22</link>), but the arrangement of genera into monophyletic families remains in flux as research continues. There are more than 7,000 known species, but many others exist in various animals. Historically, there were two orders that contained species that infect humans, Pseudophyllidea and Cyclophyllidea; however, Pseudophyllidea has been broken into two groups, Bothriocephalidea and Diphyllobothriidea, only the latter of which contains human parasites (<anchor id="ch0159s000000a0035"/><link linkend="ch0159s000000a0043">Table 3</link>). Diphyllobothriidea adults have multiple segments (proglottids) and two sucking grooves (bothria). The segments have characteristic midventral genital and uterine pores and a bilobed ovary. The eggs are operculated (much like trematode eggs) and lack an oncosphere. The family Diphyllobothriidae includes species parasitic to humans, which can be definitive (<emphasis>Dibothriocephalus, Diphyllobothrium</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Adenocephalus</emphasis>) or incidental (<emphasis>Spirometra</emphasis>) hosts, but its classification is in flux, as it is paraphyletic. Mammals are the definitive hosts, with copepods or copepods and fish as intermediate hosts. The second order, the Cyclophyllidea, holds 15 families, and there are at least 3,100 known species. The order contains the Taeniidae, which include genera of medical importance, such as <emphasis>Taenia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Echinococcus.</emphasis> There are five other families of significance in the Cyclophyllidea (<link linkend="ch0159s000000a0043">Table 3</link>). They are characterized by multiple proglottid segments, four suckers on the scolex for attachment to the host, a genital opening on one side (except for the Dilepididae, where there are openings on both sides), and a compact yolk gland posterior to the ovary. Eggs are shed from the definitive host containing an infectious first-stage larva (oncosphere).</para>

        <para id="ch0159s000000p0029">Commonly called roundworms, the Nematoda belong to the Ecdysozoa, the sister clade to the Lophotrochozoa. At least 20,000 species are described, but most estimates expect about 1 million species to exist. Their large diversity is due to the fact that they inhabit all habitats, from the deep sea to the mountain peaks, across all latitudes. They are classified into five clades (designated I to V), each with a name (<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0023">23</link>, <link linkend="ch0159s000000li0024">24</link>). Clades III to V and related lineages are grouped together in a parent clade called the Chromadoria. The phylogeny of the orders and families of nematodes is still in flux, particularly for the Chromadoria and clade III, as the research has not been completed. Vertebrate parasites must have originated independently at least four times. They occur in the Trichinellida and Dioctophymatida (Dorylaimia, clade I); in all six groups of clade III (Spirurina, clade III), namely, the Ascaridomorpha, the Spiruromorpha, the Rhigonematomorpha, the Oxyuridomorpha, the Gnathostomatomorpha, and the Dracunculoidea; in the Panagrolaimomorpha (Tylenchina, clade IV); and in the Rhabditomorpha (Rhabditina, clade V). None are known in the Enoplia (clade II) or other lineages within the Chromadoria. Human parasites occur in clades I, III, and IV (<anchor id="ch0159s000000a0037"/><link linkend="ch0159s000000a0046">Table 4</link>). Most species that infect humans are dioecious (having separate male and female sexes; one notable exception is <emphasis>Strongyloides stercoralis</emphasis> which reproduces parthenogenetically during the parasitic part of its life cycle. Adults are oviparous or ovoviviparous and there are usually four larval stages (L1 to L4) prior to the adult (L5). For most nematodes, the infectious stage is the L3 larva (notable exceptions include some of the Dorylaimia).</para>

Only the class Arachnida contains medically important species. The phylogeny of Arachnida and of Acari in particular remains in flux and requires further research (<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0027">27</link>). Arachnids can be medically important in a variety of ways. A few spiders (Araneae) and many scorpions (Scorpionida) can inflict potentially life-threatening bites and stings, respectively. Some spiders (e.g., tarantulas in the family Theraphosidae) possess urticating hairs. Dust mites (Acari: Pyroglyphidae) and their feces can cause severe allergic reactions. The most medically important arachnids are the obligate ectoparasitic ticks and mites in the subclass Acari (<link linkend="ch0159s000000a0055">Table 5</link>), including <emphasis>Sarcoptes scabiei</emphasis> (the causal agent of scabies), hard ticks (Ixodidae), and soft ticks (Argasidae).

        <para id="ch0159s000000p0040">Hexapoda contains two classes: Entognatha (which contains microscopic soil-dwelling animals of no medical importance) and Insecta (insects), the most diverse class of extant animals. There are approximately 28 extant orders of insects, depending on the classification scheme used (<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0029">29</link>), roughly eight of which contain medically important species. There is a vast multitude of ways in which insects can be of medical importance, most notably as vectors of many agents of debilitating diseases, including the agents of malaria, plague, and numerous arboviruses, or as intermediate hosts for helminthic infections (see <ulink url="ch0175#ch0175s0001">chapter 152</ulink> for a comprehensive review of insects and other arthropods of medical importance). The focus of <link linkend="ch0159s000000a0055">Table 5</link> is the ectoparasites most commonly encountered by clinical, diagnostic, and reference laboratories. Insect ectoparasites of humans are found in the orders Hemiptera (true bugs), Psocodea (Psocoptera + Phthiraptera [Anoplura + Mallophaga]; lice), Diptera (flies), and Siphonaptera (fleas, all of which are obligate parasites of mammals or birds as adults) (<link linkend="ch0159s000000a0055">Table 5</link>) (<link linkend="ch0159s000000li0030">30</link>).</para>
