        <para id="ch0121s0001s0002p0001">VZV is an enveloped virus with a diameter of about 180 to 200 nm (<anchor id="ch0121s0001s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0121s0001s0003a0005">Fig. 1</link>). It contains an icosahedral nucleocapsid surrounded by a tegument structure (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0002">2</link>), a lipid envelope that allows the virus to be degraded by lipid solvents, and a linear double-stranded DNA genome (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0003">3</link>). The viral genome has an approximate length of 125,000 bp and contains at least 70 viral genes and more than 130 polyadenylated transcripts (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0004">4</link>). The VZV genome consists of a unique long region, a unique short region, and flanking internal and terminating repeat regions, and it can exist in four isomeric forms (<anchor id="ch0121s0001s0002a0004"/><link linkend="ch0121s0001s0004a0005">Fig. 2</link>). Protein-coding genes in the terminal repeats are present in two functional copies.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0002p0002">VZV may infect susceptible cells either by fusion at the cell surface or by endocytosis. Virus replication takes place in the nucleus of the infected cell. Similar to other herpesviruses, the progression of viral gene expression is highly regulated. For example, genes transcribed soon after<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> infection are termed immediate early (IE). Not all VZV gene functions are yet known. The especially well-characterized ones include some transcription regulator proteins (IE61 to IE63), viral enzymes such as thymidine kinase required for acyclovir antiviral activity (TK; encoded by open reading frame 36 [ORF36]), the DNA polymerase (ORF28), and various VZV glycoproteins, such as gB (ORF31), gE (ORF68), and gH (ORF37), which are required for virus attachment. Truncated gE protein is used in recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) and induces antibodies that neutralize virus and limit cell-to-cell spread, as well as being a prominent target of T cell immunity (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0006">6</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0002p0003">VZV exhibits low genomic diversity among isolates in comparison to other herpesviruses (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0007">7</link>). From full genome sequencing, nine VZV clades have been established (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0009">9</link>).

        <para id="ch0121s0001s0003p0001">VZV is ubiquitous and highly contagious, and therefore, primary infection with VZV usually occurs in early childhood. In nonvaccinated populations, serum antibodies serve as a surrogate marker for VZV infection, since IgG positivity is retained throughout life (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0011">11</link>). Prevaccination seroepidemiological studies in 11 European countries have shown that in most areas, more than 90% of 10- to 15-year-olds were seropositive for VZV (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0012">12</link>). Seropositivity is lower in some equatorial regions (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0014">14</link>), resulting in adult populations susceptible to primary infection. In the United States, the incidence of clinical varicella has declined significantly since 1995, when childhood VZV live attenuated vaccination was generally introduced (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0015">15</link>). Vaccinated persons are seropositive by routine assays, which do not distinguish between prior vaccination and wild-type infection.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0003p0002">Primary infection with VZV is most likely acquired by virus transmission through aerosols. Infection occurs by inoculation of the respiratory tract mucosa and replication in tonsillar lymphoid tissue, from which the virus then disseminates. The incubation period is 10 to 21 days. During this incubation time, the virus is spread by cell-associated viremia within leukocytes (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0016">16</link>). Virus also replicates in reticuloendothelial organs and finally infects cutaneous epithelial cells, which are the major sites of virus replication. Eventually, the infected host begins to shed virus by the respiratory route. Cell-free virus is also produced at high levels in skin vesicles, and thus, the fluid from these vesicles is also highly infectious. New vesicles containing infectious fluid may appear for several days after rash onset. Individuals are no longer infectious once the last set of vesicles has dried and crusted.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0003p0003">After primary VZV infection, the virus remains latent in neural ganglia. Reactivation from the various reservoirs accounts for the diverse clinical manifestations of reactivation, clinically known as shingles, varicella zoster, herpes zoster, or zoster. Autopsy studies have detected VZV DNA in the clinically important trigeminal ganglia, as well as other cranial nerve and autonomic ganglia (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0018">18</link>), while the widespread distribution of zoster reflects the ability of VZV to enter latency in sensory ganglia throughout the neuraxis. VZV may also become latent in autonomic ganglia. Herpes zoster rash vesicles are filled with virus-containing fluid and may also be a source of primary infection for susceptible, VZV-seronegative individuals. Virus can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or during or after delivery (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0019">19</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0001">Varicella (chicken pox) is the manifestation of primary infection with VZV. The clinical appearance of chicken pox is usually dominated by a generalized vesicular rash. Sometimes, symptoms such as fever, malaise, and abdominal pain are seen as prodromal symptoms 24 to 48 h before and during the first days after the onset of the rash. New vesicles develop during the first 3 to 6 days of varicella. Due to its characteristic clinical appearance, the diagnosis of varicella is often a clinical one and does not require laboratory confirmation. A history of contact with other cases can also be helpful. Clinical reinfection with VZV with second episodes of varicella illness has been described for immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0021">21</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0002">Complications associated with chicken pox can occur (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0022">22</link>), and older age, immunosuppression, and pregnancy are considered to be generally associated with a higher complication rate. The most frequent complications seen with chicken pox are secondary bacterial infections of the skin lesions, which can lead to abscesses, lymphadenitis, and, rarely, bacteremia and sepsis. In healthy adults especially, varicella may be complicated by VZV pneumonia, which is 25 times more frequent in these patients than in children and has been described to be especially severe in pregnant women (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0023">23</link>). Chest imaging typically shows miliary lesions (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0024">24</link>). The hospitalization rate among adults with varicella is about 32 per 1,000 reported cases, which is more than 6 times higher than in children (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0025">25</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0003">VZV encephalitis can occur with chicken pox, due to primary infection or to postinfection processes, and often presents with symptoms of acute cerebellar ataxia (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0026">26</link>). Other varicella complications include hepatitis, nephritis, and acute thrombocytopenia. In immunosuppressed patients, extensive general dissemination can occur, leading to multiorgan infection and death if not treated early. The inability to use live attenuated vaccines in children with severe immunodeficiency syndromes motivates research into inactivated vaccines for this group, but nothing is licensed in the United States (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0027">27</link>). Recently, human genetic polymorphisms, often with incomplete penetrance, have been identified in innate immunity pathways in persons who appear generally immunocompetent but suffer from isolated, severe primary VZV infection (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0029">29</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0004">Primary infection with VZV during the first 21 weeks of gestation may lead to congenital varicella syndrome in the fetus, characterized by cutaneous scarifications, atrophy of the extremities, and, in rare cases, seizures, microcephaly, and other sequelae. The association between the clinical syndrome and VZV has been confirmed by detection of viral DNA by PCR in fetal tissue (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0030">30</link>). The incidence is low, &lt;1% in the first 2 trimesters (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0031">31</link>). Alternatively, the child may be clinically normal at birth but develop typical zoster during infancy or childhood (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0019">19</link>). Neonatal varicella can result in severe disseminated infection in babies born 4 days before to 2 days after the maternal varicella rash appears. Given these issues, occupational health programs for female health care workers with childbearing potential typically include serologic tests of VZV immune status (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0032">32</link>). Advisory bodies in some countries recommend serologic testing for pregnant women with no history of varicella or vaccination (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0033">33</link>). Accelerated diagnostic testing of either mother or child may be sought in suspected cases of varicella or varicella exposure during pregnancy, as there are specific temporal windows for therapeutic intervention with immune globulin products (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0033">33</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0005">After primary infection, VZV persists in the host in a latent state in sensory trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. VZV reaches the sensory ganglia, most likely by retrograde axonal transport from skin lesions, and possibly by hematogenous spread (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0003">3</link>). Variable amounts of virus, ranging from about 500 to 55,000 viral genome copies per 100,000 ganglion cells, have been detected in latently infected hosts (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0034">34</link>). During VZV latency, transcription and translation of specific genes have been observed. Recent work casts some doubt on the persistent expression of VZV proteins while identifying specific viral RNA species associated with latency (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0035">35</link>). The virus is thought to be kept under control mostly by the host’s VZV-specific T-cell immunity, based on correlative studies of blood T-cell levels (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0036">36</link>). When this immunity decreases due to immunosuppression or older age, reactivation of the virus may occur.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0006">Reactivation of VZV can lead to limited subclinical local infection, or the virus may spread via neurons to the skin, resulting in the clinical syndrome herpes zoster. Herpes zoster is mostly characterized as a vesicular rash, typically limited in immunocompetent hosts to the dermatome innervated by a single sensory nerve (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0003">3</link>). At times, scattered clusters of vesicles appear that are not clearly dermatomal, leading to diagnostic confusion with herpes simplex virus (HSV) (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0037">37</link>). Specific virologic diagnostics may be indicated in such cases, as therapy is distinct between recurrent cutaneous VZV and HSV. Herpes zoster is often preceded and accompanied by intense neuropathic pain due to sensory neuron involvement. The eye may be affected, resulting in zoster ophthalmicus. Ocular syndromes include keratitis, uveitis, and retinal necrosis, with PCR of vitreous fluid assisting in the diagnosis. An increase in the VZV-specific immune responses is thought to limit viral spread and resolve zoster. Recurrent zoster, while rare in the immunocompetent, can occur (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0038">38</link>). The most frequent complication of herpes zoster is postherpetic neuralgia, which presents as severe pain and may last for up to several months after herpes zoster.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0007">In most cases, the diagnosis of herpes zoster is a clinical one, based on its characteristic appearance and the distribution of vesicles. In some cases, however, reactivation may also result in zoster sine herpete, a syndrome of undefined local pain that is sometimes associated with central nervous system (CNS) infection or visceral organ dysfunction that occurs in the absence of a vesicular rash. The diagnosis of zoster sine herpete can be provided only by virological investigation. It may occur more commonly than previously thought. The detection of VZV DNA in saliva by PCR has been found to be diagnostically useful in such cases (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0039">39</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0008">In immunocompetent hosts, the most severe complications of herpes zoster are associated with VZV infections of the CNS. Viral meningitis, myelitis, or encephalitis may be observed, with encephalitis likely occurring due to neuronal spread. PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains the standard for diagnosis of these cases. Cases of facial palsy syndrome are also seen. Approximately 25% of cases with CNS complications due to virologically confirmed VZV reactivation occurred in the context of zoster sine herpete (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0040">40</link>). Furthermore, VZV reactivation can cause intra- and extracranial vasculopathy. A significant fraction of stroke syndromes occurring in children and otherwise healthy younger adults without typical cerebrovascular disease or structural lesions have been associated with VZV reactivation (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0042">42</link>). As discussed below, the detection of VZV DNA by PCR of CSF, or surrogate specimens such as saliva or blood, may clarify the diagnosis in such cases. VZV infection of arteries should be considered in patients with transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or possibly giant cell arteritis, in particular if it follows zoster or varicella (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0043">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0044">44</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0009">In the immunosuppressed host, primary infection and reactivation can lead to severe and possibly life-threatening generalized infection. In the prevaccine era, severe disseminated primary infection associated with high mortality was a particular concern in immunosuppressed children. This remains an important entity in undervaccinated populations. After bone marrow or solid-organ transplantation, patients frequently exhibit episodes of VZV reactivation, which sometimes proceed to severe disseminated infection and development of visceral zoster, a clinical picture characterized by severe abdominal pain and associated with the involvement of internal organs, such as the liver, colon, or lung (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0045">45</link>–<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0049">49</link>). Among solid-organ transplant recipients, lung transplant patients especially have an increased risk for VZV complications (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0050">50</link>), but VZV can also cause substantial problems in patients with hematological malignancies or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0051">51</link>). HIV-infected individuals may also undergo severe episodes of VZV reactivation and dissemination, especially during AIDS, and they may exhibit an unusual clinical presentation (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0052">52</link>–<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0054">54</link>). VZV can also play a role in the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and mucocutaneous zoster may occur within 4 weeks after the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0055">55</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0010">VZV is also responsible for some cases of vasculopathy in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed persons. Presentations can be diverse and depend on the anatomical area supplied by the affected arterial system. The most commonly recognized presentation is intracerebral, in which VZV vasculopathy may present clinically as a stroke syndrome. Classically, this occurs during or after resolution of zoster rash, especially in the distribution of the trigeminal ganglia, and may account for epidemiologic observations of a higher overall incidence of stroke after zoster (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0056">56</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0057">57</link>). Diagnosis can be sought by CSF VZV PCR, but results may be negative by the time of clinical presentation and, if positive, must interpreted in light of data showing that serum VZV PCR may be highly positive in cases of routine zoster without stroke-like symptoms, meningitis, or Ramsay Hunt syndrome, such that detection of small amounts of VZV DNA in CSF could also be expected in such persons (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0058">58</link>). A mild CSF pleocytosis may be present. To increase sensitivity, practitioners can use indices of local immune responses by measuring the level (not just presence) of VZV-specific IgG in CSF. When this is performed, simultaneous evaluation of serum and CSF total IgG levels is typically also done to rule out significant passive transfer or total IgG into CSF as a nonspecific finding. If the total IgG ratio is low, then detection of anti-VZV IgG in the CSF, or optimally a significant level of anti-VZV IgG in CSF compared to serum, is consistent with a local immune response and thus viral involvement. CSF VZV IgG tests are available through providers such as Mayo Laboratories and ARUP in the United States.</para>

        <para id="ch0121s0001s0004p0011">Disease caused by VZV can be prevented by vaccination. A live attenuated varicella vaccine derived from the Japanese Oka strain, termed vOka, was developed in the early 1970s. It was approved in the United States in 1995 for persons who are susceptible to chicken pox and is currently recommended in various European countries (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0059">59</link>). The childhood vaccination policy in the United States has led to a substantial decrease in varicella incidence (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0060">60</link>), disease severity, and associated complications (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0061">61</link>). A vOka-derived vaccine has also been developed to boost immunity against VZV in older patients in order to prevent zoster reactivation (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0062">62</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0063">63</link>). Rarely, vOka can be pathogenic if given to persons before or during immune suppression and can lead to disease either shortly after administration or upon reactivation (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0064">64</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0065">65</link>). Genotyping of viral isolates or PCR-positive specimens to distinguish wild-type VZV from vOka is available through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is based on a series of known genetic markers (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0038">38</link>). Genotyping may also be available through the U.S. manufacturer of the live attenuated vaccine. More recently, a nonlive vaccine based on recombinant VZV gE and a potent adjuvant has been approved in several countries for the prevention of zoster in older adults (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0063">63</link>). The mechanism of action is thought to involve a boost in VZV-specific CD4 T cells, although brisk antibody responses are also observed (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0003">3</link>). The efficacy of the nonlive vaccine, termed recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), is higher for shingles than that of the live attenuated product, zoster vaccine live (ZVL), including in older age groups. Long-term clinical durability data are still pending but thus far appear excellent for RZV.</para>

        <para id="ch0121s0001s0006p0001">Specific antiviral treatment of VZV primary infection and reactivation is possible. If treatment is necessary, it is usually performed with nucleoside analogues, such as acyclovir or penciclovir, or with the more highly orally bioavailable prodrugs valacyclovir and famciclovir. Among these, only acyclovir is generally available as an intravenous preparation, and it is given on a per-weight basis with adjustment for renal function at doses higher than are used for HSV. Empiric acyclovir therapy may be warranted in cases of suspected severe VZV infection, such as hepatitis with incipient liver failure, while awaiting PCR results. Brivudine is another nucleoside analogue licensed in some countries that has proven effective against VZV (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0067">67</link>). Anti-VZV treatment is administered in immunosuppressed hosts and in immunocompetent patients when clinical complications arise. In addition, herpes zoster reactivation is also treated to limit the development of postherpetic neuralgia and to prevent ocular involvement when the first distribution of the trigeminal nerve is involved.</para>

Vesicular fluid contains cell-free virus, mostly at high concentrations. Since nearly all patients with varicella and many patients with herpes zoster show a vesicular rash, and because collection of vesicular fluid is very convenient, laboratory diagnosis from vesicular fluid is a major diagnostic tool for detection or confirmation of VZV infection or reactivation. The vesicular fluid can be collected using capillary pipettes or syringes. For PCR analysis, vesicular fluid can also be collected on swabs and submitted to the laboratory in physiological saline or in viral transport medium. If further virus culture is planned, it should be kept in mind that virus collected on swabs is less stable and is also further diluted in the medium, which may decrease the efficiency of virus culture.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0007p0002">VZV DNA is detectable by PCR in vesicular fluid, CSF, plasma, serum, saliva, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), ocular fluid, biopsy material, or paraffin-embedded tissue. Plasma or serum is conventionally used due to ease of preparation. Whole-blood specimens should be submitted in anticoagulants other than heparin if PCR testing is to be performed, as heparin can inhibit DNA polymerases. CSF should be submitted in a sterile container. Usually, uncentrifuged CSF is used for detection of VZV DNA, but virus can also be detected in the cellular fraction or in supernatant.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0007p0003">In disseminated disease, tissue testing has now largely been replaced by PCR of blood specimens due to test sensitivity and ease of specimen procurement. Cells from tissue can be stained by immunofluorescence. Touch preparations of cells are prepared by pressing tissue (typically 10 to 15 mm) against the clean surface of a glass slide multiple times, over a length of 30 to 40 mm. Slides are air dried, fixed in cold acetone, and stained with reagents used in antigen detection (see below). Tissue homogenates can be prepared as described elsewhere in this<emphasis>Manual</emphasis> and tested by culture or PCR.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0001s0007p0004">Generally, VZV DNA, which is ultimately amplified by PCR methods, is quite stable during collection, transport, and storage. VZV virions, however, are quite labile; therefore, specimens should be placed into culture as quickly as possible after collection if isolation is required. Samples for PCR can be stored at −20°C. Virus isolation from frozen samples is largely ineffective unless cellular fractions are stored in cryoprotectant medium at −80°C.</para>

However, since the presence of these cells is characteristic of both HSV and VZV infections, a specific diagnosis of VZV cannot be made with this test.

These techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis of VZV disease of the CNS and disseminated VZV infection in immunocompromised patients and the identification of herpes zoster in patients who do not develop the typical rash. The advantages of these molecular techniques are that they require only small volumes of input material and are extremely sensitive and rapid.</para>

Real-time PCR methods (reviewed in <ulink url="ch0021#ch0021s0001">chapter 6</ulink>) that are more sensitive and can be quantitative have replaced older PCR techniques and are now routinely performed in many diagnostic laboratories. Numerous laboratory-developed PCR tests have been published for amplifying various gene segments of the VZV genome (<link linkend="ch0121s0001s0006a0004">Table 1</link>). There is no generally preferred target sequence, and the genetic variability between virus strains is low. An increasing number of commercially available VZV nucleic acid test kits are being developed, such as VZV Tracer (Affigene; Cepheid), the VZV PCR kit (Abbott Laboratories), the RealStar VZV PCR kit (Altona), and Artus VZV PCR kits (Qiagen). Protocols have also been designed for simultaneous amplification of VZV together with various other viruses causing similar clinical pictures. Commercially available tests include Artus herpesvirus LC-PCR kits (Qiagen; CE marked for <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic use in Europe, available for research use only in Canada, and not available in the United States), HSV1 HSV2 VZV R-gene (Argene Inc.; CE marked for <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic use in Europe and available for research use only in the United States), and the Lyra Direct HSV 1+2/VZV assay (Quidel Corp.; FDA approved). In addition, FDA-cleared, sample-to-answer instruments for VZV detection in swabs and cerebrospinal fluid are available, such as the Simplexa VZV (swab) direct kit (DiaSorin; FDA cleared and CE marked) and the BioFire Film Array meningitis/encephalitis panel (bioMérieux; FDA cleared and CE marked).

Given the widespread availability of PCR, few clinical laboratories continue to perform VZV culture. Clinical laboratories that continue to isolate VZV generally use human foreskin fibroblasts for isolation of VZV from clinical samples. Other sensitive host cells include diploid human cell lines, preferably derived from fetal kidney, fetal lung, human lung carcinoma (A549), or human melanoma cell lines, and nonhuman cell lines, such as primary monkey kidney cells (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0068">68</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0117">117</link>). A cell mixture (CV-1 and MRC-5) is commercially available for the recovery of herpesviruses including VZV (H&amp;V Mix Mixed FreshCells; Diagnostic Hybrids, Quidel). VZV maintains a high level of genetic stability during the culturing procedure. Cell cultures are performed at 37°C under sterile conditions, and the medium used is usually Eagle’s minimal essential medium, prepared in Hanks’ or Earle’s balanced salt solution containing neomycin and glutamine and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for the growth medium and 1 to 2% fetal bovine serum for maintenance. The medium is heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. The need for a medium change is indicated by a drop in pH, and this change is required at least once weekly. When virus culture is done for diagnostic purposes, the clinical material is adsorbed onto the cell monolayer or inoculated directly into the medium, and the cells are then incubated at 37°C and evaluated daily by microscopy. The development of a cytopathic effect (CPE) is variable, but the CPE is usually visible after 4 to 14 days of incubation. The CPE consists of small foci of rounded and swollen cells. Confirmation of VZV infection is done by PCR or by staining monolayer cells with VZV-specific monoclonal antibodies (described below). Shell vial centrifugation cultures can provide results in 2 to 5 days and are more sensitive than conventional cultures for VZV but less sensitive than PCR.</para>

For identification by VZV-specific PCR, supernatant is taken from the culture, and DNA is extracted and subjected to PCR. Monolayers can also be stained with VZV-specific MAbs when approximately 50% of the monolayer demonstrates CPE suggestive of VZV. For this purpose, cell monolayers are washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then, monolayer cells are scraped into 0.5 ml of PBS. Slides are prepared by directly applying the suspension to a glass slide using a cytocentrifuge. Slides are air dried and then fixed in cold acetone for 10 min. Following a washing with PBS, cells are stained with VZV-specific MAbs. Commercial reagents approved for use in culture confirmation include the D<superscript>3</superscript> DFA VZV detection kit (Quidel) as well as the MAbs listed in “Antigen Detection” above. After a 30-min incubation at 37°C, monolayers are washed in PBS and rinsed in distilled water. Excess moisture is removed by blotting around wells. Stained cells should not be allowed to dry, as this produces artifactual fluorescence. Mounting medium and a coverslip are applied, and the staining is visualized by fluorescence microscopy.</para>

Different methods for discrimination between WT and vaccine strains have been published, and in this regard, much attention has been focused on VZV ORF62 because nonsynonymous VZV vOka mutations occur in this ORF.

Detection of VZV-specific antibodies (Abs) is also routinely used for determining the immune status. This may be required in patients who cannot remember their varicella history and is especially important in pretransplantation evaluations as well as after virus exposure to guide prophylaxis with varicella immune globulin in high-risk individuals, such as solid-organ or bone marrow transplant patients, pregnant women, and health care workers.

        <para id="ch0121s0012s0001p0002">Development of drug resistance may lead to uncontrolled viral dissemination, visceral complication, and death (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0146">146</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0147">147</link>). Data from <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> studies and investigation of resistant isolates have shown that acyclovir resistance is mostly associated with mutations in the VZV TK gene and is only rarely due to mutations in the VZV DNA polymerase. Foscarnet and cidofovir can be used for treatment of acyclovir-resistant strains. Resistant VZV strains may be detected only in specific compartments, and therefore, when screening for drug-resistant VZV strains is performed, samples from all affected body sites should be investigated (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0148">148</link>). Antiviral susceptibility of VZV strains can be determined phenotypically. Changes in virus replication in the presence of different concentrations of various drugs are measured in most cases by plaque reduction assay in human diploid lung cells. The 50% effective doses of acyclovir have been shown to range from 2.06 μM to 6.28 μM (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0149">149</link>). Other methods that have been described include the late-antigen synthesis reduction assay (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0150">150</link>) and phenotypic characterization of the TK gene without the need for virus isolation (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0151">151</link>). The levels of acyclovir that inhibit VZV are somewhat higher than required for HSV, correlating with the clinical use of higher doses of drug. When oral valacyclovir is used at high doses, adequate serum levels are obtained. Phenotypic resistance analysis has several disadvantages that limit its clinical utility: time to result typically is prolonged, limiting its use in clinical decision-making; it cannot easily be performed from all clinical materials; and it may be not sensitive enough for detection of minor resistant VZV populations. Therefore, genotypic resistance testing is theoretically preferred for clinical use, as it is rapid and can be performed from different clinical materials. Genotypic resistance testing is mostly done by sequencing of certain regions of the VZV TK gene that are associated with resistance to acyclovir (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0152">152</link>) and of parts of the polymerase gene. A number of defined VZV mutations have been described so far, and their influence on resistance against different drugs has been proven by phenotypic data (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0153">153</link>). However, variants of unknown significance can also be detected, such that resistance is difficult to rule out on the basis of genotyping alone. Resistance testing is so far performed only in research settings and is not applied in routine diagnostics. Clinically, it may be necessary to replace acyclovir with a second-line agent, or add such a drug, in the setting of deterioration of an immunocompromised patient at risk for the development of acyclovir resistance.</para>

        <para id="ch0121s0012s0002p0001">For appropriate evaluation and interpretation of test results, knowledge about the clinical background of the individual patient is of the utmost importance. The interpretation of the results is dependent on whether a primary infection with VZV is suspected or whether the patient has already had chicken pox. In addition, it is important to know whether a patient is immunosuppressed.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0012s0002p0002">Primary infection is usually diagnosed based on clinical presentation. Virus can be detected from vesicles by PCR and antigen detection assays and from pustules and even crusts by PCR. The results of serologic tests can be supportive, but are not definitively diagnostic, of primary infection. For example, IgM (alone or in the presence of low IgG) or a 4-fold increase in IgG in convalescent-phase serum can be observed during primary infection; however, these seroresponses can also be detected during reactivation.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0012s0002p0003">Herpes zoster can also be diagnosed clinically; however, confirmation may be necessary if vesicles are limited or otherwise indistinct in appearance from those seen in other types of infection. Detection of virus in vesicle fluid is preferred.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0012s0002p0004">The presence of VZV in blood can be observed by PCR assays during chicken pox and sometimes during VZV reactivation. In most immunocompromised hosts, detection of VZV in blood by PCR is generally indicative of severe disease. It should be noted, however, that VZV DNA can also be detected in the blood of HIV patients with localized zoster. The same holds true for the detection of VZV DNA in CSF, which is generally considered a pathological finding. Both clinical situations usually require immediate antiviral treatment.</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0012s0002p0005">However, highly sensitive detection of virus DNA does not always prove the causality of disease. VZV DNA may also be found due to secondary and/or subclinical reactivation, but then it is observed mostly at clearly lower levels than during VZV disease. In this context, the quantitative evaluation and reporting of VZV DNA levels are gaining significance. For immunocompromised patients, so far no defined VZV-DNA thresholds in blood exist for distinguishing subclinical reactivation from clinically relevant and potentially fatal disease. Severe visceral infections are associated with higher virus loads in blood. Studies have also shown that high VZV DNA levels in CSF may be associated with the expression and severity of CNS disease (<link linkend="ch0121s0004a0006">Fig. 5</link>). It may, therefore, be useful to assess and report quantitative results in the setting of VZV CNS disease. In the pre-PCR era, Ab detection in CSF and quantitation in comparison to blood Ab levels were used for diagnosis of VZV infections of the CNS. The detection of IgM Abs is considered evidence of intrathecal Ab production, as is an increase of the IgG Ab CSF/serum ratio in relation to a test of the blood-brain barrier function, i.e., the albumin CSF/serum ratio. The clinical significance of these tests in VZV infections of the CNS and their value for therapeutic decisions are limited, as they allow a diagnosis only late in the course of disease, in contrast to PCR tests of CSF, which identify virus replication at an earlier stage of disease. Serology from CSF was, however, described to be of certain value for detection of VZV vasculopathy (<link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0043">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0121s0012s0003li0044">44</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0121s0012s0002p0006">The major importance of Ab assays, of which commercial immunoassays are currently the most commonly used, lies in their ability to identify previously infected or vaccinated individuals, as indicated by anti-VZV IgG Abs in the absence of IgM. This information can be used to guide further vaccination decisions. However, this may result in the vaccination of seropositive individuals, since these tests are not as sensitive as other gold standard formats.</para>
