        <para id="ch0165s000000p0004"><emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> is distributed worldwide and can infect most mammals and birds through contaminated food or water. The life cycle takes place between definitive hosts (felids) and intermediate hosts (virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans), but it can also be transmitted between intermediate hosts by predation or between definitive hosts, ensuring an amazingly efficient transmission cycle. There are three development stages of this obligate intracellular parasite. Tachyzoites (or trophozoites) are the invasive forms which rapidly proliferate during acute infection in the intermediate host (asexual replication in any nucleated cell); bradyzoites are quiescent forms within cysts which are the hallmark of chronic infection; and oocysts originate from the sexual cycle in the definitive host and contain sporozoites once sporulated (<anchor id="ch0165s000000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0165s000000a0009">Fig. 1</link>). Cats/felids become infected with <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> by consuming infected prey or animal products or by ingestion of oocysts. After tissue cysts or oocysts are ingested by the cat, viable bradyzoites or sporozoites, respectively, are released and invade epithelial cells of the small intestine, where they undergo an asexual replication with systemic infection, followed by a sexual cycle leading to formation of oocysts which are then excreted with feces in the environment. The unsporulated oocyst needs 2 to 5 days after excretion, depending on the climate, to become a sporulated oocyst, i.e., containing two sporocysts each containing four sporozoites. Only sporulated, oocysts are infective for other hosts (<anchor id="ch0165s000000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0165s000000a0010">Fig. 2</link>). Although cats shed oocysts for only 1 to 3 weeks, large numbers may be shed, often exceeding 100,000 per g of feces (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0025">1</link>). Roaming cats are much more likely to become infected than domestic cats that are confined indoors (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0026">2</link>). Even if a strong immunity develops after infection, cats can be reinfected and can excrete oocysts several years later (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0027">3</link>). Oocysts can survive in the environment for several months, up to more than a year; they are remarkably resistant to freezing and disinfectants, but are inactivated by heating to 55°C for 2 min (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0028">4</link>). In wildlife, they infect a wide range of animals, such as herbivores, birds, and rodents as well as humans, through raw vegetables or plants, or water. Carnivores, including humans, can also become infected by consumption of raw (or undercooked) meat containing cysts. After ingestion of tissue cysts or oocysts, bradyzoites or sporozoites, respectively, are released and invade epithelial cells of the small intestine, where they rapidly transform into tachyzoites. The tachyzoites then invade patrolling dendritic or macrophage cells, where they multiply, and use them to disseminate through the bloodstream. Acute primary infection results in a systemic infection, but the immune system finally controls the parasite multiplication through an efficient T-helper (Th)-1 immune response. However, even immunocompetent individuals cannot clear all parasites, but force tachyzoites to convert into quiescent bradyzoites, which form cysts. Cysts are mainly located in the brain, retina, myocardium, and muscles, where they remain lifelong. These cysts are derived from infected cells in which the parasitophorous vacuole has grown to harbor hundreds of parasites and whose membrane has evolved to ensure parasite long-term survival. As the parasite has no cell specificity, potentially all organs can be infected. During acute infection in a pregnant woman (or other animal female hosts), tachyzoites can transfer through the placenta to the fetal compartment.</para>

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0005">Serologic prevalence data indicate that toxoplasmosis is one of the most common infections of humans throughout the world (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0029">5</link>). Because <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> tachyzoites or cysts are rarely detected in immunocompetent humans with toxoplasmosis, serologic examination is used to indicate the presence of the infection (i.e., of quiescent cyst carriage) by detecting <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis>-specific antibodies. The prevalence of seropositive people increases with age, but prevalence rates vary greatly among countries and geographical areas. Overall, infection is more common in warm and humid climates and at lower altitudes than in cold climates and mountainous or arid desert regions. This distribution is probably related to conditions favoring the sporulation and survival of oocysts, but also to the density of felids across these biotopes. A low seroprevalence (10 to 30%) is observed in North America, Southeast Asia, Northern Europe, and Saharan Africa. A moderate to high prevalence (30 to 50%) is found in countries of Western Europe and Southern and North Africa, and high prevalence (&gt;50%) appears in central Europe, Central and Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0030">6</link>). Other factors accounting for differences in seroprevalence between geographic areas or population groups include food or cultural habits, density of and contact with stray cats, socioeconomic level, rural or urban living, and quality of water network supply (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0031">7</link>). A high prevalence in Central and South America has been related to the frequency of stray cats or other felids in a humid and warm climate that favors the survival of oocysts. Hygienic and dwelling conditions also account for the high prevalence rates observed in many African countries (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0032">8</link>). Some outbreaks due to contaminated drinking water have also been described across the world (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0033">9</link>–<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0035">11</link>). A high prevalence of infection in France (50 to 85% in pregnant women) in the 1970s was associated with a preference for eating raw or undercooked meat, but has dramatically declined to 34% in 2016 (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0036">12</link>), probably related to the increasing practice of freezing meat. A similar decreasing trend has been observed in the United States, as the National Health and Nutritional Assessment Survey (NHANES) in U.S.-born persons 12 to 49 years old showed a decrease from 14.1% in 1988–1994 to 9.0% in 1999–2004 (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0037">13</link>) and 6.7% in 2009–2010 (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0038">14</link>).</para>

The two major routes of transmission of <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> to humans are oral and congenital. In immunocompetent subjects, acute infection resolves within several weeks into chronic infection, characterized by long-term carriage of tissue cysts and a lifelong positive serology. As long as the T-cell response is efficient, the infection remains latent, but in case of immune suppression, cysts can release bradyzoites which rapidly reactivate into tachyzoites, leading to a recrudescence of clinical disease.</para>

These recommendations include the following: (i) meat should be cooked to safe temperatures (whole cuts of meat to at least 145°F [63°C] with a 3-min rest before eating [i.e., after removal from the heat source]; ground meat to 160°F [71°C]; poultry to at least 165°F [74°C]); (ii) fruits and vegetables should be peeled or washed thoroughly before eating; (iii) cutting boards, dishes, counters, utensils, and hands should always be washed with hot soapy water after they have contacted raw meat, poultry, or seafood or unwashed fruits or vegetables; (iv) raw or undercooked oysters, mussels, or clams (these may be contaminated with <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> that has washed into seawater) and unpasteurized goat’s milk should be avoided; (v) individuals should wear gloves when gardening and during any contact with soil or sand, because cat waste might be in soil or sand, and should wash hands afterwards. Pregnant women should avoid changing cat litter; pregnant women who must change cat litter should wear gloves and a mask, then wash their hands thoroughly. The litter box should be changed daily, because <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> oocysts require more than 1 day to become infectious, and rinsed with boiling water. Pregnant women should be encouraged to keep their cats inside and not adopt or handle stray cats or kittens. Cats should be fed only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meat. Several outbreaks have been reported in association with untreated well water contaminated by oocysts (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0050">26</link>), but also with municipal drinking water in India (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0051">27</link>), Brazil (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0052">28</link>), and Canada (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0053">29</link>). Therefore, pregnant women and immunocompromised patients should be advised to drink bottled mineral water to avoid infection.

Both newly acquired (by food or transplantation) or reactivated latent infection can have severe outcomes. <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> encephalitis is more frequently observed in AIDS patients, whereas disseminated toxoplasmosis is more common in transplant patients (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0070">46</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0017">Congenital toxoplasmosis can occur when primary infection is acquired by a woman during pregnancy, and results from tachyzoite transfer through the placenta during the disseminating stage of infection. The overall rate of transmission of infection to the fetus is approximately 30%, but can vary from &lt;5 to &gt;50%, depending on the stage of pregnancy and prenatal care management (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0075">51</link>–<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0077">53</link>). The incidence of transmission and the severity of congenital toxoplasmosis are inversely correlated. At the very beginning of pregnancy, the maternal Th1 response against the parasite can lead to a disruption of immune tolerance, resulting in fetal loss or stillbirth (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0078">54</link>). During the first trimester, vertical transmission is rare (&lt;10% of cases), but parasite multiplication is uncontrolled and induces destruction or profound remodeling of the white substance with necrosis foci, leading to major abnormalities in the fetal brain and eye tissues. This can lead to severe manifestations including mental retardation, hydrocephaly, epilepsy, psychomotor deficit, blindness, or deafness. These foci further calcify and can be detected at birth by transfontanellar echography. By contrast, infection occurring during the third trimester is frequent (&gt;50%), but usually benign or even asymptomatic (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0077">53</link>). Because prompt treatment of the mother may reduce the frequency of vertical transmission and the severity of congenital infection in the fetus, rapid and accurate diagnosis is extremely important. American studies have also shown that many infants with subclinical infection at birth will develop clinical signs of congenital toxoplasmosis if left untreated (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0079">55</link>), while prompt treatment may help prevent or reduce the severity of subsequent symptoms (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0080">56</link>). Congenital toxoplasmosis can also result from reactivation of past infection if the mother is immunosuppressed (mostly HIV infection), and, in a rare case, from reinfection with a highly virulent strain (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0081">57</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0165s000000p0018">Indeed, the picture of disease can be different when primary maternal infection is due to a virulent parasite genotype, as this can induce fetal death or severe fetal infection at any stage of pregnancy, as observed in French Guiana and reported in the yearly survey of the French National Reference Center for Toxoplasmosis (<ulink url="http://cnrtoxoplasmose.chu-reims.fr/">http://cnrtoxoplasmose.chu-reims.fr/</ulink>). In Colombia and Brazil, the frequency and severity of ocular toxoplasmosis in congenitally infected infants have been noted in several studies, as well as the higher frequency of recurrent episodes (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0082">58</link>–<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0084">60</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0019">Ocular toxoplasmosis, an important cause of chorioretinitis in the United States, may be the result of congenital or acquired infection (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0085">61</link>). Jones and Holland estimated that 21,505 persons have ocular lesions (both asymptomatic and symptomatic), and 4,839 (range, 2,150 to 7,527) persons develop symptomatic ocular toxoplasmosis each year in the United States (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0086">62</link>). Data acquired from countries with systematic screening of congenital toxoplasmosis suggest that acquired ocular infection is more common than retinochoroiditis resulting from congenital infection and can be seen both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0087">63</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0088">64</link>). Retinochoroiditis is a common feature of congenital toxoplasmosis that can be observed whatever the trimester of maternal infection. It is distinctive in that its clinical expression is frequently delayed after birth. Congenitally infected patients can be asymptomatic until the second or third decade of life, when lesions develop in the eye due to cyst rupture and subsequent release of tachyzoites and bradyzoites. The frequency and the recurrence of eye lesions depend on whether the mother was treated or not and on postnatal management. During a longitudinal U.S. study including 25 infants who were not treated <emphasis>in utero</emphasis> or during their first year of life, Phan et al. (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0079">55</link>) observed that 72% of them developed new eye lesions during a mean follow-up time of 5.7 years, whereas a French prospective study of 102 infants who benefited from prenatal and postnatal treatment showed that 78% were asymptomatic over a median follow-up time of 7.8 years (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0089">65</link>). A European cohort study showed that the risk of developing eye lesions by 4 years of age was highest for children with serious neurologic sequelae at birth, but also significantly increased for those with intracranial lesions or hepatosplenomegaly (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0090">66</link>). Chorioretinitis is often bilateral in patients with congenital infection, but is often unilateral in individuals with acute acquired <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> infection or reactivation.</para>

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0020">Once toxoplasmosis is suspected on the basis of clinical signs and/or imaging findings, a biological workup is necessary to confirm diagnosis. Such a workup will rely on serologic examination and/or parasite detection. Various samples can be analyzed using a wide range of techniques, depending on the clinical context (<anchor id="ch0165s000000a0025"/><link linkend="ch0165s000000a0027">Table 1</link>). Serology is useful in any context: primary infection, systematic screening, immunocompromised patients with clinical signs, and infants with suggestive clinical signs or born to a mother who acquired toxoplasmosis during pregnancy. Parasite detection by microscopy, histology, or molecular techniques is the key diagnostic approach for acute infection in immunocompromised patients and for congenital toxoplasmosis. Mouse assay, i.e., inoculation of human products by intraperitoneal injection to mice, has been used for decades for prenatal diagnosis but is now mostly dedicated to parasite strain isolation for epidemiological purposes, as its sensitivity is lower than that of molecular diagnosis. Similarly, the use of cell cultures to grow parasites from human samples is now restricted to research <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> studies.</para>

IgA and IgM reach a plateau within 1 month, then decrease during the following 3 to 6 months, but IgM can be detected for 1 year or more, depending on the technique.

In exceptional cases, IgM can remain undetected (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0093">69</link>).

        <para id="ch0165s000000p0076">Basic serologic examination relies on anti-<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG and IgM detection. Many tests for the detection of antibodies to <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> have been used since Sabin and Feldman developed the methylene blue dye test (DT) (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0029">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0095">71</link>). Commercial kits using various methods, i.e., agglutination tests (latex agglutination, immunohemagglutination assay [IHA], immunosorbent agglutination assay [ISAGA]), indirect fluorescent antibody tests (IFAT), and enzyme immunoassays (EIA), are available worldwide. A number of automated devices and multiparameter platforms allow testing of large numbers of specimens and of multiple immunoassays in high-volume laboratories (<anchor id="ch0165s000000a0044"/><link linkend="ch0165s000000a0046">Table 3</link>). These serologic methods and commercial assays do not all have the same threshold of positivity, nor yield comparable antibody titers, although they are supposed to provide results in international units per milliliter (IU/ml), indexed on the WHO international standard reference serum for <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0096">72</link>). Additionally, titers can vary among batches of a given assay, and thus sequential serum samples must be analyzed in parallel to compare titers and interpret a kinetics of antibody response. Results from tests done at different times, in different laboratories, or with different procedures should not be compared quantitatively, only qualitatively as positive or negative.</para>

        <para id="ch0165s000000p0123">It is essential to use a serologic assay designed for<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnosis (IVD); the manufacturer’s package should be carefully reviewed to check that the assay is not reserved for research use and to confirm how it was validated on human samples. Published literature may also help for information on the sensitivity and specificity rates (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0097">73</link>–<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0112">88</link>). A recent systematic review provided cumulative data on the performance of currently available diagnostic tests (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0113">89</link>). The user should perform an in-laboratory comparison of kits by using positive and negative samples confirmed by a toxoplasmosis reference laboratory. Thorough evaluation of the performance of the assay is required for accredited laboratories, and publication of well-conducted studies is welcome and helpful for professionals. In general practice, it is important to have a reliable and sensitive assay for <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG detection. Indeed, the knowledge of positive IgG can guide important clinical decisions, as (i) it should prompt chemoprophylaxis in HSCT patients and heart transplant patients to avoid reactivation, (ii) it allows the identification of an organ donor as a potential source of infection for the recipient, (iii) it should prompt further investigation to document <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> encephalitis (TE) in an HIV-infected patient with neurological signs, and (iv) it allows the health care provider to inform a pregnant woman about the risk of acquiring toxoplasmosis during gestation. False-positive results, as observed with some assays, can be due to cross-reactions with antibody directed against genetically close parasites (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0114">90</link>) and can be an issue if a pregnant woman is wrongly considered as having protective immunity from previous infection. Together with a high positive predictive value, a high negative predictive value is also expected from an IgG assay to rule out TE in HIV patients. The performance of an IgM assay is essential to properly diagnose an acute infection or a congenitally infected newborn. Although there are many diagnostic assays for IgG/IgM <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> serology on the market, few rigorous evaluation studies are available in the literature (<link linkend="ch0165s000000a0046">Table 3</link>). Because they can be easily automated, EIA-based assays are now the most widely used by diagnostic laboratories for <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG and IgM detection as well as IgA detection. Their performance has been largely improved over time with the development of immunocapture methods. However, despite overall high sensitivities, the occurrence of false-positive IgM reactions due to natural cross-reacting IgM, outside any context of infection, remains a problem with some commercially available kits, and thus confirmation with another technique is required (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0115">91</link>). Confirmatory IgM testing can be performed with another EIA or with IgM ISAGA. In high-income countries in the era of lab accreditation, manual techniques (agglutination test, IFAT) are less and less used, due to possible gaps in handling and standardization and the lack of computerized tracking information on the analytical process. Latex agglutination assays should be used with caution, as they detect both specific IgG and IgM and are prone to nonspecific reactions (up to 11%) due to interfering diseases (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0098">74</link>). Rapid diagnostic tests, such as ICT, have also been marketed and evaluated in an American study (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0107">83</link>), but their place in patient management or in lab organization remains to be determined. They may be helpful to quickly confirm a serological status, for bedside diagnosis, or for epidemiological studies, provided that they are used properly. One test seems to have very good performance (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0106">82</link>). The shortcomings and advantages of each method are summarized in <anchor id="ch0165s000000a0059"/><link linkend="ch0165s000000a0061">Table 4</link>.</para>

        <para id="ch0165s000000p0124">In routine practice, serologic diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is based on IgG and IgM detection, to avoid missing a recent acute infection. Usually, if the determination of immune status is the reason for testing, a single serum specimen is satisfactory, unless complementary investigations are needed. When IgG is detected together with IgM, it may be of interest to know if the infection might be recent, as it can have clinical consequences in patient management. The<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG avidity test is a widely used additional tool to help discriminate between past and recently acquired infection (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0116">92</link>). The test is based on the observation that during acute infection, IgG antibodies bind antigen weakly, i.e., have low avidity, while patients with chronic infection display antibodies with stronger binding to antigens (high avidity). Depending on the method used, a high-avidity result indicates an infection that is more than 4 to 5 months old (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0117">93</link>). However, a low-avidity result does not definitely indicate a recently acquired infection, because low- or intermediate-avidity antibodies may be detectable for a year postinfection in some patients. Indeed, some subjects present with a delayed maturation of IgG avidity (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0094">70</link>). Furthermore, the early initiation of specific treatment significantly delays the maturation of IgG avidity and therefore makes it uninterpretable (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0118">94</link>). Several commercialized EIA avidity assays are now available (<link linkend="ch0165s000000a0046">Table 3</link>), but can have diverse performances to exclude a recent infection. The VIDAS TOXO avidity assay (bioMérieux) was the first marketed kit in Europe and the United States and is usually used as a comparator in the evaluation of other kits (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0099">75</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0119">95</link>–<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0121">97</link>) with undefeated performances.</para>

        <para id="ch0165s000000p0125">In situations in which determining the time of infection is important and avidity result is not conclusive, specimens drawn at least 2 to 3 weeks apart may be useful. An at least 2-fold-increasing immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer, with the simultaneous detection of specific IgM, is deemed indicative of an acute infection of less than 2 months before the first serum sample. If IgG titers are steady in the absence of specific treatment, then the infection was acquired more than 2 months before the first sample. The different data are depicted in<anchor id="ch0165s000000a0067"/><link linkend="ch0165s000000a0069">Table 5</link>.</para>

        <para id="ch0165s000000p0126">Other serologic tests may be of interest when routine techniques yield equivocal results or in unusual clinical settings. A commercial Western blot assay (WB Toxo IgG II assay, LDBio) has been designed to confirm the specificity of low IgG titers, with a sensitivity equal to the dye test, a gold standard test which is currently available only in a few reference centers. This assay has a high added value, as it provides rapid confirmation of primary infection when EIA techniques are still negative (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0110">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0122">98</link>).</para>

IgA detection should always be performed in addition to IgM assays for newborns suspected of having congenital infection or born to mothers with infection acquired during gestation (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0029">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0123">99</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0124">100</link>). Results of IgA testing in adults can be of interest to document a recent infection, as these isotypes are reputed to disappear more rapidly than IgM (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0125">101</link>). However, no IgA detection assays are currently FDA-cleared for use in the United States. The presence of <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis>-specific IgE antibodies may also contribute to the determination of acute infections, although reports concerning the utility of IgE antibody detection have been mixed (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0126">102</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0127">103</link>). The differential agglutination test comparing agglutination of acetone (AC)-fixed versus formalin (HS)-fixed tachyzoites (AC/HS test) can provide contrasting titers in case of recent infection, and can be of help, but requires fresh parasites, which restricts its use to reference centers (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0128">104</link>).</para>

The production of specific antibodies in aqueous humor (AH) can be also quantitatively assessed by comparison of AH and serum IgG titers, thanks to the calculation of the Goldman-Witmer coefficient (GWC) (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0131">107</link>). This coefficient represents the respective proportion of anti-<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG antibodies in serum and in AH, compared to the overall level of IgG in these two compartments, and is calculated as follows: GWC = (anti-<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG [IU/ml] in AH/anti-<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG [IU/ml] in serum) × (total amount of IgG [g/liter] in serum/total amount of IgG [g/liter] in AH). A ratio of &gt;3 is considered significant of ocular toxoplasmosis. Another coefficient has been recently proposed, replacing total IgG dosage by mumps virus IgG dosage and calculating independently the two following ratios: anti-<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG in serum/anti-<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG in AH, and anti-mumps IgG in serum/anti-mumps IgG in AH. The result was in favor of ocular toxoplasmosis when the “Toxo ratio” was &lt;2 and the “mumps ratio” was &gt;3 (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0132">108</link>).</para>

However, this is of little utility in patients with aplasia or leukopenia. In that case, a large volume of serum or plasma can also be extracted.

Fluid specimens (except blood) should be spotted on a microscope slide by cytocentrifugation and stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG) or Giemsa for microscopic examination.

        <para id="ch0165s000000p0140"><emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> DNA detection by PCR is the key tool for diagnosing congenital infections, ocular toxoplasmosis, and toxoplasmic reactivation in immunocompromised patients (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0029">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0129">105</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0137">113</link>). Nested PCR should be avoided as it carries a high risk of contamination with amplicons. Real-time PCR (rtPCR) is the preferred and widely used method for nucleic acid detection by reference labs. The repeated-sequence AF146527 gene target (also known as <emphasis>rep529)</emphasis> has largely replaced other PCR targets, such as the B1 gene. The literature about PCR technique performances must be read with caution, as results may vary widely according to the study design, the PCR technique (conventional or rtPCR), and the amplification device (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0138">114</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0139">115</link>). Although many clinical studies are based on in-house techniques, commercial assays are now available (<anchor id="ch0165s000000a0082"/><link linkend="ch0165s000000a0083">Table 6</link>), but need to be evaluated on field samples and on spiked samples with known dilutions of <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> tachyzoites to assess their analytical sensitivity. Additionally, it is very important to verify that the extraction method used does not modify the analytical sensitivity of the amplification assay, as shown for the ELITe MGB assay (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0140">116</link>). Some qPCR assays have been evaluated in the literature (<link linkend="ch0165s000000a0083">Table 6</link>) and have yielded results roughly similar to those of reference laboratory methods on clinical samples (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0140">116</link>–<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0142">118</link>), yet not uniformly on all sample types (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0140">116</link>). The ELITe MGB assay was able to detect DNA parasites from samples spiked with 1 <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> cell per ml, but suffered from decreased sensitivity on cell-rich samples, such as placenta. The Bio-Evolution assay was prospectively evaluated in the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients and showed a relative sensitivity and specificity of 98.8% and 100%, respectively, compared to a <emphasis>rep529</emphasis>-rtPCR in-house method (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0143">119</link>). Another assay, the <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> TIB Molbiol assay, was evaluated in only one clinical study on a small number of samples and yielded concordant results with the in-house method in 37/38 samples (no clinical data were provided to analyze the discordant result) (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0144">120</link>). Other evaluation studies are ongoing at the French National Reference Center for Toxoplasmosis. A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has been commercialized and proved efficient to detect <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> DNA in blood, placenta, and amniotic fluid samples; its analytical sensitivity using spiked samples was &lt;0.04 parasite per reaction tube (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0142">118</link>). A multiplex solid-phase strip PCR (strip PCR) has been recently developed by a Japanese team to detect 24 pathogens responsible for ocular infections, including <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis>, and was evaluated in a multicenter clinical study by comparison to single qPCRs (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0145">121</link>). Results were concordant for nine pathogens (including <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis>), but the assay still needs adjustments for other targets. However, the concept proved interesting, and such multiplex commercial panels would be welcome in other clinical settings.</para>

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0143">Baseline information about an individual’s<emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> serologic status would be useful in the following situations: (i) before conceiving a child or in early pregnancy; (ii) before receiving immunosuppressive therapy or undergoing transplantation; and (iii) after the initial determination of HIV-positive status. A negative IgM/IgG result indicates that the patient has not been infected. A positive IgG result, whatever the titer, indicates infection with <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> at some undetermined time. Pretransplant testing for <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> serology helps to determine if transplant candidates might be at risk for acute acquired infection (seronegative before transplantation) or at risk for reactivation (seropositive before transplantation), and thus serological results will guide chemoprophylaxis and/or hygienic counseling. However, it is important to make sure that the candidates were not transfused during the month (cell transfusion) or 2 months (plasma transfusion) before sampling, as passively transferred anti-<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG can skew interpretation of immune status. It is also recommended that all HIV-infected patients be tested for <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis>-specific IgG antibodies soon after the diagnosis of HIV infection, to detect latent infection needing chemoprophylaxis if CD4+ T cell counts are &lt;200/μl (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0148">124</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0165s000000p0144">The detection of IgM together with IgG can require further examination (IgG avidity, serologic control at a distal time point) depending on the setting and patient background. Essentially, the estimation of the date of infection is needed to guide patient management and clinical decisions if it deals with pregnant women or organ/hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donors (<link linkend="ch0165s000000a0092">Fig. 5</link>). In the first case, it is important to determine if infection was acquired during or before pregnancy, to guide maternal treatment, ultrasound surveillance, and amniocentesis sampling. In the case of organ or HSC donors, recent infection in the donor should lead to postponing transplantation or treating the recipient from day 0 of transplantation and careful monitoring.</para>

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0145">For immunocompetent patients with suspected acute infection, the patient’s serum specimen should be tested for the presence of IgG/IgM anti-<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis>-specific antibodies. The presence of typical lymphadenopathy suggestive of acute toxoplasmosis, together with positive IgG and IgM antibodies, suggests acute infection, which can be confirmed by a low IgG avidity. Very rarely, early after infection, a person may present with a positive IgM and a negative IgG result, which will soon turn positive. Demonstration of seroconversion from a negative titer to a positive titer, or of a more than 2-fold increase in IgG titer (IU/ml), confirms the diagnosis of recent infection when specimens drawn several (≥2) weeks apart are tested in parallel with the same quantitative EIA kits (<link linkend="ch0165s000000a0069">Table 5</link>). However, when specimens are drawn after titers have peaked, IgG avidity testing can provide additional evidence for acute infection if the index is very low, and definitely rules out recent infection if the avidity index is high (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0095">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0116">92</link>). A negative IgG/IgM result essentially excludes the diagnosis of acute <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> infection, but the test should be repeated 2 weeks later if clinical signs began shortly before sampling (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0060">36</link>). A negative IgM test essentially rules out infection in the previous 6 months, although IgM can occasionally be cleared within 3 months (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0093">69</link>). A positive IgM/IgG result and a high IgG avidity result also rule out a recent <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> infection (usually in the preceding 4 months, depending on the assay).</para>

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0146">Immunocompetent women who have IgG antibody before conception are generally considered immune, preventing transmission of infection to their fetus (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0149">125</link>), although second infection with another genotype may, rarely, lead to congenital infection (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0081">57</link>). Women who are seronegative are considered at risk for infection and in France or other European countries (e.g., Belgium, Italy, Austria) are tested monthly during pregnancy to guide quick onset of treatment as soon as seroconversion is observed. If a woman is first tested after conception and has <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis>-specific IgM antibodies, IgG avidity testing and, possibly, the differential agglutination AC-HS test could also be done to determine if acute infection is likely to have occurred during pregnancy (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0128">104</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0149">125</link>) (<link linkend="ch0165s000000a0069">Table 5</link>). A high-avidity result in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy essentially rules out an infection acquired during gestation or in the month before. A low-avidity result cannot be used as an indicator of recent infection, because some individuals have persistent low IgG avidity for many months after infection, but a very low index (&lt;0.05) is suggestive of recent infection. These cases may be tricky to interpret and should be confirmed by a toxoplasmosis reference laboratory prior to intervention (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0149">125</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0165s000000p0147">When the diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis has been made in a pregnant woman, she should be treated and prenatal diagnosis should be proposed to investigate whether the fetus has been infected (<anchor id="ch0165s000000a0095"/><link linkend="ch0165s000000a0096">Fig. 6</link>). Prenatal diagnosis relies on amniotic fluid sampling and is also indicated when fetal anomalies suggestive of congenital toxoplasmosis are detected during ultrasound follow-up of a woman with possible acute infection during pregnancy (IgG+/IgM+ with unknown serologic status in early pregnancy). Amniocentesis can be performed from 16 weeks of gestation onwards, and a gap of 4 weeks must be allowed between maternal infection and amniotic fluid sampling. <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> DNA amplification by PCR in amniotic fluid is the method of choice to diagnose congenital toxoplasmosis (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0129">105</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0150">126</link>–<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0152">128</link>), as fetal blood sampling does not improve the diagnostic yield and increases the risk of fetal loss (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0153">129</link>).

In addition, fetal ultrasound examinations are recommended every month until delivery to search for signs of infection: cerebral or hepatic calcifications, hydrocephalus, hepatomegaly, or ascites. When congenital infection is confirmed or maternal infection occurred after the first trimester of pregnancy, a specific combination therapy with pyrimethamine (PYR) and sulfadiazine (SDZ) is recommended until delivery (<link linkend="ch0165s000000a0096">Fig. 6</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0148">Diagnosis of<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> infection at birth can be obtained through a combination of serologic testing, parasite DNA detection on amniotic fluid or placenta collected during delivery, and imaging (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0029">5</link>). An infant suspected of having congenital toxoplasmosis should have a thorough general, neurologic, and ophthalmologic examination and a computed tomographic scan of the head (magnetic resonance imaging does not demonstrate calcifications). Diagnosis of congenital infection necessitates the use of multiple costly laboratory tests, which are counterbalanced by early diagnosis and treatment, known to improve outcome (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0079">55</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0080">56</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0154">130</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0155">131</link>). The cord blood or child’s serum should be tested for anti-<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies and compared with the same sample from the mother by using Western blot analysis to detect neosynthesized antibodies produced by the neonate when infected (<link linkend="ch0165s000000a0079">Fig. 4C</link>). Placental leak during delivery can occasionally lead to false-positive IgM or IgA detection in the newborn, and thus positive tests for these antibodies usually must be confirmed by repeat testing for IgM at 3 to 7 days of life and repeat testing for IgA at 10 days of life. Identical IgM Western blot profiles of mother and newborn can facilitate interpretation, as they suggest cord blood contamination with maternal blood. In a U.S. study on 164 infected, untreated infants, <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis>-specific IgM, IgA, and IgE antibodies were detected in 86.6%, 77.4%, and 40.2% of infants, respectively (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0156">132</link>). Testing for IgM and IgA antibodies increased the sensitivity of diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis to 93% compared with testing for IgM or IgA individually. The value of combining IgM and IgA testing has been reported in other studies (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0124">100</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0129">105</link>). More recently, some reports pointed out that maternal treatment could be associated with decreased sensitivity of diagnostic tests in the newborn. In 25 sera of U.S. newborns from treated mothers, the sensitivity of the IgM ISAGA and IgA ELISA was only 44% and 60%, respectively (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0157">133</link>), as observed in other European reports from treated cohorts (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0158">134</link>). This impact of prenatal treatment, whatever it is (spiramycin or pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine), has been recently confirmed in a larger multivariate analysis comparing prenatally treated and untreated cases (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0159">135</link>). Therefore, the lack of specific IgM or IgA detection in a neonate cannot not rule out congenital toxoplasmosis.</para>

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0149">When maternal infection is not suspected during pregnancy (which is usually the case in the absence of ultrasound signs and no serologic follow-up), amniotic fluid during delivery and placenta are usually discarded at delivery. However, in the case of ultrasound abnormalities, they should be kept for analysis, as<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis> DNA can be detected in about 70% in one or the other when the fetus has been infected (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0160">136</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0161">137</link>). PCR on the neonate’s blood can also contribute to diagnosis in about 30% of cases (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0159">135</link>). When transfontanellar ultrasound shows the presence of ventricular dilatations or intracerebral calcifications, CSF can be analyzed for cells, glucose, protein, total IgG and <emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis>-specific IgG, and <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> DNA by PCR. PCR in CSF was positive in 46% of 58 symptomatic infected infants born to untreated mothers (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0162">138</link>). The calculation of the ratio: (anti-<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis>-specific antibody in CSF/<emphasis>Toxoplasma</emphasis>-specific antibody in serum) × (IgG concentration in serum/IgG concentration in CSF) can mean a significant antibody production in the intrathecal compartment when ≥4 in favor of TE, but lacks specificity (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0163">139</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0152">In AIDS patients, toxoplasmosis is often the result of cyst reactivation, and thus a positive serology easily confirms the risk and should prompt further investigation (CSF puncture, BAL) to document acute toxoplasmosis by searching for the parasite. A negative serology usually rules out diagnosis, as IgM at least should be detected if clinical signs were due to primary infection. Serological diagnosis can be more challenging in patients with deep immune cell suppression (allo-HSCT or SOT patients within the first 6 months of transplantation), as antibody synthesis can be delayed for several months following acute infection, or absent altogether. In the absence of serologic evidence of acute infection (IgM detection, low IgG avidity), diagnosis relies on tissue biopsy and demonstration of replicating parasites by histologic or cytologic examination, or, more efficiently, by detection of<emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> DNA by PCR in various samples (peripheral blood, CSF, BAL, AH, biopsies) guided by imaging and clinical signs. Most clinical studies assessing the diagnostic performances of PCR in immunocompromised patients focused on HIV-infected patients, reporting sensitivities from 35 to 72% and from 15 to 80% in CSF and blood, respectively (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0138">114</link>). Due to this low negative predictive value, a negative PCR result cannot rule out the diagnosis of TE, but the positive predictive value is assumed to be 100% when performed by a reference lab. The use of qPCR methods has not significantly improved the sensitivity of TE, as shown in a study conducted in French Guiana where only 25% of patients with TE had a positive PCR on blood samples (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0165">141</link>). Sensitivity on CSF could be higher when cellularity is ≥4 nucleated cells/μl and in patients with multiple brain lesions (≥4) detected with magnetic resonance imaging (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0166">142</link>). Importantly, curative treatment decreases PCR sensitivity in CSF as soon as 1 week after starting (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0167">143</link>), and thus it is important to sample before treatment onset. In disseminated and pulmonary toxoplasmosis, PCR sensitivity has not been evaluated but is assumed to be high because of uncontrolled parasite multiplication. In a recent European study, PCR provided the diagnosis in 9/10 pulmonary cases compared to only 1/10 for microscopy (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0069">45</link>).</para>

Negative IgG/IgM antibody rules out ocular toxoplasmosis if the person is immunocompetent. Patients with active retinochoroiditis as a result of acute infection have both detectable IgM and IgG antibodies and low IgG avidity, while IgG+/IgM– results can be observed in patients with recurrent retinochoroiditis, whether congenital or not. When typical eye lesions are observed (old pigmented scars at ocular fundus examination), a sole positive serology confirms the diagnosis. Otherwise, AH or vitreal fluid sampling is needed for further documentation. The demonstration of the local production of antibody and the detection of parasite DNA in AH are useful to document active ocular toxoplasmosis. Western blot comparison of AH and serum IgG or IgA profiles requires small sample volumes and contributes efficiently to diagnosis, particularly in immunocompetent subjects (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0130">106</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0138">114</link>). The Goldman-Witmer coefficient can add a gain in sensitivity when combined with other techniques, but is sample-consuming, and the amount of AH sample is often a limiting factor, in favor of PCR and WB.

      <para id="ch0165s000000p0171">Currently recommended drugs work primarily against the actively dividing tachyzoite form of<emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> and do not eradicate encysted organisms (bradyzoites). Treatment regimens rely on a combination of antibiotics.</para>
      <para id="ch0165s000000p0172">The most common drug combinations used consist of PYR and SDZ or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the latter being most used in African countries. Both associations have shown comparable efficacy for the treatment of cerebral toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0174">150</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0175">151</link>). Pyrimethamine and trimethoprim inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, which is important in the synthesis of folic acid, and sulfonamides inhibit synthesis of dihydrofolic acid, both pathways important in DNA synthesis. Thus the two drugs work synergistically against <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis>, but may also inhibit DNA synthesis in tissues with a high replication activity such as bone marrow and epithelium. This adverse effect can be bypassed by giving folinic acid in the form of leucovorin calcium to protect progenitor cells.</para>
      <para id="ch0165s000000p0173">Due to toxicity in early pregnancy, PYR-SDZ therapy is not recommended for use in pregnant women at &lt;18 weeks of gestation. After the 18th week, PYR-SDZ may be given if fetal infection is confirmed by amniocentesis. Spiramycin (available through the Food and Drug Administration for U. S. citizens) is recommended for pregnant women with acute toxoplasmosis when fetal infection has not been confirmed (<anchor id="ch0165s000000a0107"/><link linkend="ch0165s000000a0108">Table 8</link>), in an attempt to prevent transmission of <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> from the mother to the fetus (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0176">152</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0177">153</link>). Both treatments are continued until delivery. Several retrospective cohort studies have provided conflicting results regarding efficacy of maternal treatment, but suffered from various biases (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0178">154</link>). All in all, what should be remembered from these studies is that the treatment, whatever it is (spiramycin or PYR-SDZ), begun within 3 to 4 weeks after seroconversion, reduces mother-to-child transmission compared to a treatment started after &gt;8 weeks (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0177">153</link>). Maternal treatment also improves fetal prognosis, reducing the risk of serious neurologic sequelae and intracranial damage, if given within the first 4 weeks after maternal infection (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0076">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0179">155</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0180">156</link>). A French cohort study comparing transmission rates and severity of disease in infants before and after implementation of systematic maternal screening and treatment found a significant decrease of disease burden in the era of systematic screening and treatment of mothers (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0181">157</link>). Randomized prospective studies of treatment versus no treatment during acute infection in pregnant women have not been performed because of obvious ethical concerns, but a clinical trial comparing spiramycin and PYR-SDZ showed that materno-fetal transmission was lower in the PYR-SDZ group (18.5% [12/65]) compared to the spiramycin group (30% [18/60]) (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0182">158</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0165s000000p0174">PYR-SDZ (plus leucovorin) is the drug regimen generally used to treat infants with congenital toxoplasmosis and has led to improved outcomes compared with historic controls (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0066">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0107">83</link>). A 1-year course is usually recommended, with the dose regimen adapted according to disease severity (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0075">51</link>) (<link linkend="ch0165s000000a0108">Table 8</link>). Given the risk of hematologic toxicity with PYR, blood cell counts should be closely monitored (e.g., every other week) so that treatment can be halted if neutrophil or platelet counts drop below 750/μl and 50,000/μl, respectively, until restoration (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0183">159</link>). Early treatment is equally important in asymptomatic and subclinical newborns, as it reduces the onset of clinical manifestations (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0184">160</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0185">161</link>), and in symptomatic children, where it is expected to ease the symptoms and to reduce long-term sequelae (cerebral calcifications, eye lesions, and even hydrocephalus) (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0186">162</link>). Therapeutic regimens for the treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis have recently been developed (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0075">51</link>). Clinicians can seek advice from the Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago (Chicago, IL), regarding the treatment of infected children.</para>

TMP-SMX is also suitable, but is reserved for chemoprophylaxis in high-income countries, to avoid using the same drugs for preventive and curative treatments, as the long-term use of chemoprophylaxis can lead to the development of mutations in the target genes. Clindamycin is a second alternative for use in combination with pyrimethamine and leucovorin in those who cannot tolerate sulfonamides (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0174">150</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0175">151</link>). Atovaquone in combination with either pyrimethamine or sulfadiazine has sufficient activity to be considered for treatment in case of intolerance to one or the other, but serum levels should be monitored, as it is available only by oral route (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0187">163</link>). The role of other drugs in the treatment of systemic toxoplasmosis has not been defined by controlled trials. In general, alternative drugs such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, and dapsone should be used in combination with another drug, preferably pyrimethamine (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0188">164</link>). Azithromycin and pyrimethamine should be reserved for ocular toxoplasmosis. Refer to recent reviews for further details (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0174">150</link>, <link linkend="ch0165s000000li0175">151</link>).</para>

Although kidney and liver transplant recipients are less prone to reactivation, TMP-SMX is also recommended during the first 3 months following transplantation or if immunosuppressive drugs are increased, all the more because it protects against <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> pneumonia, which is far more frequent than toxoplasmosis.</para>
      <para id="ch0165s000000p0180">Seropositive patients receiving HSC from a seronegative patient are the most at risk for severe reactivation, as they harbor cysts but do not benefit from the T-cell memory repertoire from the donor. Thus, TMP-SMX chemoprophylaxis is essential and is given for 6 to 12 months or until CD4+ T-cell counts are over 200/μl. It should be noted that breakthrough of prophylaxis has been observed when atovaquone was used alone (<link linkend="ch0165s000000li0191">167</link>). This latter study also reported that 56% of reactivation cases occurred before day 30 of transplantation, of which the vast majority had not received TMP-SMX because of myelotoxicity concern. A change in practices, starting TMP-SMX at day 1 of transplantation, led to a dramatic decrease of the incidence of reactivation (1.5% versus 11.6%). Overall, TMP-SMX should be started as soon as possible to prevent toxoplasmosis efficiently.</para>
