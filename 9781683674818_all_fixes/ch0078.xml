A list of validated <emphasis>Leptospira</emphasis> spp. can be found at <ulink url="https://www.bacterio.net/genus/leptospira">https://www.bacterio.net/genus/leptospira</ulink>.

Neither serogroup nor serovar reliably predicts the species of <emphasis>Leptospira.</emphasis> Moreover, genetic heterogeneity resulting from horizontal transfer of genes coding for cell surface antigens occurs within serovars (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0012">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0013">13</link>), resulting in strains of some serovars being classified in multiple species, most notably the two genotypes of serovar Hardjo (<emphasis>L. interrogans</emphasis> serovar Hardjo subtype Hardjoprajitno and <emphasis>L. borgpetersenii</emphasis> serovar Hardjo subtype Hardjobovis) (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0015">15</link>).

      <para id="ch0078s000000p0004">Classification of leptospires requires the identification of both species and serovar of each isolate. Identification of<emphasis>Leptospira</emphasis> species is readily accomplished by sequencing of conserved housekeeping genes (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0017">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0018">18</link>), by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0019">19</link>), or by using average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0020">20</link>). Phylogenetic analysis of <emphasis>rrs</emphasis> (16S rRNA) and <emphasis>ppk</emphasis> (polyphosphate kinase) gene sequences demonstrates the two clades of leptospires, designated pathogens (P) and saprophytes (S), each containing two subclades (P1 and P2, S1 and S2) (<anchor id="ch0078s000000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0078s000000a0010">Fig. 1</link>). Genomes of several hundred strains of <emphasis>Leptospira</emphasis> have been sequenced, starting with representative reference strains (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0018">18</link>), providing valuable information that can be used for taxonomy, including species identification (<anchor id="ch0078s000000a0006"/><link linkend="ch0078s000000a0014">Fig. 2</link>). Already there are nearly 1,000 whole-genome assemblies for the genus <emphasis>Leptospira</emphasis> in the NCBI database, reflecting increased use of whole-genome sequencing. As molecular technologies and bioinformatics allow more powerful and complete analyses, classification schemes for <emphasis>Leptospira</emphasis> spp. may move away from traditional serovar classification and instead rely on typing schemes based on genomic sequencing (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0021">21</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0078s000000p0007">Leptospires are ubiquitous, either free-living in water or wet soil, or associated with renal colonization of mammals. Leptospirosis is presumed to be the most widespread zoonosis in the world (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0023">23</link>) and is estimated to cause more than a million cases per year globally (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0024">24</link>). The source of infection in humans is usually either direct or indirect contact with the urine of an infected animal. The incidence is much higher in warm-climate countries than in temperate regions, due mainly to longer survival of leptospires in the environment under warm, humid conditions. Leptospirosis is seasonal. Peak incidence occurs in summer or fall in temperate regions, where temperature is the limiting factor in survival of leptospires, and during rainy seasons in warm climate regions, where rapid desiccation would otherwise prevent survival.</para>
        <para id="ch0078s000000p0008">Animals, including humans, can be categorized as maintenance hosts or accidental (incidental) hosts. A maintenance host is defined as a species in which infection is endemic, usually transferred from animal to animal by direct contact. Infection is usually acquired at an early age, and the prevalence of chronic excretion in the urine increases with the age of the animal. Other mammals (such as humans) may become incidental hosts when they are infected by direct or indirect contact with the maintenance host. Animals may be maintenance hosts of some serovars but incidental hosts of others, infection with which may cause severe or fatal disease. The most important maintenance hosts are small mammals, which may transfer infection to domestic farm animals, dogs, and humans. Different rodent species may be reservoirs of distinct serovars, but rats are generally maintenance hosts for serovars of the serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae, as are mice for serogroup Ballum serovars. Domestic animals are also maintenance hosts; dairy cattle may harbor serovars Hardjo and Pomona, pigs Pomona, Tarassovi, or Bratislava, and dogs Canicola. Distinct variations in maintenance hosts and the serovars they carry occur throughout the world, and these associations may change over time.</para>
        <para id="ch0078s000000p0009">Knowledge of the prevalent serovars and their maintenance hosts is essential for understanding the epidemiology of the disease. For example, the incidence of canine leptospirosis has increased in the northeastern regions of North America over the last 20 years. Serology and molecular characterization suggest that it is caused largely by serovar Grippotyphosa (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0025">25</link>–<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0027">27</link>). Epidemiological evidence implicates raccoons (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0028">28</link>) and possibly skunks as the reservoir. Cases are clustered particularly in newly suburbanized areas (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0026">26</link>). This change in epidemiology has led to the inclusion of serovars Grippotyphosa and Pomona in canine vaccines (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0029">29</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0078s000000p0010">Human infections may be acquired through occupational, recreational, or avocational exposures. Occupation remains a significant risk factor for humans. Direct contact with infected animals accounts for most infections in farmers, veterinarians, abattoir workers, rodent control workers, and others whose occupations require contact with animals, while indirect contact is important for sewer workers, miners, soldiers, septic tank cleaners, fish farmers, rice field workers, and sugar cane cutters. Livestock farming is a major occupational risk factor throughout the world. There is a significant risk associated with recreational exposures occurring in water sports (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0030">30</link>). The increasing popularity of adventure sports and ecotourism has led to an increase in leptospirosis in travelers (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0032">32</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0078s000000p0011">The usual portal of entry is through abrasions or cuts in the skin, or via the mucous membranes. The great majority of infections are either subclinical or of very mild severity, and patients will probably not seek medical attention. The clinical presentation of leptospirosis is biphasic, with a septicemic phase lasting about a week, followed by the immune phase, characterized by antibody production and excretion of leptospires in the urine. Most of the complications of leptospirosis are associated with localization of leptospires within the tissues during the immune phase and thus occur during the second week of the illness.</para>
        <para id="ch0078s000000p0012">The overwhelming majority of recognized cases present with a febrile illness of sudden onset, the symptoms of which include chills, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, and conjunctival suffusion. Aseptic meningitis may be found in up to 25% of all leptospirosis cases. Between 5 and 10% of all patients with leptospirosis have the icteric form of the disease (Weil’s disease), in which patients may develop jaundice, acute renal failure, and sometimes pulmonary hemorrhage or cardiac arrhythmias. Severe cases often present late in the course of the disease, and this contributes to the high mortality rate, which ranges between 5 and 15%. Although rare, some patients present with hemoptysis and pulmonary symptoms (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0033">33</link>), which may progress very rapidly to severe pulmonary hemorrhagic syndrome (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0034">34</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0078s000000p0027">Leptospirosis is commonly diagnosed by serology. Antibodies are detectable in the blood approximately 5 to 7 days after the onset of symptoms. The definitive serologic investigation of leptospirosis remains the MAT, in which patients’ sera are reacted with live antigen suspensions of leptospiral serovars. After incubation, the serum-antigen mixtures are examined microscopically for agglutination, and the titers are determined. The MAT is a complex test to control, perform, and interpret (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0082">82</link>), and its use is limited to regional or national reference laboratories. Protocols for performing the MAT have been described in detail (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0083">83</link>). An international proficiency testing scheme under the auspices of the International Leptospirosis Society has stimulated improvement in the performance of the MAT by participating laboratories (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0084">84</link>). The range of antigens used should include serovars representative of all serogroups (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0082">82</link>). The wide range of antigens is used to detect infections with uncommon, or previously undetected, serovars. The test is read by dark-field microscopy. The end point is the highest dilution of serum in which 50% agglutination occurs and is determined by the presence of approximately 50% free, unagglutinated leptospires by comparison with the control suspension (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0040">40</link>). Considerable effort is required to reduce the subjective effect of observer variation, even within laboratories.</para>
        <para id="ch0078s000000p0028">Interpretation of the MAT is complicated by the high degree of cross-reaction that occurs between different serogroups, especially in acute-phase samples. Paradoxical reactions, in which the highest titers detected are antibodies to a serogroup unrelated to the infecting one, are also common (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0011">11</link>). The broad cross-reactivity in the acute phase, followed by relative serogroup specificity in convalescent-phase samples, results from the detection in the MAT of both IgM and IgG antibodies and the presence of several common antigens among leptospires (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0085">85</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0078s000000p0029">Paired sera are required to confirm a serologic diagnosis with certainty. A 4-fold or greater rise in titer between paired sera confirms the diagnosis, regardless of the interval between samples. The interval between first and second samples depends very much on the delay between onset of symptoms and presentation of the patient. If symptoms typical of leptospirosis are present, an interval of 3 to 5 days may be adequate to detect rising titers. However, if the patient presents earlier in the course of the disease, or if the date of onset is not known precisely, then an interval of 10 to 14 days between samples is more appropriate. Less often, seroconversion does not occur with such rapidity, and a longer interval between samples (or repeated sampling) is necessary. MAT serology is insensitive, particularly in early acute-phase specimens (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0087">87</link>). Moreover, patients with fulminant leptospirosis may die before seroconversion occurs (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0087">87</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0088">88</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0078s000000p0030">A presumptive diagnosis can be made by detection of a single elevated titer in association with an acute febrile illness. The magnitude of such a titer is dependent upon the background level of exposure in the population, and hence the seroprevalence.</para>
        <para id="ch0078s000000p0031">Titers following acute infection may be extremely high (≥25,600) and may take months, or even years, to fall to low levels (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0089">89</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0090">90</link>). Thus, in a high-incidence population, a low cutoff titer for presumptive diagnosis is inappropriate and will generate many false-positive diagnoses (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0091">91</link>). In areas where the disease is endemic, a single titer of ≥800 in symptomatic patients is generally indicative of leptospirosis, but cutoff titers as high as ≥1,600 have been recommended (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0083">83</link>). Rarely, seroconversion may be delayed for many weeks after recovery, and longer serological follow-up will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.</para>
        <para id="ch0078s000000p0032">Formalin-treated antigens have been used in the MAT to overcome some of the difficulties associated with the use of live antigens. Titers obtained with these antigens are somewhat lower, and more cross-reactions are detected (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0040">40</link>). These antigens are not available commercially but may be obtained from WHO Collaborating Centers.</para>
        <para id="ch0078s000000p0033">The MAT is the most appropriate test to employ in epidemiological serosurveys, because it can be applied to sera from any animal species and because the range of antigens utilized can be expanded or decreased as required. It is usual to use a titer of ≥100 as evidence of past exposure (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0082">82</link>). Contrary to a widely held belief, the MAT is a serogroup-specific assay. However, conclusions about infecting serovars cannot be drawn without isolates; at best, the MAT data can give a general impression of which serogroups are present within a population (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0092">92</link>–<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0094">94</link>).</para>

Traditional methods based upon agglutination have largely been superseded by IgM detection assays. IgM antibodies become detectable during the first week of illness, allowing the diagnosis to be confirmed and treatment to be initiated while it is likely to be most effective. IgM detection has repeatedly been shown to be more sensitive than MAT when the first specimen is taken early in the acute phase of the illness (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0087">87</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0095">95</link>, <link linkend="ch0078s000000li0096">96</link>), although ideally rapid tests have the highest sensitivity after 10 days of symptoms (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0097">97</link>). IgM dipstick assays have been shown to be as sensitive as microtiter plate IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0098">98</link>–<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0100">100</link>).

Positive rapid IgM results from patients in areas where leptospirosis is endemic should be interpreted with caution due to antibodies that circulate months to years following exposure or infection with leptospirosis (<link linkend="ch0078s000000li0091">91</link>). Ideally, rapid tests should be confirmed with MAT using paired serum samples to demonstrate a rise in titer to distinguish a new infection from a prior exposure in areas of endemicity.</para>

In populations and/or regions where leptospirosis is not endemic, MAT titers of ≥200 in a single specimen obtained after the onset of symptoms are suggestive but not diagnostic of acute or recent leptospirosis. A titer of ≥800 in the presence of compatible symptoms is strong evidence of recent or current leptospirosis. Delayed seroconversions are common.
