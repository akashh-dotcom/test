        <para id="ch0045s000000p0001">The word “actinomycete” is derived from two Greek roots (<emphasis>actino</emphasis>- and -<emphasis>mycete</emphasis>) meaning “ray” (and hence also “rod”) and “fungus,” respectively. The anaerobic organisms now in the genus <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> and the aerobic organisms grouped together as the “aerobic actinomycetes” were previously presumed to be related to one another on the basis of shared features of microscopic and colonial morphology. The aerobic actinomycetes, a group for which no agreed-upon operational definition currently exists, are now known to be an evolutionarily heterogeneous assemblage of genera. At some stage, they all form Gram-positive rods, and most of the more commonly isolated species exhibit at least rudimentary branching under certain growth conditions. All genera grow better under aerobic than anaerobic conditions (except for the newly described genus <emphasis>Lawsonella</emphasis>), a feature distinguishing them from most organisms in the genus <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis>. Because <emphasis>Lawsonella</emphasis> displays many other traits demonstrated by other members of the aerobic actinomycetes, including being partially acid-fast, this species will be included in the discussions in this chapter. <anchor id="ch0045s000000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0045s000000a0005">Figure 1</link> shows the current classification of most of the genera included in this chapter according to the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN; <ulink url="http://www.bacterio.net/">http://www.bacterio.net/</ulink>).</para>
        <para id="ch0045s000000p0002">The organisms that contain mycolic acids in their cell walls (included in the genera<emphasis>Dietzia, Gordonia, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Segniliparus, Tsukamurella</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Williamsia</emphasis>) are closely related on the basis of molecular genetic studies (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0045s000000li0002">2</link>); these mycolic-acid-containing genera appear phylogenetically more closely related to the genera <emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> (both of which are sometimes considered aerobic actinomycetes) than to the other non-mycolic-acid-containing genera usually also included with the aerobic actinomycetes. According to a recent classification scheme, these seven genera of actinomycetes, along with the genera <emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis>, are classified together in the order <emphasis>Mycobacteriales</emphasis> (LPSN). Note in <link linkend="ch0045s000000a0005">Fig. 1</link> that the genera in the order <emphasis>Mycobacteriales</emphasis> are at least weakly acid fast, with the exception of <emphasis>Williamsia</emphasis> and possibly <emphasis>Dietzia</emphasis>.</para>
        <para id="ch0045s000000p0003">The number of recognized pathogenic species of aerobic actinomycetes has been rising rapidly. However, this chapter deals only with genera containing species of documented clinical significance. Unfortunately, the increasingly fine discrimination of species has made it difficult to delineate important species-specific differences in geographic distributions, pathogenic and other biological mechanisms, disease associations, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. This enormous proliferation of distinct species for which association with human disease has been claimed presents several problems for the clinical microbiologist. First, phenotypic testing has been rendered virtually useless for accurate discrimination among species. Particularly for the aerobic actinomycetes, the number of phenotypic (biochemical) tests available in clinical laboratories (and in most research laboratories) is far too small for accurate differentiation among so many species, and often, information on the percent positivity for a specific reaction in a given species is not known. Furthermore, precisely the same biochemical testing format has generally not been employed with isolates of all the species, making the usefulness of multistudy comparisons uncertain. Second, some types of testing, such as analysis of cell wall constituents and of whole-cell sugars, are available in only a few research settings and are rarely of use for species-level identification. Some general information regarding these features is provided herein, but the references should be consulted for performance procedures and additional details. Third, gene sequencing is currently adequately discriminatory, reproducible, and sufficiently available to be useful for precise species identifications in many clinical laboratories. Fourth, while the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) allows the discrimination of certain species, this procedure is adequately sensitive only if the associated database has been adequately validated. Fifth, because of the growing problems with accurate species determinations, the clinical literature is rife with erroneous identifications; nowhere is this problem more apparent than with organisms in the genus<emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis>. Additionally, because some species have been described on the basis of only a single isolate, and for others only a few reports exist, little if any meaningful clinical information can be associated with many species names. Thus, when molecular methods are not available, precise identification of isolates may be impossible and, given the current state of our knowledge, is frequently not of immediate clinical utility.</para>

        <para id="ch0045s000000p0004">There are a few terminology issues that, while they pertain to all bacteria, seem to cause confusion particularly frequently with regard to the aerobic actinomycetes. First, for every bacterial species, there is only one “type strain,” the strain on which the original description of the species was based. Other strains contained in culture collections that are thought to belong to the same species as a given type strain can be referred to as “reference strains,” but they are not type strains. Second, the term “<emphasis>sensu stricto</emphasis>” means “in the strict sense.” This term, when used with a species name, should be restricted to mean organisms belonging to that particular species as determined by the best available methods. So, to refer to isolates that are “<emphasis>Nocardia asteroides sensu stricto</emphasis>” should mean isolates that by gene sequencing are identical to the type strain of <emphasis>N</emphasis>. <emphasis>asteroides</emphasis> (ATCC 19247).</para>

      <para id="ch0045s000000p0016">A brief account of the nomenclatural history of the designation “<emphasis>Nocardia asteroides</emphasis>” is necessary to clarify a confusing and widely unappreciated taxonomic issue. In 1888, Edmond Nocard obtained an isolate of an organism thought to be the causative agent of bovine farcy, a chronic suppurative skin and lymphatic infection of cattle. This organism was given the name <emphasis>Nocardia farcinica</emphasis> by Trevisan in 1889, and thereupon it became the type strain for both the genus and species.

      <para id="ch0045s000000p0041">Recent reports suggest an increasing frequency of isolation of<emphasis>Gordonia</emphasis> species; these reports also list an increasing number of species implicated in human infection. However, an unknown number of <emphasis>Gordonia</emphasis> infections may be missed, either because the isolate is considered an insignificant coryneform Gram-positive rod or because the isolate is misidentified by biochemical methods as belonging to another genus, such as <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> or <emphasis>Rhodococcus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0054">54</link>). The range of infections caused by <emphasis>Gordonia</emphasis> species includes primary bacteremia and respiratory, cutaneous, and central nervous system infections (see <link linkend="ch0045s000000a0079">Table 2</link>).

The brain is one of the most common secondary sites of infection (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0061">61</link>).

In addition, a few cases of catheter-related <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> infections have been reported, but the precise species involved has not always been unambiguously identified (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0063">63</link>).

      <para id="ch0045s000000p0046">In 1988 a breakthrough in the clinically useful categorization of pathogenic<emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> isolates was provided by Wallace and his coworkers (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0041">41</link>). They divided organisms phenotypically resembling <emphasis>N. asteroides</emphasis> into six drug pattern types and one additional miscellaneous group. With more recent molecular characterizations, numerous species have been described within this set of organisms, which came to be known as the <emphasis>N. asteroides</emphasis> complex. These include <emphasis>Nocardia abscessus</emphasis> (drug pattern I), <emphasis>Nocardia nova</emphasis> (drug pattern III), <emphasis>Nocardia wallacei</emphasis> (drug pattern IV), <emphasis>Nocardia farcinica</emphasis> (drug pattern V), <emphasis>Nocardia cyriacigeorgica</emphasis> (drug pattern VI), and other isolates comprising drug pattern II.

      <para id="ch0045s000000p0047">Given the current state of the literature, it is possible to make only the most tentative statements regarding geographic distribution and disease correlates of different species. While accurate species assignment allows one to make some predictions regarding likely antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, such a species assignment today requires the use of molecular methods (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0061">61</link>). Of the more than 100 species of <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> currently recognized, almost one-half have been reported as human isolates, and several others have been reported as pathogens of animals. Importantly, isolates in many reports of infection, even in the recent literature, are incorrectly identified because of failure to use optimal identification methods.</para>

The organism probably occurs worldwide; there are reports of infection from Australia (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0075">75</link>), West Bengal (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0076">76</link>), and Europe (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0077">77</link>) and many reports from North America (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0078">78</link>). A variety of cutaneous manifestations in addition to mycetoma, including cellulitis, abscesses, and lymphocutaneous infection, have been reported. Nearly all cases are a result of trauma, including those caused by thorns (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0077">77</link>), cat scratch (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0079">79</link>), and insect bite (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0080">80</link>). Most of the trauma-related infections have occurred in immunocompetent individuals. Disseminated infection, usually originating from a pulmonary focus, has also been reported (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0078">78</link>); such infections are more likely to occur in immunocompromised patients (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0081">81</link>). Some cases, such as one of a brain abscess resulting from dissemination from a pulmonary focus (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0082">82</link>), occur in patients who appear to be immunocompetent. However, most of the cases of invasive disease, as well as some of the cases of cutaneous infection, attributed to <emphasis>N. brasiliensis</emphasis> (prior to 1995) almost certainly have been caused by <emphasis>Nocardia pseudobrasiliensis</emphasis> (see below).</para>

Isolates of this species were reported to constitute 13 of 96 (14%) clinical <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> isolates from Thailand (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0092">92</link>) and 13 of 86 (15%) such isolates from Belgium (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0088">88</link>). The 16S rRNA sequence of the type strain of this species (1,400 bp) was found to be identical to that of the reference strain of <emphasis>N. asteroides</emphasis> drug pattern type VI (ATCC 14759) (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0066">66</link>, <link linkend="ch0045s000000li0093">93</link>). DNA-DNA hybridization studies subsequently established that this drug pattern type VI reference strain and <emphasis>N. cyriacigeorgica</emphasis> belong to the same species (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0094">94</link>). In the original work describing the different <emphasis>N. asteroides</emphasis> drug pattern types, type VI strains were the most commonly isolated strains (35%) (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0041">41</link>). <emphasis>N. cyriacigeorgica</emphasis> is probably the most frequent human nocardial pathogen, at least in areas where actinomycotic mycetomas are relatively rare. While the species <emphasis>N. cyriacigeorgica</emphasis> has been designated an emerging pathogen (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0095">95</link>), it is actually a relatively common and long-recognized pathogen that has recently acquired a valid name. In fact, many isolates previously reported as <emphasis>N</emphasis>. <emphasis>asteroides</emphasis> almost certainly belong to this species.</para>

Quality control slides should be stained along with stains of colonies from cultures. With the modified acid-fast stain, the background should be blue; slides that have a pink background may be inadequately decolorized and should be repeated. The smear should be scanned for areas where individual bacterial cells can be seen. The acid-fast reaction of tightly packed clumps of organisms may not represent the true partially acid-fast nature of the cells; be wary of large clumps of cells which all appear to be acid-fast stain positive. Acid-fast cells will clearly be red; cells that stain purple or light pink may or may not be truly acid fast. A stain that shows an unambiguous positive acid-fast reaction may frequently show only a few clearly red cells, with a majority of blue cells. Frequently, only the beads appear acid-fast positive. If modified-acid-fast stain results are ambiguous, transfer of the organism to a lipid-rich medium, such as Lowenstein-Jensen medium or Middlebrook 7H11 agar (to increase the organism’s lipid content), and repeat staining may give a more clear-cut stain result.

Occasionally, coccoid forms of <emphasis>Streptomyces</emphasis> may appear to be partially acid fast; hyphae, however, are acid-fast negative. Because of the difficulties of interpretation of the modified acid-fast smear, results of this stain should be considered preliminary and must be used only in conjunction with results from other tests. In some cases, an isolate of a species that is considered to be modified-acid-fast stain positive may not give a positive stain reaction. If the microscopic and colonial morphology are consistent with an aerobic actinomycete, and if the isolate might be clinically significant, regardless of the acid-fast stain result, an attempt should be made to determine the identification of the isolate.</para>

The authors created sequence-based phylogenetic clusters using concatenated partial sequences of five genes—<emphasis>gyrB</emphasis>, the 16S rRNA gene, <emphasis>secA1, hsp65</emphasis>, and <emphasis>rpoB</emphasis>—in a study of 36 type and reference strains and 190 clinical isolates. The results showed that 71.3% of the clinical isolates clustered with type strains and were thus considered to be identified to the species level. The authors found that when sequences of individual genes were evaluated, the resulting identification differed from that obtained using MLSA. This was especially evident for sequences targeting <emphasis>hsp</emphasis>65 and <emphasis>rpoB</emphasis>. The authors noted that the sequences from multiple genes appeared to “buffer” the effect of discrepant alleles in the sequences of the individual genes.

If growth is adequate, the MICs should be read at this time (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0253">253</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0045s000000p0152">Sulfonamides remain the mainstay of treatment for many nocardial infections other than those involving the central nervous system. A sulfonamide is often used in combination with other antimicrobial agents because of the historical<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> susceptibility of <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> isolates to sulfonamides and because of a long history of the clinical effectiveness of these drugs if administered in adequate doses (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0254">254</link>, <link linkend="ch0045s000000li0255">255</link>). Several recent reports have indicated an increase in resistance to the sulfonamides among <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> spp. Ameen et al. reported that 8 of 19 patients in Mexico with actinomycetomas caused by <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> failed sulfonamide treatment; the authors proposed that sulfonamides should be used only for limited actinomycotic disease of comparatively short duration and only for those patients with actinomycetomas who are at low risk for visceral dissemination (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0256">256</link>). In 2010, Uhde et al. reported that 61% of <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> isolates submitted for susceptibility testing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1995 to 2004 were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, and 42% were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0257">257</link>). The authors stated that their results may not represent the resistance profile of all U.S. isolates, because only organisms recovered from patients with severe infections or from patients with treatment failures may have been submitted for testing. The authors also indicated that they did not receive information on any possible preinfection antibiotic prophylaxis or on clinical outcome. Larruskain et al. reported in 2011 that the majority of <emphasis>N. farcinica</emphasis> isolates from northern Spain were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0258">258</link>). In contrast, results from Taiwan indicate that only 2% of 138 <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> isolates tested over an 11-year period were sulfonamide resistant (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0259">259</link>). In response to the report from the CDC on sulfonamide resistance in the United States, Brown-Elliott et al. reported a retrospective analysis of 552 <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> isolates recovered and tested at six U.S. laboratories, among which only 2% were resistant to sulfonamides (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0260">260</link>). The authors proposed that reports of increased resistance may be related to the difficulties in interpretation of sulfonamide broth dilution tests, the lack of a recommended <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> species quality control organism, and the lack of proficiency testing programs to ensure accurate interpretation. There are limited data to indicate the <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> result of sulfonamide treatment in cases of <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> resistance. The multisite broth microdilution study published in 2012 noted a significant lack of reproducibility among testing sites for the sulfonamides (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0254">254</link>). Of a total of 1,681 replicate sulfonamide MIC results for five species (one isolate each of <emphasis>N. brasiliensis, N. cyriacigeorgica, N. farcinica, N. nova</emphasis>, and <emphasis>N</emphasis>. <emphasis>wallacei</emphasis> determined by previous testing to be susceptible to sulfonamides), 14.6% of results indicated resistance to sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Since criteria for inoculum preparation and assay performance were similar at all testing sites, the authors noted that the most likely explanation for this lack of reproducibility with these drugs is the difficulty of determining the endpoint, which is defined as the dilution that results in 80% inhibition compared to growth in the control well. Interestingly, only 1.7% of 296 concurrently run disk diffusion tests using the same isolates indicated resistance to sulfamethoxazole. The authors propose that when performing broth microdilution tests for sulfonamides, a disk diffusion test using Gantrisin (not trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) be performed for validation of the MIC result. The inoculated disk diffusion plate may also be useful for checking the inoculum concentration (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0254">254</link>). The CLSI document states that isolates showing a discrepancy between the broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests for sulfonamides should be retested or referred to a reference laboratory for testing (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0253">253</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0045s000000p0153">The 2012 multicenter study also highlighted additional difficulties that may be encountered in the setup and interpretation of broth microdilution tests for<emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0254">254</link>). Preparation of an adequate inoculum is an important concern; the clumping nature of <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> isolates often prevents the preparation of an adequately homogeneous inoculum suspension. The current CLSI document suggests the use of a “pellet pestle” to assist in creating a dense suspension with a minimum of organism clumps (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0253">253</link>). In addition, the use of a nephelometer to standardize the inoculum suspension is recommended to provide an appropriately dense inoculum (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0253">253</link>). However, even with careful inoculum preparation, resulting colony counts prepared using traditional spread plate techniques may not accurately represent the actual organism concentration in the inoculum (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0254">254</link>). The CLSI document recommends evaluation of a Mueller-Hinton plate inoculated as for a Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test to evaluate the adequacy of the inoculum (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0253">253</link>). Because endpoint determination for <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> spp. is more technically challenging than for other organisms, the multisite study report recommends that technical staff should become familiar with endpoint determinations as illustrated in the CLSI M24 guidelines, especially for the sulfonamides. Additional recommendations to improve susceptibility testing results include thorough training of technical staff in inoculum and panel preparation, comparison of results with expected results for a particular species (as noted in the current CLSI document), the testing of an appropriate quality control strain (<emphasis>N. nova</emphasis> ATCC BAA-2227 was recommended [254]), and participation in proficiency testing with another laboratory. The multisite study also recommends referral of any isolate to a reference laboratory if the susceptibility pattern obtained is different from the expected result for that organism (<link linkend="ch0045s000000li0254">254</link>).</para>

Therefore, particularly when an aerobic actinomycete is isolated in culture in small amounts without having been visualized in the direct patient specimen, it may be impossible for the laboratory to determine if the isolate is the result of specimen or laboratory contamination, patient colonization, or actual infection. Some indication of the quantity of the organism present should be given for any isolate of an aerobic actinomycetes. Discussion between the clinical and laboratory staff is extremely useful for selection of additional patient specimens and laboratory procedures for determination of the clinical significance of an isolate from a given patient. (See the “Clinical Significance” section of this chapter for information on species known to cause human disease. Additionally, see<link linkend="ch0045s000000a0079">Tables 2</link> and <link linkend="ch0045s000000a0096">3</link> for information on the frequency of isolation of species known to be clinically significant.) Identification of an organism to the genus level may help determine its significance. However, even for accurate genus assignment, molecular methods may need to be employed. In some cases, genus-level identification (if possible) suffices.</para>
        <para id="ch0045s000000p0171">When an isolate is reported to the species level, the laboratory should be certain that clinicians are aware of the reliability of the identification method used. Reports should indicate how the isolate was identified. Precise identification can be achieved only by gene sequencing or proteomic analysis using an expanded database; if identification is obtained by other methods, the report should indicate that the identification is presumptive. Susceptibility results should be reported for isolates considered to be clinically significant. For accurate determination of both identification and susceptibility results, referral to a laboratory with expertise in working with these organisms may be necessary.</para>

For such searches, the LPSN and PubMed may be good starting points; care should be taken to consider current nomenclature and taxonomy as stated by the LPSN.
