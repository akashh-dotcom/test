Worms present in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, such as<emphasis>Anisakis</emphasis> or <emphasis>Capillaria</emphasis>, may be retrieved by endoscopy. Surgical resection specimens may contain a worm or larvae. The intact worm and surgical specimens may be preserved and transported in 60% ethanol or 10% neutral buffered formalin, with the former preferred for intact worms since formalin hardens the tissues of the worm. Stool is an important diagnostic specimen for parasites that reproduce within the intestinal tract, such as <emphasis>Capillaria philippinensis</emphasis>, and should be collected and fixed in a standard manner (e.g., formalin and polyvinyl alcohol), as described in <ulink url="ch0160#ch0160s0001">chapter 137</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis> Blood for serology should be handled in a standard manner.

        <para id="ch0174s0002s0004p0001">The clinical features are caused by either the physical presence/migration of the larvae, or an allergic response to the parasite. Most commonly, patients experience nonspecific, acute abdominal pain from the physical presence of the worm within 12 hours after eating infected fish; allergic reactions may occur within this same timeframe (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0009">9</link>).

The larvae are associated with the superficial aspects of the mucosa in the early stages of disease, and with mucosal trauma caused by larval migration and the tissue reaction to the helminth. Larvae at this stage may migrate up the esophagus and cause coughing, potentially with expectoration of the worm; infestation of the palatine tonsil has been described (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0012">12</link>). <emphasis>Anisakis</emphasis> has been incidentally discovered in the colon of an asymptomatic individual (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0010">10</link>). Severe symptoms manifest if the worm penetrates through the mucosa into the submucosal and deeper tissues (<anchor id="ch0174s0002s0004a0004"/><link linkend="ch0174s0002s0004a0006">Fig. 2</link>). This evokes leukocytosis and eosinophilia (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0013">13</link>). Sudden, intense abdominal pain may be mistaken for appendicitis, acute gastritis, gastric ulcer disease, or chronic colitis (e.g., Crohn’s disease) (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0014">14</link>).

        <para id="ch0174s0002s0005p0001">The intact worms, best visualized with a dissecting microscope, are white to cream, nonsegmented larvae that measure 10 to 50 mm by 0.3 to 1.2 mm. One dorsal and two subventral reduced lips and a triangular boring tooth are useful for identification. The mucron or tail spine is another useful feature for the identification of<emphasis>Anisakis</emphasis> larvae. Both the boring tooth and mucron are useful features, but in some specimens these may be difficult to identify, which should not deter assigning the identification of an anasakid nematode. Histopathologic analysis of infected tissues often demonstrates cross sections of the worm and the host inflammatory response, which contains numerous eosinophils. The presence of Y-shaped lateral chords is useful for confirming the specimen as an anasakid worm. Cross-sectional studies are useful for identifying the type of anisakid present, but the precise genus and species designation is not necessary for treatment. Molecular- and protein-based methods of detection and characterization have been described; these are most commonly used in the food industry and are usually unnecessary for the diagnosis of human infection (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0016">16</link>). Molecular characterization is useful for understanding species distributions, which provides insights for possible epidemiologic links. For example, molecular identification of anisakid larvae recovered by endoscopy from patients in South Korea identified all as <emphasis>Anisakis pegreffii</emphasis>, as were 90.7% of the larvae recovered from eels, supporting an epidemiologic association (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0017">17</link>).</para>

A variety of serologic assays have been developed, which vary in sensitivity and specificity. These identify 85 to 90% of infected individuals, with antibodies appearing from 10 to 35 days after infection. The specificity of these assays is limited predominantly because of cross-reactivity with other ascarids, which may limit the utility of these assays in certain populations (e.g., individuals with intestinal ascarids).</para>

        <para id="ch0174s0002s0007p0001">Removal of the larva via endoscopy, while it is associated only with the superficial mucosa, is the most efficacious treatment. Surgical resection, however, may be needed for more deeply insinuated larvae. Anthelmintic drugs do not appear to be useful, but corticosteroids may be used to decrease the associated inflammation (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0018">18</link>). The CDC suggests that treatment with albendazole (i.e., 400 mg p.o. [orally], b.i.d.

Porcine transmission, however, has decreased significantly in areas with good animal husbandry practices (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0021">21</link>).

Gastrointestinal symptoms, associated with adult worms, last only about a week and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Clinical findings include fever, facial edema that is particularly predominant around the eyes, ocular hyperemia with or without hemorrhage, headache, myalgia, and splinter hemorrhages under the nails (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0023">23</link>).

The seroprevalence of human disease reflects helminthic control in dogs and cats. The highest infection rates occur among the poor, and there is an association with dog and cat ownership (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0029">29</link>). Large surveys in the Netherlands associated with the evaluation of fecal specimens from 960 household dogs and 670 cats confirmed that younger animals were more likely to be infected, as were animals that were allowed to roam (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0031">31</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0174s0004s0003p0002">The natural cycle of<emphasis>Toxocara</emphasis> begins with the passage of unembryonated eggs in the feces of the definitive host (<anchor id="ch0174s0004s0003a0003"/><link linkend="ch0174s0004s0004a0003">Fig. 5</link>). An infected animal passes a large number of eggs per day; for instance, an infected puppy may pass more than 10,000 eggs per g of feces (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0032">32</link>). Therefore, one instance of stool contamination of the environment, such as in a sandbox, can cause significant contamination. The L2 (i.e., second-stage) larvae develop in the eggs after 10 to 20 days of incubation in the soil; the eggs at this stage are infective. If the eggs are ingested by a suitable definitive host, then the larvae penetrate the intestinal tract and migrate through the liver, bloodstream, and lungs. The larvae then migrate up the respiratory tract, are swallowed, and mature into adult worms in the intestinal tract. Paratenic hosts (e.g., rabbits) may also participate in the life cycle by harboring infective larvae after egg ingestion; ingestion of the paratenic host by the definitive host will allow the larvae to mature to adulthood. When the eggs are ingested by a nonpermissive host, such as a child, the resulting <emphasis>Toxocara</emphasis> larvae cannot complete their life cycle but rather wander aimlessly in the aberrant host, causing visceral larva migrans. Prevention is achieved foremost through zoonotic control by deworming dogs and cats. Deworming is most important for puppies, which are particularly permissive for infection and are often in close contact with children. Other preventive measures include avoidance of animal feces, thorough washing of fruits and vegetables, and thorough cooking of meats from potentially paratenic hosts (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0033">33</link>).</para>

The adult worms of <emphasis>Parastrongylus cantonensis</emphasis> reside in the pulmonary artery and the right side of the heart of the rodent, whereas the adults of <emphasis>P. costaricensis</emphasis> reside in arterioles in the ileum. Eggs released from the adult worms lodge in capillaries, where they hatch and release larvae. The larvae subsequently migrate up the trachea, are swallowed, and are passed in the feces. These larvae infect mollusks, particularly snails and slugs, which are the intermediate host. Within the snail, they mature into the infective L3 larvae. A number of animals, including shrimp, crabs, fish, and frogs, that eat the infected mollusks serve as important paratenic hosts. Rodents that ingest either the infected mollusk or tissues from the paratenic host become infected. In the definitive host, the infective larvae penetrate the intestine, become bloodborne, and migrate to the central nervous system, where they molt twice.

Although originally endemic only to North America, raccoons with this parasite have been exported worldwide as zoo animals, as fur-producing animals, or as pets, which is discouraged (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0071">71</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0174s0010s0003p0002">Young raccoons usually become infected through the direct ingestion of eggs, which are sometimes adherent to the fur of the mother raccoon (<anchor id="ch0174s0010s0003a0003"/><link linkend="ch0174s0010s0003a0004">Fig. 19</link>). Mature raccoons are more commonly infected through the ingestion of infected animals, such as woodchucks, rabbits, and rodents, which are paratenic hosts that develop larva migrans when infected (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0072">72</link>). Interestingly, if the paratenic host does not die of the larva migrans, the disease makes the animal more susceptible to opportunistic predation by raccoons. After ingestion, migration, and maturation, male and female worms develop in the small intestine of the raccoon and mate.</para>
        <para id="ch0174s0010s0003p0003">It has been estimated that the adult female produces between 115,000 and 179,000 eggs/worm/day (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0073">73</link>). An infected raccoon passes 20,000 to 26,000 eggs per g of feces (EGF), with extremes of more than 250,000 EGF recorded (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0073">73</link>). In addition to the high level of egg production, there is an enhanced risk of infection by <emphasis>B. procyonis</emphasis> compared with other <emphasis>Baylisascaris</emphasis> species because of the behavior of the raccoon host. Raccoons are known to defecate in specific locations, known as raccoon latrines, which results in the accumulation of a large quantity of fecal matter (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0073">73</link>). This creates a high-risk area for contracting infection. Sandboxes and garden plots are common locations for latrines, and are locations where young children may contract the infection. It is for this reason, as well as the use of sandboxes by cats, that sandboxes should be covered when not in use, if possible.</para>
        <para id="ch0174s0010s0003p0004">Transmission occurs through the ingestion of material contaminated with egg-containing raccoon feces.

For example, the ingestion of a plerocercoid larva of<emphasis>Dibothriocephalus latus</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Diphyllobothrium latum</emphasis>) by a human results in the development of an adult tapeworm, whereas the ingestion of a plerocercoid larva of a <emphasis>Spirometra</emphasis> species results in the continued existence of the larva (i.e., the sparganum) in the new host (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0081">81</link>). This is a situation wherein the human is behaving biologically like a second intermediate or paratenic host. The clinical features of disease are influenced by worm burden (most patients harbor only a single worm), worm location, and worm viability. Proliferative sparganosis can occur rarely with devastating, often fatal, outcomes (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0082">82</link>). Spargana migrate, but this migration usually does not cause symptoms. Migration to a subcutaneous location, however, may result in a nodule (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0044">44</link>). This nodule may be excised to exclude the possibility of malignancy. Ocular sparganosis, particularly involving the conjunctiva, may result following the application of a folk-medicine poultice that contains raw snake or frog tissues. Inflammation and calcification ensue after death of the sparganum; when these symptoms occur in the brain, they may cause obstructive hydrocephalus (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0058">58</link>). Subcutaneous spargana that become exposed through ulceration have been mistaken for <emphasis>Dracunculus</emphasis> in regions where this latter parasite is endemic (<link linkend="ch0174s0012s0009li0044">44</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0174s0012s0008p0001">There are a wide variety of less commonly encountered helminthic parasites, which may be nematodes, cestodes, or trematodes. The diseases caused by these parasites are interesting and demonstrate their highly evolved life cycles and the complex interactions with their hosts. Diseases produced range from subclinical to life threatening. In many instances, the disease occurs only in a particular geographic area which is largely determined by the biological ranges of the definitive and intermediate hosts. Dietary and folk-medicine customs are also important in the prevalence of human disease, as many of these are associated with the ingestion or application of raw animal products. The treatment of these parasites varies depending on the infectious agent, but common preventive measures may significantly diminish the transmission of many of these parasitic diseases. These measures include the zoonotic control of parasitic disease in animal hosts and the vectors of transmission, washing of fruits and vegetables, access to clean drinking water, and thorough cooking of meats before consumption.</para>
