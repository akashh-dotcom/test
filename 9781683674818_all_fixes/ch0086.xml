        <para id="ch0086s0000p0002"><emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> was first isolated in 1935 and called a rickettsia due to its intracellular replication, small size, presence in ticks, and staining characteristics. It is now known to be genetically quite distinct from the <emphasis>Rickettsiales</emphasis> and to have a number of unique features. Replicating <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> exists in a morphological form known as a large-cell variant (LCV). LCVs are typically rod shaped (0.4 to 1.5 by 0.2 to 0.5 μm) and metabolically active, and they divide by binary fission (<anchor id="ch0086s0000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0086s0000a0008">Fig. 1</link>). When conditions are not conducive to <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> replication, it will convert to the small-cell variant (SCV) (0.5 by 0.2 μm). This is an electron-dense form that is filterable (0.22 μm) and differentially expresses some unique proteins compared to LCVs. Although not considered spores, SCVs act as the survival and transmissible form of the bacterium when it is extracellular and in the environment. SCVs are resistant to heat, desiccation, and some disinfectants, but not to the same extent as typical bacterial spores (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0009">5</link>). The cell wall stains poorly by the Gram stain and better by the Gimenez stain.</para>
        <para id="ch0086s0000p0003">The complete genome sequences of Nine Mile and other strains of<emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> demonstrate a circular genome with approximately 2 million base pairs, including many insertion sequences; a single plasmid is found in most strains (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0010">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0086s0000li0011">7</link>). The presence of many pseudogenes implies a process of ongoing gene reduction, presumably associated with recent evolutionary adaptation to an intracellular lifestyle. Unlike the <emphasis>Rickettsiaceae, C. burnetii</emphasis> does not transport ATP across its cell membrane and has almost full biosynthetic capabilities. It requires a low extracellular pH (&lt;5.25) for growth and uses a type IV secretion system to transport effector proteins into host cells (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0012">8</link>). Extracellular <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> can show some metabolic activity, can utilize glucose and glutamate at low pH, and converts to LCVs and replicates axenically in a specialized medium (acidified citrate cysteine medium [ACCM]) placed in a low-oxygen environment (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0013">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0086s0000li0014">10</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0086s0000p0004">It was first noted in 1956 that<emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> can exist in two antigenic phases (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0015">11</link>). The form of <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> isolated from infected animals or humans is referred to as phase I, and this antigenic form is virulent. When phase I isolates are grown for an extended period in the laboratory in tissue culture or embryonated eggs, the population of bacteria can gradually change to a second form (phase II) and become avirulent. Antigenically, the most significant difference between the phases is that phase II <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> lacks full-length O-antigen polysaccharide side chains on lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This conversion to phase II can involve loss of genetic material such that the microbe cannot synthesize a full-length polysaccharide, but in some strains, loss of virulence does not seem to involve genomic changes (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0016">12</link>). The <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> change from virulent phase I to avirulent phase II is analogous to the smooth-to-rough transition that occurs in the <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0017">13</link>). The correlation of LPS truncation with loss of virulence has led to acceptance of the idea that phase I LPS is a key virulence determinant of <emphasis>C.</emphasis> <emphasis>burnetii</emphasis>.</para>

        <para id="ch0086s0000p0005">Transmission of<emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> to humans typically occurs by inhalation of the bacterium after it has been shed by animals. It is most commonly associated with cattle, sheep, and goats, where it replicates to high density in placentas. At parturition, when large amounts of <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> are present in the placenta, fetus, and associated membranes and fluids, the microbe readily contaminates the animal’s environment (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0018">14</link>). Smaller amounts of <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> can be shed in urine, feces, and milk. Once shed, <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> can remain viable in the SCV form in soil, hay, etc., for many years (possibly even for decades) (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0019">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0086s0000li0020">16</link>).

Although some human outbreaks in North America have been linked to parturition by cats and dogs (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0026">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0086s0000li0027">23</link>), the majority of Q fever cases are associated with livestock. <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> has been found in numerous tick species, which could be important for maintenance of the agent in veterinary populations, but the great bulk of human infections occur by aerosol transmission from an infected-animal focus, such as a herd of parturient goats. Infections in animals are typically asymptomatic, but abortions and stillbirths have been observed in pregnant, infected sheep and goats (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0018">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0086s0000li0028">24</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0086s0000p0007">Q fever is found worldwide and is most likely endemic in every country except New Zealand. Seroprevalence studies have found high rates of<emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> exposure in many countries. The highest rates of exposure have been found in subpopulations having frequent contact with livestock. In the United States, 22% of veterinarians are seropositive, compared to approximately 3% of the population overall (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0029">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0086s0000li0030">26</link>).

The largest known outbreak of Q fever occurred in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2010 and was associated with intensive dairy goat farming (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0033">29</link>), with airborne spread to nearby populations. Over 4,000 cases were recorded and more than 40,000 people were infected (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0034">30</link>). Nosocomial transmission, presumably by coughing with aerosol production, has been reported rarely (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0035">31</link>), as has infection of obstetric staff during delivery of an infected patient (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0036">32</link>). Without proper precautions, infection in the laboratory setting is possible, especially when <emphasis>Coxiella</emphasis> is cultured. Multiple outbreaks involving laboratory staff have been reported, with most cases occurring prior to 1976 (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0037">33</link>).

        <para id="ch0086s0000p0009">Several factors influence the epidemiology of human Q fever: the worldwide ubiquitous distribution of<emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis>, the extremely low infectious dose required for human infection (probably between 1 and 10 viable <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> cells) (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0039">35</link>), environmental conditions (such as high concentrations of infected animals, high animal pregnancy rates, and dry weather), and the strength and direction of prevailing winds (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0033">29</link>).

Within the macrophage, <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> traffics to an endosomal PV that is similar to a phagolysosome. The PV has the low pH found in typical phagolysosomes, but evidence suggests that <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> modifies the PV to enhance its own survival and replication (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0012">8</link>). Exposure to the acidic environment results in transition of the organisms from the SCV to the LCV form and activation of metabolism. <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> expresses a fully functional type IV secretion system which secretes effector proteins into the cytosol of the infected cell (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0042">38</link>). Over 100 <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> type IV secretion system effector proteins have been identified through genetic screens, but for most, the function remains undefined (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0043">39</link>). The PV enlarges by diverting the normal intracellular autophagy pathway and fusing with autophagosomes (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0044">40</link>). The <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> PV maintains many of the features of the phagolysosome, including low pH, the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1, and the protease cathepsin D. The type IV secretion system also secretes proteins that keep the host cell alive by inhibition of host cell apoptosis. Prevention of intrinsic apoptosis pathways in the host cell is thought to be important for prolonging <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> infections <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0045">41</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0086s0000p0011">Infection by<emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> triggers interleukin 1β production and formation of an intracellular inflammasome, but <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> appears to be able to block pyroptosis, which normally follows inflammasome formation (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0046">42</link>). <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> infection also triggers robust antibody and T-cell-mediated immune responses; both play a role in clearance of the bacteria (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0047">43</link>). It is likely that most infections are cleared in the absence of treatment with no or minimal clinical symptoms. A low percentage of infections persist and can result in chronic conditions, such as endocarditis, vascular infections, or bone and joint infections. The reasons that these infections persist are not clear. Animal studies have suggested that overproduction of the immune response inhibitor interleukin 10 could play a role, but a variety of host and pathogen factors are likely to be involved (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0048">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0086s0000li0049">45</link>). <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> commonly infects cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, but a variety of cells have been infected <emphasis>in vitro.</emphasis> It can grow to high density in trophoblasts of the placenta, resulting in high risk of transmission associated with exposure to infected human or animal placentas (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0018">14</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0086s0000p0012">Diagnosis of chronic Q fever requires identification of a focus of infection, which can often be difficult. Q fever endocarditis can be easily missed by routine echocardiography because of the small size or absence of vegetations. Many patients with chronic Q fever first present when severe complications have developed, such as valve dysfunction in endocarditis or a ruptured aneurysm in vascular chronic Q fever, with associated high mortality (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0050">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0086s0000li0051">47</link>). To prevent serious complications, it is important to diagnose and localize chronic Q fever in an early stage, so that appropriate treatment can be started as soon as possible.</para>
        <para id="ch0086s0000p0013">In endocarditis in general, diagnosis is based on the modified Duke criteria, with endocardial involvement on echocardiography as one of the major criteria (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0052">48</link>, <link linkend="ch0086s0000li0053">49</link>). However, in Q fever endocarditis, the diagnosis is usually more complex, and vegetations are rarely seen by echocardiography (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0054">50</link>), which is one of the main reasons that a high titer of phase I IgG has been added to the modified Duke criteria as a major criterion. In suspected chronic Q fever (positive nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT] in the absence of an acute Q fever infection or a phase I IgG titer of &gt;512 more than 3 months after the acute infection), transesophageal echocardiography should be performed when transthoracic echocardiography is normal and there is no evidence of noncardiac vascular chronic Q fever (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0055">51</link>).

Tissue samples are most commonly used for isolation, NAATs, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Whole blood should be collected in sodium citrate or EDTA tubes. Samples to be used for isolation should be collected aseptically and shipped promptly, with constant refrigeration. If prompt shipment is not possible (within 1 week), then samples should be kept frozen before and during shipment (to at least −20°C; −80°C is preferable). Blood or tissue samples to be tested by NAATs should ideally be frozen (−20°C) prior to and during shipment, but prompt shipment under refrigeration is also possible.

The primary serologic assays are the indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and complement fixation test (CFT) (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0069">65</link>), with IFA assay being the gold standard and most commonly used method. The use of a CFT for human diagnostics is currently uncommon due to poor sensitivity (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0069">65</link>). The diagnosis of infection by any serologic assay can be complicated by the facts that <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> has a worldwide distribution in nature and that many humans have been exposed and are seropositive. Most serologic methods make use of <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> antigen grown in either tissue culture cells or embryonated chicken eggs. Serologic methods also take advantage of the antigenic differences between naturally occurring virulent phase I <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> and attenuated phase II isolates (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0015">11</link>). Phase I strains contain intact LPS antigens, while phase II strains lack complete LPS antigens. The antibodies produced during natural human infection react in a unique time sequence to the phase I and phase II forms, with the acute response reacting primarily to phase II antigens, while the response in chronic infections is a mixture of phase I and phase II antibodies. The reason that the acute antibody response is primarily reactive with phase II antigens is poorly understood, as only phase I <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> can be isolated from infected animals and humans.</para>

Detection of<emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> in blood or tissue in the absence of an acute infection confirms the diagnosis, but blood NAATs are negative in the majority of patients (<link linkend="ch0086s0000li0050">46</link>), and tissue samples are often very difficult to obtain. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibodies become elevated, and IgG titers of &gt;512 in patients without risk factors for chronic disease and &gt;256 in patients with risk factors should lead to further diagnostic evaluation for a focus of chronic Q fever infection. Risk factors include an immunocompromised state or the presence of an aneurysm, vascular prosthesis, congenital heart disease, severe valve dysfunction, or a prosthetic heart valve.
