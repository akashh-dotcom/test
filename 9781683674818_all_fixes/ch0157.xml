      <para id="ch0157s0000p0002">The groups of antifungal agents licensed for the systemic treatment of invasive fungal infection currently include the polyene amphotericin B and its three lipid formulations; the azoles fluconazole, isavuconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole; the echinocandins anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin; the pyrimidine flucytosine; and the allylamine terbinafine (see<ulink url="ch0155#ch0155s0001">chapter 133</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). The activity of these agents is both agent and species specific, and the emergence of resistance during therapy and in the environment is an emerging problem in molds, yeasts, and dermatophytes (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0009">9</link>). In molds, the most worrying development has been the emergence of strains of <emphasis>Aspergillus fumigatus</emphasis> with cross-resistance to therapeutic triazole drugs due to environmental exposure to agricultural azoles (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0010">10</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0012">12</link>). In yeast, concerns have arisen regarding the emergence of fluconazole resistance in <emphasis>Candida (Nakaseomyces) glabrata</emphasis> and <emphasis>Candida parapsilosis</emphasis>, of echinocandin resistance particularly in <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis>, and the global emergence of <emphasis>Candida auris</emphasis>, a yeast that is almost universally fluconazole resistant and can readily develop resistance to other agents and that has caused large health care-related outbreaks in high-dependency units on five continents (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0013">13</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0016">16</link>). A more recent development has been the emergence of a new clade of <emphasis>Trichophyton mentagrophytes/interdigitale</emphasis> in India, now named as <emphasis>Trichophyton indotineae</emphasis> (see <ulink url="ch0148#ch0148s0001">chapter 127</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>), which causes recalcitrant tinea cruris infections and is highly resistant to terbinafine and often fluconazole (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0017">17</link>). However, terbinafine resistance is not limited to <emphasis>T. indotineae</emphasis> and India, as documented in recent European surveys (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0019">19</link>). As a result, clinical laboratories are now asked to assume a greater role in the selection and monitoring of antifungal chemotherapy. Thus, accurate and predictive antifungal susceptibility testing has become imperative and is now so widely accepted as a useful tool for informing decision-making during the management of patients with invasive fungal infections that recommendations for testing appear in management guidelines (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0021">21</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0157s0000p0003">In regard to investigational agents, a once-weekly-dosed echinocandin, rezafungin, and three first-in-class agents are in or have completed phase 3 clinical trials for various systemic fungal infections (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0022">22</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0024">24</link>). The first-in-class agents include: (i) ibrexafungerp, a triterpenoid glucan synthase inhibitor that has been licensed in the United States for oral treatment of complicated vaginal candidiasis and that is fungicidal against <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> and fungistatic against molds (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0025">25</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0028">28</link>); (ii) olorofim, an orotomide antifungal targeting the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme and interfering with pyrimidine synthesis with oral and intravenous formulations and active (with delayed cidality) against most molds except Mucorales (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0029">29</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0031">31</link>); and (iii) manogepix, a gepix antifungal and the active agent of fosmanogepix, which inhibits glycosylphosphatidylinositol acylation and thus interferes with mannoprotein trafficking, and is active (cidal) against <emphasis>Candida</emphasis>, except <emphasis>Candida krusei</emphasis> (<emphasis>Pichia kudriavzevii</emphasis>), and fungistatic against molds (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0032">32</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0034">34</link>). Information is beginning to appear regarding reference susceptibility testing with some of these agents (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0035">35</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0037">37</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0157s0000p0004">To be clinically useful, the requirements of<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> susceptibility tests are that they should (i) provide a reproducible and reliable indication of the activities of antifungal agents, (ii) provide results that correlate with <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> activity and therefore help to predict the likely outcome of therapy, (iii) provide a means with which to detect the development of resistance during therapy by applying clinical breakpoints, (iv) act as a surveillance tool for monitoring the development of resistance mechanisms among a normally susceptible wild-type population of organisms by adopting species-specific epidemiological cutoff values (ECOFFs/ECVs), and (v) have value as a screening tool to predict the therapeutic potential of newly discovered investigational agents. To provide this information, there must be a careful analysis of multicenter MIC data, the dosing practices and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of the drug, as well as MIC-outcome relationships.</para>
      <para id="ch0157s0000p0005">The accepted reference methods for MIC determination of antifungals published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing and by the Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are well established (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0038">38</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0043">43</link>). The CLSI subcommittee has developed reference methods for broth macro- and microdilution susceptibility testing of yeasts (CLSI M27-Ed4 document) and molds (including dermatophytes) (CLSI M38-Ed3 document), as well as disk diffusion methods for yeasts (CLSI M44-A2 document) and molds (CLSI M51-A document) (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0039">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0042">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0043">43</link>). EUCAST has developed broth microdilution methods for fermentative yeast (E.Def 7.3 document), for conidia-forming molds (E.Def 9.4 document), and for microconidia-forming dermatophytes (E.Def 11.0 document), as well as agar screening tests for detection of azole resistance in <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> and echinocandin resistance and <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp. (E.Def 10.2) (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0044">44</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0047">47</link>). The main differences between the EUCAST and CLSI microdilution reference methods are the EUCAST recommendations of (i) a higher glucose and inoculum concentration, and (ii) incubation in microtiter plates with flat-bottomed wells to allow an objective spectrophotometer reading for yeast and dermatophytes, and amphotericin and azole MICs against <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> isolates rather than visual reading as recommended by CLSI. Both microdilution reference tests for yeast can be evaluated after 24 h of incubation (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0048">48</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0051">51</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0006">Species-specific clinical breakpoints for the systemically active antifungal agents against the most common<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species have been published by CLSI and EUCAST for their respective reference methods. For those species where there is insufficient evidence to support clinical breakpoints, epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs/ECOFFs) have been provided for some species-drug combinations by both organizations, which allow identification of isolates with acquired resistance (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0052">52</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0056">56</link>). Although the two sets of reference methods are more alike than different and the overall approaches to setting breakpoints are broadly aligned, the MICs obtained with the two methods deviate for some agents and fungi. Therefore, it remains imperative that the appropriate breakpoints are applied for the method employed. This includes interpretation of those commercial methods developed to replicate results produced by either of the respective reference methods. The appropriate breakpoints to apply are usually specified in the manufacturer’s test instructions (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0057">57</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0060">60</link>) and are listed in <anchor id="ch0157s0000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0157s0000a0011">Table 1</link>. Yet, before adopting CLSI or EUCAST breakpoints for the results of commercial test results, it is mandatory to ensure that in-house replicas of QC strains align with the MIC target and that modes and ranges of clinical wild-type isolates align with the MIC distributions used for the breakpoint setting (for EUCAST, available in the rationale documents at <ulink url="https://www.eucast.org/astoffungi/rationale_documents_for_antifungals/">https://www.eucast.org/astoffungi/rationale_documents_for_antifungals/</ulink>). This is important because the essential agreement between commercial test results and the reference method is not always within the ±1 dilution necessary to avoid misclassification of susceptibility test categorization (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0061">61</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0062">62</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0157s0000p0007">In its simplest form, susceptibility testing is a measure of the potency of an agent to inhibit the growth<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> of an organism, and the MIC is the lowest concentration of the agent able to inhibit growth to a predetermined degree under specified growth conditions. Growth inhibition may be determined in a broth format, usually in microtiter plates, or on solid agar by either incorporation of the agent into the agar base or impregnation into a disk or strip applied to the surface of a previously inoculated plate. Solid agar incorporation is particularly useful in the high-throughput testing required for surveillance screening of environmental isolates, but is also increasingly used in clinical routine laboratories for screening for azole-resistant <emphasis>A. fumigatus.</emphasis> Commercial plates with four wells containing breakpoint concentrations of three different antifungal agents and a control well have been validated (VIPCheck, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0063">63</link>). However, <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> susceptibility testing is heavily influenced by a number of technical variables, including inoculum size and preparation, medium formulation and pH, duration and temperature of incubation, and the criterion used for MIC endpoint determination (complete or partial inhibition, etc.), all of which have to be considered when developing and interpreting test methods (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0064">64</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0068">68</link>). In addition, antifungal susceptibility testing is complicated by problems unique to fungi, such as slow growth rates (relative to bacteria) and the ability of certain fungi (dimorphic) to grow either as a unicellular yeast form that produces blastoconidia or as a hyphal or filamentous fungal form that may have the ability to produce conidia or sporangiospores. Finally, the basic properties of the antifungal agents themselves, such as solubility, chemical stability, modes of action, and the tendency to produce partial inhibition of growth over a wide range of concentrations above the MIC, must be taken into account.</para>

        <para id="ch0157s0000p0008">Some antifungal agents demonstrate fungicidal activity at concentrations that can be achieved<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> and may provide better outcomes than those agents that are fungistatic and therefor rely on some host phagocytic cell activity to remove the remaining viable pathogens. It has been reported that the clinical outcome is significantly better for patients with invasive candidiasis due to <emphasis>Candida albicans</emphasis> and treated with an echinocandin (fungicidal against <emphasis>Candida</emphasis>) compared to those receiving fluconazole (fungistatic against <emphasis>Candida</emphasis>), and that voriconazole (fungicidal against <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis>) is superior to echinocandins (fungistatic against <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis>) in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, despite the fact that <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> and <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> are susceptible to these compounds (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0069">69</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0074">74</link>). Standard testing parameters are not yet available for evaluation of the fungicidal activity of antifungal agents. The determination of minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) requires the subculturing onto drug-free agar medium of fixed volumes from each MIC tube. The criteria for MFC determination vary in different publications, and the MFC has been described as the lowest drug concentration resulting in either no growth or three to five colonies upon subculture. The clinical relevance and the development of standard guidelines for MFC determination still need to be addressed (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0075">75</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0076">76</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0157s0000p0009">A microorganism is defined as wild type for a species by the absence of phenotypically detectable acquired and mutational resistance mechanisms to the agent in question. A non-wild-type isolate harbors one or more resistance mechanisms, but, depending on the values of the clinical breakpoints, wild-type and non-wild-type isolates may or may not respond clinically to treatment with the agent (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0053">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0077">77</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0078">78</link>). Phenotypic susceptibility testing is associated with inherent variation. Arendrup and colleagues (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0077">77</link>) tested a single isolate of <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> with a fluconazole MIC of 2.0 mg/liter, as assessed by the EUCAST susceptibility testing method, a total of 45 times. They found MIC results spanning three 2-fold dilutions ranging from 2.0 to 8.0 mg/liter, almost directly mirroring those results produced for 35 different <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> isolates that were tested in parallel. This demonstrated that variation within the wild-type population could be explained solely by test variation, allowing for a doubling dilution difference on each occasion when tested in a single laboratory. When interlaboratory variation, which is associated with even well-standardized and controlled testing, is taken into account, MICs of wild-type isolates (without acquired resistance) of a given species will form a bell-shaped Gaussian distribution within a range of ±1 to 2 2-fold dilution steps around a “modal” (most common) MIC (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0053">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0078">78</link>). Therefore, the modal MIC represents the “true” MIC of the species. With a normal Gaussian distribution, the MIC<subscript>50</subscript> (the MIC that encompasses 50% of isolates) will be identical to the modal MIC. Non-wild-type isolates with acquired resistance may form a hump, a tail, or a second Gaussian distribution to the right, depending on the number of resistant isolates and the magnitude of the MIC elevation.</para>

        <para id="ch0157s0000p0010">Occasionally, a distribution of MIC results may be bimodal, or even appear to be quite random. Whereas presence of isolates with acquired resistance may be the explanation, incorrect species identification, mixed species, or the presence of cryptic species that cannot be correctly identified with standard techniques may all be causes of non-Gaussian distributions.<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species such as <emphasis>C. guilliermondii, C. fermentati, C. lusitaniae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. palmioleophila</emphasis> may be difficult to distinguish correctly from one another without MALDI-TOF or molecular tests, but have species-specific susceptibility patterns (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0079">79</link>). Moreover, taxonomic studies of those species complexes that appear to have a random MIC distribution may further delineate taxonomic groupings within the complex that each display separate susceptibility profiles, such as <emphasis>Scedosporium aurantiacum</emphasis> within the <emphasis>Scedosporium apiospermum</emphasis> complex (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0080">80</link>) and <emphasis>Aspergillus lentulus</emphasis> within the <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> complex (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0081">81</link>).

        <para id="ch0157s0000p0011">Susceptibility characteristics of a population can be described by defining the range of MIC values encountered and calculating the value at which 50% (MIC<subscript>50</subscript>) and 90% (MIC<subscript>90</subscript>) of the population is inhibited. Moreover, the epidemiological cutoff value (abbreviated ECOFF by EUCAST and ECV by CLSI) is the MIC that represents the upper limit of the MICs for wild-type isolates. This provides an indication of the normal susceptibility patterns encountered with a given drug-organism combination and thus confirms whether a given isolate conforms to the predicted wild-type susceptibility profile or is displaying a less susceptible non-wild-type phenotype. An MIC above the ECOFF/ECV cannot be explained by inherent test variation. Such outlier organisms can most often be found to harbor resistance mechanisms (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0082">82</link>). Clinical breakpoints should therefore not be set higher than ECOFF/ECV unless there is supporting clinical evidence to demonstrate that such isolates do respond to standard therapy (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0078">78</link>). The ECOFF/ECV value for a given drug and species has in the past been set based upon a visual inspection of where the Gaussian MIC distribution ends; however, today mathematical/statistical methods are also adopted. The principle in these methods is that a Gaussian distribution is created by “mirroring” the left and low-MIC half-side of the MIC distribution, thereby ensuring that only inherent test variation and not isolates with discrete MIC elevation are taken into account in the ECOFF/ECV setting determination. The data needed for ECOFF setting are described in the EUCAST SOP 10.2, which is freely available on the EUCAST website (<ulink url="https://www.eucast.org/eucastsops/">https://www.eucast.org/eucastsops/</ulink>), and for CLSI, document M57 outlines the principles and procedures (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0083">83</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0157s0000p0018">The most important differences are as follows. First, in some cases, clinical breakpoints can reflect the need to achieve higher-than-normal blood concentrations for a given drug to achieve good outcomes. CLSI has used the term “susceptible dose dependent” (SDD) for such isolates, whereas EUCAST has revised the meaning of the “I” category to be “susceptible, increased exposure” for isolates with slightly elevated MICs when current evidence supports that there is a high likelihood of therapeutic success if exposure to the agent is increased by adjusting either the dosing regimen or the agent’s concentration at the site of infection. Such categorization has been used with fluconazole by both organizations where there is clear clinical evidence that higher doses, and therefore higher blood concentrations, can influence the outcome in isolates with MICs above the usual susceptible range (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0084">84</link>). The second important difference is that “I” in CLSI means intermediate susceptibility and is used for isolates with MIC results only just in excess of the normal wild-type MIC<subscript>s</subscript>, which means that the currently available data do not allow the organism to be categorized as either fully susceptible or fully resistant. “Intermediate” is also used as a buffer zone to prevent small, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing misclassifications and major discrepancies in interpretations, for example, when the MICs for susceptible and resistant organisms overlap. The third difference is that “ATU” (area of technical uncertainty) is used by EUCAST for situations where the MIC cannot be interpreted reliably on its own. It is not to be reported to the clinicians, but is intended to warn the laboratory staff that the value is in an area where there are interpretative difficulties. The reason is that a MIC is in a place where reproducible S, I, R interpretation cannot be achieved. The ATU is not related to uncertainties in the testing procedures, although the natural unavoidable variation in testing will influence the actions that may need to be taken. The ATU assumes that the susceptibility test is correctly performed and that the MIC value obtained is correct in itself. For example, a posaconazole MIC of 0.25 mg/liter for <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> may represent either the upper end of the wild-type distribution or the lower end of the MIC distribution of isolates with target gene alterations. Hence, it cannot be interpreted as S or R by itself, but several studies suggest that there is cross-resistance between posaconazole and itraconazole and, therefore, that the posaconazole MIC should be classified as S if also susceptible to itraconazole but as R if itraconazole resistant (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0052">52</link>). Resistance (R) denoted by either method classifies those fungi where therapeutic failure is likely even with increased exposure.</para>

        <anchor id="ch0157s0000a0034"/>
        <para id="ch0157s0000p0019">The following parameters are considered when setting breakpoints: (i) standard dosing, (ii) species-specific MIC distributions, (iii) ECOFFs/ECVs, (iv) pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses, and (v) clinical experience and MIC-outcome relationships. In the ideal situation, all of these data would be available; however, more often, breakpoints are selected based on less-than-perfect datasets, usually comprising MIC distributions, some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information, and clinical experience from infections involving wild-type isolates.</para>
        <para id="ch0157s0000p0020">Due to the complex pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of most drugs, the exposure is a function of multiple variables such as the mode of administration, dose, dosing interval and duration, site of infection, tissue distribution, and drug metabolism and excretion, as well as the potential antagonism of other concomitant medication. This often varies greatly from patient to patient and even day to day and highlights the need for therapeutic drug monitoring, particularly with some agents or classes of agent such as the azoles. Another important point to consider when setting breakpoints is that they should not divide wild-type distributions of important target species because this would lead to random classification of isolates with identical susceptibility (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0077">77</link>). Species-specific breakpoints have been introduced to prevent this occurrence while not incorrectly classifying other groups and to acknowledge that virulence differs across various species. <link linkend="ch0157s0000a0011">Table 1</link> shows a comparison of the species-specific breakpoints for yeast isolates accepted by the CLSI and EUCAST.</para>
        <para id="ch0157s0000p0021">Breakpoint setting, therefore, is not an exact science, and classification of isolates into S, I, and R based on clinical breakpoints does not<emphasis>per se</emphasis> predict outcome, because other factors, including severity of the infection and underlying disease, timing of therapy, and virulence of the organisms, all influence the outcome. Susceptibility classification, however, predicts the likelihood of a successful outcome. It has been suggested that for antifungal therapy of yeast infections the “90-60 rule” should be applied, which suggests that infections due to susceptible organisms respond 90% of the time, while those due to resistant organisms respond in 60% of cases (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0085">85</link>). The same is unlikely to be true of chronic or invasive mold infections, where the underlying condition of the host, which has led to susceptibility to infection in the first place, is likely to have a greater impact and lead to worse outcomes even with fully susceptible organisms and very rare success with a resistant organism. Even with yeast infection, the lack of adjunctive host response in the neutropenic patient may have an additional adverse impact on the likely outcome, and it is well recognized that removal of intravenous catheters can positively influence outcome irrespective of the choice of antifungal therapy (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0087">87</link>). For systemic therapy, dose, dosing interval, route of administration, and effect of coadministration of other drugs have a direct impact on achievable blood levels, and it is usually considered that blood levels should be several times in excess of the MIC for successful outcome. For example, a dose/MIC ratio of 25 (using the higher MICs obtained with 48-h CLSI reading) or 100 (using the lower MICs obtained with EUCAST and CLSI with 24-h reading) was found to correlate well with successful outcome of treatment with fluconazole and was supportive of the suggested breakpoint (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0088">88</link>). It is becoming increasingly recognized that monitoring of blood levels for some drugs is therefore an important part of the management of patients, particularly those treated with the triazole agents itraconazole, posaconazole, or voriconazole and for patients treated with 5-flucytosine (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0089">89</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0157s0000p0022">When agents are used topically, such as in the treatment of cutaneous and mucosal forms of candidiasis, otomycosis, and mycotic keratitis, different, higher breakpoints may be more applicable because local concentrations of the agent may be many-fold in excess of the MIC of the infecting organism. An example of this is the topical treatment of mycotic keratitis, where topical agents such as 0.15% (1,500 mg/liter) amphotericin B, 1% (10,000 mg/liter) natamycin, 1% (10,000 mg/liter) voriconazole, and 2% (20,000 mg/liter) econazole would greatly exceed the<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> susceptibility ECOFFs/ECVs for most organisms. However, although local concentrations may be high, there are other complexities, and consideration has to be given to issues such as tissue penetration and duration of contact, so to date, breakpoint setting for topical therapy has not been formally addressed.</para>

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0027">Antifungal powders can be obtained directly from the drug manufacturers or from reputable commercial sources. Clinical intravenous or oral preparations should not be used. Antifungal stock solutions should be prepared at concentrations at least 10 times the highest concentration to be tested (e.g., 1,280 mg/liter for fluconazole and flucytosine). Solutions of standard powders of hydrophilic substances are prepared in distilled water. For testing non-water-soluble agents, sufficient drug standard should be weighed to prepare a solution 100 times the desired final concentration. EUCAST and CLSI methodology specifies the use of dimethyl sulfoxide for all non-water-soluble agents, which allows storage of prepared plates for up to 6 months without loss of potency (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0091">91</link>). The actual amount to be weighed must be adjusted according to the specific biological potency of the lot of antifungal drug powder. Amphotericin B solutions must be protected from light, and drug stock solutions prepared with solvents should be allowed to stand for 30 min before use.</para>

The inoculum suspension is prepared by picking five colonies, each at least 1 mm in diameter, ideally from 24-h-old cultures of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. or 48-h-old cultures of <emphasis>Cryptococcus neoformans.</emphasis> These are then suspended in 5 ml of sterile 0.85% NaCl or sterile distilled water for the EUCAST method and vigorously shaken on a vortex mixer. The turbidity of the cell suspension measured at 530 nm is adjusted with the appropriate suspension medium to match the transmittance produced by a 0.5 McFarland barium sulfate standard. This procedure produces a cell suspension containing 1 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> to 5 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> CFU/ml. It is recommended to validate the performance of the adopted spectrophotometer for the five most common species by performing CFU counts before it is implemented, as differences in cell sizes (small cells for <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> versus large cells for <emphasis>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. krusei</emphasis>) and pigmentation (e.g., <emphasis>Aspergillus niger</emphasis>) have been associated with the need to use species-specific OD values to obtain the correct concentration (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0093">93</link>). For the CLSI method, this suspension is then diluted 1:1,000 with RPMI medium to provide the 2× test inoculum (1 × 10<superscript>3</superscript> to 5 × 10<superscript>3</superscript> CFU/ml) for yeast. The 2× inoculum is diluted 1:1 when the wells are inoculated to achieve the desired final inoculum size (0.5 × 10<superscript>3</superscript> to 2.5 × 10<superscript>3</superscript> CFU/ml). For the EUCAST method, which utilizes a 100-fold higher final inoculum, a working suspension is prepared from a 1:10 dilution of the standardized suspension in sterile distilled water to produce 1 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> to 5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml, which then is diluted 2× (to 0.5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> to 2.5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript>) in the inoculated wells. For molds, CLSI uses a final concentration of 0.4 × 10<superscript>4</superscript> to 5 × 10<superscript>4</superscript> and EUCAST a 10-fold higher inoculum of 0.5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> to 1.25 × 10<superscript>5</superscript>.</para>

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0031">For hydrophobic drugs dissolved in solvents other than water (e.g., the polyenes, the echinocandins, and the azoles, except some formulations of fluconazole), intermediate test drug dilutions are prepared from stock solutions to be 100 times the strength of the final drug concentration, with 100% dimethyl sulfoxide used as a diluent (e.g., 1,600 to 3 mg/liter). Dilutions should be prepared according to ISO recommendations (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0094">94</link>). This procedure prevents precipitation of agents with low solubility in aqueous media. Alternative dilution schemes may be used if they are shown to perform as well as the reference method (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0095">95</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0096">96</link>). Despite careful procedures, itraconazole and some other agents do not remain completely solubilized upon dilution into aqueous media, which makes the use of QC procedures vital to minimize inaccuracies. For water-soluble drugs, such as flucytosine and some formulations of fluconazole, dilutions are prepared from the stock to be 10 times the final test drug concentrations directly in RPMI medium according to the additive, 2-fold drug dilution schema (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0038">38</link>) (e.g., 640 to 1.2 mg/liter for fluconazole and flucytosine). The 10× and 100× drug concentrations should be diluted 1:5 and 1:50, respectively, with RPMI to achieve the 2× drug concentrations needed for the microdilution test; after the inoculation step the drug concentrations are 16 to 0.03 mg/liter for amphotericin B and triazoles and 64 to 0.12 mg/liter for fluconazole and flucytosine. Although flucytosine is hydrophilic, a recent report suggested that following the scheme for hydrophobic agents is also possible and should be included as an option in the CLSI method documents (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0097">97</link>). Because the echinocandins are potent at lower concentrations, and to encompass the EUCAST breakpoints, drug dilution series from 4.0 to 0.08 mg/liter are recommended for these compounds. Of note, drug dilution series are produced in double-concentrated medium for the EUCAST testing to allow the 2-fold dilution when the inoculum (prepared in water) is added.</para>
      <para id="ch0157s0000p0032">The broth microdilution test is performed by using sterile, disposable, 96-well microdilution polystyrene plates (U-shaped wells for CLSI or flat-bottom plates for EUCAST). Differential binding capacity has been observed for untreated or tissue/cell culture plates, and most EUCAST data for breakpoint setting have been generated with treated plates. A multichannel pipette (or a large dispensing instrument for 96-well trays) is used to dispense the 2× drug concentrations in 100-μl volumes into the wells of columns 1 to 10 of the microdilution plates. Column 1 contains the highest drug concentration, and column 10 contains the lowest drug concentration. Microdilution trays can be sealed in plastic bags and stored frozen at −70°C (or −80°C) for up to 6 months or at −20°C for not more than 1 month (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0091">91</link>). Each well is inoculated on the day of the test with 100 μl of the corresponding 2× inoculum, which brings the drug dilutions and inoculum densities to the final test concentrations (final volume in each well, 200 μl). The growth control wells (column 11) contain 100 μl of sterile drug-free medium (for water-soluble agents) or 100 μl of sterile drug-free medium (with solvent for non-water-soluble agents) and are inoculated with 100 μl of the corresponding 2× inoculum. The QC yeasts are tested in the same manner as the other isolates and are included each time an isolate is tested. Row 12 of the microdilution plate can be used for the sterility control (drug-free medium only).</para>

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0034">The determination of MIC endpoints is a critical step in antifungal susceptibility testing, especially with the azoles (for yeasts) and echinocandins (for yeasts and molds). For the CLSI methodology, the endpoint reading is undertaken by eye, whereas the flat-bottom plates used for EUCAST testing allow an automated and objective spectrophotometric reading and cutoff defined by a fixed percentage of the optical density achieved in the corresponding control well. The recommended absorbance for reading the plates is 530 nm, although others can be used (e.g., 405, 450 or 490 nm), and the value of the blank background should be deducted from the readings for the other wells. For the CLSI methodology, the growth in each well is compared with that in the growth control (drug-free) well with the aid of a reading mirror (e.g., Cooke Engineering Co., Alexandria, VA). The MIC for amphotericin B is defined as the lowest concentration at which a complete absence of growth (optically clear) is observed, i.e., 100% inhibition, or ≥90% inhibition if read with a spectrophotometer for the EUCAST method.</para>
      <para id="ch0157s0000p0035">The partial inhibition or trailing that is observed with fungistatic compounds such as the azoles against<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> prevents adoption of a complete absence-of-growth endpoint. Moreover, the highest degree of reproducibility is obtained if the steepest part of the growth inhibition curve is taken as the endpoint. Therefore, the MIC of the azoles, echinocandins, and flucytosine is defined as the lowest concentration at which prominent growth inhibition is observed (≥50% inhibition as compared to the growth control well) for both standards. For visual interpretation, agitation of the microdilution trays is highly recommended prior to CLSI MIC determination; this step facilitates the visual estimate of prominent growth inhibition (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0098">98</link>).</para>

However, the EUCAST guidelines caution against relying only on the results of these as QC strains when testing agents that are highly potent on a milligram per liter basis (such as echinocandins and isavuconazole) because they are not sufficiently sensitive in detecting variation in the free active amount of agent in the low concentrations, so for these drugs <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> ATCC 64548 or ATCC 64550 should be included (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0091">91</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0101">101</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0102">102</link>). <link linkend="ch0157s0000a0048">Table 4</link> summarizes the expected CLSI MIC ranges and EUCAST MIC target and ranges of 14 antifungal agents for the most commonly utilized QC isolates; information for additional strains can be found elsewhere and on the EUCAST website (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0037">37</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0103">103</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0106">106</link>). Each new batch of medium and lot of macrodilution tubes and microdilution trays should be checked with one of the two QC strains to determine if the MICs are within these ranges and preferably on the mid value (also called the target MIC within the target range). It is important that QC strains are selected so that they cover both the mid and low end of the concentration range relevant for clinical isolates, as drug loss and higher MICs are more common in the low end. In addition, the overall performance of the test system should be monitored by testing either or both QC isolates each day on which a test is performed for each drug. Details regarding corrective measures when the MICs for the QC isolates are not within the expected ranges are found in the CLSI M27-Ed4 document (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0038">38</link>) and the EUCAST 7.3.2 document (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0040">40</link>).

It is suggested that if this value is not reached, then tests should be repeated with incubation of the trays at 30°C. Moreover, there is a suggestion in CLSI M27-S4 (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0057">57</link>) for the use of yeast nitrogen base glucose (YNBG) broth, which may enhance the growth of <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis>, thus facilitating the determination of MICs. A study examined a number of parameters for testing a range of nonfermentative yeast species. These included growth medium (RPMI versus YNBG), glucose at 0.2 or 2%, shaken or static, a different nitrogen source, incubation temperature (30 versus 35°C), and inoculum size (10<superscript>3</superscript>, 10<superscript>4</superscript>, or 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml). It concluded that the use of YNBG medium, shaking, and a lower incubation temperature enhanced the growth rate of <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> spp. and most of the other nonfermentative yeast species tested. This allowed reading after 24 h and more consistent endpoint determination; however, there were no significant differences in MICs obtained by the different methods (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0090">90</link>). Two large global studies utilized the CLSI M27-A4 method in RPMI medium, read at 72 h, to define ECVs for fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0107">107</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0108">108</link>).

In a multicenter study of data from 17 laboratories analyzing up to 11,550 <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> isolates, wide discrepancies were found for most species in modal values, as well as truncated and bimodal distributions. Despite examination of many testing parameters, including caspofungin powder source, storage time and temperature, solvent, and MIC determination, no single source of this variability could be established (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0117">117</link>). In general, the efficacy of the three echinocandins against <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> isolates is uniform in the sense that resistance mutations confer resistance across all three compounds. Therefore, both anidulafungin and micafungin have been evaluated as markers for caspofungin resistance (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0118">118</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0119">119</link>).

Interpretive MIC breakpoints (<link linkend="ch0157s0000a0011">Table 1</link>) have been established for isolates tested by the CLSI M27-Ed4 method for fluconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin, following some correlation with clinical data predominantly from patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis, candidemia in nonneutropenic patients, and some more invasive infections (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0122">122</link>). Breakpoints for yeast isolates tested by the EUCAST E.Def 7.3 method are available for amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin, and micafungin (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0078">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0093">93</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0121">121</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0123">123</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0125">125</link>). Considerable effort has been expended on harmonization of the discrepant CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints for yeast isolates, because there was concern that the results of two very similar methods should be interpreted with different breakpoint criteria (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0051">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0059">59</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0103">103</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0126">126</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0127">127</link>). This is especially true since the publication of CLSI M27-Ed4, which, like EUCAST E.Def 7.3, allows the reading of results at 24 h, which has led to lower CLSI MICs for most drug-organism combinations (as illustrated also by the lower QC ranges for the 24-h reading) (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0038">38</link>). Changes to the CLSI breakpoints were published in a supplement to the reference method, CLSI document M27-S4 (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0057">57</link>), and have now been slightly revised in document M27/M44S (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0037">37</link>); these, together with the EUCAST clinical breakpoints and the available ECVs/ECOFFs for each method, are presented in <link linkend="ch0157s0000a0011">Table 1</link>. Breakpoints are species specific, which makes accurate species identification a vital part of breakpoint interpretation. Harmonization has been achieved for many drug-organism combinations; where differences remain is mainly dependent on differences in the endpoints achieved by the two methods (e.g., for anidulafungin).</para>
        <para id="ch0157s0000p0045">Fluconazole inhibits the majority of the most common<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. (<emphasis>C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. tropicalis</emphasis>) at concentrations of ≤2 mg/liter, so this is the breakpoint for susceptibility for the majority of species; 4.0 mg/liter is considered SDD (CLSI terminology) or I (for susceptible, increased exposure; EUCAST terminology), and ≥8 mg/liter is considered resistant. The SDD/I designation for fluconazole encompasses isolates in which susceptibility is dependent on achievable peak levels in serum of 40 to 60 mg/liter at fluconazole dosages of 800 mg/day (or 12 mg/kg) versus the expected peak levels of ≤30 mg/liter at lower dosages. The pharmacodynamic parameter that predicts efficacy for fluconazole is ~100 (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]/MIC ratio). Fluconazole MICs for <emphasis>C. glabrata, C. krusei</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> are generally higher than for other species, at 4 to 16, 16 to ≥64, and 8 to ≥64 mg/liter, respectively (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0128">128</link>). The recommendation is that these species are not good targets for standard dosing of fluconazole, but because <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> is not fully resistant, the <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> wild-type population is classified as SDD/I to accommodate use of fluconazole at higher doses in some clinical situations (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0084">84</link>). In contrast, <emphasis>C. krusei</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> should be considered innately resistant and should not be treated with fluconazole (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0057">57</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0157s0000p0046">Species-specific breakpoints for itraconazole have been set by EUCAST for<emphasis>C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. tropicalis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0093">93</link>) but are not addressed in CLSI M27-S4 or M60; however, the need for species-specific breakpoints has been recognized by CLSI, and species-specific CLSI ECVs as well as EUCAST ECOFFs for common species without clinical breakpoints have been published that may assist in detecting and monitoring any acquired resistance development (ECVs for this drug are included in CLSI M57S-Ed4 [54]) (<link linkend="ch0157s0000a0011">Table 1</link>). It is important, however, not to confuse the information provided by breakpoints and ECVs/ECOFFs. An MIC below the breakpoint suggests a high likelihood of success and that the agent can be used. An MIC below the ECV/ECOFF suggests the isolate has no acquired resistance mechanisms, so it will likely respond to therapy like other isolates of that species.</para>
        <para id="ch0157s0000p0047">For voriconazole, the susceptible breakpoints for CLSI and EUCAST are identical (≤0.125 mg/liter for<emphasis>C. parapsilosis</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. tropicalis</emphasis>) or one dilution apart (≤0.125 [CLSI] and ≤0.06 [EUCAST] mg/liter for <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis>), but whereas the CLSI document specifies an SDD of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/liter and a resistant breakpoint of ≥1.0 mg/liter (<link linkend="ch0157s0000a0011">Table 1</link>), EUCAST classifies isolates with MICs of &gt;0.25 mg/liter as resistant. This is mainly based on differences in MICs obtained by the two methods. Isolates for which the voriconazole MIC is higher are mostly <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis>, for which the CLSI ECV and EUCAST ECOFFs are 0.25 and 1.0 mg/liter respectively, but also include non-<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> genera such as <emphasis>Sporobolomyces salmonicolor</emphasis> and <emphasis>Rhodotorula rubra</emphasis>, as well as some <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> isolates (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0128">128</link>). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters indicate that 24-h free-drug AUC/CLSI-MIC ratios of 24 and 75 to 100 are predictive of the 50% effective dose and a 2-log CFU reduction, respectively. Recommended doses would produce free-drug AUCs of ~20 μg h/ml (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0129">129</link>). However, voriconazole has nonlinear and variable pharmacokinetics, and the coefficient of variation of the AUC has been estimated to be 74 to 100%. Monte Carlo simulations showed that a free-drug AUC/CLSI-MIC target of 24 would inhibit 99% of isolates with a CLSI MIC of ≤0.5 mg/liter if standard treatment were given intravenously and 99% of isolates with MICs of ≤0.25 mg/liter if treatment were given orally. For EUCAST MICs, the PK/PD target is 60 fAUC24/MIC (the area under the concentration-time curve for free unbound drug, over 24 hours in steady state divided by the MIC) for <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. The 99% target attainment is reached for <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> with EUCAST MICs of ≤0.06 mg/liter for the 200 mg × 2 standard oral dose, MIC of ≤0.125 mg/liter at the oral 300 mg × 2 oral dose, and MIC of 0.25 mg/liter for the 4 mg/kg steady-state intravenous dose. This supports the clinical EUCAST breakpoints for resistance of &gt;0.25 mg/liter and the concept of having an I category where increased dosing is needed (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0052">52</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0157s0000p0048">EUCAST has also addressed breakpoints for posaconazole for several<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. and suggests a susceptible breakpoint of ≤0.06 mg/liter and a resistant breakpoint of &gt;0.06 mg/liter for <emphasis>C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. tropicalis</emphasis>, again based on careful evaluation of known wild-type distributions and the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0124">124</link>). A multilaboratory analysis of CLSI ECVs of eight <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. to fluconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole suggests that breakpoints should be higher if assessed by the CLSI methodology, and ECVs documented in <link linkend="ch0157s0000a0011">Table 1</link> reflect this (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0130">130</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0157s0000p0049">Reevaluation of the clinical CLSI breakpoints for the echinocandins following the analysis of accumulated data suggested that the previous CLSI breakpoint thresholds of ≤2.0 mg/liter as susceptible and &gt;2.0 mg/liter as nonsusceptible were too high for most<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. This led to the misclassification as susceptible of a significant number of isolates from infections that were refractory to echinocandin therapy and had known <emphasis>fks</emphasis> mutations, which are recognized as a marker for echinocandin resistance (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0127">127</link>). Thus, with the exception of <emphasis>C. parapsilosis</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. guilliermondii</emphasis>, lower drug- and species-specific CLSI breakpoints have been suggested for the echinocandins (see <link linkend="ch0157s0000a0011">Table 1</link>). The CLSI breakpoints differ for the three echinocandins and are lower for <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> than for most other <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. Applying these new lower breakpoints to 15,269 isolates of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. from 100 centers worldwide collected over an 8-year period from 2001 to 2009, Pfaller and colleagues detected a significant number of isolates with non-wild-type resistance patterns that would have been missed by applying the higher clinical breakpoints (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0060">60</link>). At present, EUCAST has refrained from setting breakpoints for caspofungin due to significant variation associated with <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> testing of this compound (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0117">117</link>). The EUCAST breakpoints for anidulafungin and micafungin are lower than those proposed by the CLSI because the EUCAST method provides lower MICs than are obtained by CLSI. Hence, for both methods, the breakpoints basically mirror the ECOFFs/ECVs, and the differences are method driven. Anidulafungin is considered a good marker for caspofungin susceptibility by CLSI until the reproducibility issue has been solved and breakpoints can be established for this agent (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0119">119</link>). Differential activity has, however, been demonstrated for micafungin and <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis>, because some weaker mutations elevate the anidulafungin and caspofungin MIC but not the micafungin MIC and are not associated with efficacy loss in an animal model, while the opposite is true for a few <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> isolates where some mutations elevate MIC for caspofungin and micafungin but not for anidulafungin (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0082">82</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0120">120</link>). Consequently, EUCAST recommends testing both anidulafungin and micafungin as markers for caspofungin susceptibility. <emphasis>C. parapsilosis</emphasis> and other members of the species complex demonstrate low virulence, which in clinical practice abrogates the consequences of elevated MICs. Therefore, it is considered safe to use echinocandins as first-line agents for this species, and the wild-type population is classified as susceptible today by both CLSI and EUCAST.</para>

These have been applied historically, and numerous publications support their application, although very little clinical experience exists for <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> isolates with MICs above 1 mg/liter.

        <para id="ch0157s0000p0051">Astvad and colleagues have suggested a pragmatic approach to susceptibility classification of yeast species without EUCAST breakpoints and include in their analysis many of the less common<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species and some other yeast genera (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0053">53</link>). Their classification relies on a correct identification and confidence in the MIC obtained (they suggest repeat testing to confirm) and on the following assumptions: (i) that genetically related isolates will have similar pathogenicity and intrinsic susceptibility patterns and (ii) that nonrelated isolates with similar MIC to better known wild-type populations are likely to respond in the same way, as their pathogenicity should be quite low considering they are rare pathogens. These authors discuss amphotericin B, anidulafungin, fluconazole, and voriconazole MICs against 30 different rare yeasts based on MIC data for more than 4,000 isolates generated in the EUCAST Development Laboratory for Fungi, validated by alignment to published EUCAST MIC data (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0053">53</link>). Until formal ECOFFs and breakpoints have been established, the proposed classification may help interpreting an MIC for species without breakpoints.

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0053">Colorimetric indicators or fluorescent dyes can facilitate determination of MIC endpoints. Commercial (Sensititre YeastOne, ASTY, Micronaut-AM, and Fungitest) and noncommercial (tetrazolium salt methods and substrate uptake indicators) procedures have been adapted for antifungal susceptibility testing (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0132">132</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0136">136</link>). The Sensititre YeastOne YO2IVD plate (TREK Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Cleveland, OH) follows the same microdilution format as the CLSI reference method; it has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is CE marked for the testing of nonfastidious yeast species with fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, flucytosine, and caspofungin, with the ability to include a QC organism on the same plate. Other systemic antifungal agents included on the Sensititre YeastOne YO9 plate, such as amphotericin B, posaconazole, anidulafungin, and micafungin, are available for nondiagnostic use in the United States, but the same range of antifungals on Sensititre YeastOne Y10 has been CE marked for use in Europe. Reading of endpoints is enhanced by the inclusion of alamarBlue as the oxidation-reduction colorimetric indicator. If wells remain blue, there is no growth; pink wells indicate growth, and purple wells indicate partial inhibition. Agreement to within 2 doubling dilutions with CLSI broth microdilution MICs has been excellent with posaconazole and voriconazole (95.4%) and with anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin (100%), all read after 24-h incubation (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0133">133</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0135">135</link>). Evaluation against the CLSI microdilution method using the most recent clinical breakpoints and epidemiological cutoff values for the echinocandins with 404 isolates of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. showed excellent (100%) essential agreement and close agreement with categorical values. For <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis>, categorical agreement ranged from 93.6% (caspofungin) to 99.6% (micafungin) with less than 1% very major or major errors (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0137">137</link>). For <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. krusei</emphasis> and caspofungin, it was somewhat less optimal (87.9 and 69.1%, respectively). More recent studies have included large numbers of echinocandin-resistant isolates with known <emphasis>FKS</emphasis> mutations, and when applying species-specific ECVs for anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin, 88.9%, 91.4%, and 93.8% of isolates, respectively, were correctly classified (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0138">138</link>). A recent study comparing Sensititre results for 100 clinical yeast isolates with a second colorimetric broth microdilution test, MICRONAUT-AM (MERLIN Diagnostika GmbH, Bornheim, Germany), found systematically higher MICs with the former method for all antifungal drugs except itraconazole. There were large differences in absolute MIC readings, leading to low levels of essential agreement (EA) for voriconazole, itraconazole, and particularly posaconazole (only 38.3% EA), although high levels for fluconazole (98.0%), amphotericin B (100%), and 5-flucytosine (94.9%) (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0136">136</link>). Discrepancies in EA are not surprising, as Sensititre follows CLSI methodology and should have CLSI breakpoints applied, whereas MICRONAUT-AM was developed to replicate MICs obtained by EUCAST methodology. For drugs such as fluconazole and amphotericin B, where the breakpoints are identical, there was also high agreement (95.1% and 100% respectively) when isolates were analyzed according to susceptibility category (categorical agreement [CA]), as there was with micafungin (93.9%). However, like many studies of this nature, there was a paucity of resistant isolates, which makes meaningful analysis of very major errors (VMEs)—susceptible in the testing method while resistant in the reference method—very difficult. It is clear that the choice of commercial system employed will have an impact on the susceptibility patterns encountered and the consequent choices of antifungal agent, especially with azole and echinocandin drugs.</para>

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0054">In an effort to automate yeast susceptibility testing, bioMérieux (Hazelwood, MO) developed the VITEK 2 yeast susceptibility test, a commercial test system based on spectrophotometric analysis and incorporating a card-based miniaturized version of the doubling-dilution reference method. This was shown to produce reproducible, rapid, and accurate results consistent with those produced by the CLSI broth microdilution method with 48-h incubation for amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, and voriconazole with several hundred isolates of<emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0139">139</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0140">140</link>). One study investigated the potential of the VITEK 2 system to specifically detect resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole in 36 isolates of <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> and 86 isolates of <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> with well-characterized resistance mechanisms (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0141">141</link>). The VITEK 2 system exhibited excellent agreement with the reference broth microdilution method (with 48-h incubation) for detecting resistance, with overall categorical agreement of 97.5% for both fluconazole and voriconazole. In a study of 154 isolates, including some resistant to the azoles and amphotericin B, Cuenca-Estrella and colleagues (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0142">142</link>) compared the VITEK 2 antifungal susceptibility testing system with the CLSI and EUCAST broth dilution reference methods and with the Sensititre YeastOne and Etest techniques. With essential agreement to within 2 doubling dilutions of &gt;95% for <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. and 92% for <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis>, they concluded that the VITEK 2 system was a reliable technique to determine antifungal susceptibility of yeast species and, moreover, was a more rapid and easier alternative to the reference procedures. The average time to reading was 15.5 h for <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. and 34 h for <emphasis>Cryptococcus.</emphasis> Recently, caspofungin has been included in the panel. A drawback is that the MIC range that can be reported is ≤0.25 to ≥4 mg/liter and thus does not include the revised breakpoint for <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> (S: ≤0.125 mg/liter), and hence susceptible and intermediate isolates cannot be discriminated. Of note, a caveat in most performance evaluations is that few clinically resistant isolates are included. This will automatically lead to a low percentage of VMEs even if all were misclassified as susceptible simply due to the low numbers. An example demonstrating this caveat in performance evaluations is a recent study evaluated the performance of the VITEK 2 system for caspofungin testing using a well-defined panel of wild-type and resistant mutants of the five most common <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. If <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> isolates with an MIC of ≤0.25 were considered susceptible, there were no misclassifications of susceptible wild-type isolates. However, 19.4% (6/31) of isolates harboring <emphasis>FKS</emphasis> hot-spot resistance mutations were misclassified as susceptible (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0143">143</link>). The AST-YS05 card for use with the VITEK 2 system, which contains fluconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin, is available in the United States and Europe. VITEK has recently been evaluated for the testing of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>, showing an overall poor agreement to both CLSI and EUCAST (72% and 70% respectively) and worst for amphotericin B and fluconazole (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0144">144</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0056">Worldwide, the most commonly used technique for antibacterial susceptibility testing is the disk diffusion test, which yields a quantitative result (zones of inhibition) and a qualitative interpretive category (e.g., susceptible or resistant) based on correlation of zone sizes obtained with organisms with known MICs. Agar disk diffusion testing is a simple, flexible, and cost-effective alternative to broth dilution testing. The CLSI Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing has developed a disk diffusion method (<anchor id="ch0157s0000a0080"/><link linkend="ch0157s0000a0082">Table 6</link>) for testing <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. with caspofungin, fluconazole, manogepix, micafungin, posaconazole, rezafungin, and voriconazole, although interpretive criteria are only available for caspofungin, fluconazole, micafungin, and voriconazole, and as yet there are no commercially available FDA-approved disks (CLSI M44-Ed3 document) (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0146">146</link>). Extensive worldwide testing with fluconazole and voriconazole as part of a global survey suggests that this method performs very well (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0147">147</link>). It has also demonstrated good performance with caspofungin (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0148">148</link>). The M44 disk test method has also been shown to be a useful approach for determining the susceptibility of <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis> and other genera of yeast (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0147">147</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0149">149</link>). Zone interpretive criteria have been approved for fluconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin, and micafungin (CLSI M44-S3, now replaced by M27/M44S [37, 150]). Of note, despite the initial encouraging reports, studies evaluating the performance compared to CLSI with 24-h incubation or against EUCAST and associated revised breakpoints are few or nonexisting.</para>

        <para id="ch0157s0000p0061">The Etest (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Étoile, France, and Durham, NC) was the first antifungal gradient strip test to be produced, but Liofilchem strips are now also commercially available in some European countries and North Africa (Launch Diagnostics, Kent, United Kingdom). Such tests are based on the diffusion of a stable concentration gradient of an antimicrobial agent from a plastic strip onto an agar medium. There are commercially available gradient strips for amphotericin B, fluconazole, flucytosine, ketoconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin. For clinical use, the FDA has approved fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and flucytosine Etest strips; all gradient strips are CE marked. Agreement of Etest and reference MICs has been species, drug (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0119">119</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0151">151</link>), and medium dependent. The medium that provides the best performance for Etest MICs is solidified RPMI medium supplemented with 2% glucose, and reading requires expertise and close adherence to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the proviso on reading <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. krusei</emphasis> outlined below. If a clear zone is seen, the MIC can easily be read where the zone of inhibition intersects the strip. Problems can arise when inexperienced readers incorrectly interpret faint background growth of small colonies within the zone as resistance. This is most often seen with fluconazole, and if an isolate is unexpectedly found to be fluconazole resistant by Etest, it should be retested by a reference method. In this regard, it is crucial to ensure that a pure culture is used; for example, with a mixture of <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis>, the susceptibility of the more susceptible <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> would be read, and the smaller colonies of the less susceptible <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> growing in the <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> inhibition zone could be mistaken for trailing that should be ignored. The Etest may be useful in testing yeasts suspected of being potentially resistant to amphotericin B (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0115">115</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0152">152</link>). This method has also been evaluated and found to correlate well with CLSI methodology for testing the susceptibilities of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp. to triazoles and echinocandins (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0153">153</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0155">155</link>). It is clear that the breakpoints developed for the reference tests cannot necessarily be applied to results obtained with the commercial methods. A study suggests that when the current CLSI breakpoints for caspofungin are applied to Etest results for some isolates of <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. krusei</emphasis>, a significant number will be misclassified as intermediate (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0156">156</link>). This finding has been confirmed for <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> when evaluating the clinical response for patients with infections involving isolates with MICs just above the CLSI breakpoint (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0157">157</link>). Of note, whereas the caspofungin breakpoint for <emphasis>C. krusei</emphasis> is 0.25 mg/liter, the quality control MIC range in the Etest manual for anidulafungin against the QC strain of <emphasis>C. krusei</emphasis> ATCC 6258 is 0.25 to 1 mg/liter (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0158">158</link>). This suggests that a significant proportion of <emphasis>C. krusei</emphasis> isolates will be misclassified as nonsusceptible to anidulafungin when tested with Etest, in line with the above-mentioned findings. Another concern is the fact that whereas the anidulafungin CLSI breakpoint for <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> is 0.25 mg/liter, the quality control MIC range in the Etest manual for anidulafungin against the QC strain of <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> ATCC 90028 is 0.002 to 0.008 mg/liter. This suggests that the MIC for the wild-type population of <emphasis>C. albicans</emphasis> is 100-fold lower than the breakpoint (or at least 5 2-fold dilutions) when tested by Etest, and raises concern whether isolates with target gene alterations and increased MIC will indeed be reliably detected.</para>

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0063">A recent review of rapid antifungal susceptibility testing of yeasts and molds by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) looked at 12 studies and found good accuracy in the detection of antifungal drug resistance (sensitivity 91%, specificity 95%), as compared to the reference standard broth microdilution methodology, and documented turnaround times with a median of 6 hours (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0162">162</link>). Two main approaches have been utilized. The first examines a change in fungal proteomic profile on exposure to an antifungal agent and yields a composite correlation index (CCI) by analyzing data from a range of antifungal drug concentrations to produce a minimum profile change concentration (MPCC) which is roughly equivalent to the MIC. The second method, known as the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization Biotyper antibiotic susceptibility test rapid assay (MBT ASTRA), compares the growth of the test organism at different drug concentrations to growth in drug-free controls and defines a ratio of relative growth (RG) which, when compared to a predefined cutoff value, can classify the organism as susceptible or resistant. The latter method, which is more analogous to the conventional methodology, showed the greatest sensitivity in detecting resistant isolates. In order to further reduce turnaround times, Vatanshenassan and collagues (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0163">163</link>) evaluated the utility of MBT ASTRA to detect echinocandin resistance with <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> isolates directly from positive blood cultures. They successfully categorized 50 isolates as compared to CLSI guidelines with a categorical agreement of 98% and 96% for anidulafungin and micafungin, respectively, within 6 hours, thus confirming the considerable utility of this methodology.</para>
      <para id="ch0157s0000p0064">Meletiadis and colleagues explored the possibility of rapid discrimination of<emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> isolates susceptible and resistant to fluconazole and anidulafungin using a colorimetric MIC test measuring metabolic activity (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0164">164</link>). The colorimetric dye XTT is a yellow, water-soluble tetrazolium salt that is rapidly reduced by mitochondrial dehydrogenases of metabolically active yeast cells. Following the standard EUCAST E.Def 7.3.2 method, but with supplementation with 100 mg/liter of XTT plus 0.78 μM menadione in the growth medium and using single concentrations of 0.06 mg/liter anidulafungin (S breakpoint) or 16 mg/liter fluconazole (I breakpoint), respectively, significant differences between growth curves for susceptible and resistant strains were found within 7.5 h for fluconazole and 5 h for anidulafungin. The sensitivity/specificity for detection of resistant strains was 100%/94% for fluconazole and 91%/100% for anidulafungin.</para>
      <para id="ch0157s0000p0065">Although these methods are yet in development and not ready for routine use, it brings hope for an earlier detection of resistance in clinical practice, facilitating earlier appropriate therapy for patients with infections caused by isolates with acquired resistance.</para>

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0066">Molecular detection of resistance mechanisms has the potential to detect resistance but not susceptibility, because lack of detection of known and targeted mechanisms does not mean that other or novel mechanisms not targeted could not be present (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0165">165</link>). Multiple mechanisms lead to reduced susceptibility or overt resistance to azole antifungal drugs in <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species; these include changes in cell wall composition leading to reduced uptake, increased efflux, upregulation of target gene (<emphasis>erg11</emphasis>) production, and mutation in the target enzymes (see <ulink url="ch0156#ch0156s0001">chapter 134</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). One or more of these may be present in a cell, and stepwise acquisition appears to be common (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0166">166</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0167">167</link>). Thus, any method for molecular determination of azole resistance in <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> must be a multiplex system and must also be capable of determining not just the presence but the upregulation of housekeeping genes. Recent application of whole-genome sequencing techniques has facilitated detection of known resistance mutations, but such methods are currently the province of research laboratories (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0016">16</link>). Resistance to echinocandins usually centers on mutations of two hot-spot regions of the <emphasis>fks1</emphasis> and, for <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> specifically, also the <emphasis>fks2</emphasis> gene, although other mutations have been induced in the laboratory setting (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0078">78</link>). These are easier to detect by simple sequencing, including pyrosequencing (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0168">168</link>). A study attests to the utility of a Luminex-based multiplex assay that can be used for high-throughput screening and proved to be 100% concordant with DNA sequencing results on 102 isolates of <emphasis>C. glabrata</emphasis> with mutations in the FKS1 and FKS2 hot-spot domains (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0169">169</link>). However, molecular techniques are unable to detect previously uncharacterized mechanisms of resistance and thus should always be confirmed by phenotypic testing.</para>

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0072">Since nongerminated conidia are easier to prepare and standardize, this is the method of inoculum preparation described, and it is broadly similar in both documents. The main exception is that EUCAST suggests filtration of the inoculum with an 11-μm-pore-diameter filter to ensure the inoculum consists of conidia and not hyphal clumps. For the CLSI method, the inoculum for each isolate is prepared by first growing the mold on potato dextrose agar slants for 7 days at 35°C or until good sporulation is obtained, which may be 48 h for some genera. Each slant is then flooded with 1 ml of sterile 0.85% saline (addition of 0.01 ml of Tween 20 will help for<emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp.), and the surface of the colony is gently probed with the tip of the pipette. The resulting mixture is withdrawn, and the heavy particles are allowed to settle for 3 to 5 min. The upper homogeneous suspension, containing the mixture of nongerminated conidia or sporangiospores and hyphal fragments, is aliquoted and mixed for 15 s with a vortex. The turbidity is measured with a spectrophotometer at 530 nm, and the optical density is adjusted by addition of sterile saline to 0.09 to 0.13 for <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Paecilomyces</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Exophiala dermatitidis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Sporothrix schenckii</emphasis>; to 0.15 to 0.17 for <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>S. apiospermum, Verruconis gallopava</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Ochroconis gallopava</emphasis>), <emphasis>Cladophialophora bantiana</emphasis>, and mucoraceous molds; and to 0.25 to 0.3 for <emphasis>Curvularia, Bipolaris</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Alternaria</emphasis> spp. Stock inoculum suspensions are then diluted 1:50 in medium to obtain 2× the final inoculum of 0.4 × 10<superscript>4</superscript> to 5 × 10<superscript>4</superscript> CFU/ml. Certain genera (e.g., <emphasis>Scedosporium, Lomentospora, Curvularia, Bipolaris</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Alternaria</emphasis>) may require a lower (50%) dilution factor (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0039">39</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0073">The EUCAST E.Def 9.4 method differs by utilizing a higher inoculum, which is prepared by counting in a hemocytometer, except for<emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis>, for which spectrophotometric determination is a valid alternative, provided the conidia suspension is filtered and the spectrophotometer has been standardized against CFU counting for the species in question (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0041">41</link>). Conidia are harvested in 5 ml of sterile water plus 0.1% Tween 20 by rubbing 2- to 5-day growth at 35°C on potato dextrose agar, Sabouraud dextrose agar, YGC agar, or other suitable selective agar with the tip of a pipette/syringe and transferring it with the pipette/syringe to a sterile tube. Using a syringe for harvest will allow direct filtering through an 11-μm-pore-size filter attached to the syringe and results in a “hyphal clump free” suspension in a single step. Alternatively, a damp sterile cotton swab could be used to gently touch the culture. The suspension is then homogenized on a vortex mixer for 15 s. The resulting suspension is diluted as appropriate for hemocytometer counting. Suspensions containing clumps should be vortexed for a further 15 s and, if hyphae are present, should be filtered through an 11-μm-pore-size filter. The inoculum is adjusted with sterile distilled water to give a 2 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> to 5 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> CFU/ml suspension, which is diluted 1:10 with sterile distilled water to obtain a final working inoculum of 2 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> to 5 × 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml and must be used within 30 min.</para>

Most mucoraceous molds should be read at 24 h and most other opportunistic fungi at 48 h; occasionally, 72 to 74 h may be required to allow sufficient growth in the control wells. Testing of the dimorphic fungi should only be undertaken at the designated hazard containment level (biosafety level 3) for the organism and may require 5 to 7 days of incubation. The MIC endpoint criterion for molds is the lowest drug concentration that shows complete growth inhibition when testing amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole determined visually, except for EUCAST testing of<emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis>, where spectrophotometric MIC reading with 90% inhibition endpoint is a validated alternative (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0170">170</link>–<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0173">173</link>).

        <para id="ch0157s0000p0076">When the echinocandins are tested, most<emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> isolates show trailing growth, and conventional MIC determination could categorize these trailing isolates as resistant to caspofungin. A more careful examination of the microdilution wells may reveal the presence of compact, round microcolonies. Under microscopic examination, these microcolonies correspond to significant morphologic alterations. The hyphae grow abnormally as short, highly branched filaments with swollen germ tubes. Kurtz and colleagues (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0174">174</link>) defined the concentration of drug producing these morphologic changes as the minimum effective concentration (MEC), to distinguish it from conventional MICs. A multicenter study demonstrated that caspofungin MECs were reliable endpoints in 14 of 17 laboratories (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0175">175</link>), and in another study in 8 of these laboratories, evaluating anidulafungin MECs against a variety of mold species provided reliable endpoints (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0176">176</link>).

However, it is notable that broth microdilution testing failed to identify an animal-model-confirmed resistant isolate from a patient failing therapy as non-wild type, even though this isolate failed to produce an inhibition ellipse with a caspofungin Etest strip (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0178">178</link>). Consequently, because conflicting results have been reported from some laboratories, caution and further refinement of this testing approach are needed (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0175">175</link>).</para>

The consensus epidemiological cutoff results were ≤1.0 mg/liter for itraconazole and voriconazole. For isavuconazole, the EUCAST ECOFF was 2 mg/liter, whereas the CLSI ECV was 1 mg/liter (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0202">202</link>). CLSI has set clinical breakpoints for voriconazole against <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> of S, ≤0.5 mg/liter and R, ≥2 mg/liter. The EUCAST clinical breakpoints were revised after the introduction of the revised I category, meaning susceptible increased exposure and not “intermediate/indeterminable/I-don’t-know.” For itraconazole and voriconazole, the S breakpoint was set at the ECOFF (S, ≤1 mg/liter), but for posaconazole and isavuconazole the S breakpoints were set conservatively one step below the ECOFF. This reflected pharmcokinetic/pharmacodynamic data suggesting that the wild-type MIC is only just covered, and that isolates with posaconazole MIC of 0.25 mg/liter or isavuconazole MIC of 2 mg/liter may both represent either wild-type or <emphasis>cyp51A</emphasis> target mutants of <emphasis>A. fumigatus.</emphasis> A posaconazole MIC of 0.25 mg/liter and isavuconazole of 2 mg/liter are therefore in an area of technical uncertainty (ATU) and should be reported as susceptible if susceptible to a marker agent (itraconazole for posaconazole; voriconazole for isavuconazole) (<link linkend="ch0157s0000a0113">Table 8</link>).</para>

Azole resistance in <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> isolates has been associated with target gene mutations (<emphasis>cyp51A</emphasis> gene), efflux pumps, and upregulation of the target gene and with HapE mutations (see <ulink url="ch0156#ch0156s0001">chapter 134</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). CYP51A alterations may confer resistance to itraconazole only or to itraconazole and posaconazole, or may induce pan-azole resistance.

The Netherlands has the highest rates of TR<subscript>34</subscript>/L98H and TR<subscript>46</subscript>/Y121F/T289A and was the first country to revise the national treatment guidelines recommending combination therapy as the first-line therapy due to high levels (&gt;10%) of resistance (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0204">204</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0205">205</link>). This has been linked to the significant environmental use of azoles for plant protection, and a correlation of frequency of such resistant isolates in the environment with the proportional global use of antifungal pesticides has been established (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0206">206</link>). Resistance frequencies for azoles therefore vary. (For recent reviews, see reference <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0009">9</link> and <ulink url="ch0156#ch0156s0001">chapter 134</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis>) TR<subscript>34</subscript>/L98H is multi-azole resistant with particularly elevated itraconazole MICs. TR<subscript>46</subscript>/Y121F/T289A displays notably high-level voriconazole and isavuconazole resistance but variable itraconazole and posaconazole susceptibility (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0207">207</link>).

      <para id="ch0157s0000p0087">Susceptibility testing of dermatophytes has lagged behind that of other molds, but EUCAST has recently introduced a standardized method, E.Def 11.0, and the CLSI M38-Ed3 broth microdilution method has been successfully adapted, with minor modifications, to the testing of dermatophytes (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0214">214</link>). The CLSI method modifications include the use of oatmeal agar for <emphasis>Trichophyton rubrum</emphasis> for inoculum preparation, to induce conidium formation, and 4 to 5 days of incubation at 35°C for MIC determination (visual 80% growth inhibition endpoints). Two isolates of <emphasis>Trichophyton</emphasis> spp. have been validated as CLSI reference strains (<link linkend="ch0157s0000a0048">Table 4</link>). The EUCAST E.Def 11.0 method for the testing of microconidia-forming dermatophytes has been designed to be able to take advantage of the antifungal drug-containing microtiter plates prepared for mold testing, while rendering the medium selective for dermatophyte growth to reduce the risk of bacterial or yeast contamination that otherwise might be a problem due to the longer incubation time needed for dermatophytes (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0046">46</link>). Consequently, the inoculum is prepared as according to the EUCAST mold document but supplemented with cycloheximide and chloramphenicol in an amount that results in a double-strength final concentration (100 mg/liter of chloramphenicol and 600 mg/liter of cycloheximide, respectively). This allows further dilution when the inoculum is added to the test plate, resulting in a final concentration of 50 mg/liter of chloramphenicol and 300 mg/liter of cycloheximide in the inoculated plate. Examples with preparations of 8- and 12-ml inoculum volumes are shown in <anchor id="ch0157s0000a0133"/><link linkend="ch0157s0000a0135">Table 9</link>. The inoculated microtiter plates are incubated at 25 to 28°C for 5 (to a maximum of 7 days) and the MIC is read by a spectrophotometer at 50% growth inhibition, which renders the method user-friendly and avoids variation related to the subjective experience-dependent visual endpoint reading adopted by CLSI. Two isolates of <emphasis>Trichophyton</emphasis> spp. have been validated as EUCAST QC strains with associated tentative MIC targets and ranges (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0215">215</link>).

Since standard MIC methods are not available, the size of the inoculum varies among the different studies. Such methods are particularly useful for the high throughput required for environmental surveillance and for initial and early screening for azole resistance of clinical cultures, because testing can be done directly from the primary plate before a pure culture is available.</para>

The echinocandin agar screening plate has two wells with echinocandins (anidulafungin 0.25 mg/liter and micafungin 0.125 mg/liter) and a control well.

Of note, azoles are fungicidal against <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> but echinocandins are not. Hence, the susceptibility endpoints differ from one another. For azoles it is a no-growth endpoint for susceptibility, provided sufficient growth is observed on the drug-free control agar after 48 h, but for echinocandins the endpoint is an aberrant colony morphology endpoint. In detail, the endpoint for echinocandin susceptibility is a disk-like growth without a halo of radiating hyphae, in contrast to the growth control characterized by a halo of radiating fluffy hyphal growth from the denser center of the colony (photos of agars are available in the E.Def 10.2 method document freely available at the EUCAST website). Associated QC strains have been chosen and included in the EUCAST QC document and are available from the CCUG culture collection (<ulink url="http://www.ccug.se">www.ccug.se</ulink>). The use of such screening plates may reduce the number of isolates that need further reference testing by 90% and at the same time provide an early indication of azole susceptibility patterns.

In contrast to what is observed with yeasts, the azoles appear to have a certain degree of fungicidal activity, as mentioned above, for a variety of common and rare opportunistic mold pathogens. MFCs of &lt;0.03 to &gt;16 mg/liter have been reported with the triazoles for various mold species (<link linkend="ch0157s0000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0157s0000li0075">75</link>). However, standardization of this procedure is needed to reliably assess the potential value of the MFC endpoint in patient management. These standardization efforts should include the correlation of <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> results with the clearing of target organs of the infecting organism in animal models and the further clinical relevance of MFC data. Studies incorporating an indicator of metabolic activity [2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide] in microdilution broth-based formats examined fungicidal activity of amphotericin B and voriconazole and revealed a concentration-dependent sigmoid pattern of fungicidal effects. Such developments will need careful evaluation and standardization.</para>

        <para id="ch0157s0000p0103">A great deal of progress has been achieved in the field of antifungal susceptibility testing with both yeast and filamentous fungi since testing began in earnest in the early 1980s. Standardized broth macrodilution and microdilution methods are available for testing molds and yeasts, as are standardized disk diffusion methods for systemically active antifungal drugs. Progress is also being made in establishing the relationship between test results and patient responses to therapy in varied clinical settings and with many of the currently available antifungal agents. Breakpoints are available for common yeast species with most systemically active drugs, and the list of EUCAST breakpoints for<emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp. is growing and includes values for most agents against <emphasis>A. fumigatus.</emphasis> Moreover, some commercial methods have been approved for the antifungal susceptibility testing of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> spp., but care should be taken in selecting appropriate breakpoints based on the ECOFF/ECV for these methods, which may vary from those produced by the standardized reference tests. Often, identifying the yeast or mold pathogen to the species level is sufficient to direct initial therapy, and MALDI-TOF methods have vastly decreased turnaround time to identification especially for yeast (see <ulink url="ch0155#ch0155s0001">chapter 133</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). The introduction of MALDI-TOF-based susceptibility testing methods has enormous potential for the rapid identification of drug-resistant yeast isolates even directly from positive blood culture bottles. Given the increasing problem of resistance to azole antifungals in <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> in many countries, the use of drug-containing screening agars is to be encouraged for primary isolates to provide an early indication of resistance while isolates are being purified for reference testing. The strong move toward consensus in the standardized methodology employed and the principles by which breakpoints are selected in the United States and Europe has meant that internationally agreed-upon breakpoints can be applied for some drug-fungus combinations. Finally, molecular resistance detection of environmental azole resistance in <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> and the dominant mechanisms behind terbinafine resistance in <emphasis>Trichophyton</emphasis> spp. facilitate testing in laboratories with less mycology experience and also for some culture-negative cases. This has helped to improve surveillance of resistance patterns worldwide and will help in the further development of clinically relevant breakpoints, although it is important to keep in mind that molecular tools can detect resistance but not susceptibility.</para>
