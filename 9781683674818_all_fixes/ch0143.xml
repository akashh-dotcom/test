      <para id="ch0143s0001p0002">Fungi in the genus<emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> are extracellular, host-obligate, mostly host-specific, and typically restricted to the lung tissues of mammals, although extrapulmonary manifestations have been reported (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0002">2</link>). Once known collectively by the single genus and species “<emphasis>Pneumocystis carinii</emphasis>,” it is now understood that distinct species of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> infect different mammalian hosts. Current evidence suggests that <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> can exist with little consequence in hosts with intact immune systems (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0003">3</link>), but debilitation of the immune system, induced by various means including infectious or immunosuppressive agents, congenital defects, malnutrition, and more recently by treatment with new immunotherapeutics (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0004">4</link>), can lead to organism proliferation within the lung alveoli, and potentially a lethal pneumonia if untreated. No species of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> can be cultivated continuously outside the mammalian lung, impeding diagnostic capabilities as well as basic scientific research. Limited therapy is available with which to treat the pneumonia since these fungi are not susceptible to such antifungal drugs as the azoles or the polyenes. The echinocandins selectively target the asci (previously called “cysts”), which has led to new revelations about effective treatment and prophylaxis (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0006">6</link>), discussed below. Recent studies on the life cycle of these fungi provide compelling evidence that asci are the agents of transmission (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0007">7</link>) and that the apparent asexual cycle may not always be in operation (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0009">9</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0143s0001s0001p0001">Taxonomic problems have plagued the organisms known as “<emphasis>Pneumocystis carinii</emphasis>” since their original description in 1909 by Carlos Chagas, who mistakenly identified the “cyst” forms as life cycle stages of the protozoan parasite <emphasis>Trypanosoma cruzi.</emphasis> In 1914, these organisms were provided an identity of their own and given the binomial epithet that reflected their predilection for the lung, <emphasis>pneumo-</emphasis>; the characteristic morphological form, <emphasis>-cystis</emphasis>; and, to honor the Italian investigator Antonio Carini, who provided the slides for study, <emphasis>carinii.</emphasis> At the time of identification, the <emphasis>P. carinii</emphasis> organisms were presumed to be protozoan parasites; the question of their potential fungal nature was first raised in the 1950s, and the controversy of their protozoan or fungal nature continued to the late 20th century The protozoan term “cyst” has been replaced with the more appropriate fungal term, “ascus,” and “trophozoite” with “trophic form” (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0010">10</link>).

        <para id="ch0143s0001s0001p0003"><emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> species all appear to contain similar life cycle stages, although the clusters of organisms removed from the lungs of the different host species can vary in presentation and size. For example, clusters of <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> (pronounced “yee-row-vetsee”) obtained from human patients can be much larger than those obtained from rodent lungs, stain more intensely with Wright-Giemsa-like stains, and form multilayered “mats” composed of several layers of organisms that hinder identification of individual life cycle stages (see <anchor id="ch0143s0001s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3B</link> and <link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">D</link>for example). The term “<emphasis>Pneumocystis carinii</emphasis>” was thought to represent a single zoonotic species until 1976, at which time Frenkel described serological differences between human- and rat-derived organisms that he suggested were representative of distinct species (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0013">13</link>). It is now clear that the organism first identified as “<emphasis>Pneumocystis carinii</emphasis>” is a collection of many species within the genus <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> that likely number in the hundreds to thousands. Almost every mammal examined to date appears to harbor at least one species of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> that is not found in any other mammal. It should be noted that host specificity associated with the <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> species has been questioned in certain mammalian species (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0014">14</link>). To date, five <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> species have been formally described according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature: <emphasis>Pneumocystis carinii</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. wakefieldiae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0015">15</link>) are found in rats; <emphasis>P. murina</emphasis> is found in the lungs of mice (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0016">16</link>); <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> is found in humans (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0017">17</link>); and <emphasis>P. oryctolagi</emphasis> resides in rabbits (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0018">18</link>). The name <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis>, though first resisted by some groups, has gained widespread acceptance within the scientific and clinical communities, with a strong endorsement by <emphasis>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</emphasis> in 2007 (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0019">19</link>). The shorthand abbreviation for the pneumonia in humans has changed from PCP/PcP to PJP.

        <para id="ch0143s0001s0002p0001">The terminology used to describe the various life cycle stages of<emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> bears remnants of its earlier classification as a protozoan parasite. This discussion uses terms more suitable for its fungal identity but, for continuity, identifies those commonly found in the literature. Three developmental forms are generally recognized: the trophic form (trophozoite), 1 to 4 μm (<anchor id="ch0143s0001s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0143s0002a0004">Fig. 1A</link>); the sporocyte (precyst), 5 to 6 μm (<link linkend="ch0143s0002a0004">Fig. 1B</link>); and the ascus (cyst), 5 to 8 μm (<link linkend="ch0143s0002a0004">Fig. 1C</link> through E) (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0022">22</link>–<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0023">23</link>). <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> spp. reproduce extracellularly within the mammalian lung alveoli. The trophic forms appear ameboid in shape in some electron micrographs, but in freshly prepared specimens they are ellipsoidal and often occur in clusters with other trophic forms and developmental stages. The nucleus and often the mitochondrion are visible in rapid Wright-Giemsa-stained specimens by light microscopy. The trophic forms do not stain with fungal stains designed to complex with the cell wall, such as methenamine silver. The sporocyte is smaller than the mature ascus and frequently oval. This stage contains a rigid cell wall that is lacking in the trophic forms and is stained with methenamine and other fungal wall stains. At the sporocyte stage, the nuclei are at varying levels of nuclear division (from four to eight nuclei) but have not yet been compartmentalized into separate spore structures. Aggregates of mitochondrion can also be seen in this stage. The mature ascus is spherical in shape, contains eight spores (although these may not all be visible with traditional light microscopy), and displays a thick cell wall that excludes certain stains such as the rapid Wright-Giemsa. Asci can be visualized with cell wall-complexing stains such as methenamine silver. The ascus is considered the diagnostic morphological form. All developmental forms are often found in large, multilayered, tightly adherent aggregates or clusters in clinical specimens, making identification of each stage difficult (see <link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3B</link> and <anchor id="ch0143s0001s0002a0004"/>D).</para>

        <para id="ch0143s0001s0003p0001">Early animal studies showed that<emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> infection was likely transmitted by an airborne route. Immunosuppressed, <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>-free rats could acquire the infection from infected rats housed in the same room or from infected cage mates (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0024">24</link>). Air sampling studies using quantitative PCR, conducted around patients admitted with <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> pneumonia (PJP), showed the highest levels of detection within 1 m of the patients’ heads (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0025">25</link>). Although levels decreased with increasing distance from the patient source, samples were still positive in corridors outside the patients’ rooms. Importantly, the genotypes of the <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> infecting the patients were the same as the genotypes outside the immediate patient area, confirming that the potential sources of transmission were these patients. These data provide evidence that supports historical and more recent descriptions of outbreaks in renal transplant units (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0026">26</link>–<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0028">28</link>) and other clinical settings where patient-to-patient transmission can occur, such as among heart transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0029">29</link>). These studies support animal studies and human genotypic analyses demonstrating that most clinical episodes of disease occur because of re-exposure to the organism rather than reactivation of latent infection (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0030">30</link>–<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0032">32</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0143s0002p0001">Histochemical and ultrastructural studies form the basis of the current understanding of the life cycle of<emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> spp., due to a historic lack of a long-term cultivation method outside the lung. Thus, any life cycle should be considered presumptive until it is possible to perform definitive kinetic analyses. There is no evidence for an intracellular phase, although the organisms can be frequently observed within macrophages as a result of the host response to the infection. Despite numerous attempts to find an environmental cycle or external reservoir for <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>, none has been identified. However, a recent study reported the presence of <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> by PCR in electrostatic dust collectors in homes of COPD patients (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0033">33</link>), though this may have simply been due to collection of airborne particles and not a true reservoir.

The various life cycle stages of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> are most often found together in large adherent clusters that resemble biofilms <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0143s0002a0006">Fig. 2B</link> and <anchor id="ch0143s0002a0006"/>D). The <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> formation of biofilms by <emphasis>P. murina</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. carinii</emphasis> provides support for the formation of these structures <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis>, which could be responsible for intransigent infections that are unresponsive to current therapies (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0035">35</link>). Trophic forms are presumed to be the vegetative stages of the <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> life cycle and reproduce asexually by binary fission, not budding as most yeasts do. Recently, the role of binary fission in the life cycle has been called into question, with the suggestion that it may be facultative and not required for replication (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0008">8</link>). A process of “endogeny” has also been suggested as a reproductive process for trophic forms, which would result in a large trophic form containing several smaller trophic forms, but this has been reported in only two studies (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0037">37</link>). There is strong genomic evidence that <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> spp. participate in the sexual mode of reproduction using a process referred to as primary homothallism, whereby a single self-compatible mating type can enter the sexual cycle on its own (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0009">9</link>). Several fungal meiosis-specific and mating type gene homologs have been identified in genomic <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> analyses (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0038">38</link>). The finding that <emphasis>P. jirovecii, P. murina</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. carinii</emphasis> all contain a single genomic region with only three genes involved in differentiation lends credence to the existence of a homothallic sexual cycle (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0039">39</link>).</para>

(C) Putative sexual cycle of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>: haploid trophic forms with mating receptors Map3 and Mam2 (“M”) fuse and undergo karyogamy, resulting in a diploid zygote; the zygote then undergoes meiosis, resulting in four nuclei; an additional postmeiotic mitosis increases the number of nuclei to eight; and the nuclei and mitochondria (not shown) are compartmentalized by invagination of the inner plasma membrane, resulting in eight spores within an individual ascus sporulation.

(E) The asexual replication cycle of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> is undergoing reconsideration.

      <para id="ch0143s0002p0003">As shown in<link linkend="ch0143s0002a0006">Fig. 2</link>, after the mating process, nuclear fusion occurs and is followed by meiosis and sporogenesis, resulting in formation of the sporocyte (previously called the “precyst”). Following meiosis, an additional mitotic replication occurs, with subsequent compartmentalization of the nuclei and organelles into eight ascospores (previously called “sporozoites”). The product of sporogenesis is the spherical ascus, containing the eight spores. The mode of spore release has not been fully described but may follow a process of dehiscence, releasing all spores at once using weaknesses in the cell wall. Localized thickening at one pole of the ascus has been observed, as well as “rents” in the cell wall after spore release, supporting this theory of the process of spore release (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0008">8</link>).

The median incubation time was estimated to be 53 days, with a range of 7 to 188 days.

The effects of the presence of low numbers of <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> on the host have yet to be determined, and the role of carriage in mild respiratory infections, chronic lung disease, and progression to PJP is now being actively investigated. The most common underlying conditions associated with the presence of <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> in non-HIV-positive individuals include asthma and chronic lung diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, Epstein-Barr virus infection, lupus erythematosus, high-dose corticosteroid therapy, anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapies for rheumatoid arthritis, thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis, and pregnancy. In a recent study of patients with COPD, lower BMI, higher IL-17, and CD62P were risk factors for colonization in this population (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0033">33</link>).

In patients with cancer and other non-HIV diseases, there has been little improvement in mortality rates, and often these patients fare more poorly than patients with HIV. In one such study, the mortality of non-HIV-infected patients with PJP was 48% while HIV-infected patients experienced a 17% mortality (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0081">81</link>). In a recent study which analyzed hospitalized patients with PJP, the mortality rates were significantly higher for non-immunocompromised patients versus patients who were immunocompromised (71.4% versus 43.9%) (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0082">82</link>). The immunocompromised patient populations included those with HIV infection; hematological malignancies; solid organ tumors treated with chemotherapy; rheumatic diseases; or medication with immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and biologicals including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, or vedolizumab. Patients with at least one of the criteria were referred to as “immunocompromised” (IC). Patients who were negative for those criteria were defined as non-immunocompromised (non-IC). Reasons for this disparity in mortality rates were the advanced age of the non-IC patients and their lower response to anti-PJP therapy within the 90-day survival time. Within the IC patient group, 90-day mortality rates were lowest in the HIV-infected group. Several factors were associated with the increased survival including younger age of the HIV-infected patients; less frequent ventilation; lower neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); less severe lung injury; and adjuvant corticosteroids shown to reduce mortality in HIV-infected patients.</para>

      <para id="ch0143s0012p0001">Sputum collection is best done in a centralized facility by pulmonary function laboratory technicians, respiratory therapists, or specially trained assistants. Deep inhalation of nebulized 3% sodium chloride solution by the patient will result in osmotic accumulation of fluid in and irritation of the respiratory passages with subsequent coughing and expectoration of bronchoalveolar contents. The patient should vigorously brush the teeth, tongue, and gums with a toothbrush and normal saline for 5 to 10 minutes prior to sputum induction, followed by thorough rinsing, to remove as much cellular debris of oral origin as possible. Toothpaste should not be used, as it can interfere with subsequent processing and staining of the specimen. The induced sputum specimen is usually mucoid and translucent in appearance; only rarely is it purulent. When<emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> clusters are present in the unstained sputum, they are typically 0.1 to 0.2 mm in diameter and cream to light tan in color. Sputum smeared directly on slides and subsequently stained was shown to be a less sensitive method than treatment with a mucolytic agent followed by concentration of the specimen (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0101">101</link>).</para>

Some protocols require the addition of a clearing reagent for optimal results (e.g., the Light Diagnostics <emphasis>Pneumocystis carinii</emphasis> DFA Kit 3195 [Millipore Sigma, Billerica, MA]). The specimen is then concentrated by centrifugation at 3,000 × <emphasis>g</emphasis> for 5 min and the sediment is smeared on glass slides, which are air dried and heat fixed by exposure to a heating block (50 to 60°C). Prolonged heat fixation is important in fixing the material to the slide (~30 min), since most of the natural cellular adhesions are removed during mucolysis. Slides containing the fixed material are then stained and examined microscopically (see below). Samples can be concentrated using a Cytospin centrifuge as described for BALF (above).</para>

      <para id="ch0143s0013p0001">Open thorax lung biopsy is the most invasive of the sampling procedures and is not routinely performed. Under current laboratory assay conditions, this technique has no greater sensitivity than less invasive sampling (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0098">98</link>). However, should the laboratory receive such a specimen, the tissue should be blotted onto sterile gauze to reduce excess fluid (which would interfere with a diagnostic imprint) and used to make touch imprints by pressing several cut surfaces onto sterile glass slides. The remainder of the tissue can be used for histological sections, for microbiological cultures, or for nucleic acid extractions and subsequent PCR techniques. Glass slides with touch imprints should be air dried and then treated with absolute methanol or fixatives included in commercial kits of rapid Wright-Giemsa-like stains, such as Protocol Hema 3 (Fisher Scientific Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Infected tissue stained in this manner will reveal the presence of clusters of trophic forms and asci with reddish purple nuclei and blue cytoplasm; asci are surrounded by a halo of dye exclusion (<link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3D</link>) (see “Microscopic Identification” for a more detailed description). Slides should be fixed in acetone or a vendor-recommended fixative for immunofluorescent staining. Alternatively, a more concentrated sample can be achieved by tissue homogenization using tabletop instruments like the gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) following vendor recommendations for tissue type and weights. Slides are prepared with 10-μl drops of the homogenate, which are then air dried, fixed, and stained as desired.</para>

      <para id="ch0143s0016p0001">A variety of stains have been used for the identification of<emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> organisms. One of the most common stains used by pathologists for tissue sections, hematoxylin and eosin, does not stain the organism but rather the foamy exudates within the lung alveoli, often described as honeycombed in appearance. Stains that illustrate the morphology of the organism by microscopic examination are those used for diagnosis in the clinical laboratory.</para>
      <para id="ch0143s0016p0002">A common staining procedure used for the diagnosis of PJP is methenamine silver, which also stains other fungi (<link linkend="ch0143s0011a0004">Table 1</link>; <link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3C</link>). Cell wall and membrane polysaccharides of fungi are oxidized to aldehydes by treatment with periodic acid; the aldehydes in turn reduce the silver ion to metallic silver at alkaline pH. Addition of gold salts stabilizes the complex, and excess silver is removed by a sodium thiosulfate rinse. Variations of the methenamine silver stain (e.g., Grocott, Gomori) are used for both tissue sections and bodily fluids such as BALF or induced sputum (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0105">105</link>–<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0107">107</link>). Disadvantages to the use of the silver staining process have been the instability of solutions, the capricious nature of the metal impregnation, and the length of time required for staining (1 to 2 h or 6 to 24 h; see <link linkend="ch0143s0011a0004">Table 1</link>). These disadvantages have been largely overcome with kits using standardized laboratory microwave ovens for controlled processing and supplied reagents (e.g., Gomori’s Methenamine Silver staining, rapid microbiology, Co. Cork, Ireland; Gomori’s Methenamine Silver Staining Kit for Fungi Detection, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Unlike other pathogenic fungi, <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> does not bud, and this feature can be used to discriminate between these organisms and other fungi found in the lung that do bud, e.g., <emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum.</emphasis> Silver-stained asci have a distinctive, black, cup-shaped morphology against green-colored host cell architecture. In some staining reactions, wall thickenings appear as a double-comma morphology in asci. More often, the folds in the wall stain a dark brown to black to produce a crinkled, raisin-like appearance (<link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3C</link>). Spores cannot be seen with this stain, and asci that are empty (nonviable) appear the same as those with the full contingent of eight spores.</para>
      <anchor id="ch0143s0016a0003"/>
      <beginpage pagenum="2369"/>
      <para id="ch0143s0016p0003">Other stains that complex with components of the ascus wall include periodic acid-Schiff, toluidine blue, cresyl echt violet, and calcofluor. The reactions to some of the more commonly used stains are described in<link linkend="ch0143s0011a0004">Table 1</link>. Cresyl echt violet stain produces results similar to toluidine blue O (<link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3E</link>) and has the same drawbacks as the methenamine silver stain, since a mixture of sulfuric acid and glacial acetic acid is necessary for the step prior to staining with the dye. Asci stained by toluidine blue are similar in appearance to those stained with methenamine silver, except for the light purple color. Staining with calcofluor, whether in commercial kits (e.g., Fungi-fluor; Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) or prepared in-house, can produce variable effects. Though calcofluor staining is designed to detect only the asci, a characteristic double-parentheses staining body within the asci is often observed (<link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3A</link>). Excitation in the UV range (340 to 380 nm) with a suppression filter of 430 nm produces a fluorescent blue color that is not as intense and is sometimes difficult to visualize. Refer to the vendor instructions for optimal filter requirements.</para>
      <para id="ch0143s0016p0004">In contrast to the asci wall stains, Giemsa and rapid Giemsa-like stains do not stain the ascus wall, but instead stain the nuclei of all the various life cycle stages a reddish purple and the cytoplasm a light blue (<link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3B</link>). The ascus wall excludes the dyes and appears with a circumscribed clear zone surrounding the reddish-purple nuclei of the spores within. Note the thick mat type of appearance, characteristic of the human infection. Lung cells are often present; their nuclei are much larger than those of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> and stain a deep reddish purple (<link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3B</link>). The rapid variants of the Giemsa stain are recommended for the diagnosis of PJP using BALF, induced sputum, or impression imprints because of the low cost, ease, and rapidity of the staining procedure. Commercial kits such as PROTOCOL Hema 3 (Fisher Scientific Co., Cincinnati, OH) produce similar results. The staining procedure requires less than a minute to perform and all forms of the organism are detected. Since there are approximately 10-fold more trophic forms than asci, the sensitivity of detection is likely to be increased. This stain also permits assessment of specimen quality of BALFs by demonstration of host alveolar macrophages, which should be present in a productive sample. In addition, the distinctive Giemsa-stained morphological appearance of other organisms likely to be encountered in the lung environment, such as <emphasis>H. capsulatum</emphasis>, permits rapid diagnosis of pulmonary infections caused by these pathogens which may not be detected with other stains. Because background host cells will also stain, training and expertise in interpreting cellular elements in Giemsa-stained preparations is necessary. Laboratories with a lower volume of <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> specimens may prefer to use immunofluorescent staining or one of the other stains described in <link linkend="ch0143s0011a0004">Table 1</link>.</para>
      <para id="ch0143s0016p0005">Direct and indirect fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal anti-<emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> antibodies used for immunofluorescent assay (IFA) are targeted to a family of surface glycoproteins that contain both common and distinct epitopes, within and among <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> species (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0108">108</link>). Depending on the monoclonal antibody supplied with the kit, staining may target only the asci or all forms of the organism. Since trophic forms are more numerous than asci, kits using antibodies directed to all forms of the organism, such as Millipore/Sigma’s LIGHT DIAGNOSTICS <emphasis>Pneumocystis carinii</emphasis> DFA Kit or Bio-Rad’s MONOFLUO <emphasis>Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis> IFA Test Kit (direct immunofluorescence assays for the detection of all <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> life cycle forms), are more sensitive. The typical fluorophore conjugated to the antibody or used in an indirect assay is fluorescein isothiocyanate, which produces a brilliant apple-green color. The staining reaction shows a diffuse surface pattern distributed over the entire cluster of organisms (<link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3F</link>) and often stains the matrix in which the organisms are embedded. Single asci will usually appear with a distinctive rim of fluorescence and duller interior fluorescence. It should be noted that kits using a direct staining procedure may not react with <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> on slides fixed in ethanol, and fixation in acetone or vendor recommendations for fixation should be followed.</para>
      <para id="ch0143s0016p0006">Papanicolaou’s stain, frequently used for cytopathological specimens, stains the clusters of extracellular organisms a greenish color, although thick clusters of organisms can collect the stain and appear bicolored with pink to purple and green/turquoise staining as in<link linkend="ch0143s0001s0002a0004">Fig. 3D</link>. A diagnostic criterion is the presence of distinctive alveolar casts, as shown in panel D. Organism architecture is better observed with the Giemsa-like stains. Gram’s stain produces a negative (pink) reaction with poorly defined organism morphology.</para>
      <para id="ch0143s0016p0007">However, it is worth noting that low fungal burden, which would limit the microscopic observations found especially in the non-HIV population, could lead to false negatives and missed diagnosis.

Note that highly viscous samples must be treated with dithiothreitol before processing. The limit of detection is 10 copies/ml of a plasmid per PCR that equated to 500 copies/ml in BALF. Accurate quantitation was observed over a 7- to 8-log range. This fully automated method showed a good quantitative correlation with the reference PCR (R<superscript>2</superscript> = 0.82). This method permits pre-aliquoting of PCR reagents; allows the use of the entire system outside a specified PCR area, reducing cross-contamination; and requires little technician input, reducing potential human error.

In many cases, the fungi are present as large clusters of organisms, in which it may be difficult to differentiate the life cycle stages within the dense assemblage by using the Wright-Giemsa or Papanicolaou stains. Because of this, it is recommended that a stain which only visualizes the ascus form of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> (e.g., Gomori methenamine silver) be used for diagnosis because it is easier to interpret. IFA can be helpful in laboratories that are less familiar with <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> morphology, but this requires a fluorescent microscope, which may not always be available. The outcome of IFA staining depends on the monoclonal antibody target. Some kits use monoclonal antibodies targeting the surface glycoprotein present on all of the life cycle stages, but these also stain the dense matrix in which <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> is embedded, resulting in a highly fluorescent mass, though in some cases the asci can be differentiated by a dark halo in the center. Since there are no other species of the genus that are known to cause this pneumonia in humans, the presence of these fungi can be reported as <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> or <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> spp. The name “<emphasis>Pneumocystis carinii</emphasis>” should not be used, as this species infects rats and not humans. Treatment should be initiated upon demonstration of <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> by microscopic methods and/or positive signals with approved PCR kits, and based on clinical evaluation of the patient. Moderate to severe PJP is treated with a combination of corticosteroids and intravenous TMP-SMX, clindamycin/primaquine, or pentamidine. Mild to moderate PJP is treated with TMP/SMX, TMP-dapsone, pentamidine, atovaquone, or clindamycin/primaquine (<link linkend="ch0143s0018s0006li0093">93</link>).</para>
