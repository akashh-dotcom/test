      <para id="ch0030s0001p0001">The effective use of disinfection and sterilization procedures is important in patient care and laboratory settings. Inadequate disinfection and sterilization procedures may lead to health care-associated and laboratory-acquired infections. The selection of procedures and disinfectants is dependent on several factors: the presence and amount of organic soil, the degree of microbial killing required, the nature and characteristics of the surface(s) to be treated, material compatibilities, surface contamination and access (e.g., the presence and size of device lumens), the intended use of the item, disposal requirements, cost of the item, and the ease of procedure performance. This chapter also discusses international consensus standards related to disinfection and sterilization in the health care environment.</para>

      <para id="ch0030s0002p0001">Sterilization is a process used to render a surface or product free from viable microorganisms. Only a limited number of technologies (which may be referred to as “sterilants,” or physical/chemical agents capable of sterilization) are widely used for sterilization. The most common methods in laboratory applications use heat, either as steam under pressure or as dry heat. Other sterilization processes include ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma radiation and E-beam radiation) and different types of gas processes such as those based on ethylene oxide or hydrogen peroxide (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). Sterilization may be important for the preparation of sterile supplies (such as culture media), for the treatment of contaminated wastes, or for other health care facility-based applications, such as the preparation of medical instruments for surgical use. Often, the maintenance of a sterile state following sterilization (as in the case of culture media) is as important to consider as the sterilization process itself. In many of these cases, the product to be sterilized is maintained within a sterile barrier system (when applicable) that preserves the sterile state following the sterilization process (e.g., during storage or transportation). The sterilization process itself is generally conducted under defined conditions that have been developed to ensure an “overkill” of target microorganisms. For this reason, a prerequisite for sterilization is the demonstration of broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, viruses, protozoa, and particularly bacterial spores (which are considered the form of microorganisms most resistant to inactivation). Following that, the sterilization process is developed and validated to ensure that it meets the requirements for the intended use.</para>

      <para id="ch0030s0003p0001">Disinfection can be any antimicrobial process used to remove, destroy, or inactivate microorganisms on surfaces or in liquids to a level previously specified for its intended use (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). Disinfection applications can include a wide range of surfaces and liquids. Note that filtration technologies may be considered disinfection processes because they physically remove microorganisms (depending on their size or surface affinity), even though they may not have any intrinsic antimicrobial activity. Unlike sterilization, disinfection may be considered only a reduction of the numbers and types of viable microorganisms (or bioburden). Although disinfection in some applications may be sufficient to render a surface or liquid free of microorganisms, it may not be assumed to be sterile as a result. Disinfection can be achieved by a variety of chemical or physical processes or combinations of these (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). Physical processes also include heat (typically by temperatures of ≥70°C [158°F]) and nonionizing radiation, such as UV light (wavelength range, 200 to 320 nm), over time. Chemicals widely used for disinfection include alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, and oxidizing agents (e.g., chlorine, iodine, and hydrogen peroxide) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). It is important to note that many chemical disinfectants are generally provided as formulations, or mixtures that include active antimicrobials and nonactive excipients. Such formulations are developed to optimize the activity and stability of the product over its shelf life. Therefore, they can range in antimicrobial activity, instructions for use, and safety label claims despite having similar types or concentrations of antimicrobials. Disinfectants and disinfection processes can be effective against many types of microorganisms, depending on the type of antimicrobial, its formulation or exposure conditions, and its use. Because the resistance of microorganisms to inactivation can vary significantly, the antimicrobial activity with different types of disinfectants can also vary considerably. It is therefore important to ensure that the labeling or documentation provided with chemical disinfectants or disinfection processes is closely inspected and followed to ensure their safe and effective use for the intended application (<anchor id="ch0030s0003a0003"/><link linkend="ch0030s0006a0004">Fig. 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0003">3</link>). In some countries, and for some applications, disinfection can be further subdivided based on demonstrated antimicrobial activity. In the United States, the terms low-level disinfection (LLD), intermediate-level disinfection (ILD), and high-level disinfection (HLD) are widely used for medical device applications (<anchor id="ch0030s0003a0004"/><link linkend="ch0030s0006a0005">Table 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0004">4</link>). Although these claims may be practically useful, close inspection of the product labeling and stated activity against specific microorganisms is needed to ensure that adequate disinfection occurs.</para>

      <para id="ch0030s0005p0001">Cleaning is defined as the removal of gross contamination from a surface to the extent necessary for further processing or for an intended use. Cleaning can be used to remove microorganisms (and other associated contaminants such as blood, tissues, culture media, etc.) from a surface by physical means but may not provide any antimicrobial activity per se. Cleaning, however, is often an essential prerequisite to disinfection or sterilization to ensure the optimal activity of the antimicrobial effects of disinfectants or sterilization processes, as well as ensuring the lack of residual materials that may have other negative impacts (e.g., biocompatibility). In some applications, the requirement for cleanliness is not just being visually free of soil but also being below quantified levels of analytes (e.g., concentrations of protein, microorganisms, process residuals, and total organic carbon). Examples include the cleaning of laboratory equipment or reusable clinical or surgical equipment and devices (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0006">6</link>).</para>

Various other marker organisms are used to test the antimicrobial effectiveness of antiseptic, disinfection, and sterilization product claims in compliance with standardized test methods and regulatory requirements. Despite this, unique resistance profiles have been described for some microorganisms to types of chemical disinfectants, such as protozoal cysts (particularly <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> oocysts) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0008">8</link>), <emphasis>Mycobacterium massiliense</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0009">9</link>), and some nonenveloped viruses (e.g., some parvoviruses) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0010">10</link>), but not necessarily to heat-based disinfection. The mechanisms of resistance are due to the exclusion of the chemical(s) into the inner components of the microorganism essential for viability and lack of significant reactivity at the surface of the microorganism (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). Prions, the causative agents in transmissible, misfolded, at least partially protease-resistant prion protein diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, deserve special consideration in this hierarchy due to these agents’ displaying unique resistance to traditional disinfection and sterilization processes (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0012">12</link>). Well-established sterilization processes, such as those based on gamma radiation and ethylene oxide gas, have been shown to be ineffective, but other methods, such as the use of alkali, steam sterilization processes, and the use of hydrogen peroxide gas, can be effective. These differences are presumably due to the unique proteinaceous nature of prions, including the absence of cell/viral structures and specifically nucleic acids (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0011">11</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0030s0006s0002p0001">There are two major considerations in the use of any disinfection or sterilization product or process: antimicrobial expectations and safety. The antimicrobial expectations can vary depending on the desired outcome, which in many cases is a reduction in the numbers and types of known conditions (such as in the cultivation of microorganisms under controlled, laboratory conditions) or unknown conditions (e.g., periodic surface disinfection of laboratory or other high-risk, clinical surfaces) for infection prevention or contamination control purposes. Antimicrobial claims are product specific and often regulated. For example, in the United States, the effectiveness of medical device disinfectants and sterilization processes is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0013">13</link>), while environmental disinfectants are registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0014">14</link>). The antimicrobial claims, including the time and conditions of use, are confirmed to be effective in compliance with specific recommended Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) International and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International test methods (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0015">15</link>). Similar test methods are used in the European Union in accordance with specific standards (e.g., EN 14885) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0016">16</link>), as well as those published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (e.g., for sterilization process requirements such as ISO 17665 for steam sterilization) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0017">17</link>) or the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (e.g., AAMI ST79 for steam sterilization of reusable devices) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0018">18</link>). In some laboratory situations, such as in research laboratories, it may be recommended to verify the effectiveness of disinfectants against specific pathogens under the conditions in which the disinfectant is proposed to be used (e.g., surface disinfection of low-level contamination versus the larger-scale accidental release of high levels of microorganisms).</para>
        <para id="ch0030s0006s0002p0002">The expectations for sterilization processes are more specific, requiring the inactivation of all viable microorganisms, but the sterilization process should be designed to be able to achieve sterilization under in-use conditions (e.g., autoclave loads). Variables that may impact the effectiveness of such processes include the development of cycles for solid or liquid wastes or the presence of interfering factors that may limit the sterilant’s access to the microorganisms (e.g., air entrapment in steam sterilization processes or a high concentration of blood, body tissues, or waste materials). A good example is steam sterilization, which exposes the load to various low- and high-pressure conditions to ensure that the correct sterilization temperatures are achieved throughout the entire load (typically in excess of 121°C [250°F]). Specific steam sterilization cycles need to be developed to be able to sterilize defined loads of liquids or solids (to prepare as sterile or for inactivation of pathogens prior to disposal) to withstand the pressure requirements for such processes and to ensure the minimum temperature and time conditions to be effective. These conditions help to minimize risks such as liquid boiling over, ineffective sterilization, and safety risks. This is a particularly important consideration in the development of autoclave cycles for heavily contaminated or mixed waste loads.</para>
        <para id="ch0030s0006s0002p0003">Safety in the practical use of disinfectants and sterilization processes is the second consideration. All chemical disinfectants have safety data sheets (formally known as material safety data sheets [MSDS]) that should be reviewed prior to laboratory use (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0020">20</link>). These sheets include potential hazards such as health risks, fire risks, and reactivity, as well as recommendations for how to work with the chemical product. All disinfectants can be expected to have safety risks due to their biocidal properties, despite their widespread use. Examples include the reactivity and sensitization risks of using chlorine-based products (e.g., household bleach) and flammability of 65 to 80% alcohol preparations used as antiseptics and disinfectants. A typical safety risk with steam sterilization is the potential for burns on handling hot materials poststerilization or the reaction of various chemicals on heating that could produce toxic gases. Other aspects of safety may depend on the specific use of the disinfectant/sterilant. These include material compatibility (e.g., damage to surfaces, reusable medical devices, or equipment) and environmental safety (e.g., certain countries or states have restrictions on the types and volumes of chemicals that can be disposed of through wastewater or through the air).</para>

        <para id="ch0030s0006s0002p0004">In addition to the regulatory requirements for the labeling and use of disinfectants and sterilization processes described above, the requirements for worker safety are generally regulated in most countries. For example, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act (1970) created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which sets and enforces safe and healthful working conditions (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0021">21</link>). Further safety recommendations, in particular, microbiological safety recommendations for laboratories, are published by organizations such as OSHA (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0019">19</link>), the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0022">22</link>), the American Biological Safety Association (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0023">23</link>), the United States Department of Health and Human Services (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0024">24</link>), and the World Health Organization (WHO) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0025">25</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0030s0006s0002p0005">Cleaning is an important first step that should be performed when disinfecting frequently touched or work surfaces and prior to the disinfection or sterilization of reusable items. The main purpose of cleaning is to remove organic soil (e.g., proteinaceous material, blood, and other potentially infectious materials, lipids, and oils) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0026">26</link>). The presence of soil may contribute to the failure of both disinfection and sterilization. The type of organic soil present, including the potential presence of large or diverse microbial populations, may prevent the penetration of the disinfectant or rapidly inactivate the disinfectant and therefore allow microbial survival (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0026">26</link>). Disinfectant inactivation can occur with products containing halogens (e.g., chlorine or iodine), quaternary ammonium compounds, and oxidizers (e.g., peroxygen compounds). Disinfectants containing aldehydes, such as glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde, can react with and cross-link soil components around microorganisms, thereby limiting penetration to elicit their antimicrobial effects. These effects will be more pronounced with formulations that contain lower concentrations of these active ingredients than those with higher concentrations. Cleaning with a detergent along with various types of enzymes or chemicals (e.g., acids or alkalis) not only removes organic soil but can also reduce the microbial load that may be present. Depending on the items to be cleaned, the cleaning procedure may involve a manual process that requires scrubbing or wiping, an ultrasonic bath, or even instrument washers or washer-disinfectors (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0006">6</link>). For general environmental surfaces this may involve the use of a detergent-germicide and a one-step process (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0026">26</link>).</para>

      <title>Risk and the Spaulding Classification</title>

      <anchor id="ch0030s0007a0002"/>
      <para id="ch0030s0007p0001">Current approaches to cleaning and disinfection in health care have been greatly influenced by the work of Earle Spaulding (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0027">27</link>). Spaulding defined a classification scheme for single-use and reusable medical instruments, devices, and patient care items based on the risk to the patient. It defined these risks and the decontamination methods (sterilization or disinfection) needed to prevent infections from occurring. This classification scheme is based on contact with the human body (sterile spaces, mucous membranes, nonintact skin, and intact skin), and items are divided into three categories: critical items, semicritical items, and noncritical items (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0026">26</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0007p0002">Critical items are those that enter normally sterile body spaces, the vascular system, or items through which blood flows. Examples include devices used for surgical procedures. These can be sterile, single-use items or reusable items. Many of the items in this category can be purchased as sterile or labeled to be cleaned and sterilized (e.g., by steam sterilization) prior to use (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0006">6</link>). However, some of these items are heat sensitive and require sterilization using low-temperature methods, such as ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide gas, or gas plasma systems, or in some cases the use of liquid chemical sterilants. It is important to note that in the use of liquid chemical sterilants, items must be adequately rinsed to remove residual chemicals before patient use, without cross contaminating the devices. The items should be used immediately after treatment, as there is no provision for sterile storage prior to use (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0006">6</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0007p0003">Semicritical items are those that come into contact with mucous membranes or nonintact skin. These items should be free from microbial contamination, but small numbers of bacterial spores are considered acceptable if present. This is because intact mucus membranes form a natural barrier and are generally resistant to infection by common environmental bacterial spores (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0026">26</link>). It is important to note that the Spaulding classification of such devices may vary depending on the type of procedure they are being used for (e.g., visualization of the internal structures of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract or invasive surgical procedures). Semicritical items generally require sterilization or, when this is not practical, at least HLD, which is defined as the complete elimination of most pathogens (including vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses, and fungi) but may require extended exposure times for efficacy against bacterial spores. Typically, this is achieved by using a chemical high-level disinfectant or sterilant under less-than-sterilizing conditions (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0026">26</link>). Some examples of instruments and devices that typically undergo HLD include respiratory therapy equipment, endoscopes, and esophageal manometry probes. These devices require meticulous cleaning prior to disinfection, because many have intricate designs and long narrow lumens (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0028">28</link>). Reprocessing failures due to inadequate cleaning have resulted in infection or colonization of patients (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0028">28</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0030">30</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0007p0004">A number of researchers have suggested that the Spaulding classification scheme, which was developed in the late 1950s, has a number of challenges (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0029">29</link>). This scheme is believed by some to be an oversimplification and does not consider design complexity and heat sensitivity of certain types of medical equipment or problems associated with inactivating biofilms and some infectious agents, such as prions. In other cases, one may have a device that is typically semicritical that is used in conjunction with a critical instrument that contacts sterile body tissues. The most common causes of infection with reusable devices and surfaces are clearly linked to lapses in best practices, including adequate cleaning and the correct use of disinfection and sterilization products and processes (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0028">28</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0030">30</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0030s0007s0001p0001">Cleaning is often an important and required step to ensure the effectiveness of disinfection or sterilization. Clinical practice is often associated with many types of substances (such as blood and other body fluids, tissues, and medical waste) that can dramatically impact the desired antimicrobial process (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0032">32</link>). Examples include the decontamination of a blood spill on a surface, the presence of residual soil on reusable laboratory equipment, and reprocessing of reusable medical devices following clinical or surgical use (i.e., cleaning followed by disinfection and/ or sterilization).</para>
        <para id="ch0030s0007s0001p0002">Although the analytical requirements for cleaning and the determination of the effectiveness of cleaning on clinical reusable surfaces is an area of ongoing development, it is generally accepted that visual cleanliness is the minimum criterion to ensure the efficacy of disinfection and sterilization. For environmental disinfection, this may depend on the labeling of the disinfectant. Most disinfectants, for labeling purposes, are tested in the presence of residual soil (e.g., 5% serum) to ensure effectiveness if residual contamination is present (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0016">16</link>). Some disinfectants (often referred to as two-step disinfectants) are labeled with instructions that require cleaning (or the removal of gross soil) before using the disinfectant on a contaminated surface, while others (one-step disinfectants) have demonstrated effectiveness in the presence of higher concentrations of residual soil. Sterilization processes, due to their overkill approach to microbial inactivation, can be effective but under soiled or uncontrolled conditions may not be guaranteed to achieve a sterile endpoint. In the case of reusable medical devices, although the antimicrobial requirements for disinfection and sterilization may be achieved, surgical or other complications (e.g., immune responses) have been reported due to the presence of soil debris (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0034">34</link>). For semicritical and critical devices, the analytical requirements for cleaning endpoints have recently been harmonized internationally and include levels of soil below visible levels to include the detection of residual protein (≤6.4 μg/cm<superscript>2</superscript> device surface) and total organic carbon (≥12 μg/cm<superscript>2</superscript>) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0035">35</link>).</para>

The chain of infection requires interaction between the agent, host, and environment. For transmission to occur, factors such as a reservoir, portal of exit, mode of transmission, portal of entry, and the presence of a susceptible host are necessary. Surface disinfection, hand hygiene, and other engineering controls can minimize the transmission of infectious agents, especially when the agent has the ability to persist on surfaces, whether these surfaces are devices or general environmental surfaces (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0034">34</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0036">36</link>).

Similar expectations are present in other regions, such as the European Union (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0016">16</link>). If the disinfectant is marketed in the United States for use on a specific medical device (e.g., a hemodialysis machine, hemodialyzer, or flexible fiber-optic endoscope), the disinfectant falls under additional regulatory control of the FDA, and if marketed for use on a specific device, it is also considered a medical device. As such, disinfectants must not only be EPA registered but also have FDA clearance (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0037">37</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0039">39</link>).</para>

For surface disinfection of general environmental surfaces and workspaces, typically low- or intermediate-level liquid disinfectants are used depending on the goal of the process. One can select an agent for surface disinfection depending on the microorganisms expected to be encountered, the compatibility of materials, and use requirements. In the United States, the pesticide registration program on the EPA website has several lists based on the label claims of registered products (<ulink url="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants">https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants</ulink>) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0040">40</link>). Note that chemical agents in list A are typically not used for routine surface disinfection. These are chemical sterilizers, and the liquid formulations are typically used for HLD of certain devices and are usually used in reprocessing machines or chemical sterilization processes (e.g., ethylene oxide). Low- or intermediate-level disinfectants are typically used for routine purposes. Products containing the following active ingredients are commonly used for surface disinfection: quaternary ammonium compounds, iodophors, phenolics, chlorine-containing compounds, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, and alcohol (<anchor id="ch0030s0008a0003"/><link linkend="ch0030s0008a0006">Table 3</link>).

      <para id="ch0030s0008p0003">Surfaces that require routine cleaning and disinfection in the laboratory may include laboratory instrumentation, benchtops, biological safety cabinets, incubators, and refrigerators. These surfaces are all classified as noncritical surfaces. A hospital-grade disinfectant with a tuberculocidal claim would be sufficient for most laboratories for general use. In some cases, commercially available disinfectant wipes may also be acceptable for use. Work surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected, usually by wiping them down when they become contaminated, between different procedures, before leaving the bench, and after completing work. In each case, one should follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use. Laboratories producing large numbers of bacterial spores for research purposes may also have to use products that have a sporicidal claim. Spill management is also a component of surface disinfection, and laboratories should have a spill management plan that covers blood and other potentially infectious material as well as concentrated culture (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0037">37</link>). When developing a spill plan, be sure to review the disinfectant label for use. Remember that organic soil can interfere with the activity of disinfectants, and several steps may be necessary. In a study evaluating spills using staphylococci and Gram-negative bacteria at 10<superscript>8</superscript> CFU/ml challenge organisms, 10,000 mg/L of sodium hypochlorite was capable of reducing the bacterial burden by 5 log<subscript>10</subscript> in all soils tested (serum, pus, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, ascitic fluid, urine, stool, and blood), with the exception of the staphylococci in blood as a matrix (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0041">41</link>).</para>

If not using a solidifier, one should apply disinfectant working inward, allow sufficient contact time as specified by the label, and then remove as much of the organic material as possible and discard it appropriately. The final step is to disinfect the surface that was contaminated.

      <para id="ch0030s0009p0001">The use of steam under pressure for sterilization purposes has a long history, and its use for disinfection of surfaces is not new; it was first proposed as a method for terminal room disinfection in 1906 (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0046">46</link>). Several investigators have evaluated the use of steam for surface disinfection (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0047">47</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0049">49</link>). A steam vapor system showed that a short exposure (3 to 5 s) produced about a 4- to 5-log<subscript>10</subscript> reduction of biofilms and dried pathogens (with a test soil) on surfaces. Some studies tested not only bacterial species (<emphasis>E. coli, Shigella flexneri, Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Salmonella enterica</emphasis> serovar Enteritidis) but also a nonenveloped virus (MS2), fungi (<emphasis>Candida albicans</emphasis> and <emphasis>Aspergillus niger</emphasis>), and <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> spores (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0048">48</link>). Bagattini and others (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0049">49</link>) evaluated an overheated dry saturated steam vapor disinfection system and compared it to the activity of sodium hypochlorite solutions and found that the dry saturated steam vapor eliminated pathogens inoculated onto surfaces in the presence of organic soil after 7 min exposure time. While there appear to be sufficient laboratory-generated data, these newer technologies have not been fully evaluated in the field. Two studies have evaluated the use of steam vapor devices in reducing microbial loads in the clinical environment. The first study evaluated the use of this device in eight patient rooms in a long-term care wing of a hospital. Six surfaces were chosen and sampled before and after application of steam (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0047">47</link>). They found that the steam system provided a &gt;90% (1 log<subscript>10</subscript>) reduction in total bacterial counts and reduced targeted pathogens to below detectable levels. The second study was conducted in a veterinary hospital where a system was used to disinfect a variety of surfaces, including the dog runs and kennel floors (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0050">50</link>). The authors observed a &gt;99% (2-log<subscript>10</subscript>) reduction in detectable bacteria after steam treatment of a stainless-steel sink and the laminate laboratory countertop. There was essentially no log reduction after treatment of the ribbed rubber mat of the weight scale test site (this was the only failure in the study). Even though there were &gt;99% reductions in counts in the sinks, these were not statistically significant. Steam treatment did cause significant reductions in bacteria/fungi in the concrete dog runs and stainless steel kennels. This study clearly showed that the steam process effectiveness can vary depending on the surface to which it is being applied. The steam did not reach the target areas in ribbed rubber mats compared to flat surfaces, and this provides an important lesson in the application of this disinfection process.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0009p0002">For equipment that might be contaminated with biofilms, physical cleaning or removal methods (e.g., scrubbing, scraping, brushing, and ultrasound) are often needed to accomplish disinfection or sterilization.

        <para id="ch0030s0009s0001p0001">The most widely used sterilization method for clinical laboratory applications is heat (specifically, moist heat or steam) sterilization, which is considered in this section along with a brief explanation of alternative sterilization methods. It is important to remember that the definition of sterilization highlights that it is a controlled (or validated) process to render a product free of microbial life. Therefore, it is first important to show that the sterilization method can inactivate microorganisms in a predictable way. The technology being employed must have a broad spectrum of activity against microbial pathogens. This has been widely established for most of the traditional heat, gas, and radiation sterilization methods (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0051">51</link>). Modern systems use detailed sterilization parameter monitoring and chemical indicator systems during the sterilization process to verify minimum acceptance criteria for process development and routine monitoring. These are based on testing with microorganisms considered to represent the most difficult challenge to inactivation (usually bacterial spores, due to their innate resistance) (<link linkend="ch0030s0006s0001a0005">Table 2</link>). Beyond that, the process being employed needs to show an expected overkill effect.</para>

        <para id="ch0030s0009s0001p0002">A typical approach is to develop the process to be able to demonstrate a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10<superscript>−6</superscript>. The SAL is defined as the probability of a single viable microorganism remaining on a product after sterilization. For example, a SAL of 10<superscript>−6</superscript> means that there is a probability of 1 in 1,000,000 that a single viable microorganism may be present following sterilization (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0017">17</link>). Therefore, if we start with a theoretical population of 1 × 10<superscript>6</superscript> bacterial spores and we apply a process to kill 6 log<subscript>10</subscript>, then strictly speaking, this could render the population “sterile,” but with no safety margin; a further 6 log<subscript>10</subscript> reduction would increase the safety margin to provide a SAL of 10<superscript>−6</superscript>. The SAL is a probability of sterility, and this safety margin is a clear benefit over many disinfection methods. Sterilization technologies such as those based on heat (<anchor id="ch0030s0009s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0030s0010a0004">Fig. 4</link>) or radiation can provide rapid sterilization of microorganisms under these defined conditions, but they can be variable depending on the nature of the load being sterilized. Examples of variables to be considered include air being trapped in a load that would not allow steam to penetrate, temperature distribution in a load of dry materials in comparison to liquids, and the impact of the presence of interfering soils (such as blood and tissue) that can protect microorganisms from the penetration of a gas process (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0052">52</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0055">55</link>).

      <para id="ch0030s0010p0001">The use of high temperatures is a well-established method for disinfection and sterilization (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). The most effective method of high-temperature sterilization is the use of moist heat, such as in hot water/liquid or steam. Most pathogens are inactivated in water at temperatures in excess of 55°C (131°F), with the notable exception of certain microorganisms, such as <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0056">56</link>) and <emphasis>Legionella</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0057">57</link>), that require temperatures of approximately 60 to 65°C (140 to 149°F) and certain parvoviruses (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0010">10</link>). As the temperature increases above the minimum temperature for inactivation, there is typically a log-linear rate of killing over time. Therefore, heating water to temperatures up to the boiling point (100°C [212°F]) is clearly a reliable and rapid method of disinfection. However, bacterial spores (particularly <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Geobacillus</emphasis> sp. spores) are well established as being the most resistant to heat inactivation and have been the subject of many investigations (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). The bacterial spores of nonpathogenic <emphasis>G. stearothermophilus</emphasis> have overall been shown to be the microorganism most resistant to heat inactivation, in comparison with known pathogens. Biological indicators using <emphasis>G. stearothermophilus</emphasis> spores are widely used to study, validate, and perform quality control requirements of steam sterilization processes. Steam temperatures in excess of approximately 115°C are typically required to inactivate these spores, which is achieved by increasing the pressure of steam in accordance with the universal gas laws (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). Under these conditions, microbial pathogens are rapidly inactivated, typically in seconds. The antimicrobial effects appear to be cumulative due to temperature effects on proteins, DNA, and lipids that make up microbial structures and the substantial release of energy when steam is condensed onto a colder surface. In addition, or as an alternative to the use of biological indicators to validate and verify the performance of steam sterilization processes, parametric monitoring of the essential variables of the antimicrobial process (such as temperature and pressure) is widely used (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0017">17</link>). As highlighted above, the impact of the load being processed, including its effect on temperature penetration into the load is an important consideration and not only for the monitoring of autoclave equipment.</para>

      <para id="ch0030s0010p0002">A special circumstance that must be considered when using steam sterilization is the presence of prions in certain human and animal tissues. Current strategies for prion decontamination have been published by various public health organizations (<anchor id="ch0030s0010a0005"/><link linkend="ch0030s0010a0009">Table 4</link>). The WHO convened a working group that reviewed the science and then developed a consensus for several options for the decontamination of prion-contaminated surgical instruments (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0058">58</link>). The working group acknowledged that incineration with temperatures approaching 1,000°C under normal or air-starved conditions was the decontamination method that provided optimum patient safety. This method essentially removes devices and materials from potential patient contact. However, incineration is often not the first choice, especially in the United States, where most hospitals no longer perform routine incineration. Health care institutions can manage decontamination using several strategies that make use of alkaline chemicals followed by steam sterilization (<link linkend="ch0030s0010a0009">Table 4</link>). When medical instruments are reused on patients, the infectivity of the tissues should be considered (<anchor id="ch0030s0010a0006"/><link linkend="ch0030s0010s0001a0004">Tables 5</link> and <anchor id="ch0030s0010a0007"/><link linkend="ch0030s0010s0001a0007">6</link>) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0057">57</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0064">64</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0010p0003">Prions appear to be resistant to traditional methods sterilization and disinfection. Some of this is due to the unavailability of animal models or culture systems in which to perform inactivation studies and epidemiology. Numerous studies evaluating the impact of physical sterilization have been published, with most focused on steam sterilization at various temperatures (134 to 138°C) and cycle times (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0058">58</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0060">60</link>).

When infected tissues were treated with either 1 M NaOH or sodium hypochlorite solutions in combination with steam sterilization, complete inactivation of prions or reduction of prions to below detection levels in animals was observed (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0059">59</link>). Limitation of various cycle times and autoclave parameters was due to high protein/tissue content and high prion challenges (given prion titers of 10<superscript>8</superscript> to 10<superscript>11</superscript> 50% lethal doses [LD<subscript>50</subscript>] per gram of brain tissue). However, when the chemical and physical methods were combined, the combined effect was complete inactivation. When tissues were immersed in 1 to 2 M NaOH and autoclaved in a gravity displacement autoclave at 121°C for up to 90 min, researchers noted complete inactivation of CJD prions and several strains of scrapie (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0059">59</link>). Alternatively, immersing contaminated material in either NaOH or NaOCl for an exposure period and then transferring the container to a gravity displacement autoclave resulted in reduction of prions to below detectable levels in animal assays.</para>

        <para id="ch0030s0010s0001p0001">There are a number of mechanisms by which microbes acquire resistance to biocides and these are considered in further detail elsewhere (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). In many cases, microbial innate resistance is determined by cellular and viral structure, composition, and physiology (<link linkend="ch0030s0006s0001a0005">Table 2</link>). The relative resistance of organisms to biocides varies and can be dependent on the microorganism itself, the chemical composition or formulation of the disinfectant, and how the disinfectant is applied (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0030s0010s0001p0002">Microorganism-related factors that have an impact on either resistance or tolerance to chemical disinfectants can include a number of mechanisms (impermeability, presence of efflux pumps, production of enzymes, and physiological state). These mechanisms may be intrinsic to the organism or acquired (e.g., plasmid mediated). In some cases, the mechanism may also affect susceptibility to antimicrobial agents (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). It should be noted that resistance to antimicrobials used to treat clinical infections and pathogens that cause severe disease does not necessarily correspond to resistance to chemical disinfectants.</para>
        <para id="ch0030s0010s0001p0003">Biocide impermeability is often related to the outer surface of the microorganism (e.g., bacterial cell wall or viral capsid), and intrinsic impermeability is associated with the spore coats of spore-forming bacilli, lipophilic cell walls of mycobacteria, outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, the presence of capsules, and, in the case of biofilms, the extracellular polymeric substances of the biofilm matrix (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). Acquired tolerance to biocides has also been reported, such as in some strains of <emphasis>Mycobacterium chelonae</emphasis> and <emphasis>Mycobacterium abscessus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0068">68</link>), most likely due to cell wall changes. In addition, some Gram-negative bacteria can acquire plasmids that can alter the expression of outer membrane proteins and increase their resistance to biocides such as formaldehyde (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>).</para>

This occurs primarily in organisms in nutrient-poor environments and in biofilms.

In biofilms, another factor that contributes to tolerance or resistance is the nature of the mixed-species population that may exist within the biofilm (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). It is important for clinical microbiologists to be aware of these mechanisms, since they may lead to infections in patients (especially in relation to reprocessing failures) and the potential for biofilm formation in laboratory equipment (e.g., water-jacketed incubators, humidification systems for incubators, and lab reagent water systems) and other equipment or instruments with fluid pathways. Cleaning and disinfection of this equipment may need to consider these factors, in particular with known risks of biofilms or handling of specific pathogens.</para>

There has been only one published study evaluating hand hygiene in the laboratory setting. Johnston and coworkers (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0071">71</link>) evaluated hand-to-face contact behaviors of personnel, since laboratory-acquired infections are thought to be acquired primarily by aerosol exposure and direct contact with mucous membranes. This observational study was conducted among 93 workers in 21 biosafety level 2 (BSL2) laboratories. The researchers observed the following procedures: cell culture maintenance, cell infection, virus harvesting, reagent and medium preparation, and tissue processing. The observational portion of the study was followed up with a survey that measured 11 psychosocial predictors of hand-to-face contact. During the study, 396 touches to the face (mean, 2.6 touches/h) were observed, and 72% of the study participants touched their face at least once (range, 0.2 to 16 touches/h). In decreasing order of frequency, the sites touched were the nose (44.9%), forehead (36.9%), and cheek/chin (12.5%), followed by the mouth (4%) and eyes (1.7%). Hand-to-face contact rates were found to vary by laboratory. The perceived severity of infection lowered the hand-to-face contacts. For every 1-point increase in the severity scale, workers had 0.41 fewer touch contacts to the face. The study concluded that hand-to-face contact is common in this setting and is largely overlooked as a major route of exposure.</para>

While soap and water and hand-washing remain the mainstay of hand hygiene in the laboratory setting, the use of alcohol hand rubs may encourage the practice of hand hygiene in this setting as well. However, these hand gels should be used if hands are not grossly contaminated after removing gloves. Handwashing with soap and water should occur if hands become contaminated, when working with large numbers of alcohol-resistant microorganisms (e.g., bacterial spores), and when leaving the laboratory. Large outcome studies performed in the community setting demonstrate that there is no difference between the use of plain soap and the use of antimicrobial soap in preventing infections (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0073">73</link>).

Work surfaces (e.g., benches and biosafety cabinets) should be cleaned and disinfected on a routine basis and after a spill. Unless the product is sold as “ready-to-use,” the label instructions for preparation, use, and storage should be followed. One should be aware that some products may cause respiratory irritation (when spraying or misting or via fumes), and workers should use proper personal protective equipment to prevent occupational exposure (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0074">74</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0013p0002">Cleaning and disinfection of biological safety cabinets is also a physical process that involves the wiping of surfaces with a disinfectant. One should remember if using sodium hypochlorite (500 to 8,000 mg/L) that it is corrosive (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>) and that its activity may need to be neutralized following the appropriate contact time. This can be performed after finishing work or after a spill. The use of UV light for surface decontamination within cabinets in the laboratory setting remains controversial (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0075">75</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0076">76</link>). UV light can be used as a supplement to routine cleaning and disinfection of these surfaces, but one should remember that UV light over time becomes less effective. UV light sources typically have a fixed life span stated by the manufacturer, and the bulbs should be changed based on these recommendations. In some applications, UV lamps are equipped with monitors that measure energy output linked to alarm settings that indicate when bulbs should be changed. Cabinets can also be decontaminated using fumigants (chlorine dioxide, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide), and this is usually done during periodic certification (whenever they are moved and at least annually) and prior to changing the HEPA filters (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0077">77</link>).

Room and large-space disinfection may be needed following decommissioning of laboratory spaces, prior to renovations, as part of a spill response, or following certain types of experiments. This activity should be performed by trained specialists using appropriate protective equipment and process measures (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0078">78</link>). For most clinical microbiology laboratories (BSL1 to BSL3), the most common approach to surface disinfection is the physical application of a liquid disinfectant to a surface, usually in combination with an applicator (wipe, microfiber cloth, or spray), and it involves both contact time and physical wiping of the surface. With large-area decontamination/disinfection methods, the disinfectants are often applied to the whole room via mist, vapor, or gas generation. These approaches were applied to the decontamination of buildings during the response to anthrax-contaminated mail in 2001 to 2002 and usually utilize formaldehyde, chlorine dioxide, or hydrogen peroxide (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0079">79</link>).</para>

The interior surfaces of BSL3 laboratories must be water resistant so that they can be easily cleaned and decontaminated. Access areas or other openings into the room (such as doors, pass-throughs, and gas connectors) should be sealed or capable of being sealed for decontamination purposes. Thus, in the BSL3 laboratory, liquid decontamination (which can include cleaning, physical removal, and disinfection) is assumed to be the norm, and fumigation is not considered the primary means of disinfection. Care should be taken that openings in the walls, floors, and ceilings are kept to a minimum and “sight sealed.” Verification of the seals is usually not required for BSL3 laboratories, the exception being BSL3 agricultural laboratories. BSL4 laboratory design requires that the interior surfaces be water resistant and sealed to facilitate fumigation. These seals require testing and verification to ensure containment. The BSL4 laboratory is designed to allow both liquid disinfection and fumigation. Periodic fumigation is required in the BSL4 laboratory to allow routine maintenance and certification of equipment. Procedures for disinfection of large spaces, such as rooms and walk-in incubators, are varied and influenced significantly by the type of etiologic agent involved, the characteristics of the structure of the space, and the materials present in the space.

One area is the improved formulation of widely used biocides such as quaternary ammonium compounds, hydrogen peroxide, and chlorine-releasing agents. As mentioned above, the formulation of these products can increase the stability and efficacy of the biocide to give superior product label claims (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>). There has also been an increased focus on the use periodic or continuous room disinfection technologies across different industries, including health care settings. These are used to reduce microbial contamination in enclosed areas such as patient care environments and broader applications. These technologies include the use of visible light in the blue wavelength range (400 to 470 nm) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0100">100</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0107">107</link>), far-UV light (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0108">108</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0111">111</link>), low-concentration hydrogen peroxide (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0112">112</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0115">115</link>), and antimicrobial, antiattachment, or self-disinfecting surfaces (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0116">116</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0118">118</link>). Some of these technologies are meant to be used in occupied spaces and others in more confined spaces, but overall, more research and regulatory clearance requirements are needed to determine safety and efficacy (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0115">115</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0116">116</link>). It should be noted that the mechanisms of action of all these technologies are not unique to microorganisms and that, in all cases, human cells will be more sensitive to their effects than prokaryotes. Therefore, short- and long-term toxic or harmful effects associated with the use of such technologies should be considered, particularly when they are to be used in open (patient-containing) environments. These technologies are briefly considered here, and they have been reviewed in greater detail by other authors (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0119">119</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0015p0002">UV light (200 to 320 nm range) has been well established as a physical disinfection process, with optimum activity within the UV-C range (200 to 280 nm) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0051">51</link>). The photochemical reactions that elicit damage to microbial biomolecules are considered the most optimal at wavelengths of &lt;320 nm (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0051">51</link>). However, some levels of microbial reduction have been described at higher wavelengths, including in the visible-light range. For example, the use of blue or violet-blue light (400 to 470 nm) has mostly been studied in research and some clinical studies (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0107">107</link>). Antimicrobial blue light (400 nm) decreased cell counts of 34 health care-associated pathogens in saline suspensions by &gt;5 log<subscript>10</subscript> after exposures to 54 to 108 J/cm<superscript>2</superscript> (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0120">120</link>). Other studies found similar results of health care-associated pathogens in suspension with blue light at wavelengths of 405 nm, 412 nm, 415 nm, 450 nm, and 470 nm. Blue-light exposures varied from 6 J/cm<superscript>2</superscript> to 2,214 J/cm<superscript>2</superscript>, and log reduction varied from &lt;1 to 7 log<subscript>10</subscript> CFU. Those with the least reduction were thick suspensions placed on microscope slides (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0107">107</link>). Maclean and others (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0106">106</link>) have shown that blue light (405 nm) had some sporicidal effect and achieved up to 4 log<subscript>10</subscript> inactivation of <emphasis>C. difficile, Bacillus megaterium</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Bacillus subtilis</emphasis> spores after a dose of 1.73 kJ/cm<superscript>2</superscript>. Although the direct mechanism(s) of action is not known, it likely involves the localized generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within target cells from the presence of intrinsic, photosensitizing chromophores (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0102">102</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0106">106</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0107">107</link>). These can lead to macromolecular damage that can cause cell death over time. The overall direct effects on viruses would therefore be considered limited, but reports on the impact of blue-light treatment under <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> conditions against enveloped viruses (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0121">121</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0122">122</link>) may be linked to other effects, such as carryover of porphyrins or other cellular components under the conditions of testing.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0015p0003">A few clinical studies have applied blue-light technology to disinfection of surfaces, including continuous disinfection of burn unit inpatient and outpatient surfaces (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0105">105</link>), universal decontamination of hospital surfaces in an occupied patient room (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0103">103</link>), an intensive care unit (ICU) isolation room (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0106">106</link>), and an orthopedic operating room (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0104">104</link>). Bache et al. (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0103">103</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0105">105</link>) and Maclean et al. (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0106">106</link>) reported significant reductions in surface contamination when the blue light was in use; however, reductions, though statistically significant, were only 22 to 86% and represent only a 1 log<subscript>10</subscript> (90%) reduction. One study has shown that blue light in combination with manual cleaning resulted in significant reductions both in surface contamination and in surface contamination and surgical site infections in an operating room (OR) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0104">104</link>). It is important to note that consistent cleaning of surfaces has been highlighted as being critical for reduction of exogenous cross contamination and infection in health care facilities (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0123">123</link>). Further studies are needed to clarify the true impact of such continuous visible-light applications and their safe use.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0015p0004">As stated earlier, UV room disinfection systems have been widely studied (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0051">51</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0116">116</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0124">124</link>, <link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0125">125</link>) and are particularly antimicrobial in the UV-C or far-UV-C range (~200 to 222 nm) (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0108">108</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0111">111</link>). The efficacy of such applications varies depending on the presence of contaminating soil, penetration of the light to contact surfaces, types of microorganism (e.g., bacterial and fungal spores are more resistant), etc., but they are considered effective when used in combination with good cleaning/housekeeping practices. However, continuous use in open areas should proceed with caution, as there is the potential for human tissue damage (e.g., the eyes) over time.</para>
      <para id="ch0030s0015p0005">A variety of technologies have been described to reduce the attachment of microorganisms to surfaces or provide antimicrobial activities (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0126">126</link>–<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0128">128</link>). A simple example is the existing use of some environmental disinfectants, particularly phenolics and quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectants.

TiO<subscript>2</subscript> is applied to surfaces as film (e.g., air filters, laboratory tables, HVAC systems, etc.). The photocatalytic activity generated with by UV irradiation causes advanced oxidation processes that inactivate microorganisms, deodorize, and mineralize organic matter (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0129">129</link>). Margarucci and others (<link linkend="ch0030s0016s0002li0130">130</link>) reviewed the use of this technology in hospital settings. Most of the studies reviewed were laboratory based, while four were field studies in hospital settings. These four studies evaluated the use of environmental disinfection using a photocatalyst. However, issues in comparing these studies leave many questions to be answered, including those regarding differences in morphology of the characteristics of the TiO<subscript>2</subscript> coating, quality of indoor lighting, microclimatic conditions, presences or quality of coating, and wear and tear of coating during cleaning processes.</para>
