        <para id="ch0112s0001s0001p0001">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are so called due to their striking crown of surface projections, reminiscent of the solar corona, which can be seen by electron microscopy (EM) (<anchor id="ch0112s0001s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0112s0003a0005">Fig. 1</link>). Coronaviruses currently comprise 39 species within 27 subgenera that belong to five genera within two subfamilies in the family <emphasis>Coronaviridae</emphasis>, suborder <emphasis>Coronavirineae</emphasis>, order <emphasis>Nidovirales</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0001">1</link>). The subfamily <emphasis>Orthocoronavirinae</emphasis> (<emphasis>Coronavirinae</emphasis>) contains four genera, <emphasis>Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Deltacoronavirus</emphasis>; the seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) identified to date belong to the genera <emphasis>Alpha-</emphasis> and <emphasis>Betacoronavirus</emphasis> (<anchor id="ch0112s0001s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0112s0004a0004">Fig. 2</link>). The genus <emphasis>Alphacoronavirus</emphasis> (previously CoV group 1) contains two HCoVs, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, along with several other CoVs, including those from bats, pigs, dogs, and cats. Four lineages are commonly recognized within the genus <emphasis>Betacoronavirus</emphasis> (previously CoV group 2), which contains the remaining HCoVs and many other mammalian CoVs. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are in <emphasis>Betacoronavirus</emphasis> lineage A, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the subgenus <emphasis>Sarbecovirus</emphasis>, lineage B, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is found in lineage C (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0002">2</link>). The genera <emphasis>Gammacoronavirus</emphasis> (previously CoV group 3) and <emphasis>Deltacoronavirus</emphasis> predominantly comprise avian CoV species, with some CoVs found in mammalian species but none thus far in humans (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0004">4</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0112s0002p0001">CoVs have a linear, positive-stranded RNA genome approximately 30 kb in size. The 5′ two-thirds of the genome contains the large replicase gene which encodes the replication transcription complex and is composed of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b. The remaining 3′ third of the genome encodes up to five structural proteins, translated from a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs, and contains additional accessory genes specific to particular CoVs (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0005">5</link>). The spherical or pleomorphic virions are enveloped and contain a helical nucleocapsid comprising nucleoprotein (N) associated with the RNA genome. Embedded in the envelope are 20-nm-long homotrimers of spike glycoprotein (S), also called peplomers, which have a club-shaped morphology and facilitate attachment to cells. The envelope also contains integral membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins. CoVs of the <emphasis>Betacoronavirus</emphasis> lineage A also have 5- to 7-nm spikes of an additional membrane glycoprotein, hemagglutinin esterase. The initial viral attachment to the host cell involves specific binding of the S protein to cellular receptors, which include angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 for MERS-CoV (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0006">6</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0009">9</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0112s0003p0001">CoVs have been found in a wide range of domestic and wild mammals and birds; however, the particular diversity of strains found in birds and bats suggests that these animals are the natural reservoirs of CoVs, although this may also be the result of sampling bias (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0004">4</link>). Recent genetic analysis of CoVs suggests that both HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 originated from bats (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0011">11</link>); for HCoV-229E in particular, camelids may be potential intermediate hosts (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0012">12</link>). HCoV-OC43 is a subspecies of <emphasis>Betacoronavirus</emphasis> lineage A closely related to other domestic-animal CoVs, particularly bovine CoV, and it is postulated that zoonotic transmission from cattle to humans may have occurred with bovines serving as intermediate hosts (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0013">13</link>). The evolution of HCoV-OC43 in particular is characterized by frequent recombination events, and seven distinct genotypes (A to G) have been described (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0014">14</link>), although a novel genotype was recently reported from China (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0015">15</link>). HCoV-HKU1 is distinct from HCoV-OC43 within <emphasis>Betacoronavirus</emphasis> lineage A; however, the ancestor sequences for both were identified in rodents that likely serve as the natural host (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0017">17</link>). <emphasis>Betacoronavirus</emphasis> lineage B comprises the human SARS-CoV alongside related CoVs from civets, ferrets, badgers, and bats (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0019">19</link>). It is thought that SARS-CoV may have emerged indirectly through recombination of SARS-CoV-like viruses from a natural reservoir in Chinese horseshoe bats. The most closely related is the bat SARS-CoV-like strain WIV1-CoV, with &gt;95% nucleotide sequence homology to SARS-CoV (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0020">20</link>). This virus was isolated from Chinese horseshoe bat fecal material, uses ACE2 for cellular entry, and is neutralized by sera from SARS-CoV-infected patients (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0019">19</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0021">21</link>). Although MERS-CoV may also have arisen in bats (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0023">23</link>), camels are also thought to be an important reservoir; several studies have demonstrated high MERS-CoV seroprevalence and viral detection rates particularly in dromedary camels in the Middle East and parts of Africa (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0024">24</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0027">27</link>). Genomic analyses suggest that multiple sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into the human population have occurred, followed by human-to-human transmission (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0029">29</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0112s0003p0002">SARS-CoV-2 shares a high sequence identity with SARS-CoV, and bats are also the likely natural reservoir. The genome of bat CoV RaTG13 is most closely related to the genome of SARS-CoV-2, with ~96.2% homology (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0031">31</link>). It is hypothesized that there is an intermediate host, as SARS-CoV-2-like genomes have been identified in Malayan pangolins (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0033">33</link>). However, given the phylogenetic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related CoVs, it is not clear that transmission from pangolins accounts for the origin of this virus in humans (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0030">30</link>). Nevertheless, zoonotic transmission to humans from a reservoir or intermediate host remains the leading hypothesis, though concerns have been raised that SARS-CoV-2 may have been accidentally released from a research laboratory (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0034">34</link>). Additional studies are critical to identify the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and to characterize the evolutionary measures that enabled the virus to cross the species barrier and cause a pandemic (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0035">35</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0038">38</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0112s0004p0001">In the 1960s, a number of virus strains that had a cytopathic effect (CPE), morphology, and biology unlike those of known respiratory viruses were isolated in culture from individuals with respiratory illness in the United States and the United Kingdom (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0039">39</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0041">41</link>). Isolation of these viruses was difficult and generally required the use of primary organ cultures. They were morphologically and biologically similar and appeared most closely related to infectious bronchitis and mouse hepatitis viruses. Together, they formed a new group of viruses recognized as coronaviruses in 1968. From this group, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were subsequently well characterized, owing in part to their ability (HCoV-229E) or subsequent adaptation (HCoV-OC43) to propagate <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0039">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0042">42</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0112s0004p0002">In 2003, SARS-CoV was isolated from cell cultures inoculated with respiratory specimens from affected patients; it had CoV-like morphology as determined by EM and was identified as a novel CoV by sequence analysis (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0043">43</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0048">48</link>). Experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques demonstrated that it was the etiological agent of SARS (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0049">49</link>). Shortly after the SARS epidemic, two further HCoVs were identified: HCoV-NL63 in 2004 (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0050">50</link>) and HCoV-HKU1 in 2005 (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0051">51</link>). HCoV-NL63 was isolated using a novel cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism-based technique to identify an unknown virus from culture (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0050">50</link>) (<anchor id="ch0112s0004a0005"/><link linkend="ch0112s0004a0008">Fig. 3</link>). HCoV-HKU1 was identified solely through nucleic acid-based methods because it was refractory to growth in conventional cell lines (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0051">51</link>). Retrospective analysis using stored samples has shown that both of these “newly discovered” HCoVs have been circulating in the human population for many years (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0052">52</link>). MERS-CoV was identified in 2012 by pan-CoV reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and genetic analysis (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0053">53</link>). Rhesus macaques experimentally infected with MERS-CoV developed pneumonia, thus establishing a causal relationship between virus and disease (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0054">54</link>). SARS-CoV-2 was first identified from respiratory specimens from patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the People’s Republic of China, in December 2019, by deep metatranscriptomic whole-genome sequencing (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0055">55</link>).

        <para id="ch0112s0004s0001p0001">HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 are endemic in humans. In contrast, SARS-CoV has not been reported since early 2004, and infections with MERS-CoV have been intermittently diagnosed since it was first identified (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0056">56</link>). SARS-CoV-2 is unique among the endemic and highly pathogenic HCoVs in that it caused a global pandemic within months of its discovery. The four community-acquired, endemic HCoVs have a worldwide distribution (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0057">57</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0061">61</link>). Serological surveys carried out several decades ago showed that HCoV infection fluctuated between years, with a higher frequency of serological responses in the winter than in summer months. With the advent of RT-PCR detection, the substantial temporal and geographical variations in HCoV detection and in the predominance of individual HCoVs have been confirmed. This variability makes it hard to draw conclusions about the burden and periodicity of infection from studies describing HCoV epidemiology over only 1 or 2 years. Furthermore, due to their relatively recent discovery, few studies have looked for all four HCoVs simultaneously over long periods. From multiyear molecular studies in children and adults, it appears that detection by RT-PCR of all four endemic HCoVs typically peaks in the winter and spring months in temperate countries; although HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 are usually the most commonly detected (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0062">62</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0072">72</link>) (<anchor id="ch0112s0004s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0112s0004a0010">Fig. 4</link>), other studies have demonstrated higher frequencies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0073">73</link>). A large Dutch study found that the timing and extent of HCoV winter peaks may be related to influenza A epidemics (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0074">74</link>), and a 2- to 3-year periodicity has been described for HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43 in some RT-PCR and serological studies (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0075">75</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0077">77</link>) but not in others (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0070">70</link>). The combined HCoV detection rate in individuals with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in multiyear studies varies from 1 to 18%, and coinfections with other respiratory viruses are common (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0057">57</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0063">63</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0065">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0067">67</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0068">68</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0073">73</link>).

        <para id="ch0112s0004s0001p0002">Historical serological surveys demonstrated that infection with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 could occur on a background of preexisting neutralizing antibody and that apparent reinfection with the same virus species was common (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0075">75</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0076">76</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0078">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0079">79</link>). Reinfection could also be achieved in experimental inoculations of healthy adults, although it generated subclinical infections under these conditions (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0080">80</link>). In longitudinal studies in children, approximately half of the serological responses to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 occurred in the absence of symptoms, suggesting the occurrence of natural subclinical infection (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0075">75</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0076">76</link>). Contemporary serological studies have shown that infection with HCoVs is a common event in early childhood, with seropositivity to all four HCoVs generally increasing with age. Seroconversion to at least one HCoV was observed in 24 of 25 healthy infants by the age of approximately 20 months (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0063">63</link>). However, seroconversion was more frequent with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 than with HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1, in line with individual detection frequencies determined by RT-PCR (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0063">63</link>). The sequence of HCoV infection in infancy appears to be important, as prior HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-NL63 infection may elicit immunity that protects from subsequent HCoV-HKU1 or HCoV-229E infection, respectively, but not vice versa (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0063">63</link>). In two independent cross-sectional seroepidemiological studies in different populations, the proportion of infants with antibodies to both HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 decreased significantly from 0 to 6 months of age but then increased rapidly, so that by the age of 4 years, more than 50% of children were seropositive for both viruses (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0082">82</link>). It is likely that this pattern illustrates the waning of maternal antibody and the development of new antibody in response to infection in early childhood. Some studies in adults have reported a seroprevalence as high as 90 to 100% for HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43, with a lower seroprevalence for HCoV-HKU1, 59 to 91% (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0083">83</link>). However, other studies have found a much lower seroprevalence for all four HCoVs (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0082">82</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0084">84</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0086">86</link>). Differences in study population and geographic location, as well as in assay sensitivity and specificity, may account for the variation.</para>

        <para id="ch0112s0004s0001p0003">The major transmission route of HCoV is likely to be respiratory, although many animal CoVs also have a fecal-oral route of transmission and can replicate in epithelial cells in both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The isolation of HCoVs from fecal specimens has been described, but it is unclear to what extent HCoVs are transmitted feco-orally. HCoV can be detected by RT-PCR in respiratory secretions for over 3 weeks after the onset of illness, particularly for immunocompromised patients and neonates; however, it is not known if this represents replication-competent virus (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0087">87</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0088">88</link>). HCoVs may survive on surfaces (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0089">89</link>), in suspension (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0090">90</link>), or as aerosols (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0091">91</link>). Therefore, contact- and aerosol-mediated transmission from the environment is a possibility. Nosocomial outbreaks of HCoV have been associated with severe illness in long-term-care facilities and neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0092">92</link>). The typical incubation period of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and related strains was shown to be 2 to 5 days in intranasal inoculation experiments in healthy adults; however, it has not been well described for other common HCoVs or for different populations, such as children.</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0004s0001p0004">SARS-CoV infection emerged as a zoonosis in Guangdong Province, China, in 2002 and then spread globally via human-to-human transmission to cause the SARS pandemic. The SARS-CoV index case was shown to have contact with game animals, and interestingly, seroprevalence studies showed a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV IgG in animal traders (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0093">93</link>). Global spread appeared to be largely related to transmission events involving symptomatic individuals in places such as hospitals, hotels, and residential complexes, and asymptomatic seropositivity in the community was low (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0046">46</link>). Initial epidemiological investigations suggested that respiratory droplet secretion and direct or indirect contact were the most likely routes of transmission (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0047">47</link>). The generation of aerosols, particularly in hospitals, was also important. SARS-CoV was shed in respiratory specimens, stool, urine, and other body fluids, but, unusual for a respiratory virus, shedding peaked in the second week of illness (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0094">94</link>). This meant that the peak of infectivity occurred when the patient was already likely to be symptomatic and in the hospital. Public health measures, including rapid identification and quarantine of patients and improved infection control, brought transmission to a halt in mid-2003. SARS-CoV briefly reemerged in Guangdong Province in late 2003 from a probable new zoonotic transmission event, and there were also later incidences of laboratory transmission. The incubation period of SARS was typically 2 to 14 days, with a mean of 4 to 5 days, although occasional cases with longer incubation periods were reported (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0047">47</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0004s0001p0005">MERS-CoV was first isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia hospitalized in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in June 2012 (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0053">53</link>) and was subsequently found retrospectively in samples associated with a nosocomial outbreak of severe pneumonia in Jordan in April 2012 (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0095">95</link>). Cases have been reported from at least 27 countries, mostly linked to travel or residence in the Arabian Peninsula, with approximately 80% of cases reported by KSA. Overall seroprevalence in KSA is thought to be very low, with the exception of those occupationally exposed to dromedary camels (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0096">96</link>). Cases have occurred sporadically or in clusters, and direct contact with dromedary camels has been noted in some, but not all, cases (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0097">97</link>). Raw camel products, such as meat and milk, may also be potentially infectious.</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0004s0001p0006">Sustained human-to-human transmission has not been observed to date, although limited person-to-person transmission has been identified among close household contacts (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0098">98</link>). Significant nosocomial outbreaks have also occurred, the largest being in the Republic of Korea in 2015 (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0099">99</link>); as with SARS, transmission has been associated with time to isolation and a small number of events in hospitals (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0100">100</link>). Therefore, contact and droplet transmission-based precautions are recommended in the health care setting, with airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures. The incubation period for MERS-CoV is estimated at a median of 7 days, with the majority of cases occurring within 2 to 15 days (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0101">101</link>). Peak respiratory viral loads and shedding patterns for MERS-CoV appear to be similar to those of SARS-CoV, with the exception of significantly lower levels of detection of MERS-CoV in urine and stool (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0102">102</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0004s0001p0007">SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated from cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, in December 2019. From 31 December 2019 until 3 January 2020, a total of 44 patients were reported to the WHO. A novel coronavirus was identified as the etiology of these cases when the virus was characterized by direct sequencing of clinical specimens (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0055">55</link>). Shortly thereafter, imported cases were reported from Thailand (13 January), Japan (15 January), and Korea (20 January). Most of the cases (270 of 309 on 21 January) initially reported from China were from Wuhan; 23% of the patients were in severe or critical condition, with six reported deaths. In only a few days, there was a significant increase in the reported number of cases, with confirmed cases reported from six countries outside China, including the first case in the United States (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0103">103</link>). This rapid progression strongly suggested human-to-human transmission and provided evidence for the implementation of global infection control measures, early diagnosis, and contact tracing. The WHO declared the situation a pandemic on 11 March 2020, and in only a few months, cases were reported from essentially every country in the world. SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from respiratory secretions and saliva. Transmission occurs via respiratory droplets and aerosols primarily through close-range contact, though long-distance transmission may also occur (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0104">104</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0107">107</link>). SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in other specimen types, including stool and blood, though these sources do not appear to significantly contribute to disease transmission. Transmission occurs through exposure to symptomatic individuals, but in contrast to SARS-CoV, the transmission potential peaks earlier in the disease, as viral RNA levels peak within the first few days after the onset of symptoms (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0108">108</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0109">109</link>).

      <para id="ch0112s0005p0001">The rapid evolution of the pandemic CoVs, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, has been studied extensively. In particular, regions of the S protein, including the receptor-binding domain (RBD), undergo important sequence changes associated with human adaptation (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0114">114</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0115">115</link>). For SARS-CoV, these mutations resulted from both adaptation to its cellular receptor ACE2 and antibody-mediated selection (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0116">116</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0117">117</link>). Similarly, the D614G change in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein enhances binding to ACE2, facilitates viral transmission, and increases viral replication (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0118">118</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0123">123</link>).

In recognition of the potential impact of viral evolution on the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (SIG) implemented a classification system to describe those viral variants thought to be most important. The classification scheme includes variants being monitored (VBM), variants of interest (VOI), variants of concern (VOC), and variants of high consequence (<anchor id="ch0112s0005a0003"/><link linkend="ch0112s0005a0007">Table 1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0112s0005p0002">As the pandemic has progressed, variants have emerged that meet the definitions for VOC and VOI; many of them were reclassified as VBM (<anchor id="ch0112s0005a0004"/><link linkend="ch0112s0005a0008">Tables 2</link> and <anchor id="ch0112s0005a0005"/><link linkend="ch0112s0005s0001a0004">3</link>). Though these variants were initially referred to by the country in which they were first identified, this practice was discouraged, and on 31 May 2021, the WHO introduced a new nomenclature based on the Greek alphabet that was meant to simplify variant naming (<ulink url="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0112s0005p0003">Variants that showed increased transmissibility include the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P.1) variants, which share the N501Y mutation (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0130">130</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0132">132</link>), as well as the Delta (B.1.617.2) and Epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) variants, which share the L452R mutation. The L452R mutation and the E484K/Q and K417N/T mutations found in multiple VOC/VOI also compromise susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies (<ulink url="https://covdb.stanford.edu">https://covdb.stanford.edu</ulink>). There is concern that vaccine effectiveness may be reduced by the emergence of VOC/VOI, and the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines have been shown to be less effective at preventing infection caused by the Beta variant (B.1.351) in clinical trials carried out in South Africa (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0133">133</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0134">134</link>).</para>

Omicron acquired an alarming number of mutations compared to the Wuhan strain, with about 30 amino acid substitutions in the S protein (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0138">138</link>). Three Omicron sublineages emerged (BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3), of which BA.2 quickly spread globally to become the most predominant (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0139">139</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0140">140</link>).

        <para id="ch0112s0005s0001p0001">The endemic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, are associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in individuals of all ages and occasionally with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were originally isolated from adults with mild URTI and were demonstrated to cause the symptoms of the “common cold” in human experiments (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0039">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0159">159</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0160">160</link>). Such experiments have not been carried out with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, so a causal relationship cannot be formally demonstrated. The four endemic HCoVs are associated with similar URTI symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0059">59</link>); HCoV-NL63 has been particularly associated with croup in children (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0061">61</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0077">77</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0161">161</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0163">163</link>). Numerous epidemiological studies have indicated a temporal association with all four of the endemic HCoVs and ARI, and some studies have shown higher rates of HCoV detection in patients with ARI symptoms than in asymptomatic individuals (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0057">57</link>). However, other studies have found similar or lower detection rates in hospitalized patients than controls, typically 2 to 10% (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0061">61</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0164">164</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0165">165</link>). Drawing firm conclusions is difficult, because in the majority of case-control studies, detection rates for HCoV are relatively low, and coinfection with other respiratory viruses is common. However, significant LRTI, such as community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, has been described for hospitalized adults and children from whom an endemic HCoV was the sole etiologic agent detected (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0162">162</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0166">166</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0168">168</link>). HCoV has also been associated with significant morbidity due to LRTI in immunocompromised patients, patients with other underlying conditions, and those at the extremes of age (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0064">64</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0166">166</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0169">169</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0170">170</link>). Overall, however, it is likely that the burden of severe illness due to endemic HCoVs is relatively minor in comparison to those of other respiratory viruses, such as adenovirus, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0171">171</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0172">172</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0005s0001p0002">Several animal CoVs are known to cause diarrheal disease, but the link between HCoV infection and enteric disease is unclear. At present, HCoVs are thought to play a minor role, if any, in gastrointestinal disease. CoV-like particles have been seen in fecal specimens by EM, and human “enteric” CoVs, some apparently closely related to the betacoronaviruses bovine CoV and HCoV-OC43, were also isolated from patients with gastrointestinal disease (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0088">88</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0173">173</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0174">174</link>). The four endemic HCoVs have been found occasionally in cases of acute gastroenteritis; however, they have also been rarely detected in controls (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0175">175</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0177">177</link>). Some animal CoVs are also neurotropic; both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E RNA have been detected in brain tissue, and a fatal case of encephalitis associated with HCoV-OC43 in an immunocompromised child has been described (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0178">178</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0005s0001p0003">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause severe respiratory illness with high mortality rates. During the SARS-CoV epidemic, the virus spread to 26 countries, resulting in 8,096 clinical cases and 774 deaths. SARS was associated with atypical pneumonia. Patients present with fever, malaise, and nonproductive cough, followed by dyspnea with rapid respiratory deterioration and diffuse alveolar damage that require intensive care and mechanical ventilation in up to 30% of patients (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0179">179</link>). Diarrhea and lymphopenia were also observed. Symptoms were milder in children than in adults, and the overall crude case fatality rate was 10% (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0180">180</link>). MERS-CoV has been predominantly seen in older adults with underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, and, although a spectrum from asymptomatic carriage to severe disease has been reported, most cases to date have been clinically severe (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0181">181</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0182">182</link>). MERS-CoV infections have only rarely been detected in children, and these are typically asymptomatic contacts of adult cases (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0183">183</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0005s0001p0004">The typical clinical course of MERS is similar to that of SARS and comprises an initial viral prodrome with fever, cough, subsequent pneumonia, and respiratory deterioration over several days (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0181">181</link>). Severe potential complications include renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome with shock, and, rarely, neurological disease (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0181">181</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0183">183</link>).

Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes have also been noted for MERS-CoV-infected pregnant women (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0184">184</link>).

        <para id="ch0112s0005s0001p0008">The key to the management of severe HCoV infection is good supportive care, as there is no specific treatment available. Several potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV, such as viral protein inhibitors, interferons, and antibodies, have been evaluated<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> and in animal models (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0214">214</link>). During the SARS outbreak, several experimental treatments were used in humans, but a retrospective review found no conclusive positive effects of any substance, and some potentially harmful effects (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0215">215</link>). The biology of MERS-CoV differs in certain important aspects from that of SARS-CoV, and potential treatment options, such as convalescent-phase plasma, interferon with or without ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir, remain investigational (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0216">216</link>). Management of severe COVID-19 is largely supportive. Remdesivir (Veklury; Gilead Sciences, Inc.), a nucleoside analog prodrug inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is the only antiviral therapy currently with FDA approval for the treatment of COVID-19 (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0217">217</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0219">219</link>). Remdesivir is indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, as well as high-risk, nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The corticosteroid dexamethasone is frequently used in patients with severe COVID-19, with the greatest benefit observed in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0220">220</link>). The potent anti-inflammatory activity of dexamethasone mitigates host systemic inflammatory responses that lead to lung injury and multisystem organ failure. Similarly, the FDA has granted EUA for the Janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib (Eli Lilly and Co.), the interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor tocilizumab (Genentech), and the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra (Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB) to treat severe COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Given the association of COVID-19 with thrombotic and thromboembolic disease, preventive anticoagulation therapy is also recommended for hospitalized adults for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0221">221</link>).</para>

In addition, a number of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been authorized to reduce the risk of disease progression in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. These include the combination therapies bamlanivimab/etesevimab (Eli Lilly and Co.) and casirivimab/imdevimab (REGEN-COV; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), as well as the single agents sotrovimab (GlaxoSmithKline LLC) and bebtelovimab (Eli Lilly and Co.)

Importantly, however, the effectiveness of these MAbs is reduced by mutations in the S gene, particularly the receptor binding domain (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0226">226</link>). As successive waves of variants harboring these mutations have emerged globally, the FDA has revoked authorization. As discussed above, when the Omicron (BA.1.1.519/BA.1) variant became dominant in early 2022, both bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab were deauthorized. Similarly, as BA.2 replaced BA.1, the FDA removed authorization of sotrovimab. Bebtelovimab lost its authorization in the U.S. at the end of November 2022 with the prevalence of the neutralization-resistant Omicron sublineages that included primarily BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.</para>

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and clinical trials proceeded at a record pace, resulting in the authorization of multiple effective vaccines. At the time of this update, the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273), the adenovirus vector (AdV26) vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen, and the adjuvanted recombinant protein subunit vaccine from Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) have received FDA approval or EUA.

Further review of these and additional cases of vaccine-associated thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome led the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to update the recommendations for use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine to include a warning that rare clotting events might occur after vaccination, primarily among women aged 18 to 49 years (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0235">235</link>). Furthermore, the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine is now indicated only for individuals 18 years of age and older for whom other FDA-authorized or -approved COVID-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate, and individuals 18 years of age and older who elect to receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine because they would otherwise not receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

      <para id="ch0112s0007p0006">One potential use case for rapid antigen tests involves frequent, serial testing to diagnose cases early in the course of illness and immediately implement infection control measures (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0286">286</link>). The real-world impact of such an approach has not yet been determined, though the FDA revised the EUA for all SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests to include authorized uses for repeat testing; at least 2 times over 3 days with at least 48 h between tests for individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, and at least 3 times over 5 days with at least 48 h between tests for asymptomatic individuals. In addition, it has been suggested that rapid antigen tests may be used as an infectivity marker (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0287">287</link>); however, in CDC-sponsored studies of two common SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests, Quidel Sofia and Abbott BinaxNow, ~10% of antigen-negative, RT-PCR-positive cases were culture positive (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0288">288</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0289">289</link>). Interestingly, a recent report showed that mutations in the N gene might impact the performance of antigen testing (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0290">290</link>). Laboratory-based, ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays can achieve near-RT-PCR levels of clinical sensitivity on URT specimens using an alternative reagent supply chain, though these methods are uncommonly used in clinical practice (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0291">291</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0292">292</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0112s0008p0001">Nucleic acid detection from clinical specimens is the most common diagnostic method in use for HCoV. Detection of viral nucleic acids is typically more sensitive and specific than viral culture, antigen, or antibody detection methods. It relies neither on the binding of antigen to potentially cross-reactive antibodies nor on the detection of a timely and specific immune response in individuals. Two strategies have been employed in nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for HCoV. The first is to select a target that is as conserved as possible among all known HCoVs, creating pan-CoV assays; the second is to select a region of the genome that is distinct between the different HCoV species to generate a series of species-specific assays. Many SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays combined targeting of a conserved<emphasis>Sarbecovirus</emphasis> genomic region and a distinct SARS-CoV-2 region to enhance assays’ sensitivities and specificities. As HCoVs have an RNA genome, an initial reverse transcription (RT) step is required; this can be either carried out separately (two steps) or combined with the NAAT, typically PCR (one step). Ideally, all four endemic HCoVs should be sought in diagnostic specimens, given our increasing knowledge of their roles as respiratory pathogens. Recent significant advances in our understanding of HCoVs have been made through nucleic acid-based methods, particularly the ability to randomly amplify and sequence nucleic acids from cultures and to compare them to databases to detect novel CoVs (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0053">53</link>). Whole-genome sequencing can be carried out directly on respiratory samples for diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0051">51</link>), although it is not commonplace at this time in most clinical laboratories.</para>

        <para id="ch0112s0008s0001p0001">Pan-CoV assays enable the detection of CoV infection without knowledge of the species involved. Regions of the conserved polymerase gene within the replicase ORF1a/b have been successfully used in pan-CoV assays, following alignment of known sequences and generation of consensus primers. Some pan-CoV assays use degenerate primers (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0067">67</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0293">293</link>), some utilize multiple primer sets (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0166">166</link>), and others employ a single set of nondegenerate primers (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0051">51</link>). Different pan-CoV assays have been shown to vary in their capacity to detect known HCoVs (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0294">294</link>), although some have sensitivity equivalent to that of individual species-specific assays (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0166">166</link>). Therefore, the choice of approach will depend on the diagnostic objectives. Pan-CoV assays have been used as an initial screening test (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0166">166</link>) and for the detection of unknown viruses growing in cell culture, leading to the discovery of new HCoVs (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0051">51</link>). To identify the CoV species, amplicons from pan-CoV assays may need to be sequenced or the positive RNA extract tested with species-specific assays.</para>

The disadvantage of species-specific assays is that they may miss emerging CoVs that are divergent in sequence, though this may also occur with pan-CoV NAATs. It is possible to multiplex individual species-specific assays into a single reaction without a loss in sensitivity (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0058">58</link>). However, some authors using other species-specific NAATs have found that the sensitivity is greater with individual assays (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0295">295</link>).

Respiratory virus infections present with a wide range of signs and symptoms, and the clinical features of ARI caused by different viruses are often indistinguishable. Syndromic respiratory virus panels enable a specimen to be tested for an array of respiratory pathogens simultaneously. These panels vary in hands-on time, throughput, and turnaround time. Direct comparison between commercial and in-house NAATs for HCoV detection has shown a range of performance. However, most comparisons are limited by the overall scarcity of HCoV-positive samples and particularly by the limited number of samples known to contain individual species, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about sensitivity for individual HCoVs (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0302">302</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0307">307</link>).

        <para id="ch0112s0008s0007p0001">Multiple molecular assays were developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 shortly after its initial characterization by whole-genome sequencing. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. CDC quickly developed molecular methods for diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0103">103</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0321">321</link>). The CDC assay targets two regions of the N gene (N1 and N2). The WHO, on the other hand, recommended screening with the E gene and confirming with an assay targeting RdRp (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0322">322</link>). Several assays received emergency use authorization in China soon after the outbreak started (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0323">323</link>). The U.S. CDC assay received its EUA by the FDA on 4 February 2020, though testing was limited to the CDC and its distribution to selected public health laboratories was delayed until 28 February 2020. On 29 February 2020, the FDA issued a policy that allowed the development of commercial and laboratory <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 tests. Numerous commercial and laboratory-developed assays have received FDA EUA since then, with more than 250 authorized commercial molecular assays as of this update (<ulink url="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics-euas-molecular-diagnostic-tests-sars-cov-2">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics-euas-molecular-diagnostic-tests-sars-cov-2</ulink>). A large number of rRT-PCR assays have been developed using various gene targets, including the N, E, and S genes, as well as the ORF1ab and RdRp regions (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0202">202</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0324">324</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0325">325</link>). Furthermore, a majority of authorized assays utilize more than one gene target to reduce the risk of false-negative results due to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.</para>

        <para id="ch0112s0008s0007p0002">Extended respiratory panels have added SARS-CoV-2 (<anchor id="ch0112s0008s0007a0007"/><link linkend="ch0112s0008s0008a0007">Table 7</link>), and other assays were developed to combine SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus (with or without RSV) in anticipation of the cocirculation of these viruses during the influenza season (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0326">326</link>). Furthermore, some assay developers added indications for asymptomatic screening, saliva, and pooling to their EUA following FDA guidance (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0008a0007">Table 7</link>). A human housekeeping gene (e.g., the RNase P gene) is generally preferred as an internal control to ensure adequate collection of respiratory secretions and to control for sufficient nucleic acid extraction and the absence of RT-PCR inhibitors, though exogenously added internal controls are also frequently used. The presence of an adequacy control, such as RNase P, is particularly important for unobserved self-collection protocols. It is notable that cycle threshold (<emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>T</emphasis></subscript>) values generated by these rRT-PCR methods have been widely used as a surrogate for viral load in order to assess viral clearance and the response to therapy; however, <emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>T</emphasis></subscript>values lack standardization between platforms (275, 327–330). Clinical outcome studies are necessary to validate the utility of this practice. The quantitative Roche Cobas Duo assay on the Cobas 6800/8800 platform has received EUA, though the FDA indicates that only the qualitative result of the test is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients suspected of COVID-19. The availability of the First WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (code 20/146), available from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom), provides the opportunity to harmonize SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification assays for quantitation (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0331">331</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0007p0003">In addition to rRT-PCR methods, other approaches have been developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and have received FDA EUA, including RT-LAMP, RT-LAMP plus CRISPR, RT-droplet digital PCR, and next-generation sequencing (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0300">300</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0007p0004">Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via nucleic acid amplification testing from NP specimens is the current reference method, and NP specimens are the preferred specimen type for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Nevertheless, there has been significant concern regarding false-negative SARS-CoV-2 results from URT specimens (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0332">332</link>). Early reports from China suggested a clinical sensitivity of ~70% (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0332">332</link>), and similar to other respiratory viruses, there are examples of individuals that present with LRT disease and viral RNA detectable only in BAL fluid (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0333">333</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0334">334</link>). However, studies showed that only a small percentage (up to 3.5%) of patients initially testing negative by NP swab were positive on retesting within 7 days (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0327">327</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0335">335</link>), consistent with high clinical sensitivity. It is clear, however, that the clinical sensitivities of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics vary based on the time of specimen collection in relation to the onset of illness and the type of specimens collected (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0256">256</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0258">258</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0260">260</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0263">263</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0266">266</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0268">268</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0336">336</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0341">341</link>). It is also important to note that an exact estimate of clinical sensitivity is difficult to calculate given the lack of a comparator gold standard (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0335">335</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0342">342</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0343">343</link>). Critically, whenever there is high suspicion for COVID-19 and negative URT testing results, nucleic acid amplification testing of a newly collected URT specimen as well as an LRT specimen should be considered. Furthermore, serological testing may also play a role if an LRT specimen cannot be obtained.</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0007p0005">SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected for an extended period after the onset of symptoms (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0109">109</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0327">327</link>); however, the correlation between viral RNA detection and shedding of infectious virus is still a dilemma. Generally, higher viral loads are associated with virus recovery on cell culture (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0109">109</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0327">327</link>). However, cell culture results must be interpreted with care, due to variables that include the cell lines used and the number of days of incubation, which may have significant impact on sensitivity. An interest in developing molecular assays to differentiate prolonged shedding and actively transcribing virus resulted in the development of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) assays as a potential replacement for cell culture (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0268">268</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0344">344</link>). Interestingly, the median durations of symptoms to a negative test for sgE and sgN transcripts were 14 days and 25 days, respectively, suggesting that sgRNA may be no more useful than <emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>T</emphasis></subscript>values as an infectivity biomarker (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0345">345</link>). An alternative to sgRNA assays is the detection of minus-strand viral genomic RNA as a marker for active replication (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0346">346</link>). Further work is required to validate this approach compared to viral culture.</para>

The most common approach for whole-genome sequencing utilizes a tiled amplicon protocol developed by ARTIC with sequencing performed on widely available next-generation sequencing platforms, including Illumina and Oxford Nanopore (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0347">347</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0348">348</link>). Mutation-specific RT-PCR targeting mutations associated with VOC/VOI, such as N501Y, E484K, and L452R, are also used to complement whole-genome sequencing (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0349">349</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0350">350</link>). In addition, the S gene target failure observed in the three-gene-target Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID-19 assay has been used as a high-throughput screening method for the Alpha and Omicron variants (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0351">351</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0352">352</link>). Genotyping may impact clinical decision-making, particularly during the emergence of new variants that are resistant to neutralization by available monoclonal antibody therapies. As of this update, there are six sequencing tests, that have received EUA for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping.</para>

        <para id="ch0112s0008s0009p0001">Isolation of HCoVs is not effective as a routine diagnostic tool, because many commonly used cell lines are not permissive for growth or do not show obvious CPE. CPE is generally nonspecific, and reagents for immunofluorescent detection in culture are not widely available. The use of RT-PCR to detect HCoV in cell culture supernatant has been described, but it may be more efficient in a routine context to carry out NAATs on nucleic acids extracted directly from the specimen. HCoV-229E was originally isolated in human embryonic kidney cells but later propagated in a number of human embryonic lung fibroblast lines, such as WI-28, L132, and MRC-5 (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0039">39</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0080">80</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0159">159</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0353">353</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0354">354</link>). HCoV-OC43 was originally isolated in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0040">40</link>) and later adapted to suckling mouse brain and then to cell culture lines, including HRT-18, RD, and HEL (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0297">297</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0298">298</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0353">353</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0355">355</link>). HCoV-NL63 was originally isolated in tertiary monkey kidney cells and subsequently propagated in Vero and LLC-MK2 monkey kidney epithelial cell lines (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0050">50</link>). Although some reports described HCoV-NL63 CPE by day 5 of inoculation (<link linkend="ch0112s0004a0008">Fig. 3</link>), other studies have found low viral titers with slowly developing CPE and with difficulty in sustaining growth (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0294">294</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0355">355</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0356">356</link>). HCoV-NL63 growth appears to be more efficient in CaCo-2 cell lines, and this has enabled the development of a cytopathogenic plaque assay (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0355">355</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0009p0002">The continuous epithelial cell line HuH7 has been demonstrated to be permissive for HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63 (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0294">294</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0357">357</link>). HCoV-HKU1 has not yet been propagated in any common cell line (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0051">51</link>). However, all four HCoVs, including HCoV-HKU1, were successfully propagated on primary human bronchial epithelial cells subpassaged to form pseudostratified human airway epithelial cell cultures (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0358">358</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0359">359</link>). In this system, HCoV-NL63 was still difficult to isolate and there was no visible CPE for any of the viruses. HCoV-HKU1 has also now been serially propagated in primary human alveolar type II cells (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0360">360</link>). SARS-CoV grows in Vero and fetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cells, and in contrast to other HCoVs, focal CPE occurs and rapidly spreads across the monolayer (within 2 to 6 days) (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0043">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0044">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0047">47</link>). Human cell lines such as HuH7, HEK-293, and Hep-G2 are also permissive for SARS-CoV infection (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0361">361</link>). MERS-CoV was originally isolated in LLC-MK2 and Vero B4 cells (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0053">53</link>); however, isolation appears to be more successful in Caco-2 cells (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0362">362</link>), and the virus is capable of infecting a wide range of cell lines, including those from primates, pigs, goats, and bats. Inadvertent isolation of a novel CoV in cell culture is therefore a possibility, so when there is a suspicion of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, or other novel CoV infection, virus isolation should not be attempted without BSL3 facilities and procedures. NAATs should be used as a first-line test, because they involve virus inactivation. Transmission of SARS-CoV to a laboratory worker has been described (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0363">363</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0009p0003">Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 has been carried out by several groups primarily to study the correlation between RNA detection in respiratory specimens and shedding of infectious virus, particularly in the context of prolonged NAAT positivity after symptom resolution. These studies show that replication-competent virus can be recovered up to 9 days after symptom onset (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0110">110</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0268">268</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0338">338</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0364">364</link>) and that virus isolation is less likely when the viral loads are low (<emphasis>C</emphasis><subscript><emphasis>T</emphasis></subscript>values higher than 33) (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0110">110</link>). SARS-CoV-2 is isolatable using VeroE6, HuH7, and human airway epithelial cells, though a VeroE6 cell line engineered to constitutively express transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to facilitate the development of CPE and SARS-CoV-2 isolation and has been used to study the viral fitness and growth kinetics of evolving variants (<anchor id="ch0112s0008s0009a0003"/><link linkend="ch0112s0008s0010a0005">Fig. 5</link>) (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0365">365</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0112s0008s0010p0001">Serological testing for diagnosis of the endemic HCoVs has largely been replaced by more sensitive and specific NAATs. However, serology is useful in epidemiological studies, enhancing our understanding of HCoV infection and aiding the investigation of outbreaks. HCoV serology has been particularly important in the identification of cases of novel and emerging HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. In these situations, affected patients may not be tested for viral RNA but retrospectively can be shown to have developed an immune response. The use of viral lysate antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) requires propagation of the CoVs to high titers, which is difficult for HCoV-NL63 and not possible for HCoV-HKU1 without primary cultures. Furthermore, serological assays may lack specificity due to the antigenic relatedness among HCoVs, particularly between the alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and between the betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1.</para>

        <para id="ch0112s0008s0010p0002">The viral N protein induces a robust immune response, and recombinant N protein has been widely used in ELISA-based assays, as it can be readily expressed and purified without the need for viral culture. Unfortunately, cross-reactivity of serological assays using the full-length or truncated N protein has been reported, particularly between HCoVs of the same genus (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0082">82</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0085">85</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0366">366</link>). However, the carboxy-terminal region of the N protein appears to be significantly less homologous between HCoVs, and recombinant N protein-based ELISAs utilizing this region have been successfully developed for all four endemic HCoVs (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0063">63</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0082">82</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0085">85</link>). This may be at the expense of some sensitivity though, as the carboxy-terminal region of the HCoV-OC43 N protein was demonstrated to be less immunogenic than the central region (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0367">367</link>). The use of recombinant (S) protein-based ELISAs for HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0084">84</link>). The difficulty in culturing some HCoVs is an obstacle to the development of neutralization assays; however, neutralization assays using S-pseudotyped HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 can circumvent this problem (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0084">84</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0086">86</link>). As with other HCoVs, most serological assays for SARS-CoV were initially based on antibody detection in acute- and convalescent-phase sera by indirect fluorescent assay using fixed infected cells and by ELISA using lysates from cell culture (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0044">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0046">46</link>). Recombinant N protein-based ELISAs were then developed to remove the requirement for BSL3 containment, with confirmation by Western blotting targeting antibodies to both the N and S proteins. Neutralization assays also required cultivation of SARS-CoV and were less practical for routine diagnosis. A number of laboratory-developed and commercial serological tests for MERS-CoV have been described, but few have been directly compared; these include protein microarrays, ELISA, whole-virus- and recombinant-protein-based indirect fluorescent assay, microneutralization, plaque reduction neutralization, and pseudovirus neutralization tests (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0368">368</link>). However, one comparative study showed good correlation between a number of different neutralization tests, including pseudovirus neutralization tests, and acceptable performance of a commercial S-protein-based ELISA (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0369">369</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0010p0003">Serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed for total or isotype-specific antibodies (IgG, IgA, and IgM) primarily against the N or S proteins, including full-length S, the RBD, and the S1 region. Various different antibody detection approaches have been employed (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0370">370</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0372">372</link>), and numerous commercial qualitative and semiquantitative assays have obtained EUA (<anchor id="ch0112s0008s0010a0006"/><link linkend="ch0112s0008s0011a0004">Table 8</link>). These antibody assays demonstrate a range of sensitivities, and performance characteristics are dependent on the timing of sample collection. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies develop approximately 14 days after the onset of symptoms (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0268">268</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0336">336</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0340">340</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0373">373</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0376">376</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0010p0004">Serological assays may be used as an adjunct to diagnostic nucleic acid amplification assays in a limited number of circumstances; for example, for patients negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by NP swab but with radiographic evidence of viral lower respiratory tract disease, a diagnosis may be made by antibody testing, rather than by obtaining BAL fluid through an aerosol-generating procedure. IgG testing can also be used to identify or confirm previous infection in individuals who are no longer symptomatic and who may not have received a NAAT on a respiratory specimen collected during their acute illness and to diagnose patients who have 3 to 4 weeks of symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing is also critical to identify donors for convalescent-phase plasma therapy and assess cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0374">374</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0377">377</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0378">378</link>). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies typically reflects immunity to infection and reinfection, though the levels that correlate with protection and the durability of protection remain under investigation. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that develop after natural infection persist for up to 8 months, and the magnitude of the initial response may predict antibody duration (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0379">379</link>–<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0384">384</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0010p0005">SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing may also be used to monitor the humoral response to vaccination, though this practice is not currently recommended by the CDC or FDA (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0385">385</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0386">386</link>). It is worth emphasizing that even with the availability of authorized semiquantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays, protective antibody values have not yet been determined. If one decides to use serological testing for this purpose on specimens collected from individuals vaccinated with currently authorized spike-only vaccines, it is important to utilize an anti-S assay, as anti-N assays will be nonreactive. Similarly, antibody testing may be used to differentiate humoral responses due to natural infection (i.e., anti-N and anti-S) from those due to vaccination with spike-only vaccines (anti-S only). However, results must be interpreted with caution, as a subset of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection do not produce anti-N IgG antibodies (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0387">387</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0010p0006">Additional clinical assays to characterize the antibody response have also been developed. These comprise ACE2 blocking assays and culture-based neutralization assays, including spike-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus or lentivirus, that can be handled under BSL2 conditions.

        <para id="ch0112s0008s0011p0001">The cornerstone of management of HCoV infections is the accurate and timely diagnosis of affected individuals, because symptoms may be similar to those caused by other respiratory pathogens. The diagnosis of HCoV aids surveillance, ensures that appropriate infection control and public health procedures are initiated, and may contribute to antibiotic stewardship by providing a viral diagnosis (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0388">388</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0011p0002">In the case of novel and emerging HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, the development and availability of commercial tests lagged behind those of laboratory-developed tests because of the regulatory authorization process and supply chain issues, illustrating the importance of maintaining in-house molecular expertise in diagnostic virology laboratories. As supply chain issues resolved and the FDA reconsidered its oversight of the authorization of laboratory-developed tests, at the time of this update, hundreds of commercial and laboratory-developed assays are now available for diagnostic testing. Nevertheless, testing resources may vary regionally, and in situations with limited testing capacity, priority should be given to symptomatic patients.</para>

        <para id="ch0112s0008s0011p0005">The interpretation of HCoV test results remains challenging, particularly in the rapidly changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though false-negative NAAT results for symptomatic patients remain an ongoing concern (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0343">343</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0389">389</link>), lower-sensitivity pooled or group testing approaches were implemented as a mechanism to increase testing capacity (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0390">390</link>), particularly for screening asymptomatic individuals in congregate living facilities, such as dormitories, nursing homes, and prisons. Pooling allows more frequent testing, which may mitigate the loss of sensitivity. Similarly, simple, inexpensive, relatively low-sensitivity antigen tests also allow more frequent testing and may play a role in screening individuals in congregate living situations. Test interpretation is further complicated by prolonged viral RNA detection in recovered, asymptomatic individuals weeks to months following the onset of illness (<link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0109">109</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0268">268</link>, <link linkend="ch0112s0008s0012li0391">391</link>). The uncertainty regarding viral infectivity at these late time points has resulted in a transition from test-based to symptom-based recommendations for decisions about ending quarantine and returning to work. The kinetics of viral detection in asymptomatic individuals is also poorly understood. Finally, as prevalence decreases due to vaccination, it is important to note that the positive predictive value of diagnostic testing will also decrease.</para>
        <para id="ch0112s0008s0011p0006">In summary, the four endemic HCoVs make up a small but significant proportion of the viruses found in patients with acute respiratory infection. Including HCoVs alongside the more common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, RSV, and adenovirus, in syndromic panels has increased diagnostic yield and helped to further our understanding of the role of HCoVs in respiratory infections. Outbreaks caused by highly pathogenic HCoVs are of significant concern and have demonstrated devastating pandemic potential. The widespread occurrence of CoVs in mammals and birds and the potential for interspecies transmission events further emphasize the need for effective global surveillance for the emergence of new pathogenic HCoVs, as well as the implementation of a testing infrastructure capable of responding rapidly to the next pandemic.</para>
