      <para id="ch0022s000000p0001">The practice of clinical microbiology has been revolutionized by technological innovations such as the advent of molecular diagnostics and PCR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and most recently laboratory automation. The ability to automate culture-based microbiology comes as a welcome relief to laboratories struggling to keep up with the demands of increasing test volumes in the face of ongoing staffing shortages. Automated culture-based microbiology systems can be modular and automate isolated tasks, such as specimen processing, inoculation, and plate streaking, or they can offer a comprehensive process which automates everything from specimen processing to plate reading and obtaining results.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0002">Although there are many forms of automation, this chapter focuses on the automation of culture-based bacteriology, and readers are referred to other chapters for discussions on automated susceptibility testing systems (<ulink url="ch0093#ch0093s0001">chapter 75</ulink>) and molecular diagnostics (<ulink url="ch0023#ch0023s0001">chapter 8</ulink>). In this chapter, the various components of culture-based automation are discussed, along with some important considerations for those looking to adopt automation in their microbiology laboratory, such as how to select the right system, change management, and system validation. The chapter also includes some details of each system for the purposes of facilitating a capability comparison. It is important to note that these systems are rapidly evolving; readers should check with the manufacturers as they are making decisions about which automated system is best for their laboratory.</para>

        <para id="ch0022s000000p0003">The microbiology laboratory has changed very little over the past 30 years with respect to laboratory automation. The field, though, is now shifting toward automating what has traditionally been a manual discipline. Even though clinical chemistry laboratories adopted total laboratory automation (TLA) over 30 years ago, the concept has been slow to be accepted in microbiology (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0001">1</link>). Several factors have contributed to the delay in automating clinical microbiology laboratories.</para>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0004">First, the complexity of the microbiological specimen has hindered the development of TLA solutions. The clinical chemistry specimen is of relatively uniform volume and consistency and, perhaps most importantly, is collected in standardized containers. These factors are conducive to automation and are in sharp contrast to specimens received in clinical microbiology laboratories. The clinical microbiology laboratory must be able to process and analyze an enormous variety of specimen types which are collected in highly variable containers. The shift towards liquid-based, flocked-swab specimen collection systems has simplified processing of a significant portion of microbiology specimens and facilitated the adoption of laboratory automation, in particular, automated specimen processing.</para>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0005">Second, many specimens collected for bacterial culture are not from normally sterile sites. Technologists must read and interpret cultures and distinguish normal flora from pathogens using Gram stain interpretation, knowledge of expected microbiota at the site, knowledge of pathogens, and the relative quantity of these organisms. Culture interpretation is a highly specialized skill that takes months to years for technologists to develop. In the clinical microbiology laboratory, technologists must work with TLA systems to efficiently produce culture results. This differs significantly from the “sample in, answer out” testing performed by automated chemistry instruments. Artificial intelligence programs may one day be able to replicate the complex interpretations required of microbiology technologists, but at present, most culture interpretation requires human judgment and cannot be automated.</para>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0006">Third, the cost of automation is a significant barrier to entry into the clinical microbiology laboratory. Relative to chemistry testing, microbiology specimen volumes are much smaller. However, in the face of clinical microbiology laboratory consolidation and labor shortages, the high-volume, centralized laboratory model is becoming common and may be an attractive setting for the introduction and expansion of automation.</para>

        <para id="ch0022s000000p0007">There are three major commercial systems for laboratory automation: BD Kiestra (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), Copan WASPLab (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA), and the Clever Culture Systems APAS (Clever Culture Systems, Freienbach, Switzerland). The details of each system are presented below. The BD Kiestra and the Copan WASPLAB are modular, consisting of a specimen processor which inoculates specimens onto agar plates, “smart” incubators which hold temperature and CO<subscript>2</subscript> concentration constant, resulting in optimal growth of bacterial and yeast colonies, and digital imaging of agar plates for culture reading and interpretation. Automation in microbiology aims to improve quality, reduce time to results, better manage an increasing number of specimens, compensate for reduction in skilled staff, and be more economically effective (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0002">2</link>). In one study, installation of a WASPLab system in four diverse clinical microbiology laboratories resulted in an 18 to 93% increase in productivity. Testing volumes at all four laboratories rose after TLA was implemented, and the increased productivity resulted in a full-time equivalent (FTE) savings of 5.6 to 13.6, depending on the site (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0022s000000li0004">4</link>).</para>

The system processes smears (as an add-on feature) and sputum, stool, and liquid samples. It includes specimen processing with the WASP, incubation in aerobic and CO<subscript>2</subscript> atmospheres, and digital imaging. An incubator has a capacity of 854 (single incubator) to 1,708 (double incubator) plates. The system includes an automated colony-picking system (Colibri) (<anchor id="ch0022s000000a0019"/><link linkend="ch0022s000000a0036">Fig. 8</link>). The Colibri system automates the preparation of targets for MALDI-TOF MS and prepares a suspension for antimicrobial susceptibility testing that can be adjusted to accommodate a variety of identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) systems. It processes subcultures and purity plates. The Colibri system receives information from WASPLab via digital imaging. The WASP-FLO supports automatic robotic sorting and loading of samples onto conveyor lines to distribute samples to multiple WASP stations. The Collaborative Robot is a HEPA-filtered workstation that can be contained in a biological safety cabinet to allow processing of specimens that cannot be placed on the WASP directly, such as tissues, traditional transport swabs, and nonstandard collection devices. Specimens processed in this way are inserted into the automation incubation system after they have been inoculated. <anchor id="ch0022s000000a0021"/><link linkend="ch0022s000000a0041">Figure 9</link> shows a WASPLab installed in a clinical laboratory.</para>

      <para id="ch0022s000000p0010">The APAS Independence is currently the only FDA-cleared system for presumptive classification of colonies in large morphologic groups (i.e., coliform-like colonies, swarming colonies,<emphasis>Staphylococcus</emphasis>-like colonies, etc.) (<anchor id="ch0022s000000a0031"/><link linkend="ch0022s000000a0043">Fig. 10</link>). The APAS Independence system requires off-line incubation and manual loading of plates onto the system for imaging analysis. As of the writing of this chapter, the system is capable of interpreting methicillin-resistant <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> (MRSA) chromogenic agar plates as well as urine culture plates. Artificial intelligence analyzes the digital images of the plates and triages them into the categories “significant,” “nonsignificant,” “negative,” or “for review,” thus allowing the laboratory to streamline their workflow and potentially reduce the burden of managing negative cultures. Once the plates have been analyzed, the system sorts them into canisters according to their interpretation so that a technologist can then remove them and take the appropriate next steps in the culture workup. A study by Glasson et al. demonstrated this system was able to generate presumptive identifications on blood and MacConkey agar with variable sensitivity, with the lowest percentages for <emphasis>Staphylococcus</emphasis>-like colonies (81.5%) and physically smaller colonies (88.8) and the highest percentages for swarming colonies and small β-hemolytic colonies (100%) (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0005">5</link>).</para>

The automation of microbiological specimen processing improves the quality of plate streaking, avoids cross-contamination, alleviates ergonomic issues, and reduces processing time and costs (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0007">7</link>). Automated plate streaking is reproducible and reliably yields isolated colonies. This reduces the number of subcultures necessary for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0008">8</link>). The systems usually process swabs in liquid transport media such as E-swab (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA), Pur Flock (Puritan Medical Products, Guilford, ME), and Sigma swab (Medical Wire, Wiltshire, England). These swab systems consist of either an open-pore polyurethane foam tip with modified Amies medium (Sigma swab) or a nylon-flocked swab with Amies medium (E-Swab and Pur Flock). These systems lead to a significantly improved release of microorganisms from the swab to the transport medium and allow better evaluation of the microorganisms in the Gram stain (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0022s000000li0010">10</link>).

Fully automated (FA) mode is used for liquid-based specimens and includes medium selection based on the specimen type, agar plate labeling with patient identifiers, specimen inoculation, and agar plate streaking; semiautomated (SA) mode allows the technologist to add specimen to the agar plate from within the biosafety cabinet, but all other steps detailed above are automated; and first-inoculation (FI) mode allows the technologist to inoculate and streak the agar plates, but medium selection and labeling are automated. In FA and SA modes, the streaking pattern (<anchor id="ch0022s000000a0046"/><link linkend="ch0022s000000a0051">Fig. 11</link>) can be either selected from a variety of patterns or defined by the customer for each specimen or medium type. Rather than a traditional loop-based system, the InoqulA+ uses a sterile magnetic rolling bead technology to streak the plates.

        <para id="ch0022s000000p0019">The resolution of an image is the ability to distinguish fine detail in the image. The resolution of an image is expressed as the number of dots per inch (dpi) or pixels per inch (ppi) of the image that is captured. The higher the dpi of an image, the higher its image resolution. A high-resolution camera allows one to capture a digital image in a single frame while maintaining the detail and clarity of the image. The goal of resolution is to differentiate the smallest amount of detail that is anticipated to be necessary for appropriate interpretation of the culture.</para>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0020">For digital images, one must consider both the resolution of the camera and the pixel dimensions of the monitors on which the image will be displayed. Each monitor is different and may have a different resolution based on the pixel dimensions (i.e., the horizontal and vertical measurements of an image expressed in pixels). The pixel dimension of the monitor has a significant impact on the quality of the image presented to the technologist to be analyzed. Therefore, many manufacturers require that images be analyzed only on approved monitors that have image resolution appropriate for culture interpretation and analysis.</para>

        <para id="ch0022s000000p0027">Critical to the ability to capture digital images is the use of light in the imaging system. For image analysis, two key features are used to describe how light impacts the image, dynamic range and sensitivity. Dynamic range is the total range of tonal difference between the lightest and darkest part of an image that can be captured in one form. The higher the dynamic range, the more shades from light to dark that can be represented. However, with a high dynamic range, there is still the need for a range of tones to be represented. This is impacted by the imaging sensitivity, which is the lowest light intensity a camera can capture with the lowest level of noise introduced into the system (personal communication Erin McElvania). According to the manufacturers, combining dynamic range and sensitivity will determine the appropriate amount of light needed to distinguish the appropriate features in the culture image.</para>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0028">Culture plate imaging systems take pictures of plates with several exposures and under different lighting conditions (front, back, and side lights) and imaging conditions (exposure time and brightness) in order to simulate the lighting environment used by the technologist to determine the colony size, shape, color, and hemolysis. For instance, backlighting may be better to observe hemolysis, while front lighting may be best to observe bacterial colony shape and color (personal communication Erin McElvania). Systems may include an image acquired after inoculation but prior to being entered in the incubator, time zero (<emphasis>T</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript>). The <emphasis>T</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript> image can be used to (i) compare growth following incubation, (ii) review any inconsistencies in the agar that may have been present prior to incubation, and (iii) provide a baseline image for automated image analysis system.</para>

      <para id="ch0022s000000p0029">Obtaining a digital image of the culture allows the use of new tools and opportunities for advancement in culture reading and interpretation. The benefits of using a digital image for analysis include customization of image capture time for laboratory workflow, static image capture, preservation of the image for future use, and automation software-supported image analysis.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0030">Most systems allow users to configure the imaging process to take pictures of plates at customizable times with several exposures and at various angles in order to simulate the lighting environments used by the technologist to determine colony size, shape, color, and hemolysis. This allows the user to determine the appropriate time for image capture based on the needs and workflow in the laboratory. This customization of imaging ensures that cultures are imaged at specified times and aids in interpretation of cultures. Use of digital images and TLA can allow images to be captured at earlier time points, reducing the overall turnaround time (TAT) for culture reading (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0022s000000li0013">13</link>–<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0015">15</link>). In one study, image capture at 16 h instead of 18 h reduced the overall time to result by 10 h with only a slight loss in sensitivity (1 to 2% for Gram-negative organisms and 3 to 7% for Gram-positive organisms) (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0014">14</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0031">Digital images provide the advantage of capturing the culture at a static period, thus preserving the optimal read time for the culture. Even if images are not processed immediately, the image remains preserved, allowing evaluation of the culture to be interpreted appropriately, even if colonies grow further and can possibly grow together. In each system, with the included software interface, colonies of bacteria can be digitally selected and labeled by the technologist reading the culture or by image analysis systems for further processing either manually or by additional automation components (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0022s000000li0017">17</link>). In addition, all samples from one patient (e.g., urine, sputum, and multidrug-resistant organism screening) can be evaluated simultaneously to allow comprehensive interpretation of the cultures, rather than each culture or source being interpreted in isolation. Last, images can be archived and later used for training or for quality control (QC) programs.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0032">The methods employed by clinical microbiology image analysis systems may include comparing images taken at inoculation to images taken at different times during incubation, using an algorithm based on signal-to-noise/pixel ratio or machine learning to distinguish colony presence and absence (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0005">5</link>). Applications of these tools to aid in interpretation of colony morphology include detection and quantification of all colonies on a particular medium type, detection of appropriate growth on chromogenic media for morphologic assessment, and interpretation of colony morphology.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0033">Obtaining a digital image provides the opportunity for developing digital image analysis systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network pathways to support interpretation of the culture. The system must be able to replicate the complex decision-making that a technologist performs. A simple decision tree for a technologist may be as follows: (i) determine the presence of colonies; (ii) determine the morphology; (iii) distinguish the presence of multiple morphologies; (iv) count the colonies present; (v) count the colonies of each morphology present; (vi) use laboratory procedures to determine how to work up the culture. Developing AI systems that can replicate these highly complex tasks required to interpret a culture remains a challenge.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0034">The first algorithms that were developed were based on the first criterion of growth or no growth on general culture media, which looks for the presence of microbial colonies at a given colony count to identify cultures with growth (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0018">18</link>–<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0020">20</link>). The use of chromogenic media can further enhance these tools by combining the ability to identify colony growth and colony color to aid in identification of colonies on the agar. Several studies have demonstrated that use of image analysis tools with chromogenic media improves the detection of positive colonies compared to when cultures are reviewed either on the digital image or manually (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0021">21</link>). Further, the use of image analysis tools plus chromogenic media improves the sensitivity of cultures to approach that of molecular methods (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0022">22</link>). In the cases of chromogenic media, there is generally very high specificity, with false-positive results generated often due to pigmentation associated with residual sample matrix or due to inherent lack of specificity of the chromogenic media (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0022s000000li0022">22</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0022s000000p0036">Advancements in the automated analysis and interpretation of digital images are expected to continue. These advancements can include the use of more chromogenic media for simplified image analysis, additional imaging tools to identify distinguishing features in colonies that allow more accurate colony identification, and integration of laboratory data to aid in the interpretation of significance of the culture. Last, approval of these algorithms by the FDA may lead to broader adoption, as this may remove the need for a medical technologist to verify instrument decisions.</para>

Data regarding specimen volume, arrival time of specimens, plate reading schedule, and overall workflow must be collected in order to negotiate the future laboratory design with the manufacturers being considered. If possible, it is recommended that the institutions conduct a thorough assessment of the systems installed in other institutions to determine whether each system can fulfill a laboratory’s needs. All types of laboratory personnel should be involved in the project to incorporate their suggestions and ideas as well as to increase general support for the necessary changes.

The productivity is influenced by the choice of a streaking pattern, the number of pictures taken by digital imaging, and whether a whole plate or a biplate is inoculated.

Inoculators should ensure that particles and air bubbles in the specimen are detected in order to avoid false-negative inoculations. Measures against transposition and cross-contamination of the samples should be ensured during the validation process. A study evaluating cross-contamination by automated systems has been published (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0024">24</link>).

At present, there is no formal guidance on the performance of quality control for automated systems. As a result, laboratory directors will need to decide what is appropriate for their own laboratories. Although there is no official guidance, one option would be to implement sterility checks that control the inoculation process by processing negative specimens and looking for system contamination. Additional quality control monitoring may include incubator temperature checks, standards for quantitation, and image quality assessment.

Inoculation devices cost at least $200,000 (U.S. dollars [USD]). TLA costs vary by country but can exceed 2 million USD. It might be necessary to purchase agar plates and broths from different manufacturers. Changing agar media often results in the need to reprogram the automated plate streaker, which can lead to additional costs. Changes in workflow can lead to alterations in the staffing requirements on different shifts and may necessitate implementing a night shift if one does not currently exist. This must be considered when the return on the investment is assessed. Service and repair charges, as well as the costs of the interfaces, must also be included. The annual costs of the service agreement can exceed 10% of the original investment. Possible structural changes in the laboratory should also be represented in the financial plan.

It therefore falls upon the laboratory director to design and implement a validation plan. There are numerous ways in which to achieve this goal, but any validation plan should evaluate the functional components of the instrument, assess analytical functionality, and compare clinical results that are achieved with automation versus traditional culture methods. Due to the unique nature of these systems, several groups are developing guidance documents to standardize recommendations for validating/verifying laboratory automation. Laboratories should refer to these documents in order to meet the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 requirements for system validation/verification.

To maximize the benefits and efficiencies of TLA, the entire workflow and culture of the laboratory must be reevaluated. Luckily, laboratory automation provides tools which can be used to optimize laboratory practices. Data on specimen volumes, time of specimen arrival, and time of day when cultures have been imaged and are ready for reading are readily available. Laboratories can use this information to optimize staffing hours for specimen processing, culture reading, culture workup, and susceptibility testing. This allows the greatest number of employees to be working when the greatest amount of work needs to be performed, and it allows a laboratory to schedule their employees for times when the results they are entering make the biggest impact on patient care. Employee productivity can also be tracked, which ensures equitable distribution of the workload and generates metrics to justify staffing numbers.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0053">Each clinical microbiology laboratory and the medical staff they serve are different, so there is no “one size fits all” solution for optimizing laboratory automation workflows. One important step toward optimizing the use of laboratory automation is having specimens placed in liquid-based transport media wherever possible. Efficiencies are gained through trial and error and require collaboration between laboratory staff and clinical directors. During the transition from traditional culture workup to laboratory automation, it is important for laboratory staff and directors to focus on the end goal of improved patient care. Change is never easy, but a positive attitude and a willingness to try new things will go far during this process.</para>

Reading plates digitally results in earlier recognition of colony growth. Consequently, identification and susceptibility testing can be accelerated. The pictures of the plates are taken at user-defined intervals and times for further processing. Computers can support the preselection of culture-negative plates. The plates showing growth are sent through further diagnostic procedures. Imaging technology can detect even the smallest of colonies, which are difficult for the human eye to distinguish. Chromogenic media for identifying antimicrobial-resistant organisms, such as MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and multidrug-resistant <emphasis>Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> spp., are particularly suitable for imaging technology, since results of the cultures can be documented earlier (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0022s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0022s000000li0025">25</link>).

      <para id="ch0022s000000p0055">Traditional culture reading involves a single technologist reading, interpreting, and working-up a defined set of cultures for the day, such as blood, urine, respiratory, or wound cultures. This method is not efficient when combined with laboratory automation. One model used by many laboratories with automation is the “reader-worker” method. In this model “readers” view agar plates that have been imaged after predefined incubation periods specific to their culture type on computer monitors. Any culture interpreted as “no growth,” “insufficient growth,” or “mixed microbiota” normal for the culture site is reported as such in the laboratory information system. Cultures which require manual manipulation for the purposes of identification or organism rule-out are marked for testing and appear on the “worker” task list. Staff on the worker bench pull the appropriate agar plate required for testing, perform the task (e.g., biochemical testing or MALDI-TOF MS), and return the plates to the incubator. The benefits of the reader-worker method are that it promotes consistency in specimen workup, as multiple technologists have eyes on each culture. Task-based workup also allows technologists to move through culture more rapidly.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0056">Within the reader-worker model, there is room for specialization, and automation facilitates special situations unique to each laboratory. Examples are having a dedicated technologist spot MALDI-TOF MS targets from specimens that are pure cultures, ensuring that positive blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and sterile body fluids are viewed and worked up before other culture types, and designating certain culture types (e.g., urine culture, group A<emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis>, and group B <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> screens) that are read by technologists on second and third shifts, where there tends to be less supervision than on the day shift.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0057">Automatic culture reading is another huge advance made possible with laboratory automation. These applications use machine learning to determine growth of microorganisms on agar plates. If growth is detected, the imaging algorithms can determine how many colony types and what quantity of growth is present. Use of chromogenic media allows organisms to be presumptively identified (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0022s000000li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0022s000000li0025">25</link>).

Becoming a medical technologist (MT) (also referred to as a clinical laboratory scientist, biomedical scientist, or medical laboratory scientist) generally requires a bachelor’s degree in medical technology or in a science such as biology or chemistry. MT programs are usually offered through a university and involve clinical laboratory internships, and some states may require that MTs pass an examination to be licensed. MTs are qualified to perform complex testing and analyses, including direct specimen microscopy, culture interpretation, organism identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, to perform high-complexity molecular testing, and to supervise others. MTs are expected to understand the underlying scientific principles of laboratory testing as well as the causes of disease and the importance of test selection.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0059">A medical laboratory technician (MLT) is defined as someone who has a working comprehension of technical and procedural aspects of laboratory tests. The technician correlates tests with disease processes, understands basic physiology, and recognizes abnormal test results. The tasks that can be performed by MLTs vary by institution but generally include quality assurance monitoring, computer applications, and instrumentation troubleshooting and require an understanding of specimen collection and processing. The American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) states that a technician may make technical decisions related to testing but should be supervised by a technologist, supervisor, or laboratory director. MLTs usually have an associate degree from a community or junior college or a vocational school. MLTs may become MTs through additional education and experience.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0060">Medical laboratory assistants are individuals who receive on-the-job training and may have specialized education, although that is not required. The primary tasks of the medical laboratory assistant are processing specimens and using preanalytical systems. These professionals must have in-depth knowledge of specimen acceptability.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0061">Traditionally, microbiology staff are trained to read plates by specimen type, starting with culture types that are typically monomicrobial, such as those from urine specimens, and moving toward cultures that are often polymicrobial with complex algorithms for interpretation, such as cultures of respiratory and wound specimens. Training with TLA follows the same pattern. Worklists can be used to pull specific culture types so that the trainee can view only the specimens on which they are being trained. Positive and normal flora cultures can be saved for training purposes while cultures with no growth can be bypassed, giving the trainee exposure to a higher number of specimens in a shorter amount of time, while eliminating non-value-added activities such as shuffling through plates and viewing cultures with no growth. Being able to view images of all agar plates at once as well as the same culture at multiple time points allows trainees to recognize bacterial growth on various media at different stages of growth. Historical cultures can be saved and used as training aids to highlight unusual organisms or rare culture patterns. In total, although the process for technologist training follows a similar pattern, the exposure to a higher number of cultures in a shorter amount of time can increase the speed at which competency in culture reading is achieved.</para>
      <para id="ch0022s000000p0062">In laboratories with TLA, either MTs, MLTs, or laboratory assistants can load specimens onto the automated instrument, which takes the place of agar plate selection and labeling, specimen inoculation and streaking, and placing agar plates in the incubator. Generally, culture reading, interpretation, and workup are performed by MTs. A change with automation is the ability to be creative and identify special niches of work traditionally performed by medical technologists that can now be performed by MLTs. An example of this is spotting organism from pure cultures onto targets for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Use of automation allows qualifying cultures to be easily identified and pulled from the incubator for workup.</para>

        <title>LIMITATIONS OF AUTOMATION SYSTEMS</title>

        <para id="ch0022s000000p0063">The strength of the automatic systems described lies in the increased quality of specimen processing as well as directing technologist time to high-level analytical tasks and away from repetitive, manual processes. The main limitation of laboratory automation is the type of specimens they are equipped to handle. Specimens that cannot be pipetted, such as tissues, require some manual processing even with automation. However, the possibilities for automatic processing can be expanded considerably using liquid-based specimen transport systems. This effectively converts a very high-volume specimen, the swab, into a liquid specimen that can be easily managed with an automated specimen processor (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0010">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0022s000000li0026">26</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0064">Incubators are equipped for CO<subscript>2</subscript> and ambient-air incubation at 35°C, but other incubation conditions such as those used for anaerobic and <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> species must be performed offline. Medium selection, specimen inoculation, and plate streaking can still be automated using these systems.</para>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0065">A high level of flexibility and system compatibility is needed to fit automation instrumentation into the large variety of clinical microbiology laboratories that exist today. The modular nature of the automation systems described enables the laboratories to achieve various levels of automation: front-end processing, incubation and imaging, or more comprehensive configurations. The combination of modular automation and process improvement, as explained, promises scalability of the current automation systems for laboratories independent of their size or physical layout. The advantages and disadvantages of the described systems are provided in<anchor id="ch0022s000000a0091"/><link linkend="ch0022s000000a0089">Table 3</link> (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0027">27</link>).</para>

        <title>FUTURE PERSPECTIVES</title>
        <anchor id="ch0022s000019a0003"/>
        <anchor id="ch0022s000000a0092"/>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0066">The degree of automation as well as the variety of procedures that can be automated will continue to increase. Continued development will make the systems more flexible and result in products that can better accommodate the conditions of each individual laboratory. Automated technology is evolving quickly. It will soon include additional testing, such as direct testing of blood culture systems and molecular diagnostics.</para>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0067">The primary objective of automating microbiology laboratories is to improve the quality and consistency of processes that suffer from high variability and are labor-intensive. The hope is that these technologies will allow the laboratory staff to concentrate on the processing of more technically demanding specimens. Software solutions for integrating point-of-care testing devices will further improve the analytic process.</para>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0068">Further scientific evaluation of TLA could also facilitate an appraisal of its clinical relevance and its impact on patient care. Automation could reduce errors and improve the quality of diagnostic microbiology. A time gain of 30.6 h per isolate was demonstrated in comparison to conventional microbiology methods when Kiestra TLA combined with MALDI-TOF MS was used for microbial identification of blood culture isolates (<link linkend="ch0022s000000li0028">28</link>). The early identification resulted in a change of antibiotic regimen for 12% (24/200) of patients.</para>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0069">Last, digital image processing as an integral part of bacteriological clinical diagnostics will promote further development in telemedicine as laboratory consolidations result in microbiology laboratories serving larger and larger geographical areas. In many centralized laboratory models, sample processing and plate reading may not take place in the same location. In such situations, quality standards can still be maintained in small laboratories or in remote areas by offering access to experienced personnel. Telemedicine can help counter the lack of skilled personnel in these areas.</para>

        <anchor id="ch0022s000000a0093"/>
        <para id="ch0022s000000p0070">New advances in technology as well as staffing shortages are causing microbiologists to rethink laboratory design. It may be that the traditional laboratory model as we know it today will cease to exist soon. TLA will likely become commonplace in high-volume laboratories and may eventually be found in smaller laboratories. Despite its promise, there are advantages and disadvantages of laboratory automation, and it may not be appropriate for all environments (<link linkend="ch0022s000000a0089">Table 3</link>). Automation is unlikely to replace MTs, but it will change requirements in two important ways. First, manual processing of the plates will be replaced by digital imaging. Second, the efficiency of automation may cause more laboratories to adopt the 24-h culture-reading strategy. Clinical microbiology is changing at a rapid pace, primarily due to a surge in technological advances. Laboratory designs will need to be more flexible to accommodate future developments.</para>
