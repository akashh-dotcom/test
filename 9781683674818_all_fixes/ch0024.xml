      <para id="ch0024s000000p0001">While mass spectrometry, molecular, and sequencing methods have dramatically altered the diagnostic field for infectious diseases, multiple clinical scenarios exist for which serological assessment remains the diagnostic method of choice. Immunoassays often serve as confirmatory or retrospective diagnostic tests due to the inherent delay associated with development of a detectable humoral immune response following infection. As a result, serologic testing is not intended to be the sole basis by which most diagnoses are established. However, for certain infectious agents, including those that cannot readily be cultured or detected by molecular methods (e.g.,<emphasis>Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema pallidum, Coxiella burnetii</emphasis>, etc.), in situations where antimicrobials were administered prior to sampling, or if there is a need to determine prior exposure history or vaccination status, serologic testing remains advantageous. In these scenarios, detection of an organism-specific antibody response to, or antigen released from, the infectious agent can often provide a rapid diagnosis.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0002">By definition, immunoassays are used to detect the presence or quantity of an analyte (e.g., antibody or antigen) in patient samples (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0001">1</link>). While serum and plasma are the primary specimen sources evaluated, many immunoassays have also been validated for use in other sample types, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunoassays can be adapted for detection of analytes across laboratory disciplines, and reagents are often less expensive than those for other diagnostic methods, such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0003">This chapter summarizes the common serologic testing methods used for detection of the humoral immune response to, or antigen(s) released from, various infectious agents. More specifically, their application for the diagnosis of infectious diseases is presented, including a discussion of the advantages and limitations of selected methods. While a number of distinct immunoassay examples related to clinical testing are included, the reader is directed to the designated chapters in this manual for in-depth discussions of pathogen-specific serologic assays.</para>

        <para id="ch0024s000000p0004">The first immunoassays were developed in the 1940s and were largely dependent on the visualization of antigen-antibody (Ag-Ab) precipitation bands in agar. These particular types of assays, referred to as immunodiffusion tests, were developed by the Swedish physician Örjan Ouchterlony and were able to detect milligram to microgram quantities of an analyte (<anchor id="ch0024s000000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0024s000000a0005">Table 1</link>) (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0003">3</link>). Immunodiffusion tests, however, can be labor-intensive, and their interpretation is subjective. These limitations, alongside concurrent improvements in antibody/antigen purification techniques and the introduction of new detection systems, brought about the development of increasingly more sensitive and objective immunoassay methods (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0004">4</link>–<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0008">8</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0005">The first significant improvement to immunoassays occurred in the clinical chemistry arena in 1959. Rosalyn S. Yalow and Solomon Berson developed a novel radioimmunoassay (RIA) method for detection of human antibodies to insulin and received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work in 1977 (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0009">9</link>). Using purified antibodies linked to one of a variety of radioisotopes (e.g., <superscript>125</superscript>I, <superscript>3</superscript>H, or <superscript>14</superscript>C), results from RIAs could be objectively evaluated using a scintillation counter or photographic paper. The RIA dramatically improved sensitivity and greatly expanded the types of analytes available for testing (<link linkend="ch0024s000000a0005">Table 1</link>). This was also the method after which many later enzyme immunoassays were modeled. The discovery of monoclonal antibodies and the development of antibody-producing hybridomas by Köhler and Milstein in 1975 enabled the production of RIAs with improved specificity and further enhanced the repertoire of analytes available for measurement (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0010">10</link>). Although they are among the most sensitive of immunoassay techniques, RIAs presented laboratorians with a number of challenges, including, most notably, the biosafety risk of working with radioactive materials. As a result, RIAs have almost entirely been replaced with immunoassays using nonradioactive labels, including enzyme- and chemiluminescence-based detection methods.</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0006">The immunoassay has evolved over the past decade, as different solid-phase matrices for adherence of antigens or antibodies have been developed and as improved detection labels or methods have been identified. Laboratory automation, including liquid handlers and automated immunoassay platforms, has expanded into the immunoassay arena, leading to less hands-on technologist involvement. With the influx of large, complex automated systems, smaller solid-phase matrices, such as microdisks and -spheres, have become increasingly utilized, offering the capability of multiplex analysis for multiple antibody/antigen targets in a single test. Collectively, with the variety of methods available and the breadth of their utilization, immunoassays have significantly evolved, to the point that they are currently among the most widely used clinical assays.</para>

        <para id="ch0024s000000p0007">An understanding of serologic immunoassays and their clinical utility requires an appreciation of the basic immunologic principles of humoral immunity. Antibody production is a function of the humoral branch of the immune system and, more specifically, of B lymphocytes (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0011">11</link>–<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0016">16</link>). These cells utilize membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules or antibodies to recognize a wide array of immunogenic antigens, which in the case of microbial agents are often expressed on their surface. The ability of an antigen to stimulate a humoral immune response is based on a number of factors, with immunogenic antigens being characterized by a high (i) degree of “foreignness” to the host, (ii) level of circulating antigen, (iii) molecular weight, (iv) level of structural stability, and (v) degree of complexity. Therefore, while proteins and large polysaccharides are considered highly immunogenic, lipids and smaller carbohydrates are largely inert to the humoral immune response, unless they are conjugated to a more complex component (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0017">17</link>–<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0019">19</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0008">Based on different electrophoretic mobility patterns, five primary Ig classes have been identified (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM), although the infectious diseases serology field primarily focuses on detection of IgM- and IgG-class antibodies. IgM-class antibodies make up approximately 10% of the total circulating immunoglobulin pool, while IgG accounts for up to 75% (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0015">15</link>). While IgM has a single subclass with 10 possible binding sites and is largely confined to circulating in the blood due to its size, IgG has four unique subclasses (IgG1 to IgG4), each able to bind to two antigens, and readily diffuses extravascularly into tissues and other spaces. Although they are less frequently used, serologic assays measuring IgA and IgE responses to specific infectious diseases have also been developed for selected agents (e.g., IgA for <emphasis>Bordetella pertussis</emphasis> and IgE for diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0021">21</link>). IgA antibodies, of which there are two subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2), exist as dimers bound to a secretory component, are found in body secretions (e.g., saliva, tears, breast milk, etc.), and are a primary defense along the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0022">22</link>). IgE-class antibodies, which are least abundant, are unique, as they do not activate complement and do not opsonize or agglutinate antigens. Instead, secreted IgE binds mast cells and basophils and, once cross-linked by pathogen-specific antigens, stimulates secretion of vasoactive components (e.g., histamine). These trigger the recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils, which are particularly important in the humoral response to numerous parasitic infections (e.g., helminths and nematodes) (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0023">23</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0009">Following primary exposure to a novel antigen, immature B lymphocytes are stimulated and differentiate to either plasma cells, which secrete soluble antibody, or resting memory B cells. There are four phases of antibody response following initial exposure to an infectious agent: (i) an initial lag phase during which B cell clonal expansion and differentiation to plasma cells occur and antibody is not detected; (ii) log phase, when antibody levels increase in a logarithmic fashion; (iii) plateau phase, in which the amount of antibody stabilizes; and (iv) decline phase, during which the antibody is cleared or catabolized.</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0010">Importantly, the actual time course and antibody titers vary depending on the infectious agent, the immunogenic antigen, and the immune status of the individual. During primary infection, the initial antibody response is largely IgM in composition and is detectable roughly 5 to 7 days postinfection, followed by IgG antibody production approximately 7 to 10 days postexposure. For some infectious diseases, however, antibodies from the IgG and IgM classes may become detectable concurrently, without significant temporal differences (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0024">24</link>). As IgM antibody levels dissipate, IgG concentrations may continue to increase or plateau, such that by the end of the second or third month, only IgG-class antibodies are detectable. Upon subsequent infection with the same antigen, resting memory B cells are typically stimulated and rapidly transition to antibody-secreting plasma cells, referred to as an anamnestic response. While the same four phases of antibody production occur as in a primary response, the lag phase is typically shorter, with a prolonged plateau phase. Additionally, while some IgM is produced during repeat exposure, IgG is the predominant Ig formed, and antibody levels are significantly higher than in a primary infection. In the months following antigen exposure, IgG levels plateau, at which point the antibody may remain detectable for life, even in the absence of subsequent exposure to the antigen. For a detailed review of B cell expansion, antibody generation and affinity maturation, see dedicated publications on these topics (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0025">25</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0011">The section of the antigen bound by the antibody is referred to as the epitope, and the strength of the antibody-epitope interaction is termed affinity; the higher the affinity, the stronger the individual bond. Additionally, repeated exposure to an antigen leads to an increase in bond strength, a phenomenon called affinity maturation. The strength of the Ag-Ab bond is also dependent on the number of antigen binding sites per Ig (e.g., IgG has 2 sites and IgM has 10 sites), and therefore, the overall strength of the complex is much greater than the affinity of a single interaction. This is referred to as avidity. Just as with affinity maturation, avidity increases upon subsequent exposure to the antigen, and for certain infections, measurement of the avidity index may be helpful as an aid to better estimate the timing of initial infection (see “Avidity Testing” below) (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0026">26</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0012">Although there is exquisite specificity in the Ag-Ab reaction, a spectrum of antibodies with various affinities and avidities for multiple different antigens can be produced, including those against antigens that have similar antigenic determinants yet are from different organisms. It is these lower-specificity antibodies that are primarily responsible for the cross-reactions seen between assays aimed at detecting Ig against closely related microorganisms. Although current assays are designed to avoid these problems, laboratorians and clinicians should remain cognizant of the potential for antibody cross-reactivity.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0013">Serum and plasma are considered the primary specimen types for detection of antibodies to infectious agents. This concept of serologic testing has broadened over time, and the term may be used to refer to the detection of either antibody or antigen in a variety of different sample types, including CSF, urine, BAL fluid, and other body fluids. Serologic evaluation of alternative body fluids is advantageous in that a reactive result may provide additional information on disease severity and/or dissemination. However, a number of caveats must be acknowledged and considered when serologic results from alternative sources are interpreted. For example, antibody detection in CSF may be due to intrathecal antibody synthesis (i.e., antibody synthesis occurring in the central nervous system), or alternatively, antibodies may be present in the CSF due to transient introduction during a traumatic lumbar puncture or due to increased blood-brain barrier permeability as a result of injury or infection. Distinguishing between these possible scenarios can be done by determining the pathogen-specific antibody index (AI) using the Reiber formula or other such algorithms (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0028">28</link>). Briefly, an AI compares pathogen-specific antibody levels in CSF to those in serum following normalization to total Ig in both specimen types, with a final AI greater than 1.5 typically being indicative of intrathecal antibody synthesis. While not commonly used in clinical microbiology, calculation of the AI for anti-<emphasis>B</emphasis>. <emphasis>burgdorferi</emphasis> antibodies is a main component of evaluation for possible Lyme neuroborreliosis (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0029">29</link>–<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0032">32</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0014">Serologic assays can be used for either screening or diagnostic purposes. Screening tests are intended to detect infection in asymptomatic individuals (e.g., those testing for cytomegalovirus [CMV] antibodies pretransplant), whereas diagnostic tests are used to determine whether infection is present in a symptomatic patient who meets both clinical and exposure criteria for that infection (e.g., CSF cryptococcal antigen testing in a patient with HIV/AIDS presenting with meningitis) (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0033">33</link>). While the ideal screening test is both highly specific and sensitive, this is often difficult to achieve, and therefore, assays with high sensitivity are often preferred as screening tests. For screening tests to be effective, however, prevalence of the disease in the test population should be high or at least understood, as a highly sensitive assay with imperfect specificity performed in a low-prevalence setting will lead to a high rate of false-positive results and potentially lead to unnecessary follow-up testing or treatment. Due to this interplay of sensitivity, specificity, and disease prevalence, screening tests alone should not be used solely to diagnose illness. Rather, screening test-reactive or -positive samples are often evaluated by an alternative method, one with high specificity to confirm the result, or the results are correlated with clinical and epidemiological risk factors, alongside other diagnostic methods. Implementation of screening assays should also include prior consideration of assay cost versus the impact of early disease detection. Generally, screening tests should be utilized in populations with high disease prevalence, they should be inexpensive, and, perhaps most importantly, early detection of the disease should have a measurable, positive impact on patient outcome (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0034">34</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0015">A single IgM or IgG serum result should not be used in isolation to determine the stage (i.e., acute versus past) of infection. While it may be tempting to consider results with high IgG titers as indicative of recent infection, antibody levels are largely host specific, and some antigens are more effective and/or more specific than others at stimulating the immune response. Furthermore, the ability of the immune system to respond to antigens can also be affected by a variety of other host factors, such as age, genetic disposition, and comorbidities (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0012">12</link>). Ultimately, single-time-point antibody testing typically only indicates that the individual is a high responder to that antigen and has likely had prior exposure to the infectious agent. There are, however, several ways to differentiate between recent and remote infection using serologic methods.</para>

        <para id="ch0024s000000p0016">Perhaps the most frequently used method to establish acute infection is by measuring pathogen-specific IgM-class antibodies. IgM detection is optimal for pathogens with longer incubation periods and for agents that are associated with immune-mediated disease, as patients with these infections typically become symptomatic and present clinically when IgM-class antibodies are increasing (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0035">35</link>). Such infections include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated mononucleosis, CMV, acute hepatitis B, parvovirus B19 infection, and measles, among others. Cautious interpretation of positive IgM results is required for certain other pathogens, however, as IgM levels may persist beyond the acute stage (i.e., for months to years following infection). This phenomenon has been described for multiple organisms, including <emphasis>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</emphasis>, hepatitis A virus, <emphasis>Toxoplasma gondii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>B. burgdorferi</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0036">36</link>–<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0039">39</link>). Additionally, false-positive IgM results may have a variety of causes, including polyclonal B cell activation, cross-reactive antibodies between closely related pathogens, subclinical reactivation of latent viruses, autoimmune diseases, and others (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0035">35</link>). Conversely, a negative IgM titer does not immediately exclude a recent infection. For most pathogens, it may take 1 to 2 weeks for IgM-class antibodies to develop, and therefore, if a sample is drawn too early in the clinical course, false-negative results may occur. Therefore, a second convalescent-phase specimen, drawn 1 to 2 weeks after the first, may be helpful to establish the diagnosis, albeit retrospectively.</para>

        <para id="ch0024s000000p0017">A second technique used to establish recent or primary infection is determination of acute- and convalescent-phase titers. This requires drawing two serum samples, the first collected soon after exposure and the second collected at least 2 weeks later. Both samples would ideally be tested on the same run to minimize run-to-run variability during assessment of endpoint titers; however, this may not be practical or routinely possible for some laboratories. Evidence of an acute or recent infection is confirmed if there is seroconversion (conversion from negative to positive) or at least a 4-fold rise in semiquantitative or quantitative antibody titers between the first and second collection. Examples of situations where such testing has been used include diagnosis of<emphasis>C. burnetii, Bartonella henselae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Babesia microti</emphasis>. While molecular testing for <emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis> and <emphasis>B. henselae</emphasis> is both limited in availability and generally insensitive, documentation of increasing titers to <emphasis>B. microti</emphasis> is a key means to establish the diagnosis in patients who present beyond the first week of symptoms, when the sensitivity of molecular assays has diminished (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0040">40</link>). Drawbacks to this practice include the requirement for a return visit, the lack of quantitative or semi-quantitative serologic assays for many pathogens, and the delay between symptom onset and the development of an antibody response. Based on these caveats, for most scenarios, serologic testing should not be relied upon as the primary diagnostic method in the acute-phase setting for most infectious diseases. Traditional methods (such as Gram staining), molecular techniques (such as NAATs), and other direct detection assays remain the preferred diagnostic methods for early clinical management.</para>

        <para id="ch0024s000000p0018">Duration of infection can be approximated by measuring the avidity level of IgG-class antibodies for certain diseases (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0042">42</link>). Generally, IgG antibodies produced early in infection display low avidity, which subsequently increases over time. Use of an avidity assay, following assessment for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies, can, in certain situations, provide a clearer indication of infection state. Avidity tests are performed using standard EIAs; however, samples are tested in duplicate with and without the addition of high concentrations of urea, an IgG dissociation agent. In the presence of urea, low-avidity antibodies readily dissociate from the antigen and are removed during subsequent washing steps, whereas high-avidity antibodies remain bound. Avidity is subsequently established by comparing the level of IgG in urea-treated versus untreated samples. Determination of IgG avidity can be particularly useful during evaluation of pregnant women with suspected <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> or CMV infection, which are both associated with pre- and perinatal infections (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0041">41</link>). As an example, in a pregnant woman positive for both IgM- and IgG-class antibodies to <emphasis>T. gondii,</emphasis> the significance of the IgM result is important to determine—is this indicative of recent infection, or is this residual IgM from a remote infection? IgG avidity testing to aid in establishing the infection time frame may be helpful in this scenario. If IgG avidity is high, infection can be presumed to have occurred at least 3 months earlier. Alternatively, if IgG avidity is low, acute <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis> infection may be suspected, requiring additional evaluation.</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0019">Despite the potential utility of avidity testing, certain caveats remain. Importantly, low-avidity IgG antibodies do not guarantee recent infection, as such antibodies may persist for months to years depending on the infectious agent and host immunity. Additionally, few avidity assays are currently FDA cleared, and variability in testing may occur due to differences in the applied dissociation agent and the type of reagents used.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0024s000000a0019"/>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0021">There is a broad diversity of serologic methods currently used in clinical laboratories, ranging from classical agglutination and precipitation reactions to enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), electrochemiluminescence (ECLIAs), and multiplex flow immunoassays (MFIs). There are a number of ways to categorize immunoassays, the simplest of which is based on the presence or absence of a precipitate. The most commonly used label-free assays are precipitation reactions, also referred to as Ouchterlony or immunodiffusion tests, which are described in greater detail below. The majority of serologic assays, however, rely on the presence of a signal-generating or detection label, which can be either solid particle, radioactive, enzymatic, chemiluminescent, or fluorescent (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0032">32</link>). Immunoassays are classically categorized as either homogeneous or heterogeneous assays. Homogeneous assays occur free in solution and are characterized by alteration of the signal-generating label following binding of the target analyte to the labeled reagent—this eliminates the need for separation of bound and unbound reactants. These assays are notable for their speed, ease of use, and automation potential—they are frequently used for detection of drugs or hormone levels in clinical chemistry laboratories.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0022">In contrast, for heterogeneous assays, the signal-generating label is not altered following interaction of the target analyte with the labeled reagent, and therefore, after completion of the reaction, this immunoassay format requires physical removal (i.e., a wash step) of the unbound, labeled components in order to detect the presence or absence of the target analyte. As a result, heterogeneous assays typically involve some type of solid-phase matrix (e.g., microtiter plate, polystyrene or magnetic beads, etc.) to which the immunoreactants adhere. While this classification scheme is useful and can be applied to commonly used immunoassays, the reader should be aware that not all immunoassays strictly fit into either category.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0023">Depending on their design, immunoassays can provide a strictly qualitative, semiquantitative, or quantitative result. While a detailed discussion of how immunoassays are developed is beyond the scope of this chapter, these result categories are defined here. Qualitative immunoassays simply indicate whether the analyte of interest is present in the sample, with results reported as positive, negative, or equivocal/indeterminate. These results are determined by comparing the signal intensity of the patient sample to the signal intensity of a calibrator or control sample. Although a numerical index value or ratio is generated by such assays, these values are not an accurate assessment of the true amount of analyte present. Given this limitation, it is recommended that index values, signal-to-cutoff ratios, or other numerical outputs from qualitative serologic assays not be provided on patient reports. Although such information may be helpful to laboratorians for case-by-case troubleshooting purposes, inclusion of such information on patient reports may lead to misinterpretation (e.g., the belief that the values indicate immunity to reinfection) and misuse (e.g., monitoring values over time) by clinicians and patients alike. The recommendation to avoid reporting numerical outputs from qualitative serologic assays was most recently reinforced in guidance for SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0045">45</link>). In addition to a qualitative result, semiquantitative assays provide a numerical value indicative of the relative amount of analyte in the sample. These values are similar in nature to titer results reported by immunofluorescence assays. The numerical value of semiquantitative immunoassays is typically established by including a known level of the analyte of interest in the run, against which the signal intensity of the patient specimen is compared, and a relative level of the analyte is then determined. Finally, quantitative immunoassays provide numerical values indicative of the amount of analyte present in the sample. This is typically determined by comparing the signal of the sample to a standard curve of serially diluted, known quantities of reference material. Depending on how the standard curve is established, results can be reported with different units (international units per milliliter, nanograms per milliliter, picograms per milliliter, etc.) alongside a qualitative interpretation.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0025">The interaction of soluble, unlabeled antigen and antibodies is best described by a precipitin curve (<anchor id="ch0024s000000a0024"/><link linkend="ch0024s000000a0026">Fig. 1</link>). When antigen and antibody levels are at equimolar concentrations (i.e., the zone of equivalence), they bind and form an insoluble Ag-Ab lattice, which can be visualized as a precipitate using a number of different techniques (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0046">46</link>). The formation of stable Ag-Ab lattices is less efficient on either side of the zone of equivalence when either antibody (i.e., prozone) or antigen (i.e., postzone) is in excess. Passive immunodiffusion (ID) is the simplest of the precipitation assays and involves placing immune reactants (i.e., antibody and antigen) together in an inert semisolid medium (i.e., agarose gel) and visually inspecting for the formation of a precipitin band. The antigen and antibody will passively diffuse at a rate dependent on their size, room temperature, humidity, and gel viscosity. As a result, overnight incubation is often required for such assays, although turnaround time can be reduced by the application of an electric current (i.e., immunoelectrophoresis). Although not typically available through local hospital systems, these continue to be maintained in reference and specialty laboratories, as they remain the reference standard method for detection of antibodies to a number of pathogens, including <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Blastomyces dermatitidis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis>, among others.</para>

The Oudin ID assay is a single-dimension test, in which antibodies are added to liquid agarose, which is then allowed to solidify in a test tube. Antigen is subsequently added to the top of the gel and allowed to diffuse until a precipitin band is formed. Radial ID is a modification of the Oudin assay and designed to provide a quantifiable result. Instead of a test tube, the antibody-agarose mixture is allowed to solidify in a petri dish, and antigen is added to a center well and allowed to diffuse out radially. The diameter of the resulting precipitin band is compared to the diameter of a known antigen concentration, allowing a final quantification of the sample to be determined. Among laboratories that maintain ID protocols, double ID or Ouchterlony analysis is most common. In this method, specimens, typically serum or CSF and pathogen-specific antigen, are placed in separate wells in an agarose gel and allowed to diffuse, and if specific antibodies are present in the sample, a precipitation line will become visible at the zone of equivalence (<anchor id="ch0024s000000a0027"/><link linkend="ch0024s000000a0030">Fig. 2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0027">Overall, ID reactions have excellent specificity (some approach 100%), are inexpensive and relatively simple to perform, and can be adapted to a variety of different infectious agents. Currently, however, these methods are primarily maintained at larger hospitals and public health and reference laboratories due to the expertise required to accurately interpret the results. ID assays are associated with a number of limitations, including generally lower sensitivity, since microgram quantities of antibody are required for a positive reaction. To overcome this challenge, it is recommended that ID assays be performed alongside more sensitive methods, including complement fixation tests (see below). ID methods require large amounts of purified antigen, which, depending on the pathogen, may be difficult to acquire from commercial vendors and have variable quality. Finally, interpretation of the results can be subjective, as a true band of identity and nonspecific or nonidentity bands need to be differentiated, and turnaround time can be prolonged, ranging from 24 to 72 h.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0028">Agglutination reactions utilize a particulate, insoluble antigen, in contrast to precipitation reactions, which are based on the interaction of soluble antigen and antibodies. Binding of the particulate antigen and the corresponding antibody results in visible clumping (i.e., agglutination) (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0048">48</link>). IgM-class antibodies are several hundred times more efficient at agglutination than IgG-class antibodies due to their large pentameric structure. Therefore, if the immune response primarily involves IgG-class antibodies, the reaction may require some type of chemical enhancement or an antiglobulin reagent to bind to the Fc portion of IgG antibodies and enhance their agglutination (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0049">49</link>). Many varieties of agglutination assays exist, which can be classified based on the type of particle to which the antigen or antibody is bound. Direct agglutination reactions involve antigens found on naturally occurring particulates, such as whole bacterial organisms or red blood cells (RBCs), also referred to as hemagglutination assays. Among the hemagglutination tests, the monospot assay for detection of heterophile antibody produced following EBV infection is one of the most frequently used assays. Although agglutination assays are used less and less frequently, historically this method was applied for laboratory detection of a variety of infectious diseases, including use of the Weil-Felix test for detection of antibodies to rickettsial organisms. This assay was based on use of different <emphasis>Proteus</emphasis> species and strains, which share specific epitopes with the various <emphasis>Rickettsia</emphasis> species and lead to antibody cross-reactivity. Serotyping of bacterial isolates has also traditionally been performed by direct agglutination methods.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0029">Indirect or passive agglutination assays utilize antigen coupled to particles or beads composed of an inert material (e.g., latex, colloidal gold, gelatin, or silicates). Examples of indirect agglutination assays include the latex agglutination assay for cryptococcal antigen and rapid plasma reagin and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory tests for syphilis, among others. Indirect agglutination assays are often preferred over direct agglutination reactions due to the enhanced visibility of positive reactions. Finally, soluble antigen can be detected in patient samples by incubation with antibody-coated particles, referred to as reverse passive agglutination.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0030">Some serologic agglutination assays use a unique type of hemagglutination, termed hemagglutination inhibition (HI), to detect and quantify antibodies to certain viruses, including influenza virus. These viruses express surface proteins, termed hemagglutinins, which can agglutinate RBCs by binding to surface sialic acid receptors. Taking advantage of this reaction, HI assays can be used to detect anti-influenza virus antibodies by incubating RBCs with virus and serially diluted serum. The presence of antiviral antibodies in serum will inhibit RBC-virus agglutination, indicative of a positive reaction. The viral antibody titer can be reported as the last serum dilution still able to inhibit agglutination.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0031">Classic agglutination assays are straightforward, are able to be performed on a card, in a test tube, or in microtiter plates, are cost-effective, and as a result continue to be utilized in a variety of clinical and public health laboratory settings. Agglutination assays can also provide antibody or antigen concentration via serial sample dilution. The major limitations of direct agglutination assays are their limited sensitivity and the possibility of the prozone phenomenon, which can be overcome through serial dilution of the sample (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0050">50</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0032">Agglutination assays can also display limited specificity, particularly in the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0050">50</link>–<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0052">52</link>). RF is typically an IgM-class autoantibody, which binds to the Fc portion of human IgG and can nonspecifically cross-link those antibodies, leading to false-positive reactions, as has been reported in assays using IgG-coated latex beads (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0053">53</link>). Several measures can be taken to overcome or identify potentially false-positive results, including comparing the sample result to results from a reaction using control particles coated with normal IgG. If the control reaction is also positive, suggesting a false-positive result, the sample can be treated with a reducing agent, such as 2-mercaptoethanol or pronase, to inhibit RF. Alternatively, the sample can be pretreated with aggregated IgG to remove the RF prior to testing the sample. This, however, can result in loss of antigen or specific antibodies and lead to false-negative results.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0033">The complement fixation (CF) assay is based on the interaction of immune complexes with components of the classical complement pathway (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0046">46</link>). This technique involves a multistep process to detect antibodies and determine an endpoint titer. Briefly, patient serum is heated (56°C for 30 min) to inactivate native complement and is subsequently incubated with pathogen-specific antigen. During the incubation, Ag-Ab complexes form if specific antibody is present in the sample. Purified complement is then added, components of which are bound (or “fixed”) by Ag-Ab complexes in the solution, and thus, complement is inactivated. Hemolysin-sensitized RBCs are added next and act as the final indicator system. If complement was fixed by Ag-Ab complexes, the RBCs are protected from lysis and will pellet to the bottom of the reaction well following centrifugation. If, however, Ag-Ab complexes have not been formed, complement will remain active, leading to significant hemolysis and absence of an RBC pellet following centrifugation. Importantly, CF results are graded based on the level of hemolysis observed, not on the presence or amount of pelleted RBCs, making interpretation prone to a level of subjectivity. For example, the presence of 0 to 30% lysis is typically considered indicative of the presence of antibodies to the agent of interest, whereas lysis of 35% or greater indicates the absence of antibodies (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0055">55</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0035">Another classic serologic technique is the neutralization assay. These tests are used to specifically detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies, which are antibodies able to inhibit viral infectivity independent of other immune cells or complexes (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0046">46</link>). One type of neutralization assay is the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). PRNTs are technically challenging to perform and involve incubation of serially diluted patient samples with live virus, during which time if neutralizing antibodies are present, they will bind and inactivate the virus. This mixture is then inoculated into wells coated with a virus-susceptible cell monolayer, and following multiple days of incubation (depending on the virus), monolayers are assessed for the presence or absence of cytopathic effect (CPE), or plaques. The presence of plaques indicates that live virus was present and that neutralizing antibodies were absent in the patient sample; conversely, the absence of plaques or CPE suggests the presence of neutralizing antibody. PRNT can also provide endpoint antibody titers, which are established as the reciprocal of the last patient sample dilution that shows either 50% (PRNT50) or 90% (PRNT90) reduction in plaques compared to the control (the choice of percent plaque inhibition varies depending on virus/assay/institution).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0036">Neutralization assays are often used by reference and public health laboratories to confirm presumptive positive serologic results acquired by high-throughput, less specific immunoassays. For example, PRNTs were routinely used for confirmatory testing of samples reactive by anti-Zika virus IgM serologic assays, since they offer enhanced specificity over immunoassays alone (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0056">56</link>). Neutralization tests are also commonly used to assess viral vaccine efficacy, as was most recently done for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, in order to demonstrate that the vaccine candidate appropriately induces host antibody production (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0057">57</link>–<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0059">59</link>). While relatively simple to perform, these assays have a prolonged turnaround time and require cultivation of live virus (which may require enhanced biosafety containment facilities), and, depending on the readout method, interpretation can be subjective. Furthermore, they can be difficult to standardize, both within and between laboratories.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0037">Given the challenges associated with PRNTs, alternative methods for neutralizing-antibody detection have been developed, including pseudovirus neutralization assays and blockade-of-binding (BoB) immunoassays, among others. Briefly, pseudovirus neutralization assays are based on a chimeric, nonpathogenic virus, which expresses only the relevant surface binding protein from the pathogen of interest. These chimeric viruses are typically recombinant rhabdoviruses or are based on a retroviral or lentiviral vector, and therefore, these assays can be done in biosafety level 2 facilities, even if the organism being tested for is a biosafety level 3 agent. Result interpretation for pseudovirus-based neutralization assays also differs from that of PRNTs and, rather than quantification of plaques, is dependent on a reporter system or other form of signal generation (i.e., luciferase enzymes, green fluorescence protein, etc.). Such reporter systems allow faster readout and more objective result interpretation. Despite these advances, pseudovirus neutralization assays remain complex and are infrequently maintained in clinical laboratories (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0061">61</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0038">More recently, high-throughput BoB immunoassays for neutralizing-antibody detection have been developed for a number of pathogens, including most recently for Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0062">62</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0063">63</link>). Although formats vary, at their core, BoB assays are based on <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> detection of binding between the pathogen-specific binding protein and the host cell receptor. In the presence of neutralizing antibodies, this interaction is inhibited, leading to loss of signal, whereas in the absence of such antibodies, the interaction proceeds and signal is generated. These assays are often easier to perform, are designed in an EIA format using 96-well plates, and can be automated on a variety of different immunoassay processing platforms.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0040">Direct IFAs use fluorescently tagged monoclonal antibodies to directly detect the analyte of interest. For example, detection of influenza virus in a nasal wash specimen begins by fixing the sample to a slide, incubation with a fluorescently tagged anti-influenza virus antibody, and evaluation using a fluorescent microscope, viewed following excitation at the appropriate wavelength for the fluorescent tag. If influenza virus is present in the sample, the tagged antibody will bind and emit fluorescence that is then observed by the technologist. In contrast, indirect IFAs involve a two-step process. Unlabeled whole-cell organisms or cells infected with the agent of interest are fixed to the microscope slide and incubated with the patient sample. Ag-Ab complexes will form if the target analyte is present in the sample, and any unbound sample will be washed away. Fluorescently labeled secondary antibody specific to human IgM or IgG antibodies is added, and the slide observed for the presence or absence of fluorescence.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0041">In general, IFAs are inexpensive tests that are relatively easy to perform. They are also considered semiquantitative assays, allowing an endpoint titer to be determined using serial dilutions of the patient sample. For certain infections, including Q fever (<emphasis>C. burnetii</emphasis>), these titers can be used to determine severity or stage of disease and monitor disease progression. However, IFAs can be tedious to perform in high volume and require the purchase of expensive fluorescence microscopy equipment. In recent years, commercially available automated analyzers have been developed and FDA cleared for IFA slide processing (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0064">64</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0065">65</link>). Additionally, performance of IFAs requires well-trained, experienced laboratory personnel, able to differentiate between background reactivity or nonspecific fluorescence and expected fluorescence patterns, which vary depending on the IFA and infectious agent. IFA interpretation is also notoriously subjective, and the assays can demonstrate both inter- and intralaboratory result variation. As with agglutination reactions, acceptable variability between IFA endpoint titers is generally considered to be within one 2-fold dilution; therefore, seroconversion or at least a 4-fold difference in endpoint titers is required for the change to be considered significant.</para>

The filter paper is subsequently incubated with patient serum, and the presence or absence of antibodies specific to the separated proteins is determined using labeled secondary anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies. Notably, most clinical laboratories forgo the initial protein separation step and purchase preblotted nitrocellulose membranes for testing. In addition, numerous platforms have been developed, enabling the entire blotting procedure to be fully automated (e.g., washing, incubating, and developing), minimizing the amount of hands-on technologist time required.</para>

Immunoblots offer increased specificity and clarity for interpretation, as the potential cross-reactions and background noise due to nonspecific binding to other components of the lysate material are eliminated. Regardless of the method, the presence or absence of bands and banding patterns can be read visually, though this can lead to subjective interpretation due to over- or undercalling of bands. Recent advances in optical scanning instrumentation have been made, which allow a more objective interpretation of blot results.</para>

As a negative control, a similar reaction is set up using labeled analyte and buffer alone. Following a washing step, the enzyme substrate is added and the resulting color reaction is assessed. If the patient sample contains the target analyte, it will compete with the enzyme-labeled analyte for binding to the solid-phase antibody and reduce or prevent the signal generation. This reaction is then compared to the signal intensity from the negative control (buffer plus enzyme-labeled antigen) as a check for specificity.

A variety of solid-phase supports can be used, including microtiter plates, nitrocellulose strips, or polystyrene beads. Reaction wells coated with purified antigen or antibody bind to the target analyte in samples, which are subsequently detected using an enzyme-labeled secondary antibody (<anchor id="ch0024s000000a0049"/><link linkend="ch0024s000000a0054">Fig. 6</link>). To identify the specific antibody isotype (e.g., IgM or IgG), isotype-specific, enzyme-labeled anti-Ig antibodies are used as the secondary antibody. This is perhaps the most commonly used approach for the measurement of prior infection with or immune status against infectious agents. There are numerous variations of this type of assay, as the analyte adhering to the solid phase can be an immunoglobulin, a protein, or any antigen with at least two epitopes.

Chemiluminescence is defined as the emission of light when a substrate decays from an excited state to a ground state. In contrast to fluorescence, chemiluminescence derives energy from the chemical reaction itself—most often an oxidation reaction. CIAs display the highest analytical sensitivity among immunoassays, with a lower limit of detection in the 0.3- to 1.0-ng/ml range (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0032">32</link>). The chemiluminescent labels can be tagged directly to the antigen or antibody or can be used as the substrate for an enzyme-labeled immunoreactant. Acridinium ester is the most commonly used CIA label due to its high sensitivity. Oxidation of these compounds, typically through the addition of sodium hydroxide or hydrogen peroxide, results in a burst of light that is detectable by a luminometer or by capture on photographic film. Advantages of CIA include label stability, sensitivity, and low cost.

This variability can be expressed as the well coefficient of variation, calculated between wells in the same plate, which manufacturers strive to maintain between 3 and 5%. A second consideration is the edge effect, which refers to the variability between readings in the outer wells and the inner wells for the same sample in a microtiter plate. While plate manufacturing variability may be a possible cause, this occurs primarily due to temperature differences between outer and interior wells, affecting both Ag-Ab and enzyme-substrate reactions.

        <para id="ch0024s000000p0058">Although the explanation for this phenomenon is not completely established, some investigators believe that the hook effect is due to excess antigen which binds the majority, if not all, of the antigen binding sites on both bound and unbound enzyme-labeled detector antibodies. The free-floating antigen-labeled antibody complexes are removed by washing, preventing completion of the sandwich and signal detection. Alternatively, others believe that the hook effect may arise from a combination of low-affinity antibodies unable to form the sandwich complex, inadequate washing, and/or suboptimal levels of labeled antibody.</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0059">Numerous suggestions have been made regarding ways that laboratories can overcome the hook effect. One obvious strategy would be to run all patient samples using multiple dilutions to screen for this phenomenon. If the sample is nonreactive or minimally reactive at the lower dilution but reactive or “out of range” at the higher dilution, this would alert the technologist to the possibility of the hook effect. Although effective, few laboratories have adopted this approach due to the infrequent occurrence of this phenomenon and the time, cost, and labor involved in running multiple dilutions for every sample. Alternative strategies to reduce the risk of the hook effect include ensuring that adequate washing, performed manually or automated, occurs between each immunoassay step, especially following the addition and incubation with each reagent. Additionally, close communication with the kit manufacturers, some of whom have identified a level at which the hook effect may occur, may lessen the frequency of this problem. Also, during new-kit evaluations, it is crucial that the laboratory test specimens with excess antibody levels, as the frequency of the hook effect may vary between different kits. Lastly, open dialogue with the clinician is invaluable, and laboratories are encouraged to discuss the limitations of immunoassays with direct end users, particularly in light of potential false-negative scenarios.</para>

        <para id="ch0024s000000p0060">Detection and quantitation of IgM-class antibodies can pose unique technical challenges (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0041">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0068">68</link>). The most common issue regarding detection of IgM-class antibodies is the development of false-positive results, most often due to the presence of RF in the patient sample. However, false-negative results can also occur due to competitive inhibition of IgM binding in the presence of high levels of specific IgG. Initially, EIAs designed to detect IgM were developed using a standard, indirect solid-phase EIA with an immobilized antigen and an IgM-specific secondary antibody. However, these assays were fraught with both low sensitivity and low specificity.</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0061">To eliminate these problems, IgM antibody capture ELISAs (MAC-ELISAs) were developed (<anchor id="ch0024s000000a0065"/><link linkend="ch0024s000000a0069">Fig. 7</link>). In this procedure, a polyclonal anti-human IgM antibody is bound to the solid phase. Upon incubation with the patient sample, circulating IgM is captured on the plate and antigen from the infectious agent of interest is added, which will bind any specific IgM present on the plate. An enzyme-labeled secondary antibody is subsequently added and will bind any immobilized antigen. Importantly, this method eliminates the problems associated with competitive inhibition due to elevated IgG levels, as IgG and RF in the patient sample are removed from the well following the first washing step.</para>

Such interferences can be caused by antibodies binding to the actual analyte (e.g., antipathogen antibodies), binding to components of the detection system (e.g., anti-alkaline phosphatase), or binding to reagent antibodies (e.g., anti-immunoglobulin antibodies). The last category is the most common and involves three types of antibodies, including heterophile antibodies, which are characterized by their weak affinity for immunoglobulins from multiple species, without a known or obviously identifiable immunogen. RF is another cause of interference, often found in patients with connective tissue disorders, and, as discussed above, can have a deleterious effect on a variety of immunoassays, often leading to false-positive reactions (see “Agglutination Reactions” above). Finally, there are various types of anti-animal immunoglobulin antibodies, the most common of which are the human anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies (HAMAs), which can react with kit-associated, mouse-derived immunoglobulins (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0088">88</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0024s000000p0064">Excess levels of biotin, also referred to as vitamin B7 or vitamin H, have recently been shown to impact the accuracy of certain clinical immunoassays. Biotin is present in trace amounts in a number of everyday foods (e.g., egg yolk, whole cereals, and leafy vegetables), and an adequate daily level is approximately 30 µg (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0090">90</link>). However, an increasing proportion of the population (15–20%) routinely takes over-the-counter biotin supplements, as high as 300-mg megadoses, for reported benefits in hair and nail appearance. Additionally, recent studies suggest that high levels of biotin may offer supportive treatment for multiple sclerosis and other diseases (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0091">91</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0065">Biotin is a small molecule that can be coupled to various proteins, antigens, and antibodies without altering their activity, and as such, it is commonly used as a reporter molecule for many immunoassays. Biotin has high affinity for avidin or streptavidin proteins, each of which can bind four biotin molecules. The biotin-avidin interaction is the strongest known noncovalent interaction between a protein and a ligand, further explaining the common utilization of these components in immunoassays. Depending on the assay design, however, excess biotin in the patient specimen may interfere in immunoassays using avidin/streptavidin-biotin chemistry (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0092">92</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0093">93</link>). Two examples are presented below.</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0066">For certain sandwich immunoassays assays, the analyte of interest is first bound by two antibodies, one labeled with a chromogen and one biotinylated, and this complex is subsequently bound by streptavidin-coated beads via the biotinylated antibody. Presence of the analyte is determined following enzymatic activation of the chromogen. If excess biotin is present in the patient sample, it will bind the streptavidin-coated beads, inhibiting binding of the analyte-antibody complex and resulting in a false-negative result. The second example is select competitive immunoassays, in which the analyte of interest competes with labeled analyte for binding to biotin-labeled antibodies. If the analyte is present in the sample, it will outcompete the labeled analyte for binding to biotinylated antibodies, and the complex will bind to a streptavidin-coated solid-phase surface, with the detected signal intensity being inversely proportional to the analyte concentration. In patients with elevated biotin levels, however, the biotin will bind to the streptavidin, inhibiting binding of analyte-antibody complexes and leading to a decrease in signal intensity and a false-positive result (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0090">90</link>). Laboratories performing immunoassays using biotin-avidin/streptavidin chemistries should carefully scrutinize the method in order to determine whether excess biotin could impact assay performance characteristics. Importantly, use of biotin-avidin/streptavidin in the assay does not necessarily mean that excess biotin will affect results. If these two reagents are prebound to each other prior to addition of the patient sample, the impact of elevated biotin is eliminated.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0067">With the continuous expansion of commercially available immunoassays, the development of and market for automated analyzers has followed suit. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to provide a detailed review of the available instrumentation; however, the reader is referred to the College of American Pathologists website (<ulink url="http://www.cap.org">http://www.cap.org</ulink>), which provides a comprehensive annual review of each individual, commercially available immunoassay analyzer (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0094">94</link>). These instruments are designed as either semiautomated or fully automated platforms, able to process samples in batch or by random access. A number of these platforms are also open systems, able to be programmed directly by laboratory personnel. Automated systems have been adapted to capture the analyte of interest using a variety of solid-phase matrices, including microtiter plates, dyed polyacrylamide or polystyrene beads, and magnetic beads, or in solid-phase receptacles. Analyte detection can likewise vary depending on the EIA kit, which has necessitated the design of automated systems with the ability to detect colorimetric, chemiluminescent, and fluorescent end products. Currently, these instruments can run a broad range of serological assays, including but not limited to those for HIV, hepatitis (A, B, and C), <emphasis>T. gondii</emphasis>, CMV, measles virus, mumps virus, rubella virus, syphilis virus, and others, provided that an immunoassay kit is available. An increasing number of automated analyzers are also designed to directly interface with the laboratory information system, allowing easier result reporting while minimizing the potential error associated with manual result entry.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0068">These automated platforms allow laboratories to increase sample throughput, reduce hands-on technologist time, decrease ergonomic risk, eliminate transcription errors, and provide improved standardization and objective result interpretation, along with allowing increased efficiency and decreased time to result reporting. Furthermore, in the current era of cost reduction, automated instruments are more commonly being designed to process and test samples across clinical laboratory disciplines.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0069">Despite these advantages, automated instrumentation can present clinical laboratories with a number of challenges, including high upfront purchase cost, which may be difficult to overcome in smaller laboratory settings. Additionally, some of these platforms have large footprints, instrument or sampling errors can occur, and in the event of instrument malfunction, backup processes and assays may be required. Finally, as automated platforms continue to have more expansive test menus, the potential for both improper test utilization and incorrect interpretation of results will likely increase. This results in an even greater need for clinical laboratories to work closely with health care providers to guide proper test utilization and provide accurate result interpretation for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.</para>

      <para id="ch0024s000000p0070">Immunodiagnostic testing has been revolutionized with the development of rapid immunoassays for numerous analytes that were previously only performed at large reference laboratories. Many of these assays are CLIA waived and can be performed as point-of-care tests in as little as 15 to 30 min (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0046">46</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0095">95</link>–<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0102">102</link>). These assays have been designed in a variety of formats and are able to detect antigen, antibody, or even products from nucleic acid amplification tests.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0071">Among the most popular formats is the immunochromatographic method, more commonly referred to as the lateral-flow immunoassay (LFA). This one-step assay uses a chromatographic pad with three zones: a sample application area, a conjugate pad, and the reaction area (<anchor id="ch0024s000000a0074"/><link linkend="ch0024s000000a0076">Fig. 8</link>). The sample (e.g., serum, CSF, or urine) is applied to the sample pad and flows laterally by means of capillary action. On the conjugate pad is lyophilized antibody or antigen (depending on the target analyte) tagged with a specific label, which generates a visible signal on the reaction region. Commonly used conjugates include colloidal gold particles and latex beads. If present, the target analyte in the sample will bind to the conjugated detector antigen or antibody, and the resulting immune complex will migrate to the reaction pad by capillary action. The reaction area is impregnated with a secondary antibody or antigen specific to the target analyte at one location and a separate control antibody specific to the conjugated analyte at a separate location. Capture of the immunocomplex leads to concentration of the detector particles and the development of a colored band at both locations, indicative of a positive reaction. The presence of a control band only indicates a negative reaction, whereas the absence of a control band invalidates the test. While most of these assays are visually inspected by a technologist, devices able to scan and objectively determine the presence or absence of bands have been developed to provide more objective result interpretation (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0103">103</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0104">104</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0072">As variations on this format, assays have been designed that do not require separate venipuncture or specimen collection procedures. Often a finger-stick device is combined with the one-step lateral-flow assay. Rapid assay formats have been especially useful for HIV testing and have been used extensively in testing for HIV in developing countries. More recently, LFAs have been developed for detection of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic antigens from various specimen types:<emphasis>Legionella pneumophila</emphasis> serogroup 1 (urine), <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis> (urine or CSF), <emphasis>Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis> antigen (serum or CSF), <emphasis>Aspergillus fumigatus</emphasis> (serum and BAL fluid), and <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> spp. (serum), among others.</para>
      <para id="ch0024s000000p0073">Overall, rapid immunoassays are straightforward to perform and do not require specialized instrumentation. The LFA format is also ideal for point-of-care testing, and in keeping with the long-standing home pregnancy test and the more recent LFA for detection of HIV-1/2 antibodies from oral fluid, this assay may be utilized in the future for personal testing for selected infectious diseases at home (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0105">105</link>, <link linkend="ch0024s000000li0106">106</link>). While LFAs are considered to have lower sensitivity than conventional immunoassays, some rapid assays display sensitivities approaching that of traditional methods (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0096">96</link>). Limitations of rapid assays include the inability for high-throughput automation and subjective interpretation. Efforts to improve upon the subjectivity of test interpretation, however, particularly in samples with barely visible bands, include the development of rapid immunoassays with fluorescent signals which can be read by illumination systems using LED technology (<link linkend="ch0024s000000li0107">107</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0024s000000p0074">Despite the great strides in molecular diagnostics over the past decade, there remains an essential role for immunodiagnostics, particularly for infectious agents which are unable to be cultured in the clinical laboratory or for which NAATs remain insensitive. As described in this chapter, the methods and techniques used in the field of infectious disease serology are quite varied, ranging from classic immunodiffusion and complement fixation tests to multiplex bead-based immunoassays and possibly, in the future, immuno-PCR assays. An understanding of the individual advantages and limitations of these methods is important, as there is no “perfect” immunoassay. Additionally, with each advancement in immunodiagnostics, the field has seen an increase in the number of automated platforms for immunoassays, which have ultimately led to significant improvements in assay standardization and overall quality.</para>
        <para id="ch0024s000000p0075">Serologic assessment for infectious diseases, however, is not without its interpretive challenges. The presence or absence of antibodies or antigen must be assessed alongside patient presentation, including exposure history, prior vaccination history, age, presenting symptoms, and immune status. A clear understanding of the host humoral immune response to individual infectious agents, including timing of seroconversion, which may differ between agents, is likewise important, as is an appreciation for possible causes of antibody cross-reactivity between closely related organisms. Due to the ease of collection of the specimen, which in most cases is serum, overtesting using serologic assays is of concern, particularly in cases where the pretest probability for the infectious agent is low. It is therefore incumbent on laboratorians to develop and help convey proper test utilization strategies (e.g., diagnostic testing algorithms) and interpretive guidance for the assessment of serologic test results.</para>
