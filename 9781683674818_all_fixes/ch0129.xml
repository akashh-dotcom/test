        <para id="ch0129s000000p0002">Parvoviruses are small (~22−25-nm-diameter), nonenveloped icosahedral viruses with a linear single-stranded-DNA (ssDNA) genome (~5 kb) in the family<emphasis>Parvoviridae</emphasis> in the realm <emphasis>Monodnaviria.</emphasis> Their name derives from <emphasis>parvum</emphasis>, the Latin for “small,” and they are among the smallest known viruses that infect mammalian cells. The family <emphasis>Parvoviridae</emphasis> is divided into three subfamilies, <emphasis>Parvovirinae, Densovirinae</emphasis>, and the new <emphasis>Hamaparvovirinae</emphasis>, on the basis of their ability to infect vertebrates, invertebrates, or both, respectively, and their NS1 amino acid sequences (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0001">1</link>). The parvoviruses of vertebrates (<emphasis>Parvovirinae</emphasis>) are currently subdivided into 10 genera based on their sequence similarity: <emphasis>Amdoparvovirus, Artiparvovirus, Aveparvovirus, Bocaparvovirus, Copiparvovirus, Dependoparvovirus, Erythroparvovirus, Loriparvovirus, Protoparvovirus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Tetraparvovirus.</emphasis> The current taxonomy can be viewed at the annually updated site <ulink url="https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/">https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/</ulink>. To be classified as a parvovirus by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), a new viral sequence must be contiguous and contain the complete coding region of the capsid protein (VP) and the large nonstructural protein (NS1), including an SF3 helicase domain. The genome should further be linear and conform to the size constraints (~4 to 6 kb) and motifs typical of <emphasis>Parvoviridae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0002">2</link>). Members of the same species should share more than 85% amino acid sequence identity in their NS1 protein sequences, while the identity should be at least 35% in members of the same genus, with a coverage of &gt;80% between any two members.</para>
        <para id="ch0129s000000p0003">The first human parvoviruses identified were the nonpathogenic adeno-associated viruses (AAV) of the genus<emphasis>Dependoparvovirus</emphasis>, which are increasingly used in gene therapy (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0004">4</link>). As the names imply, these viruses mostly need a helper virus for their replication. Nevertheless, highly pathogenic autonomously replicating animal dependoparvoviruses also exist. The classical human parvovirus B19 (B19V) was the only known human-pathogenic parvovirus for 3 decades, and it belongs to the <emphasis>Primate erythroparvovirus</emphasis> 1 species of the genus <emphasis>Erythroparvovirus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0006">6</link>). However, modern DNA-sequencing techniques have paved the way for more human parvovirus discoveries by active virus hunting (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0007">7</link>). Such metagenomics has brought us the human bocaviruses (HBoV1 to -4) of the species <emphasis>Primate bocaparvovirus</emphasis> 1 and 2 in the genus <emphasis>Bocaparvovirus (</emphasis>8–11<emphasis>)</emphasis>, parvovirus 4 (PARV4) of the species <emphasis>Primate tetraparvovirus</emphasis> 1 in the genus <emphasis>Tetraparvovirus (</emphasis>12<emphasis>)</emphasis>, and the stool-derived bufavirus (BuV), cutavirus (CuV), and tusavirus (TuV) of the respective species <emphasis>Primate protoparvovirus</emphasis> 1, 3, and 4 of the genus <emphasis>Protoparvovirus (</emphasis>13–15<emphasis>).</emphasis> TuV is, however, very rare, so it is yet uncertain whether it is a truly human virus.</para>

      <para id="ch0129s000000p0004">Human parvovirus B19 was officially recognized as a member of the<emphasis>Parvoviridae</emphasis> in 1985, and the ICTV recommended the name B19V to prevent confusion with human papillomavirus. It is classified as a member of the species <emphasis>Primate erythroparvovirus</emphasis> 1 in the genus <emphasis>Erythroparvovirus</emphasis> with the virus name parvovirus B19 (official abbreviation, B19V) (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0001">1</link>). Although three different genotypes have been described, named genotypes 1, 2, and 3, there is serological cross-reactivity, and thus, they constitute only one serotype (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0008">8</link>–<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0011">11</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0129s000000p0005">B19V has the typical features of a member of<emphasis>Parvoviridae</emphasis>: the virions are nonenveloped and 23 to 26 nm in diameter, with icosahedral T = 1 symmetry (<anchor id="ch0129s000000a0006"/><link linkend="ch0129s000000a0009">Fig. 1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0129s000000p0006">The viral capsid consists of 60 copies of the smaller capsid protein VP2, of which ~5% are extended at the N terminus, forming the larger VP1 protein (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0012">12</link>). The unique VP1 (VP1u) sequence is 227 amino acids long and contains motifs important for immunity (immunodominant epitopes), intracellular trafficking (phospholipase A2 [PLA2]), and virion binding and internalization (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0013">13</link>–<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0018">18</link>). VP2, but not VP1 alone, can self-assemble to form virus-like particles (VLPs) even in the absence of B19V DNA; VP1 is thus not required for capsid formation but is required for infectivity (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0018">18</link>–<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0020">20</link>). B19V replicates exclusively in red blood cell precursors of the bone marrow and of fetal liver (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0006">6</link>). The primary cellular receptor was initially thought to be globoside, the blood group P antigen, and individuals who lack this antigen were shown to be genetically resistant to B19V infections (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0022">22</link>). However, it was later shown that the internalization of the virion is mediated by a still-unknown cellular receptor binding to VP1u, while globoside is required at a postentry step (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0023">23</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0129s000000p0007">The genome consists of a single-stranded DNA molecule of 5,596 nucleotides, with identical ~400-nucleotide (nt) imperfect palindromic inverted terminal repeat sequences at both ends forming hairpin-like structures (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0025">25</link>).

      <para id="ch0129s000000p0008">B19V is a common cause of infection in humans, and although there is some variation in different countries, 50% of 15-year-olds and 80% of the elderly have detectable IgG (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0027">27</link>–<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0029">29</link>). The most common B19V genotype currently circulating worldwide is genotype 1, whereas genotype 3 has been shown to be more prevalent in Ghana (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0030">30</link>) (see “Typing Systems”). Genotype 2 circulated more frequently before 1970 but is still detected in tissues of older individuals (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0031">31</link>). Infections in temperate climates are more common in late winter, spring, and early summer months, and most affected are school-aged children 5 to 15 years of age. Infection induces a lifelong immune response that generally protects from symptomatic reinfections. Rates of infection may increase every 3 to 5 years when a sufficient number of new susceptible young individuals have accumulated, and this is reflected by corresponding increases in the major clinical manifestations of B19V infection, mainly transient aplastic crisis (TAC) and erythema infectiosum (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0032">32</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0129s000000p0009">The virus can be readily transmitted by close contact through the respiratory route. In one study, the secondary attack rate from symptomatic patients to susceptible (IgG-negative) household contacts was approximately 50% (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0032">32</link>). The highest secondary attack rates and also seroprevalence and annual seroconversion rates are seen among workers with close contact with young children, e.g., day care providers and school personnel (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0029">29</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0033">33</link>). However, the virus is typically transmitted before the rash, since the rash is due to immune complexes. The virus may further be transmitted from a pregnant mother to her fetus, resulting in miscarriage or fetal death in about 10% of cases if the seronegative mother is infected in the first half of her pregnancy (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0034">34</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0129s000000p0010">Infectious virus can also be found in serum, and infection can be transmitted by blood and blood products. Although ~1% of blood donations have low-level detectable B19V DNA (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0035">35</link>), reports of transmission of B19V infection by individual units of blood or platelets are rare. However, transmission from pooled products is more common, and recommendations in Europe and the United States now require all plasma pools for fractionation to be screened for high-titer parvovirus DNA to try to minimize the transmission of B19V by blood products. The transmission risk from patients with an underlying hemolytic disorder is very high due to the extremely high loads of B19V in their blood (<anchor id="ch0129s000000a0011"/><link linkend="ch0129s000000a0015">Table 1</link>), and such patients should therefore be isolated, especially from seronegative pregnant women.</para>
      <para id="ch0129s000000p0011">Currently, there is no vaccine for B19V, although B19V VLPs expressed in either insect or yeast cells are highly immunogenic (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0037">37</link>), and while the results of phase 1 trials looked promising, a recent, larger trial was stopped due to the development of unexplained skin rashes in three recipients (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0038">38</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0129s000000p0012">B19V primarily infects erythroid progenitor cells, inducing cell death through apoptosis and cessation of red cell production. Thus, the presentation of infection depends on the significance of the drop in red cell production and/or the immune response to infection, and unlike many viral infections, the disease manifestation of infection with B19V varies widely with the immunologic and hematologic status of the host (<link linkend="ch0129s000000a0015">Table 1</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0129s000000p0013">Although a significant number of infections are asymptomatic, the major manifestation of B19V infection is erythema infectiosum, also known as fifth disease or slapped-cheek disease, due to the characteristic facial rash (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0039">39</link>). After a 2- to 5-day nonspecific prodromal illness (fever, chills, and myalgia) (<anchor id="ch0129s000000a0014"/><link linkend="ch0129s000000a0025">Fig. 2A</link>), or very suddenly without any such symptoms (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0006">6</link>), the classic slapped-cheek rash appears, followed 1 to 4 days later by erythematous maculopapular exanthem on the trunk and limbs, with or without joint pain. This rash is almost certainly immune mediated, and the timing correlates with detection of an antibody response. Before the appearance of the rash, but not thereafter, the child is thus seronegative and contagious due to the high viral load. As the rash on the trunk and limbs fades, it takes on a typical lacy appearance. There may be great variation in the dermatological appearance, and often a laboratory analysis is needed for the diagnosis. It may rarely present also as papular-purpuric “gloves and socks” syndrome, with papular, petechial, or pustular appearance (6, 40–42). The classic slapped-cheek appearance is more common in children than adults, and the second-stage eruption may vary from a very faint erythema that is easily missed to a florid exanthema and may be transient or recurrent during exercise or exposure to sunlight or heat over 1 to 3 weeks. The child is no longer contagious during the recurrent erythema and can thus go to school if otherwise healthy. Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly can occur that mimic mononucleosis (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0043">43</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0044">44</link>). In adults, the joints are more often affected, whereas the rash is faint or absent but may be associated with various polymorphous cutaneous manifestations (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0045">45</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0129s000000p0016">In children, B19V infection is usually mild and of short duration. However, in adults and especially in women, there is a symmetrical arthropathy primarily affecting the small joints of the hands and feet in approximately 50% of patients (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0046">46</link>). Joint symptoms often last 1 to 4 weeks, although in 20% of affected women, arthralgia or frank arthritis may persist or recur for &gt;2 months or even years. In the absence of a history of rash, the symptoms may be mistaken for acute rheumatoid arthritis, especially as B19V infection can be associated with transient induction of rheumatoid factor (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0047">47</link>). Erosions of joints are seldom seen (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0048">48</link>). It has been postulated that B19V is involved in the initiation and perpetuation of rheumatoid arthritis leading to joint lesions (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0049">49</link>), but these results have not been reproducible by other groups. It is further unlikely that B19V would play a role in classic erosive rheumatoid arthritis. Of note, B19V DNA is also frequently found in synovial tissue of control (noninfectious joint trauma) subjects (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0050">50</link>).</para>

Acute primary B19V infection of the mother is diagnosed by detection of specific IgM and a 4-fold increase in IgG in serum. Whether the infection occurred before or after pregnancy can further be estimated by measurement of IgG epitope type specificity (ETS) or IgG avidity and by quantitative PCR, where viral loads above 10<superscript>4</superscript> copies/ml are considered a risk for the fetus (<link linkend="ch0129s000000a0015">Table 1</link>; also see “Diagnosis,” below) (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0078">78</link>–<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0082">82</link>). When a woman in the first half of the pregnancy is diagnosed with acute B19V infection, weekly fetal ultrasound monitoring is recommended for up to 12 weeks after infection.

      <para id="ch0129s000000p0026">Due to its small DNA genome and lack of a lipid envelope around its sturdy icosahedral capsid, B19V is resistant to most types of physical inactivation and is relatively heat stable. Therefore, no special precautions are needed for transportation and storage of most clinical specimens, although repeated freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided where possible. Serum (or plasma) samples should be obtained, if possible, for measurement of both viral load and B19V-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. Additional samples may include cerebrospinal fluid (for investigation of neurologic infection), amniotic fluid (for investigations in pregnancy), and bone marrow samples (hematologic disease), but these should always be in addition to serum samples where possible, as interpretation may be difficult without a concurrent serum sample. For investigation of fetal deaths, fetal or placental tissue can be used, either frozen or fixed, although frozen material is preferable for DNA analysis. However, pediatric or adult tissue biopsy specimens (e.g., synovia, skin, tonsil, heart, bone, and brain) are dubious sample types for diagnostic purposes, given that healthy individuals may harbor this virus in their tissues (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0050">50</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0056">56</link>–<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0061">61</link>). Samples can usually be transported at room temperature, with the exception of tissue samples (especially fetal liver samples), which, if not fixed, should be fresh frozen (or immersed in RNA later) as soon as possible after collection and kept frozen until processed (due to the large amounts of proteases and DNase activity often present in such samples). For obtaining and handling of all samples intended for PCR, utmost care should be taken to avoid contaminating B19V DNA.</para>

      <para id="ch0129s000000p0039">Serological surveys were originally performed using counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE), which was relatively insensitive and was superseded by radioimmunoassays (RIA). Now, antibody testing is almost universally performed using enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Given that B19V does not grow in standard cell culture systems, early serology assays were based on the use of synthetic peptides (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0116">116</link>) or fusion protein antigens made in <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0117">117</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0118">118</link>). However, the epitopes presented by these products do not accurately reproduce the epitopes of the native capsids, and the sensitivity and specificity of these EIA were disappointing. The production of B19V capsid proteins as VLPs using baculovirus in insect cells (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0119">119</link>) or yeast (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0120">120</link>) expression systems appears to have overcome these problems, with results based on these antigens showing good correlation with assays based on native virus. The antigens are relatively easy to mass produce and are noninfectious.</para>
      <para id="ch0129s000000p0040">Immunoassays using VLPs as antigens are generally both sensitive and specific. Although B19V IgM can be detected by both IgM capture assays and indirect assays, capture assays are preferred, as they appear to be more sensitive and less prone to false-positive results caused by the presence of rheumatoid factor. In contrast, IgG assays are probably more sensitive in an indirect (or sandwich) format, especially for seroprevalence studies. Commercial immunoassays for both B19V IgM and IgG are available from a number of different companies, but they are mostly designated for research use only. In the United States, the DiaSorin and ZEUS EIA (Liaison Biotrin parvovirus B19 IgM and IgG EIA [DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy] and ZEUS ELISA parvovirus IgG test system [ZEUS, NJ, USA]) are FDA approved for diagnostic use. Some of the antibody kits have been tested in parallel, with similar performances (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0121">121</link>–<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0125">125</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0129s000000p0041">Antibodies to B19V usually appear within 1 to 2 weeks of infection, by the seventh day of illness (aplastic crisis), or the day after the onset of rash. Antibodies may remain detectable long-term, although some waning of immunity occurs (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0126">126</link>). Sera from patients with chronic B19V infection may have VP2 antibodies but lack VP1 antibodies (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0127">127</link>). It has further been shown that IgG from prior infections recognizes mainly intact conformational VP2 epitopes but not linear or denatured VP2, whereas IgG from acute infection reacts with both epitope types. To avoid disturbing the conformational epitopes, the VP2-only VLP antigens need to be gently immobilized by a linker in the EIA plate wells (e.g., biotinylated VLPs on streptavidin-coated plates) (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0080">80</link>). Due to the frequent prolonged IgM responses and specificity problems of IgM EIA, other serodiagnostic assays have been developed that measure the quality of IgG instead of the quantity. These assays are based on the differential recognition of linear and conformational VP2 epitopes (ETS assays [see above]), including a specific acute-phase peptide (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0081">81</link>), or on the gradually increasing bonding force of IgG (avidity), as the B cell response matures after primary B19V infection.

False-positive B19V IgM serology can occur with other acute infections that include rash, including measles and rubella, and may mislead clinicians.

Because HBoV1-DNA loads generally decrease with time after infection, qPCR can be used to detect high viral loads (10<superscript>4</superscript> to 10<superscript>6</superscript> copies/ml) in nasopharyngeal samples, which give a higher probability of the current symptoms being due to an acute HBoV1 infection (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0160">160</link>). A number of different in-house qPCRs have been described, specifically either detecting just HBoV1 or detecting all four HBoVs, with some of the latter assays also being able to differentiate them (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0177">177</link>–<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0187">187</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0129s000000p0061">However, a third of patients with low viral loads may also have acute HBoV1 infection, which suggests that viral load alone is not sufficient to establish clinically correct diagnoses (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0160">160</link>). Another approach is therefore RT-PCR for detection of HBoV1 mRNA. Viral mRNAs occur in the airways mostly in the acute phase of HBoV1 infection and associates with high viral load and serodiagnosis and can thus be considered a marker of an active ongoing infection (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0163">163</link>–<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0166">166</link>).

Distinguishing HBoV1 antibodies from those of the other HBoVs is important because respiratory tract infections are caused only by HBoV1. EIA for HBoVs are not yet commercially available. If two related HBoVs sequentially infect an individual, an immunological phenomenon called original antigenic sin (OAS) may hinder the induction of a specific antibody response to the latter virus, which can lead to a false-negative EIA result (<link linkend="ch0129s000000li0152">152</link>, <link linkend="ch0129s000000li0196">196</link>).
