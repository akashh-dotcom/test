      <para id="ch0152s0001p0002">In the past 100 years, the microbial pathogens described in this chapter have been classified as fungal and/or parafungal protistan microbes (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0001">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>). Based on their apparent epidemiological connection with water, they were at one point also placed in a new category of hydrophilic infectious agents (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0001">1</link>). However, based on taxonomic and other morphological characteristics, these four anomalous species, <emphasis>Lagenidium, Pythium, Rhinosporidium</emphasis>, and the uncultivated fungus previously known as <emphasis>Lacazia loboi</emphasis>, were not well understood (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>). This frustrating situation fueled a strong controversy that has only recently been solved with the advent of molecular methodologies (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0006">6</link>). Despite the recent finding that both <emphasis>Pythium insidiosum</emphasis> and <emphasis>Rhinosporidium seeberi</emphasis> are protistan pathogens, they are still studied by medical mycologists, continuing a historical tradition. The finding of two members of the Oomycota (generically referred as the oomycetes) affecting mammalian hosts, <emphasis>Lagenidium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Paralagenidium</emphasis>, alerted the medical community to the presence of a novel group of primary Oomycota pathogens phenotypically like the fungi and indistinguishable from the clinical and pathological features displayed by <emphasis>P. insidiosum</emphasis> during infection. In addition, Vilela et al. (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0008">8</link>) recently reported that the uncultivated fungus developing skin granulomas in dolphin and humans, long believed to be <emphasis>Lacazia loboi</emphasis>, comprised two different <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> species: <emphasis>P. ceti</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. loboi.</emphasis> Based on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) phylogenetic analysis, the evolutionary location of the microbial pathogens discussed in this chapter is illustrated in <anchor id="ch0152s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0152s0002a0003">Fig. 1</link>. <anchor id="ch0152s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0152s0002a0004">Table 1</link> summarizes the most prominent features of the pathogens covered in this section.</para>

      <para id="ch0152s0002p0001">Jorge de Oliveira Lobo first described parakeloidal skin lesions (Jorge Lobo’s disease) in a patient from the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, in 1930 (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0009">9</link>). He stated that the new pathogen was phenotypically similar to the parasitic stages of the genera <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> and <emphasis>Paracoccidioides.</emphasis> The earliest attempts to isolate this pathogen in culture met with failure, and soon it became clear that this pathogen resists culture (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0010">10</link>). This fact led to great controversy regarding its epidemiological and taxonomic affinities, reflected by the numerous names under which this pathogen was known. In 1999, Taborda et al. (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0011">11</link>) suggested the binomial <emphasis>Lacazia loboi</emphasis> to end more than 70 years of taxonomic ambiguity. Based on this proposal, Vilela et al. (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0012">12</link>) suggested the disease name “lacaziosis,” but with the placement of these uncultivated species within the genus <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis>, the term became obsolete (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0008">8</link>). Likewise, the disease name ‘‘lobomycosis” has long been questioned because it derives from the obsolete genus <emphasis>Lobomyces</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>). Initial phylogenetic studies placed <emphasis>L. loboi</emphasis> as the sister taxon to <emphasis>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0014">14</link>), but besides the long branches described in phylogenetic analyses of these pathogens, there were not sufficient DNA sequences to support this claim. Vilela et al. (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0015">15</link>), using at least five different PCR amplified genes (<emphasis>chitin synthase 4, ADP-ribosylation factor, gp43, Kex</emphasis>, and ITS rDNA) from DNA extracted directly from 20 <emphasis>L. loboi</emphasis> human specimens, presented a strong argument for the phylogenetic placement of this pathogen as an independent taxon. However, no DNA sequences from infected dolphins were included in their analyses.</para>
      <para id="ch0152s0002p0002">The first case of dolphin skin disease with yeastlike cells was reported in 1971 (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0016">16</link>). Based on clinical, histopathological, and serological analyses and the uncultivated nature of the pathogen, it was long believed to be the same as <emphasis>L. loboi</emphasis> in humans (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0007">7</link>). However, recent molecular data using DNA sequences (<emphasis>Gp43</emphasis> and ITS rDNA) from different dolphins (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0017">17</link>–<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0019">19</link>) clustered their DNA with the DNA sequences of cultivated <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> species causing systemic infection in humans. A recent phylogenetic study with DNA sequences (<emphasis>Gp43, Kex</emphasis>, and ITS rDNA) of six dolphins in the United States with granulomas and yeastlike cells confirmed previous reports (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0007">7</link>). These studies revealed that the interrogated dolphin DNA sequences, including those used in early analyses, clustered among the cultivated human <emphasis>P. brasiliensis</emphasis> isolates. Interestingly, the inclusion of dolphin DNA sequences lowers the bootstrap support of human <emphasis>L. loboi</emphasis> DNA sequences as an independent species from the genus <emphasis>Paracoccidioides.</emphasis> Vilela et al. (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0007">7</link>) argued that, as was previously suspected (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>), perhaps the genus <emphasis>Lacazia</emphasis> is a <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> species. Because few DNA sequences from dolphins with the disease were used in phylogenetic analysis, the separation of the dolphin DNA from the cultivated <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> species remained a puzzle. Meanwhile, Vilela and Mendoza (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0020">20</link>) proposed the variety <emphasis>P. brasiliensis</emphasis> var. <emphasis>ceti</emphasis> and the disease name “paracoccidioidomycosis ceti” until its position in the tree of life was elucidated (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0007">7</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0152s0002p0004">More recently, Vilela et al. (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0008">8</link>), investigating several dolphin ITS rDNA and protein coding genes (<emphasis>chitin synthase 4, ADP-ribosylation factor, gp43, Kex</emphasis>, and ITS rDNA) in population genetic and other analyses, found that the DNA sequences of the uncultivated dolphin pathogen formed a monophyletic cluster within the cultivated <emphasis>P. americana</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. brasiliensis</emphasis>, and separated from the uncultivated skin pathogen of humans known as <emphasis>L. loboi.</emphasis> Based on these analyses, they proposed the binomial <emphasis>P. ceti</emphasis> for the dolphin skin pathogen first described by Migaki et al. (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0016">16</link>) and emended the binomial <emphasis>P. loboi</emphasis> for the human disease described by Jorge Lobo in 1930 (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0009">9</link>). Under this new nomenclature, the use of the name “Jorge Lobo’s disease” for human cases of skin infection, and “paracoccidioidomycosis ceti” for skin-infected dolphins, was proposed (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0008">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0020">20</link>). They also recommended, along with Jorge Lobo’s disease, the name “paracoccidioidomycosis loboi” to differentiate the disease name of this uncultivated pathogen from the human-cultivated <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> species, traditionally labeled as “paracoccidioidomycosis” (<link linkend="ch0152s0002a0004">Table 1</link>). The analysis of more DNA sequences and perhaps the complete genomes of both pathogens of humans and dolphins will reveal more insights into the evolutionary paths of these two neglected uncultivated <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> species.</para>

      <para id="ch0152s0003p0001">Because<emphasis>P. ceti</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. loboi</emphasis> cannot be cultured, our knowledge of these pathogens is based on the morphological features observed in their parasitic stage. The <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> phenotype is characterized by the development of comparable unicellular, thick-walled, lemon-shaped yeastlike cells found forming long chains of one, two, or more cells with occasional branching and characteristically connected by short tubules, a feature usually absent in yeast cells of cultivated <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> species (<anchor id="ch0152s0003a0003"/><link linkend="ch0152s0004a0003">Fig. 2B</link> and <link linkend="ch0152s0003a0003">C</link>).

It is quite possible that in nature,<emphasis>P. ceti</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. loboi</emphasis> could develop hyphae with propagules (perhaps conidia), like those in cultivated <emphasis>Paracoccidioides</emphasis> species, that gain entrance into the skin through traumatic lesions. Transmission of the disease from one patient to another is rare, but some cases of autoinoculation and accidental infection by physicians in contact with infected hosts have been reported (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0025">25</link>).

Recent population genetic analysis suggested that <emphasis>P. ceti</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. loboi</emphasis> probably are dimorphic fungi with genetic defects in the pathways required for yeast cell transition to hyphae phenotype (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0008">8</link>).

      <para id="ch0152s0005p0001">Infections caused by<emphasis>P. ceti</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. loboi</emphasis> are rarely observed in the tropical areas of endemicity in the Americas (humans) and many oceans (dolphins) (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0016">16</link>). Recent reports indicate that human cases of the disease are sporadic in the areas of endemicity and occur mainly in males. The number of cases so far reported is around 600, but its real occurrence could be higher. The disease is diagnosed in apparently healthy hosts inhabiting such areas. A genetic predisposition theory was abandoned after the finding that the number of cases in a Brazilian tribe with a high occurrence of the disease dramatically decreased when the tribe was moved to a new location (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>). One common problem in the areas of endemicity is that patients with the disease do not seek medical attention until years after the initial infection, when the lesions have increased in size and spread to other skin areas. One explanation may be that the affected population is usually poor, with no access to health care, and that the lesions are rarely painful (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0152s0005p0002">Frequently affected anatomical areas in humans are the arms, ears, back, chest, face, and lower limbs. Some investigators believe that the distribution of lesions on cooler areas of skin in humans may indicate that the pathogen does not tolerate well temperatures above 37°C. Initially, a single small (0.5 to 1.0 cm in diameter), smooth, parakeloidal skin lesion develops. Some patients complain of slight pruritus at this stage. The infection is not life-threatening and evolves very slowly, sometimes over 20 or more years (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>). Usually, when patients seek medical attention, they have already developed more than one lesion. In the chronic phase, lesions are polymorphic. At least five clinical manifestations are recognized, including the typical parakeloidal type and the infiltrative, gummatous, ulcerated, and verrucous forms. However, Lacaz et al. (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0004">4</link>) pointed out that two or more forms, including a macular type, could be found in a single patient. The differential diagnosis includes chromoblastomycosis, leishmaniasis, leprosy, neoplasia, paracoccidioidomycosis, and similar skin conditions.</para>

The lesions are characterized by fibrosis and granulomatous reactions, with numerous histiocytes and giant cells containing numerous yeastlike cells of these pathogens. Areas of necrosis and the presence of other inflammatory cells have been reported. When tissue is stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), the typical yeastlike cell arrangement in chains is not observed.

      <para id="ch0152s0015p0001">The clinical manifestations of pythiosis vary according to the infection site. Most patients with the disease state that they had a skin injury prior to the infection. The lesions caused by<emphasis>P. insidiosum</emphasis> in humans can be classified into superficial infections (keratitis); cutaneous and subcutaneous forms, including orbital pythiosis; and vascular forms that usually lead to systemic infection and death. Keratitis caused by <emphasis>P. insidiosum</emphasis> is similar to that caused by fungi and other etiologic agents (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0047">47</link>–<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0049">49</link>). It begins with trauma to the superficial layers of the eye, followed by the development of conjunctivitis, photophobia, corneal ulcers, and hypopyon (pus in the anterior chamber of the eye). Cutaneous and subcutaneous infection is characterized by the formation of granulomatous plaques and/or ulcerated swellings that remain localized. Once the pathogen has reached the subcutaneous tissues, itchy papules may develop. The orbital form of subcutaneous pythiosis is rare and has been observed mainly in children in Australia and the United States (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0050">50</link>). Vascular pythiosis starts with a traumatic lesion, usually on the lower limbs, followed by dissemination of the pathogen to the nearby arteries (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0038">38</link>). Initially, the infected skin shows signs of dry gangrene, and the formation of painful necrotic ulcers in some patients has also been reported (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0037">37</link>). Clinical symptoms are pain caused by too little blood flow in the affected limb usually during exercise, local ischemia, swelling, and the absence of the dorsalis pedis pulse. As the infection progresses, an ascending arteritis, with the formation of thrombi and aneurysms of the large arteries, is the main feature. If not treated, <emphasis>P. insidiosum</emphasis> may spread through the arteries and reach the iliac and renal arteries and abdominal aorta, causing disseminated pythiosis. This form of pythiosis is more common in Thailand among patients with thalassemia, and it is usually life-threatening (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0040">40</link>).

In infected tissues, <emphasis>P. insidiosum</emphasis> triggers eosinophilic granulomas with giant cells, mast cells, and other inflammatory cells (<link linkend="ch0152s0017s0001a0004">Fig. 5D</link>).

The activation of an eosinophilic inflammatory response with the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon is a feature in common with the members of the Oomycota <emphasis>Lagenidum</emphasis> and <emphasis>Paralagenidium</emphasis> and fungi in the order Entomophthorales, from which it must be differentiated. Although most experts in the diagnosis of pythiosis agree that it is difficult to distinguish between the hyphal structures of <emphasis>P. insidiosum</emphasis> and those of the Entomophthorales, the ribbon-type morphology and the bigger size of Entomophthorales hyphal filaments could help to distinguish these fungi from <emphasis>P. insidiosum.

Biopsy or necropsy tissues and kunkers (stony, hard masses found only in horses with pythiosis) from patients suspected of having pythiosis are usually cut into small fragments 2 to 5 mm in diameter, placed into tubes containing sterile distilled water, and vigorously washed two or three times before plating. The small fragments are then physically pushed into the agar, and the plates are incubated at 25 and 37°C for 2 or more days. The relative humidity of the incubator should be enhanced by placing a beaker of water inside the chamber. Specimens that have been transported for more than 24 h can also be inoculated into tubes containing broth and then incubated at 37°C. Usually, submerged colonies surrounding the clinical specimens are detectable after 24 to 48 h of incubation (<link linkend="ch0152s0014a0003">Fig. 3A</link>) (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0033">33</link>).

Recently, susceptibility testing on a strain isolated from a child in Tennessee with orbital pythiosis showed the strain to have low MICs of terbinafine and itraconazole (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0064">64</link>). Although this combination of drugs was successfully used in this case, the same combination was less effective when tested in other humans and animals. One explanation for this contradiction is the possibility that these antifungal drugs may affect pathways other than sterols. The inconsistent results with most antifungal drugs for the treatment of pythiosis have led to the use of unconventional treatments such as immunotherapy (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0040">40</link>). Immunotherapy has been found to be effective in 55% of humans and dogs and in 70% of equines with the disease (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0057">57</link>). In addition, some investigators have evaluated <emphasis>In vitro</emphasis> combinations of several antifungals against <emphasis>P. insidiosum</emphasis>, with promising results (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0065">65</link>–<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0067">67</link>). These studies indicate that terbinafine plus fluconazole or ketoconazole (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0066">66</link>) or terbinafine plus amphotericin B (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0067">67</link>) substantially reduces the <emphasis>In vitro</emphasis> growth of <emphasis>P. insidiosum.</emphasis> However, these combinations of antifungal drugs have yet to be tested in clinical cases.</para>

When culture is not possible, the use of molecular approaches and/or immunohistochemical (peroxidase and immunofluorescence) tests could be of help. The presence of hyaline hyphae in wet-mount preparations and in histopathology should be reported as suggestive of pythiosis, whereas positive results in culture (development of zoospores in water cultures) or positive reactions in molecular assays and/or in immunohistochemical staining tests are reported as confirmatory tests of disease. In such cases, the report of results should include the following: “Pythiosis caused by <emphasis>P. insidiosum</emphasis> confirmed by culture and supported by serological and/or molecular assays.”</para>

The genus <emphasis>Lagenidium</emphasis> comprises oomycetous species affecting lower animals, such as crabs, mosquito larvae, nematodes, and others (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0061">61</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0068">68</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0069">69</link>).

Although Dick (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0070">70</link>), using phenotypic characteristics, recently questioned the validity of this genus, current phylogenetic studies have found that an <emphasis>L. giganteum</emphasis> isolate infecting dogs clustered with <emphasis>L. giganteum</emphasis> from mosquito larvae (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0071">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0072">72</link>).

In 1912, Seeber introduced the name <emphasis>Rhinosporidium seeberi</emphasis> and called attention to its priority over <emphasis>R. kinealyi.</emphasis> In 1924, Ashworth (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0002">2</link>) stated that the genus <emphasis>Rhinosporidium</emphasis>, proposed by Minchin and Fanthan, should be adopted and that, based on the description of Seeber (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0002">2</link>) and the name <emphasis>Coccidioides seeberia</emphasis> reintroduced by Belou, the binomial <emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis> has priority.</para>
      <para id="ch0152s0033p0002">The fact that this pathogen resists culture led some investigators to extreme hypotheses, recently reviewed by Vilela and Mendoza (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0074">74</link>). The suggestion that <emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis> is a cyanobacterium in the genus <emphasis>Microcystis</emphasis> is the most recent in a long list of similar views. This and other views have been challenged by several groups showing that morphological, cell cycle, and phylogenetic analyses all link this pathogen with the protistan eukaryotes (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0074">74</link>). The placement of <emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis> within the Ichthyosporea (Mezomycetozoea) came as a surprise. This group comprises orphan aquatic fish and amphibian parasites with spherical forms and endospores strikingly similar to those of <emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0005">5</link>). Currently, this pathogen is part of the supergroup Opisthokonta (Ichthyosporea [Mesomycetozoea]) (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0030">30</link>). By using the rDNA ITS, it was found that <emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis> might include several species-specific strains that could represent new species (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0075">75</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0152s0034p0001">This anomalous pathogen has resisted culture; thus, its morphological features are known only through<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> microscopic and ultramicroscopic studies (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0005">5</link>). In infected tissues, <emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis> has a complex parasitic cell cycle. It appears as multiple spherical structures known as sporangia (cysts in most mesomycetozoans) in different stages of development (<anchor id="ch0152s0034a0003"/><link linkend="ch0152s0034a0004">Fig. 7A</link>) (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0074">74</link>). The <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> life cycle starts with the release of hundreds of oval or spherical endospores, 7 μm to &gt;15 μm in diameter, from a pore developed only in mature sporangia (MS) (<link linkend="ch0152s0034a0004">Fig. 7B</link>). The endospores increase in size and progressively develop from juvenile sporangia (JS) (10 μm to &gt;100 μm) to intermediate sporangia (IS) (100 μm to &lt;150 μm), and then to MS (150 μm to &lt;450 μm). The endospores are released from MS from one or more pores, and then the <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> cycle is somehow reinitiated. Because <emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis> resists culture, everything we know about its cell cycle is based on the phenotypic structures observed in infected tissues. Although the diameter of the sporangium has been used to identify the <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> stages, the MS differs from other stages by the presence of well-developed endospores (<link linkend="ch0152s0034a0004">Fig. 7B</link>). The finding of mitotic figures within some sporangia in histological preparations has been mentioned (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0076">76</link>). These authors found the nuclei within IS synchronously divide without cytokinesis. In large intermediate sporangia, a cell wall is developed around each endospore with thousands of nuclei, becoming an MS. Recently, Delfino et al. (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0077">77</link>), using confocal microscopy and DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, confirmed previous views (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0076">76</link>) about the synchronized nature of the nuclear division of <emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0152s0034a0004">Fig. 7C</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0152s0035p0001">Rhinosporidiosis usually occurs in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world except Australia (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0001">1</link>). Although the infection was first recognized in Argentina, India and Sri Lanka show the highest occurrence of the disease (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0078">78</link>). Rhinosporidiosis occurs sporadically in other geographical areas, such as the Americas, Africa, Europe, and Asian countries, including the Middle East. Because some cases of rhinosporidiosis occur in dry areas, especially after sandstorms, the hydrophilic nature of this pathogen has long been questioned (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0074">74</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0078">78</link>). Based on accounts from patients with the disease, it is believed that rhinosporidiosis is acquired through contact with aquatic environments contaminated with <emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis>, but the precise mechanism of infection from natural sources is unknown.</para>
      <para id="ch0152s0035p0002">The finding linking<emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis> to aquatic pathogens of fish and amphibians (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0005">5</link>–<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0078">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0079">79</link>) tends to confirm its hydrophilic nature. Most probably, this pathogen evolved from an aquatic niche, in which it still can be found, to terrestrial environments by the development of resistant spores. This is a very likely scenario, since the formation of zoospores, as in the other members of the Ichthyosporea, among which <emphasis>R. seeberi</emphasis> is phylogenetically located, has not been found (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0079">79</link>). The disease tends to occur as single cases, but two outbreaks of rhinosporidiosis in humans in Serbia (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0080">80</link>) and in swans from Florida (<link linkend="ch0152s0043s0001li0081">81</link>) have also been recorded. The resistant spores present in water and soil may gain entry through small cutaneous or mucocutaneous wounds and establish infection.

The disease is not life-threatening, but it can cause breathing difficulties when the polyps obstruct the nose or laryngeal passages. Rhinorrhea and bleeding are common with polyps located in the nose. The slow-growing polypoidal masses are usually found as single or multiple, pedunculate (attached to the skin), sessile, red lesions that bleed easily. Pruritus of the affected areas is also common. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial and fungal infection, neoplasia, and other similar mucosal and skin conditions.</para>
