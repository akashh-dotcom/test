      <para id="ch0027s0001p0001">Our knowledge and understanding of the pathogenesis and transmission of infectious diseases have increased dramatically in recent decades, primarily as a result of increasingly sophisticated and cost-effective molecular techniques and the ability to interconnect and combine these observations with clinical microbiology and epidemiology. In the context of infectious diseases, epidemiology is often used to describe the study of the transmission of human pathogens, including host risk factors for exposure and control of infectious disease in human populations (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0001">1</link>). In today’s interconnected world, infectious disease epidemiology must often take into account animal and agricultural pathogens, including zoonoses, and assess the broader impact of microbial pathogens on human health, including environmental and economic risk factors, outcomes, and consequences.</para>
      <para id="ch0027s0001p0002">The practice of infectious disease epidemiology has always been linked to advances in laboratory science, data analysis, and interpretation. For the better part of the 20th century, and up until the introduction of molecular techniques in the 1970s, infectious disease epidemiology was driven mostly by discoveries in classical microbiology, with increasingly sophisticated culture and phenotypic identification methods; subtyping techniques like biotyping, serotyping, and phage typing; and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. For decades, these basic microbiologic and serologic techniques were used to discover, identify, and differentiate new pathogens, to help define their reservoirs, transmission routes, geographical distributions, and infection dynamics (including outbreak detection and investigations), and to assess the efficacy of vaccines, therapeutics, and other disease prevention measures.</para>
      <para id="ch0027s0001p0003">Beginning around 50 years ago, the first molecular microbiology methods were introduced, and as cost and feasibility continued to improve, they began to replace or support many of the classical phenotypic subtyping and characterization approaches that had been routine in most public health microbiology laboratories. The establishment of these new molecular techniques as standard tools for public health microbiology helped define a new discipline: molecular epidemiology. In its simplest form, molecular epidemiology is the application of molecular (i.e., nucleic acid- or protein-based) techniques to answer epidemiological questions. The advent of molecular epidemiology enabled public health departments of all scales to use standardized molecular methods to compare and assess microbial pathogens, and to use these data for laboratory-based infectious disease surveillance, outbreak detection, pathogen characterization, and public health response. Since the mid-2000s, rapid genomic sequencing and metagenomics have become increasingly practical in terms of cost, complexity, and turnaround time, leading many public health programs to explore the potential applications for pathogen surveillance and genomic epidemiology.</para>
      <para id="ch0027s0001p0004">Molecular epidemiology is often confused with another related but distinct microbiology discipline: molecular taxonomy. Taxonomy is the classification, identification, and naming of microorganisms. A subdiscipline of taxonomy is phylogeny, which is the study of the evolutionary relationships of microorganisms. Before the introduction of molecular methods, phylogeny was based solely on phenotypic traits and, as a result, was imprecise and often yielded erroneous information. The use of molecular data and genomic sequencing has greatly improved our understanding of microbial evolution and, in some instances, has helped redraw long-standing taxonomic classifications. Compared to taxonomy and phylogeny, molecular epidemiology focuses on the study of more recent population dynamics. In addition, taxonomy and phylogeny describe interactions between the organisms themselves, whereas epidemiology describes interaction between the organisms, their hosts, and the surrounding environment. The same molecular methods may be used in both disciplines; it is their application that determines whether they are used for taxonomy or epidemiology.</para>
      <para id="ch0027s0001p0005">In traditional molecular epidemiology, molecular techniques are used for the detection, identification, virulence characterization, and subtyping of infectious pathogens and to generate isolate-specific molecular markers (or fingerprints) for assessment of epidemiological relatedness (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0001">1</link>). But molecular epidemiology as a field is also undergoing an important period of transition: over the course of the past 15 years, genetic and genomic sequencing-based methods have become increasingly feasible and cost-effective and have begun to replace front-line molecular fingerprinting strategies. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to molecular epidemiology and important terms and concepts associated with the field. Much of this chapter will focus on applications of these classical molecular epidemiologic techniques, and on the increasing role and impact of genomic sequencing and bioinformatics in broad-based pathogen identification, characterization, molecular surveillance, and outbreak response. Later sections will discuss strategies for the development of molecular subtyping tools, including data analysis and interpretation, and comprehensive validation and quality control are discussed. Some terms and vocabulary that are commonly used in molecular epidemiology are provided for reader context in <anchor id="ch0027s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0027s0001a0006">Table 1</link>. A nonexhaustive list of subtyping methods that are commonly used now, or are anticipated to supplement or replace the currently used methods, is provided. Key characteristics and applications of these methods are summarized in <anchor id="ch0027s0001a0004"/><link linkend="ch0027s0002s0002a0004">Table 2</link>. Criteria for the selection of methods to be used in the different contexts of epidemiology, differences in sampling strategy, and how the choice of the method influences the interpretation of data will also be addressed.</para>

        <para id="ch0027s0002s0001p0001">An ideal typing method should be able to produce data that can lead to the establishment of meaningful subtypes for the majority, if not all, of the strains of the pathogen being studied, while remaining flexible enough to accommodate the ongoing evolution of the molecular markers or features being assessed. The degree to which a method achieves this can be expressed, in mathematical terms, as the percentage of typeable isolates among the total number of isolates being subtyped. All molecular subtyping methods (except plasmid profiling with some organisms) show very high typeability with the organisms that they target.</para>

        <para id="ch0027s0002s0002p0001">Reproducibility refers to the ability of a method to assign the same type to an isolate tested on repeat occasions separated in time and/or place. It may be calculated as the percentage of strains that, upon repeat testing with the same parameters, yield the same result. This term is sometimes also referred to as the repeatability of an assay. Typically, there is a direct correlation between the reproducibility and robustness of a method and the quality of the data being generated. Reproducibility may be influenced by many steps in the procedure, such as preparation of materials (e.g., growth conditions and DNA extraction), different batches of reagents, different types of instruments, and bias in observing, analyzing, and interpreting results. Some methods have such poor reproducibility that it is not possible to compare results generated in multiple runs, across different experiments, or performed by different operators. Such methods are said to be comparative, and may require direct comparison of query samples and one or more comparator(s) on a single instance. Other methods are so reproducible that it is possible to recognize the same subtypes even though they were generated in a separate time and/or place. Such methods are usually considered definitive subtyping methods.</para>

Interlaboratory reproducibility may be more difficult to control and requires significant investments in protocol standardization and proficiency testing, but is critical when results from different laboratories are to be compared.</para>

        <para id="ch0027s0002s0003p0001">Discriminatory power is defined as the ability of a method to distinguish between unrelated strains. An objective measure of discriminatory power can be obtained by calculating Simpson’s index of diversity (DI) (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0002">2</link>), which is an estimate of the probability that two epidemiologically unrelated strains will display different subtypes. The formula reads:</para>

A DI of 1.0 indicates that all strains can be differentiated from each other. A value above 0.95 is a desirable cutoff for subtyping methods to be used for outbreak investigations.</para>
        <para id="ch0027s0002s0003p0003">The DI is a function of both the number of subtypes in the strain population (richness) and the proportion of strains representing each subtype (i.e., the evenness of the distribution of the isolates among the different subtypes). It is not possible to determine the contribution of the richness or the evenness of a subtyping method to the DI from the number<emphasis>per se</emphasis>. This should also be taken into consideration when different subtyping methods are being compared. Several other diversity indices have been devised for this purpose, among which Shannon’s index (H) (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0003">3</link>) is the most commonly cited. However, the maximal size of this index is a direct function of the number of subtypes generated within a given strain population, and it is therefore difficult to interpret differences in the size of the index unless the populations studied generate the same number of subtypes. An easier and more comprehensible way to judge the richness of a subtyping method is to create a histogram showing the distribution of different subtypes. The results of a hypothetical experiment of subtyping the same population of 100 strains with two different methods are shown in <anchor id="ch0027s0002s0003a0003"/><link linkend="ch0027s0002s0003a0005">Fig. 1A</link> and <link linkend="ch0027s0002s0003a0005">B</link>. Method A has a slightly higher DI than method B. However, the difference between the methods becomes obvious when the histograms are examined: method A has a higher richness than method B. With method A, the 100 strains are differentiated into 74 subtypes, with all containing five or fewer strains, whereas the six most common subtypes with method B contain half of the strains, and overall, only 43 subtypes are generated with this method.</para>

However, the method should also be able to group isolates that are associated with the same source (i.e., it has a high sensitivity). In other words, a method with high sensitivity and specificity generates epidemiologically relevant data. The ability of a method to group epidemiologically related isolates together is sometimes also referred to as the epidemiological concordance.</para>

        <para id="ch0027s0002s0004p0001">There are many convenience parameters to be considered, including speed of analysis, cost, technical demands, accessibility of the method, and the ease of data analysis. The ability of a method to generate data rapidly is affected by the throughput of the method, the number of steps involved, required batch sizes for sample throughput, the amount of hands-on technical time required to perform the method, and whether the method is amenable to automation. Ideally, typing results should be available within a single working day. The cost of performing a method depends on numerous factors, such as the initial investment in equipment and infrastructure, the price of reagents and consumables, and the number and skill level of staff needed. Cost is usually also the most critical factor affecting the accessibility of the method to clinical microbiology laboratories. Ease of use encompasses technical simplicity, high throughput, and ease of scoring the results. For easy analysis, data should be objective and standardized and amenable to computational analysis and interpretation. In many laboratories, these analyses and comparisons are performed by skilled bioinformaticians or computational microbiologists, and the results must often be integrated with other public health or contextual information aggregated with other data before reporting.</para>
        <para id="ch0027s0002s0004p0002">Another convenience parameter rarely considered is the universal applicability of the method: can the same general method or approach be used to subtype a broad range of organisms while maintaining a universally high typeability, reproducibility, and discriminatory power? Or can it be used to address different public health needs? In general, the broader the range of microbial species that can be studied, the more central the position of the method in the general typing laboratory will be. Newer techniques, such as those based on genomic sequencing, can leverage the similarity of sequence-based laboratory methods and may introduce new opportunities for workflow optimization and consolidation.</para>

        <para id="ch0027s0003s0001p0001">Plasmids are circular, extrachromosomal, autonomous, self-replicating genetic elements that are found in bacteria and some eukaryotes. Their sizes range from approximately 1 kb to &gt;1 Mb. Besides genes regulating their own replication and transmission, plasmids may carry genes that confer specific properties in the host organism (e.g., antimicrobial resistance or toxins). Plasmid profiling was the first widely used nucleic acid-based bacterial subtyping method, dating back to the 1970s (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0004">4</link>). The rationale for using plasmid profiling for subtyping is that bacterial strains typically differ in the number and size of plasmids they carry. The isolates are lysed using a method that disrupts chromosomal DNA while retaining the integrity of the plasmid (e.g., alkaline lysis) (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0005">5</link>), followed by separation of the plasmids by agarose gel electrophoresis (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0006">6</link>), staining using a fluorescent dye (e.g., ethidium bromide), and visualization of the plasmids under UV light.</para>
        <para id="ch0027s0003s0001p0002">The advantage of this method is that it is universal (i.e., the same basic procedure may be used to characterize any organism that contains plasmids). It is also inexpensive, rapid, and simple, with no requirements for special equipment. The typeability of the method is variable, the discriminatory power varies between organisms, and the reproducibility is in general good, but since plasmids may be lost during strain propagation<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> and <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>, the stability is suboptimal. Additionally, plasmids can be unintentionally nicked, causing changes in their conformational structure (from supercoiled to a relaxed or linear form), which in turn impacts their migrating properties and results in an incorrect profile. These changes may happen if the purification process is performed too harshly. Two or all three conformations may be present at the same time in significant amounts and be visible as two or three bands in the gel, and since they have different migration properties in agarose, interpretation of the profiles may be difficult. In addition, large plasmids, those &gt;100 kb in size, are poorly separated by ordinary agarose gel electrophoresis. Unrelated plasmids with similar sizes may not be differentiated in an agarose gel. However, if they are digested with a restriction enzyme before electrophoresis, it will often be possible to differentiate between them.</para>

        <para id="ch0027s0003s0002p0001">A restriction endonuclease is an enzyme that recognizes a short DNA sequence and cuts it at a specific location within the restriction site. Genomic DNA from a single microorganism will always be cut into fragments of the same size and number if it is digested by the same restriction enzyme. The restriction fragments may be separated according to their size by electrophoresis using agarose or similar medium as a matrix, followed by staining and visualization under UV light to reveal the DNA fingerprint or restriction profile of that organism. Since different strains have different genomic contents, even strains of the same species that are epidemiologically unrelated to each other will usually show different restriction profiles. Subtyping methods that explore the polymorphisms of restriction profiles are called restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods, and the process is called restriction endonuclease analysis. The method was introduced in the late 1970s and the 1980s for subtyping of viruses, parasites, fungi, and bacteria (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0012">12</link>–<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0015">15</link>); it used high-frequency cutting enzymes, which resulted in DNA fingerprints containing up to 500 restriction fragments ranging in size from &lt;1 kb to 30 kb. Although the method had universal applicability, was simple, and required few resources, the resulting fragments were often difficult to resolve, and the DNA fingerprints were too complex to analyze accurately, especially for organisms with large genomes (e.g., bacteria, fungi, and parasites). For this reason, ways to simplify the RFLP DNA fingerprints while maintaining the discriminatory power of the method were sought. This was achieved by reducing the number of restriction fragments in the fingerprints by (i) reducing the number of fragments generated during the restriction reaction or (ii) reducing the number of fragments being visualized. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) falls within the former category.</para>

The resulting fragments usually range between ~20 kb and &gt;1 Mb in size. Because organisms differ in the guanine-and-cytosine (GC) content of their DNA, the optimal restriction enzymes for PFGE vary between organisms. The optimal restriction enzyme(s) generates between approximately 8 and 25 DNA fragments that are well separated and evenly distributed throughout the gel from each strain tested (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0019">19</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0027s0003s0002s0002p0002">Large DNA fragments cannot efficiently be purified in a liquid suspension, because this will cause random shearing. To avoid that, the genomic DNA is released and purified from cells that have been embedded in a solid agarose plug. The plug stabilizes the DNA against breaking or shearing as the cells are lysed chemically. The intact genomic DNA is then digested with an infrequently cutting restriction enzyme. Large restriction fragments cannot be resolved with conventional agarose gel electrophoresis, which works best for separation of fragments smaller than approximately 30 kb. This limitation is overcome by subjecting the plug with the macrorestricted DNA to electrophoresis in an alternating or pulsing electric field, using an agarose gel as the separation matrix. Since its introduction in 1984 (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0020">20</link>), several different PFGE platforms have been developed (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0022">22</link>). In all formats, the electric field alternates in direction in a predefined manner throughout the course of the electrophoresis. During PFGE, smaller DNA fragments reorient to a directional change in the electrical field faster than larger fragments and therefore move more rapidly through the gel, resulting in separation of the fragments in a size-dependent manner. In some platforms, the time interval during which the electrical current is applied in one direction before it switches to another direction may be changed. Usually, the switch times are set to be short in the beginning of the electrophoresis and are then increased or ramped up during the course of the run (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0019">19</link>).</para>

These so-called variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) regions have been identified in essentially all prokaryotic and eukaryotic species and have been successfully used for subtyping purposes (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0048">48</link>). Slipped-strand mispairing is the molecular model that best explains the variability of short sequence repeats (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0049">49</link>). Stretches of relatively short arrays of repeat units, when being copied by DNA polymerase, may engage in illegitimate base pairing. This forces the polymerase to introduce or delete individual repeat units. The evolutionary clock speeds of different repeat loci are varied; some loci evolve very slowly and others so fast that they are too unstable to be considered epidemiological markers. Therefore, some loci are better suited for epidemiological tracing than others (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0050">50</link>). In the simplest form, VNTR analysis may include only a single locus (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0051">51</link>). When multiple loci are targeted, the technology is often referred to as multiple-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0052">52</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0027s0004s0002s0002p0002">VNTR loci can be identified from a partial or complete reference genome sequence by using free-of-charge software available on the Web, such as Tandem Repeats Finder (<ulink url="http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html">http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html</ulink>).

A typical MLVA protocol involves a multiplex PCR amplification of VNTR targets, followed by fragment sizing using high-resolution capillary electrophoresis (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0054">54</link>). The observed fragment size for each VNTR defines the allele type (either a copy number or an arbitrary number), and the string of allele types constitutes the MLVA type.</para>
          <para id="ch0027s0004s0002s0002p0003">The key application of MLVA is in the field of epidemiological surveillance, where it can be used either alone or in combination with other techniques. Since MLVA targets fast-evolving repeat sequences, the discriminatory power of the method can be quite high for many highly clonal organisms that show low diversity with other methods. For example, an MLVA scheme targeting eight VNTRs was able to differentiate laboratory contaminants and non-outbreak-related strains during the 2001 anthrax outbreak in the United States (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0055">55</link>). Other organisms that show relatively high diversity with other commonly used methods, such as PFGE, may have clonal subpopulations that can be differentiated using MLVA. This is the case for strains belonging to the <emphasis>Salmonella enterica</emphasis> serotype Typhimurium definitive type 104 complex that, until MLVA was introduced, could not be differentiated efficiently by any subtyping method (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0056">56</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0057">57</link>). The downside of targeting fast-evolving genetic elements, such as VNTRs, is that patterns can evolve during an outbreak, complicating case definitions and confounding outbreak investigations (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0059">59</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0027s0004s0002s0002p0004">The advantages of MLVA are its high throughput, low labor intensity, and relatively low per-sample cost. As with many other PCR-based techniques, MLVA is vulnerable to PCR and fragment analysis artifacts, such as minus A, stutter peaks, and fluorescence carryover, which can interfere with the data analysis. The robustness and reproducibility of the method can be affected by instrument- and reagent-related issues, which in turn can have an impact on the portability of the method and interlaboratory data sharing. For example, significant sizing discrepancies are known to occur between different capillary electrophoresis platforms (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0060">60</link>). However, all these issues can be overcome by the proper assay design and optimization, strict adherence to standard operating procedures, and staff training. When different instrument platforms are employed, interlaboratory data sharing can be facilitated by a calibration strain set that is used to normalize the allele types to be comparable to the actual sequenced copy number (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0061">61</link>). The overall main weakness of MLVA is that the assays are typically specific to the organism or even the serotype for which they were developed.

Most CRISPR-containing prokaryotes possess multiple CRISPR clusters (from 2 to 20 loci), each of which is organized as a tandem array of up to 100 short (21 to 47 bp) and highly conserved direct repeats regularly separated by stretches of variable sequences called spacers. Many CRISPR loci are flanked by an AT-rich leader sequence and CRISPR-associated (<emphasis>cas</emphasis>) genes. Spacers are derived from foreign nucleic acids such as phages or plasmids and can bestow on the host bacteria protection from subsequent infection by homologous phages or plasmids (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0066">66</link>). As a bacterial immune system, CRISPRs evolve rapidly in response to changing phage pools. CRISPRs evolve by either deletion or acquisition of units (a direct repeat and a spacer). In the majority of cases, new units are added at one end of the CRISPR adjacent to the leader, whereas motif deletions can occur randomly (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0067">67</link>).

          <para id="ch0027s0004s0003s0001p0001">Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was one of the first DNA sequence-based subtyping methods. It was originally introduced by Maiden et al. (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0080">80</link>) for <emphasis>Neisseria meningitidis</emphasis> as a sequencing-based counterpart to the phenotypic method multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. MLST detects variation due to mutations or recombination by direct nucleotide sequencing of 350- to 600-bp fragments, typically in 5 to 10 housekeeping genes. Innovative technologies, such as electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (MS), can also be used to determine the base composition instead of direct sequencing (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0081">81</link>). When a gene has a base pair change, the new gene sequence is considered a separate allele type. The allele types for each of the gene sequences are combined to define the multilocus sequence type (ST) to characterize the genetic relatedness of the strains. Additionally, MLST results can be analyzed using clustering techniques, such as the eBURST algorithm, which is able to divide isolates based on their STs into clonal complexes (CCs). Using eBURST clustering, isolates with a high level of genetic similarity (such as those sharing six of seven identical alleles) are combined as members of a CC (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0082">82</link>). Thus, isolates in different CCs are less closely related to one another than those within the same CC.</para>
          <para id="ch0027s0004s0003s0001p0002">Since housekeeping genes are under little selective pressure, the accumulation of changes is typically slow. Because the original MLST approach often had too limited a discriminatory power in many organisms for it to be an effective epidemiological tool, other similar systems targeting more rapidly evolving genes, such as virulence-associated genes or genes encoding outer membrane proteins, have been developed. This use of virulence factors in an MLST scheme has been referred to as multi-virulence locus sequence typing. The experience so far has been mixed. Noller et al. (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0083">83</link>) used a combination of seven housekeeping genes (<emphasis>arcA, aroE, dnaE, mdh, gnd, gapA</emphasis>, and <emphasis>pgm</emphasis>) and two membrane protein genes (<emphasis>espA</emphasis> and <emphasis>ompA</emphasis>) to subtype a collection of STEC O157:H7/H– strains with highly diverse PFGE patterns. Overall, they found a lack of diversity in all housekeeping genes as well as in <emphasis>espA</emphasis>, and only minimal diversity in <emphasis>ompA</emphasis>. In contrast, an MLST scheme developed by Zhang et al. (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0084">84</link>) for subtyping <emphasis>Listeria monocytogenes</emphasis> exclusively targeted virulence genes (<emphasis>prfA, inlB</emphasis>, and <emphasis>inlC</emphasis>) and virulence-associated genes (<emphasis>dal, lisR</emphasis>, and <emphasis>clpP</emphasis>) and was able to discriminate between sporadic isolates that were indistinguishable by PFGE. An MLST assay targeting only two genes, the <emphasis>por</emphasis> gene (encoding the outer membrane protein porin) and the <emphasis>tbpB</emphasis> gene (encoding the transferrin-binding protein subunit B), has been proven to be a highly discriminatory method for subtyping of <emphasis>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis> while still being able to accurately identify sexual contact pairs (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0085">85</link>).

Genotyping can be performed on nucleic acids extracted from clinical samples or from a viral isolate that has been passaged in cell culture. The PCR design can be genotype specific, in which the primers will amplify a specific genotype. Alternatively, RT-PCR or PCR with degenerate primers can be used to amplify sequences from a wide range of viral strains.

It was prohibitively expensive, cumbersome, and too time-consuming to sequence whole microbial genomes. The introduction of high-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies resulted in a dramatic decrease in the per-base cost of genomic sequencing over the course of the past decade, with a corresponding increase in the volume of data output. The earliest NGS platforms were based on massively parallel pyrosequencing (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0095">95</link>), and subsequent generations of the technology have either refined this approach or applied new advances such as ligation chemistry (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0096">96</link>), semiconductor-based detection (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0097">97</link>), single-molecule sequencing (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0098">98</link>), and engineered protein nanopores (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0099">99</link>). There are currently four main commercial platforms for NGS, namely, Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher, Guilford, CT), Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA), PacBio Sequel RS II (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA), and Oxford Nanopore (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, United Kingdom). Broadly, these instruments may be categorized into “short-read” and “long-read” platforms. The PacBio Sequel II and Oxford Nanopore are both long-read instruments, which can perform single-molecule, long-read sequencing of insert libraries of &gt;10 kb, generating fewer reads but of significantly greater length. Conversely, short-read instruments, such as the Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms, generate between several million and several billion short sequences between 150 and 400 bp long. Aside from differences in the read length of each platform, there are important differences in sample throughput and multiplexing, sequence output, turnaround time, accuracy, error model, and cost (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0100">100</link>). Each of these factors must be considered in turn when one is selecting an appropriate sequencing strategy for specific objectives and applications. To further complicate matters, as NGS technologies continue to mature, the hardware, software, chemistries, and consumables are all subject to intense development and innovation, with improvements to sample throughput and data quality and continual decreases in per-isolate sequencing costs.</para>

In order to be useful for public health intervention, raw whole-genome sequence data from suspected pathogens must be analyzed, assembled, interpreted, and compared in a timely fashion, so that action may be taken to prevent or minimize disease-associated morbidity and mortality. In the case of a small-outbreak investigation, these data may represent tens of gigabytes of raw sequence, but for large molecular surveillance efforts, such as the PulseNet network for foodborne disease surveillance (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0111">111</link>), the expected raw sequence output could easily surpass hundreds of terabytes of raw genomic sequence data each year.

Since most end users of the technology will be microbiologists in clinical and public health laboratories with limited bioinformatics skills, it is critical that user-friendly and intuitive bioinformatics tools be developed for most sequencing-related surveillance activities.

With sufficient bioinformatics expertise and computational resources, the distillation from reference mappings to a minimum set of high-confidence, parsimoniously informative loci can be completed relatively quickly. Once validated, sets of high-confidence canonical SNPs can be used as targets for the analysis and subtyping of subsequent isolates, or as the basis for high-throughput surveillance assays using real-time PCR or other lower-cost molecular technologies (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0113">113</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0114">114</link>).</para>

This is an important issue with organisms such as <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> or <emphasis>Burkholderia</emphasis>, where mapping to historical reference strains may be inefficient or result in important gaps in genomic coverage and limit the usefulness of whole-genome SNP typing. Similarly, in organisms where critical virulence and diversity factors are carried by plasmids, transposons, or other mobile genetic elements, information about important discriminatory loci may be absent from the available reference sequences and will not be reflected in phylogenomic analyses based on chromosomal sequences. One strategy is to construct composite reference sequences from the microbial chromosome, with major plasmids or transposons of interest appended as a pseudoassembly. While this approach allows the consideration of these extrachromosomal sequences, the limited stability of many mobile genetic elements, and important differences in selective pressure between chromosomal and extrachromosomal alleles, may present important problems. Some organisms also contain mutational hot spots (clustered mutations) from which SNP calls need to be assessed carefully, with the natural error rate of <emphasis>Taq</emphasis> polymerase kept in mind. A final consideration relates primarily to fungi and parasites, where the ploidy (number of sets of chromosomes) of the organism and the presence of complex or heterogeneous alleles may impact the number and quality of high-confidence, discriminatory SNPs that are useful for subtyping and analysis.</para>

          <para id="ch0027s0004s0004s0002p0002">Although gene-based comparisons are emerging as an important strategy for strain typing and for characterizing bacteria and other pathogens using WGS data, current limitations with short-read NGS and bioinformatics analysis may impact their usefulness, particularly for large-scale comparisons. The reliance of these techniques on high-quality genomic assemblies and the consistent prediction or annotation of open reading frames presents challenges in terms of the technical complexity and throughput of the analysis. Draft bacterial genomes may include hundreds of contigs, and the interpretation of complex MLST schemes will invariably be affected by breaks, duplications, or misassemblies of important sequences or reading frames. Differences in assembly or gene prediction algorithms may also impact the throughput of the assay and interpretation of results, and the development of standardized bioinformatics methods and workflows is critical, particularly as sequence databases scale to hundreds or thousands of genomes with many different alleles.</para>

In order to elucidate the genetic relationships among the outbreak isolates, high-quality SNPs were called against the outbreak reference strain (index case), which appears at the far left. A total of nine SNPs were detected among the outbreak isolates. The nine outbreak isolates (2091 through 2098) differ from the index case (Ref_2090) at all nine SNP loci, but share all alleles among themselves. In this case, the putative index case is likely an inappropriate choice of reference, unless an outgroup is needed.

          <para id="ch0027s0004s0004s0002p0003">Gene-based microbial subtyping schemes can target varying number of genes from dozens (ribosomal MLST) to hundreds (expanded MLST) to thousands (core genome MLST [cgMLST] and whole-genome MLST [wgMLST]). The two subtyping schemes with the highest resolution are cgMLST, in which genes present in the vast majority of all strains of a given species are included, and wgMLST, in which all or nearly all genes (core and accessory genes, also known as the pangenome) present in a given species are included. While wgMLST provides the higher resolution that is required for short-term outbreak investigations, cgMLST provides long-term stability, which is desirable if strain type nomenclature is to be implemented. In addition to strain typing information, the presence or absence of specific genes or genetic variants may also be important and useful information for microbial characterization, particularly when used in conjunction with other strain typing methods. Interrogating sets of known resistance and virulence markers can provide important information during an outbreak investigation or response, and these features can often be used to support strain type identification and the prediction of phenotypic properties (e.g., antimicrobial resistance) (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0117">117</link>) or to correlate with transmission dynamics and patient outcomes.</para>

          <para id="ch0027s0004s0004s0003p0001">k-mer-based algorithms have quickly emerged as an important approach to assemble, analyze, and compare large genomic datasets in a computationally efficient manner. In general, these algorithms deconstruct longer genomic sequences or unassembled raw reads into large sets of k-mers, or oligonucleotides of length “k,” for comparison by means of suffix arrays (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0118">118</link>). The k-mers can then be quickly counted, sorted, deduplicated, and compared to other k-mer sequence sets to identify variations (SNPs and indels) that can be used for clustering and comparison (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0119">119</link>). Often, k-mer-based algorithms are an intrinsic first step in downstream sequence analysis or assembly workflows. For example, the SPADes assembler uses multiple rounds of k-mer analyses in order to select and optimize assembly parameters (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0120">120</link>). Sequence repositories, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), have also implemented k-mer-based methods for categorization, characterization, and quality control of submitted sequences. As an example, the NCBI’s Pathogen Detection Project (<ulink url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens</ulink>) uses k-mer-based approaches and other analyses to compare and visualize submitted sequence data in near-real time for organisms that have less than 1,000 isolates in the repository. k-mer-based methods can be used to assess horizontal gene transfer, annotate SNP positions based on a known reference, and earmark missing alleles and evidence of evolutionary convergence, and they are easily adapted to new applications, such as the metagenomic analysis of complex samples (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0119">119</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0121">121</link>). During outbreak investigations, k-mer-based sequence analysis is an excellent tool for initial comparison and clustering of genomes because it provides actionable strain typing information quickly and can be used to select appropriate reference strains for SNP typing, assess the overall quality of sequence data, and guide the application of more resource-intensive downstream bioinformatics analyses, which may take much longer to complete.</para>
          <para id="ch0027s0004s0004s0003p0002">While k-mer trees are often used in conjunction with SNP-based phylogenies, it is important to understand that the two are not functionally equivalent and that there are important tradeoffs for the speed advantages of k-mer-based analyses. Unlike traditional SNP-mapping approaches, which take into consideration the genomic context of the variant position and the underlying sequence quality of the reads that support its identification, k-mer-based SNP analysis focuses on the putative SNP position and the 10 to 12 bases of surrounding sequence, without considering quality scores. These are important limitations which may restrict the ability of k-mer-based methods to reliably detect closely spaced SNPs or indels and may result in limited resilience against low sequence quality or sequencing errors. Even so, k-mer methods have significant advantages in terms of speed and implementation, since they do not require assembly or alignment of sequences and can be equally applied to whole-genome sequence sets and unassembled sets of short reads.</para>

        <para id="ch0027s0004s0005p0001">A DNA microarray is a molecular platform in which a few hundred to thousands of specific DNA oligonucleotides or short sequences (capture molecules) are bound to a matrix. The array is used to detect specific DNA sequences (target sequences) in a test sample of fluorescently labeled DNA, with or without amplification, by hybridization followed by detection of the array-bound test DNA.</para>
        <para id="ch0027s0004s0005p0002">Until relatively recently, DNA microarrays were a compelling, albeit expensive, platform for comprehensive microbial identification and characterization. While DNA microarrays allow the simultaneous interrogation of hundreds of thousands of targets within a given sample, the technology is expensive and rigid and does not scale well for many public health applications. Per-sample cost, sample throughput, and turnaround time are all critical bottlenecks, and even with access to dedicated microarray printing facilities, altering or adjusting the composition or layout of microarrays to meet changing requirements is not trivial. Reproducibility is also an important consideration, since ambiguities in the interpretation of the ratios of hybridization and cross-hybridization to analogous targets are of concern. Despite the availability of bioinformatics tools and standards to compare microarray data (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0122">122</link>), interlaboratory reproducibility studies are largely absent from the literature (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0123">123</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0027s0004s0005p0003">While the use of microarrays themselves is on the decline, a recent trend has seen the adaptation of established amplicon microarray probe sets to newer, more flexible and cost-effective technology platforms, such as NGS amplicon sequencing, multiplex CRISPR panels, or digital droplet PCR. In many cases, primers and probe sets have already undergone extensive validation during array development and can be easily adapted to massively parallel amplicon sequencing approaches, such as Ion Torrent AmpliSeq (ThermoFisher, South San Francisco, CA) or Fluidigm Juno (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA). While these technologies cannot approach the same target density as a planar microarray, at least not at present, they are significantly more flexible and scalable, and they deliver sequence data for hundreds or thousands of targets, which is a clear advantage over qualitative hybridization.</para>

        <para id="ch0027s0004s0006p0001">In recent years, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) systems have become increasingly common in clinical and public health microbiology laboratories throughout the world. In contrast to earlier generations of MS equipment, which were complex, costly, and difficult to maintain, these newer low-profile and benchtop MALDI-TOF MS systems offer simple and standardized workflows for many genus- and species-level microbial identification tasks, with high throughput, accurate and fast results, and a low overall cost per test (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0124">124</link>). While proof-of-concept studies have repeatedly demonstrated the feasibility of MALDI-TOF MS for strain- and subspecies-level identification of select organisms (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0125">125</link>–<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0127">127</link>), standardized or generalizable methods have yet to be developed, and in most cases, the current level of resolution of MALDI-TOF MS, when used alone, remains at the genus or species level. Attempts have been made by some commercial companies to combine MS with other technologies and typing approaches. The Agilent MassCode (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) uses highly multiplexed PCR panels and identifies and subtypes microorganisms through the detection and measurement of cleavable mass tags using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, quadrupole MS (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0128">128</link>). Other platforms, such as the Sequenom MassARRAY (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA), use PCR MALDI-TOF MS to interrogate thousands of SNPs through single-primer base extension and can be used for high-resolution SNP-based strain typing using standardized sets of canonical targets (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0129">129</link>).

        <para id="ch0027s0004s0007p0002">At a local level, molecular and genomic epidemiology is often used for outbreak and cluster investigations, to understand patterns and routes of transmission and guide infection control and public health resources; to monitor environmental, wastewater, and animal sources for important pathogens or transmission risks; to protect vulnerable settings and populations and to better understand the factors leading to severe or unusual illness; and to rapidly detect emerging infectious diseases before they spread.

Ongoing surveillance can help establish baselines for monitoring and guide surveillance strategy. When paired with strong local public health capacity, large-scale molecular surveillance efforts can also help to detect the emergence of clinically important pathogens at a national or international scale; to understand cases with unusual virulence or phenotypic presentation; to better anticipate the disruption of diagnostic, antigenic, or therapeutic targets; and to guide and inform more effective public health policy to safeguard the health of the population.</para>

        <para id="ch0027s0005s0001p0001">Serotyping is a subtyping method in which specific antigens on the surface of microorganisms are detected by antigen-antibody reactions using diagnostic antisera. The method is definitive but only moderately discriminatory. It has nevertheless proven to be extremely useful for epidemiologic classification of a number of pathogens and has for this reason been a mainstay in the surveillance of different infectious diseases for more than 70 years. It is a cumbersome method that requires the availability of high-quality antisera and substantial expertise to perform the assay and interpret the results. More convenient, rapid, and reliable molecular alternatives to serotyping are being developed. These molecular serotyping methods are designed to generate data that are in close or complete agreement with conventional serotyping, in order to not lose the connection to the historical data and to provide the ability to roughly compare results between laboratories, regardless of their progress on transition to routine genomic sequencing.

With the advent of WGS, serotype information can be extracted from the sequence data. One primary method to determine serotype from WGS data is by extracting the sequence data from an isolate for the genes encoding the serotype.

        <para id="ch0027s0005s0002p0001">Cross-neutralization and serologic typing of viruses preceded the routine use of molecular methods by several decades; once it was established that group relatedness of virus preparations could be reliably ascertained by differences in antigenicity, serologic testing became an important standard for typing (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0138">138</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0139">139</link>). While serologic testing is still an essential component of viral characterization, sequence-based molecular epidemiologic approaches are now much more widely used to study viral relatedness and to infer patterns of transmission. The most common approach is to perform sequence analysis on a defined region of the viral genome that contains sufficient diversity from which to produce valid group typing from genetic analyses. Regions and length of these “genotyping windows” vary with each viral species and genotype. Typical genotyping windows include capsid proteins, noncoding hypervariable regions, or any other region offering sufficient group resolution by phylogenetic inference. For many virus groups, new genotypic assignments are designed to allow maximum agreement with serotyping. This is often achieved by sequencing the gene coding for capsid or surface glycoproteins, because these proteins are more antigenic. Another advantage of the use of the capsid region for some viruses is that it is less prone to recombination. For example, the picornavirus VP1 subunit is used for determining over 100 enterovirus types (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0140">140</link>) because the non-capsid-coding region frequently recombines. Hypervariable regions are also useful in typing certain viruses; for example, the M-F intergenic region of measles virus contains considerable intra-genotype diversity; the region is increasingly used to augment phylogenetic resolution alongside sequencing windows in the hemagglutinin (H) and nucleoprotein (N) genes (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0141">141</link>). Increasingly, whole-genome methods are preferred.</para>
        <para id="ch0027s0005s0002p0002">Many viruses are conventionally typed by the genotyping window. For taxonomic purposes, viruses are formally classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) into family, genus, species, and type. For the purpose of molecular epidemiology, viruses can further be distinguished (informally) into clades, genogroups, or clusters by comparison with established reference strains. In particular, RNA viruses have high mutation rates, which increase the amount of sequence variation in the genome (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0142">142</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0143">143</link>).</para>

From a clinical perspective, distinguishing between low- and high-risk genotypes, and the diseases associated with the different types, provides important information for intervention. Genotyping of viral species is a crucial part of investigations into the emergence, evolution, and transmission of disease.</para>

In some cases, these vaccines can cause symptoms that are similar to those caused by infection with wild-type virus. When the risk of exposure to disease is very low, these vaccine reactions can be identified by temporal association with vaccination. However, when vaccination is used as part of an outbreak response, it may be difficult to distinguish vaccine reactions from symptoms caused by the wild-type virus. Since serologic techniques usually lack the sensitivity to distinguish between antibodies directed at the vaccine or the wild-type strain, genetic characterization of the viruses is usually the only means available to clearly classify the case as vaccine associated or due to a wild-type infection. Of course, this approach requires that appropriate specimens for virologic detection be collected from the suspected cases and that sequence information be available for the vaccine strains.</para>
        <para id="ch0027s0005s0003p0002">The availability of molecular methods that can clearly identify vaccine reactions, as described above, has contributed to our knowledge about the safety of live attenuated vaccines. In addition, molecular techniques now play an important role in the post-licensure evaluation of live attenuated viral vaccines. Here, genetic characterization is used to monitor the stability of vaccines in the field and to clearly identify vaccine reactions. In one example, PCR and RFLP analyses were used to monitor the safety of varicella-zoster vaccine by classifying vesicular rash or zoster cases as being associated with wild-type varicella-zoster virus or the Oka vaccine strain (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0144">144</link>). Additionally, some viruses have the capacity to recombine or reassort their genomes, and in these cases, WGS is an important component of molecular epidemiologic studies. The live attenuated strains used in the WHO polio eradication program replicate in the human gut and can be excreted for several weeks after immunization. If the attenuating mutations in the vaccine strains revert, the vaccine may cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in vaccinees or result in transmissible, neurovirulent, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus strains, which have been associated with outbreaks of poliomyelitis (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0145">145</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0146">146</link>).

Rapid detection of measles vaccine reactions that occur during an outbreak response is essential to avoid unnecessary public health interventions. The standard method to identify measles vaccine strains was Sanger sequencing, but more recently, a vaccine-specific RT-PCR assay was developed to identify vaccine reactions in less than 3 hours (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0147">147</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0148">148</link>).</para>

The geographic distribution of strains may affect the efficacy of the vaccines, especially if genetic changes in the pathogen affect antigenicity, replication, or the kinetics of receptor binding. Therefore, for pathogens with highly variable antigenic profiles (e.g., rotavirus and influenza virus), careful monitoring of the strains associated with cases in vaccinated populations is necessary (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0149">149</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0150">150</link>).

Often, subtyping results are the only information available to determine if an outbreak investigation should be initiated. In this situation, the case definition needs to be very specific (i.e., the discriminatory power of the subtyping method needs to be high) in order not to include patients that are not associated with the outbreak as cases, which would confuse the epidemiological investigation. The molecular methods that are most suitable for this purpose are PFGE, MLVA, and highly discriminatory DNA arrays, many of which are currently being replaced by WGS. These methods may be used in conjunction with less discriminatory traditional and molecular methods (e.g., biotyping, serotyping, phage typing, antibiograms, and/or plasmid profiling).</para>
      <para id="ch0027s0006p0002">PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne-disease surveillance, is a prime example of a network performing real-time surveillance of infectious diseases at the community level (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0152">152</link>). In a subtyping network, the choice of method is less important than is the requirement that all participants use the same method, as long as the preferred method has sufficient performance characteristics. For PulseNet, the preferred subtyping method was PFGE for over 20 years, until it was eventually replaced in all laboratories by WGS-based methods (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0112">112</link>). Compared to PFGE, WGS has superior sensitivity and specificity, enabling more efficient outbreak detection and investigation by better distinguishing outbreak cases from sporadic cases (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0153">153</link>). For example, for listeriosis, the number of outbreaks detected in the first 2 years following implementation of WGS in the United States in 2013 increased markedly, and the number of outbreaks that were linked to a contaminated food product increased by more than 100% (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0105">105</link>).</para>

The setting is much smaller in scale and usually attended by a single laboratory, and the outbreaks are often caused by pathogens transmitted from person to person and/or by pathogens that persist in the environment. Strains that are involved in outbreaks transmitted between patients or persistently from the environment often evolve during the outbreak, and variant subtypes may be present at the same time. The methods that are used for community-wide surveillance may also be used for these health care-related outbreaks, and methods that do not show good interlaboratory reproducibility may be used as long as the intralaboratory reproducibility is sufficient. PCR-based methods are cost-efficient for short-term surveillance and to delineate outbreaks that have been detected by phenotypic or other less discriminatory methods (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0154">154</link>–<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0156">156</link>), but will likely be replaced by WGS in the near future.</para>

Given that TB disease can manifest several months to years after TB infection, molecular epidemiology can help outbreak investigations by identifying recently or newly acquired TB infection.

In particular, analysis of the sequence data can help substantiate epidemiologic links between outbreak cases, as well as confirm the source of a virus or suggest a source for cases in which the source was unknown. Transmission can occur in many contexts for highly infectious viruses such as measles virus; source attribution of outbreak cases may depend upon such variables as geography, temporality, vaccination status, or travel history (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0159">159</link>). Molecular techniques have been used to identify the source of the infections when standard case investigations have failed to identify a source (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0160">160</link>). Molecular tests used in outbreak investigations vary for different viruses. Important factors include specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, turnaround time, cost, and ease of execution. Turnaround time is crucial in the rapid response to an outbreak. Many standard methods involve pathogen isolation, which is time-intensive. By contrast, direct detection from clinical samples, by PCR/RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing, has significantly expedited the practice of outbreak investigation; application of new NGS techniques has further provided significant improvements. Direct detection of pathogens from clinical specimens by NGS is increasingly evaluated for sensitivity and turnaround time, having proven useful in recent scale-ups of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and other specific cases (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0161">161</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0162">162</link>).</para>

Strictly speaking, outbreak investigations are source attribution analyses, but the term is more commonly used in a broader sense, encompassing both outbreak-related and sporadic disease. Molecular methods may be used to study the geographic distribution or sources and spread of microbial strains, and this is discussed below.</para>
        <para id="ch0027s0006s0001p0002">Source attribution using microbiological methods is gaining increasing attention, especially in the study of foodborne disease, where it is used to estimate where in the food production chain the largest public health problems originate. Decision makers use these estimates to prioritize where control efforts can be spent most efficiently. A subtyping method that is used for source attribution creates subtypes that are distributed unevenly between the different possible sources of human infection. When this knowledge is combined with information about the distribution of the same subtypes in sick humans and, if available, the rates of human exposure to each source, it is possible to estimate the relative contribution of each source to the burden of human disease (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0164">164</link>).

        <para id="ch0027s0006s0001p0003">The limitation of the model is that it identifies only sources for which there are data available (i.e., if no isolates are included from a potential major source, no estimates for this source will be generated). Subtyping methods used for source attribution do not need to be as discriminatory or reproducible as those used for outbreak investigations, as long as they clearly differentiate isolates from different sources.

Numerous outbreaks of foodborne infections occur each year, and some have been the result of intentional contamination of the food supply (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0173">173</link>). Forensic molecular epidemiology comes into play when regulators and laymen, judges, and lawyers have to decide if an infection (or infections) is a result of criminal action. In principle, criminal microbiological investigations are not different from outbreak investigations, except that in criminal investigations, the link between the infection(s) and its source(s) needs to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. In outbreak investigations, the precautionary principle is often used when deciding on public health actions, since the aim of an outbreak investigation is to stop the outbreak from spreading as soon as possible. This is often in contrast to criminal investigations, where precautionary principle is not used, since an offender is presumed innocent until proven otherwise. Subtyping methods that may quantify the probability that two microbial strains are related are therefore preferred over methods that do not yield direct quantifiable information. Non-target-specific methods are therefore not ideal for criminal investigations, because DNA fragments of the same size may have completely different sequence content. For example, it is not possible to tell from the PFGE pattern if two isolates are identical; hence the use of the term “indistinguishable” for PFGE patterns that cannot be differentiated from each other. In contrast, differences observed with a target-specific method may be quantifiable if the prevalence of the detected alleles is known in the relevant microbial populations.</para>

The greatest utility of these methods is realized for retrospective studies for which panels of sequence data are of sufficient inter-strain diversity to resolve posterior estimates of mathematical parameters controlling the evolution of the dataset. As with all modeled evolutionary systems, the utility of phylogenetic methods is limited by the availability of accurate biochemical (e.g., base substitution mechanisms) or epidemiologic (e.g., reproductive rate) assumptions. Likewise, the viability of modeled inference may be influenced by unknown selection pressures or by inherent biases toward disease severity in the sampled population.</para>

        <para id="ch0027s0007s0003p0002">Molecular characterization of measles viruses has provided a valuable tool for measuring the effectiveness of measles control programs. In general, three patterns of measles genotype distribution have been described. In countries that still have endemic transmission of measles, the majority of cases are caused by several endemic genotypes that are distributed geographically. In these cases, multiple cocirculating lineages within the endemic genotype or genotypes are present. In countries that have eliminated measles, the small numbers of cases are caused by a number of different genotypes that reflect various sources of imported virus and suggest the lack of sustained transmission of an endemic genotype or genotypes. The third pattern occurs in countries or regions that have had very good measles control but are experiencing an increase in the numbers of susceptible individuals because of failure to maintain high rates of vaccination coverage. In this situation, reintroduction of measles usually results in a large outbreak associated with a single genotype of virus with nearly identical sequences (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0160">160</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0196">196</link>).</para>

For example, coronaviruses have the ability to recombine with other coronaviruses as well as to incorporate cellular genes into their genomes (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0197">197</link>). The initial analysis of the complete genome sequence of the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) confirmed that the virus was a novel coronavirus and not a recombinant between previously described coronaviruses. In 2012, rapid WGS of a novel coronavirus causing acute respiratory syndrome in humans (HCoV-EMC or MERS-CoV) showed that the new virus was a new variant, betacoronavirus, that was closely related to a bat coronavirus and more distantly related to SARS-CoV (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0198">198</link>–<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0200">200</link>).

In particular, epidemiologically significant sequence variants were identified using methods that represent the merging of legacy public health data systems with emergent data science technologies. Consensus amplicon protocols for sequencing were developed and widely adopted (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0215">215</link>), and in many countries, consensus sequence data for viral isolates were shared through open sequence repositories such as EpiCoV at the Global Initiative for Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID; <ulink url="https://www.epicov.org">https://www.epicov.org</ulink>), Genbank at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA; <ulink url="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena</ulink>), and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; <ulink url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ulink>).

Challenges inherent to large-scale bioinformatics activities such as this include information volume, along with the high complexity of integration between datasets covering genomic sequences, epidemiology, clinical outcomes, and other relevant contextual information. A number of countries mounted large sequencing consortia and worked together to standardize and improve sequencing and bioinformatic performance, to standardize metadata capture, labeling, and nomenclature, and to build shared bioinformatic platforms and infrastructure that could be adapted to a range of microbial surveillance needs (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0216">216</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0217">217</link>).

This has led to numerous studies in which an inappropriate method was used to study an organism (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0001">1</link>). When selecting a subtyping method, one should first consider the epidemiological context in which it is going to be used (i.e., what is the question that the typing data should answer). A method that is appropriate for long-term surveillance may not be appropriate for a short-term investigation of a health care-related outbreak. Careful consideration should also be given to the genetic makeup of the target organisms, including the clonality, mode of transmission, and outbreak potential. In the near future, method selection might become less of an issue, because WGS, due to its universality and flexibility, likely will be used for almost all molecular epidemiological applications.</para>

The simplest explanation for a genetically monomorphic pathogen is that the population size of the ancestors of all extant organisms was so strongly reduced during a recent bottleneck that genetic diversity was abolished. One possibility that can result in such a bottleneck is a crucial genetic event that happened only once, such as a change in ecological niche due to the acquisition of two plasmids by the progenitor of <emphasis>Yersinia pestis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0221">221</link>). In the case of STEC O157, it has been suggested that clonality can be explained by source-sink evolution dynamics (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0222">222</link>–<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0224">224</link>). According to this theory, mutations in microbes that reside mainly in reservoirs (the source, e.g., cattle) in which they are not pathogens confer on a small subset a phenotype that results in injury to an accidental host (the sink, e.g., humans). Alternatively, it has been argued that a strong selective advantage conferred by a mutation enabled certain strains of STEC O157 to flourish in cattle, making them more available for spillover into humans (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0224">224</link>). On the other hand, some host-restricted pathogens, such as <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> serotype Typhi, are under relatively little selection pressure from their host or environment and therefore do not diversify through point mutations, recombination, or acquisition of new sequences (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0225">225</link>). Finally, a sampling bias may also contribute to the appearance of population clonality. Sampling from one part of the phylogenetic tree will overlook much of the variation present in the population and collapse all isolates outside the studied population into a single type (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0226">226</link>).

This includes validation using a population of strains and isolates that originate from the epidemiological context in which the method is going to be applied. Techniques that will be applied in local investigations need to be validated on a strain collection from the same locality, whereas methods that will be used for community-wide surveillance need to be validated on a collection of strains reflecting the diversity in the whole community. When a subtyping method that has been validated for use in one given epidemiological context is to be used in a different one, it may be necessary to validate it in the new context before it is implemented. This supplementing validation may not need to be as thorough as the original validation, depending on how similar the two contexts are.</para>
      <para id="ch0027s0010p0002">Unlike methods developed in isolation (for use by one laboratory), methods to be used in multiple laboratories for the generation of data archived in reference libraries must be particularly carefully tested, evaluated, and validated.

Additionally, before the new method is implemented, a quality assurance and quality control program needs to be established.</para>
      <para id="ch0027s0010p0003">The goal of the initial development is to identify the optimal conditions or parameters to ensure that the protocol is robust and reproducible and that it generates highly discriminatory and epidemiologically concordant data on all strains.

      <para id="ch0027s0010p0004">During the internal validation, the method is tested by individuals not involved in the method development, in order to ascertain the robustness of the protocol in the hands of laboratorians with no prior experience with it. The panel of test isolates is expanded to include the full genetic diversity of the study population and should contain both sporadic and outbreak-related isolates in order to test the true discriminatory power and the epidemiological concordance of the method. Duplicate isolates of the same strain and multiple isolates from single-source outbreaks need to be included to evaluate the reproducibility and stability of the method. The test panel will usually contain 100 to 500 isolates. If a gold standard subtyping method already exists for the organism, it may be possible to use a collection of strains of known subtype to validate the new method and assess its performance against existing methods.</para>
      <para id="ch0027s0010p0005">During the external validation, the robustness and portability of the method are further tested, typically by 5 to 10 external partner laboratories, ideally with different levels of subtyping expertise and access to different types or brands of equipment and reagents. The assay is evaluated using 10 to 50 isolates selected by the laboratory that developed the method. The interlaboratory reproducibility of the method is also assessed during this phase. Sometimes the external validation is further expanded to include prospective or retrospective testing of up to 50 isolates from each laboratory’s own collection.</para>

At a minimum, subtyping should be performed only by personnel trained in working with the procedure, and a written standard operating procedure should be in place. In order to detect procedural failures, quality control measures, such as quantification of the DNA template or DNA sequencing library and positive and negative control samples for assays involving PCR amplification, should be included in the routine workflow. For reference library subtyping systems involving a network of laboratories, participation in an external quality assessment (EQA) program that includes an initial certification and annual proficiency testing is mandatory. An EQA program should encompass both the laboratory and the data analysis procedures (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0230">230</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0231">231</link>).</para>

Despite the broad utility of NGS in pathogen detection, the technique can be prone to contamination from sample handling, laboratory procedures, reagent contamination, run-to-run contamination, and within-run barcode “bleed-over.” For example, some Illumina MiSeq platform users experiencing assay-to-assay contamination of sequence data can alleviate or completely resolve this issue by performing a hypochlorite line wash between sequence runs. In addition, sequencing high-titer targets along with low-titer targets in the same sequencing assay could cause bleed-over of reads from the former to the latter. Even laboratory reagents can be a source of contamination. A small DNA virus that was initially detected in hepatitis patients (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0232">232</link>) was the result of contamination in the silica column used during nucleic acid extraction (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0233">233</link>). In addition, some commercial RT preparations can harbor murine retrovirus RNA, likely originating from the manufacturing process (T. Ng, unpublished data).</para>

      <para id="ch0027s0011p0001">One of the cornerstones of molecular epidemiology is the assumption that the biological relatedness of microorganisms observed by subtyping reflects epidemiological relatedness. However, it is well known that this correlation is far from perfect, and for that reason, subtyping information can never stand alone. Whenever one is interpreting a biological subtyping “match,” it is critical to ask the question: how does this match fit with all other information available? One must consider the epidemiological context and other data, such as associated demographic and epidemiological information, as well as other subtyping information (e.g., biochemical reaction profiles, serotype, phage type, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and presence of virulence factors). Reliance on a single parameter for characterization should be avoided whenever possible. Knowledge about the subtyping method, including the quality of the data, diversity of the organism, and the history of the subtypes encountered, should also be considered (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0236">236</link>).</para>

It is therefore important to know the nature of these artifacts in order to recognize and correct them. In this, the role of the database curator is extremely important.

In PCR-based methods, such as RAPD and rep-PCR, differences in band intensities are a huge problem, and in MLVA, PCR, and fragment analysis, artifacts such as minus A, stutter peaks, and fluorescence carryover can confuse data interpretation (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0237">237</link>). Sanger sequence trace files should be routinely checked for quality either manually or using software (e.g., Phred/Phrap [<ulink url="http://www.phrap.org">http://www.phrap.org</ulink>]).

While the process of documenting protocols, performance measures, controls, and competency assessment for laboratory-based components of these protocols is generally well understood, these assays also require significant bioinformatic infrastructure and workforce expertise, customized open-source and/or proprietary software analysis pipelines, and access to high-performance computing resources, data management, and specialized reference databases that make quality management frameworks far more complicated to implement and maintain. Recently, a number of different expert workgroups have been established to help define quality management systems in the context of NGS-based surveillance and reference testing and the implications for regulatory and laboratory accreditation. Many of the basic recommendations and requirements are generalizable between laboratories and can be readily adapted to different pathogen testing and analysis workflows, making these discussions an important first step in implementing reproducible genomic methods and best practices for a wide range of public health laboratory applications and routine use cases (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0243">243</link>–<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0246">246</link>).

As NGS becomes more prominent as a reference testing strategy, this is certain to be an important consideration for many laboratories.

Large databases should provide sufficient data to make reasonable determinations of diversity. If an organism displays little diversity, one should be cautious in assuming that closely related patterns, or even indistinguishable patterns, indicate a high likelihood that they originate from a common source. In this case, additional data from other typing methods and other available information should be considered. If the organism shows substantial diversity, one must still consider whether there are clonal subpopulations within a nonclonal organism.

        <para id="ch0027s0011s0003p0001">If the epidemiological setting from which the isolates are derived appears to be a point source outbreak without continued transmission, only very minor differences are likely to be observed, because the outbreak strain has very little time to undergo genetic changes. In contrast, when there is ongoing transmission—such as prolonged hospital or community outbreaks, with strains being passed from person to person, or zoonotic outbreaks, with strains being passed from animal to animal before spilling over to humans—more variability should be expected. Additionally, the amount of variation seen during an outbreak will depend on the stability of the genetic markers targeted by the typing method. Fast-evolving genetic markers, such as VNTRs, tend to change slightly even during shorter outbreaks (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0058">58</link>). During investigations of known outbreaks, it is fairly easy and often helpful to designate patterns that differ slightly from the primary outbreak pattern as subpatterns or variants. However, during surveillance for cluster or outbreak detection, accepting such variations may mislead the epidemiological investigation (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0249">249</link>), especially if one of the variants represents a common pattern.</para>
        <para id="ch0027s0011s0003p0002">It is also important to consider how the laboratory results fit together with the epidemiologic and environmental investigations. The fact that common subtypes exist for many organisms demonstrates that indistinguishable subtypes alone do not unequivocally prove an epidemiologic connection. It is always possible that two individuals were infected with the same strain from different sources. On the other hand, clearly differing subtypes do not prove that isolates are epidemiologically unrelated, since multiple strains can be associated with the same outbreak (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0250">250</link>) and some strains contain genetic elements (e.g., prophages) which are incorporated in the genome in an unstable manner and therefore may affect the subtype of different colonies picked from the same pure culture of the organism (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0251">251</link>). For this reason, when high-resolution subtyping methods such as hqSNP analysis are used, it is advisable to exclude mobile genetic elements and repeat regions from the analysis, because they may introduce phylogenetic noise into the investigation (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0252">252</link>). With analysis methods that utilize WGS data, such as hqSNP and wgMLST, setting thresholds for relatedness is not always straightforward, and utilizing a hierarchical method for cluster detection may be beneficial (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0105">105</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0253">253</link>, <link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0254">254</link>).</para>

PulseNet USA was established in 1996 (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0023">23</link>), and similar networks later followed in Canada, the Asia Pacific region, Latin America, the Middle East, and Europe, and most recently in Africa (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0261">261</link>) (<ulink url="https://pulsenetinternational.org">https://pulsenetinternational.org</ulink>). Historically, participating PulseNet laboratories performed standardized PFGE protocols on all foodborne bacterial isolates obtained from clinical, food, and environmental specimens. PFGE gel patterns were then analyzed locally using highly customized software and uploaded to the central databases for each region via the Internet. There, database managers confirmed the quality of the patterns, named them according to a standardized naming convention, and compared them against the patterns submitted to the database within the previous 60 days (or 120 days for <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis>).</para>
      <para id="ch0027s0013p0003">Starting in 2018, most PulseNet USA and PulseNet International laboratories began to transition to genomic sequence-based analysis, with most labs completing the transition by 2019. As before, participating laboratories perform WGS on all foodborne organisms they receive from clinical, food, and environmental specimens in real time. The WGS data are analyzed on a local computer cluster or in the cloud, where they are evaluated for quality, reassembled and annotated from raw reads, and subjected to a series of organism-specific analyses, including allele calling for core genome MLST. A single linkage tree is generated from the cgMLST data, and a hierarchical name, called an allele code, is assigned. Isolates that are closely genetically related share multiple digits of the allele code (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0025">25</link>). The epidemiologists are alerted if a new cluster of closely genetically related isolates is detected. Until now, much of the work in PulseNet International has focused on establishing the infrastructure of the network, but eventually each regional network will be able to log on to the server of any other international network, query the databases for matches to pathogen subtypes of interest, and, if matches are found, access the epidemiologic information on matching isolate patterns (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0261">261</link>). Such collaboration is already taking place between PulseNet USA and PulseNet Canada. PulseNet International is in the process of replacing traditional reference characterization methods, such as serotyping, virulence and antibiotic resistance profiling, and PFGE subtyping, with WGS. Their vision is to use standardized cgMLST methods to extract reference and subtyping information from the sequences utilizing curated allele and strain nomenclature databases housed in the public domain (<link linkend="ch0027s0013s0002li0112">112</link>).
