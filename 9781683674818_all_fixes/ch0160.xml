      <para id="ch0160s0000p0002">Routine diagnostic parasitology generally includes laboratory procedures designed to detect organisms within clinical specimens by using morphological criteria rather than culture, biochemical tools, and/or physical growth characteristics<anchor id="ch0160s0000a0002"/>(<anchor id="ch0160s0000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0160s0000a0010">Table 1</link>). Parasite identification is frequently based on bright-field-microscopic analysis of concentrated and/or stained preparations. Small organisms often require high magnification, such as with oil immersion (×1,000). Furthermore, new commercial test kits designed especially for detection of DNA or antigens (e.g., coproantigens of <emphasis>Giardia duodenalis</emphasis> [also called <emphasis>Giardia intestinalis</emphasis> or <emphasis>Giardia lamblia</emphasis>], <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Entamoeba histolytica</emphasis> [<anchor id="ch0160s0000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0160s0000a0018">Table 2</link>] or circulating <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> antigens in blood) have expanded the methodological repertoire. In addition to methods for direct parasite detection (morphology analysis, antigen testing, and nucleic acid amplification tests [NAAT]), methods for indirect detection of parasite infections demonstrating specific antibodies to a variety of native or recombinant parasite antigens have been developed and made commercially available (<anchor id="ch0160s0000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0160s0000a0025">Table 3</link>). Diagnostic techniques are available to detect a large range of protozoan and helminth species in different clinical specimens. An important precondition for reliable diagnostic results is the proper collection, processing, and examination of clinical specimens. Based on the biology of the parasites and the procedural features of the tests, multiple specimens must often be submitted and examined before the suspected organism(s) is found and its identity is confirmed or a suspected infection can be excluded.</para>

        <para id="ch0160s0000p0003">Various collection methods are available for specimens suspected of containing parasites or parasitic elements (<anchor id="ch0160s0000a0007"/><link linkend="ch0160s0000a0041">Tables 4</link> to <anchor id="ch0160s0000a0008"/><link linkend="ch0160s0000a0074">7</link>) (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0025">1</link>–<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0031">7</link>). When collection methods are selected, the decision should be based on a thorough understanding of the value and limitations of each. The final laboratory results are based on parasite recovery and identification and depend on the initial handling of the specimen. Unless the appropriate specimens are properly collected and processed, these infections may not be detected. Therefore, specimen rejection criteria have become much more important for all diagnostic microbiology procedures. Diagnostic laboratory results based on improperly collected specimens may require inappropriate expenditures of time and supplies and mislead the physician. As a part of any continuous quality improvement program for the laboratory, the generation of test results must begin with stringent criteria for specimen acceptance or rejection. In addition, diagnostic laboratories should provide clear information on preanalytical requirements to the physician.</para>
        <para id="ch0160s0000p0004">All fresh specimens should be handled carefully, since each specimen represents a potential source of infectious material. Proper training of laboratory personnel is mandatory. Safety precautions should include personal protective equipment; proper labeling of reagents; specific areas designated for specimen handling (fume hoods to reduce chemical exposure or biological safety cabinets may be necessary under certain circumstances, such as parasite cultures); proper containers for centrifugation; acceptable discard policies; appropriate policies of no eating, drinking, or smoking in work areas; and, if applicable, correct techniques for organism culture and/or animal inoculation. Appropriate biosafety precautions should be followed; this is particularly important when blood and other body fluids are being handled (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0032">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0160s0000li0033">9</link>). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided additional guidelines for processing specimens when hemorrhagic fever viruses, such as Ebola virus, are suspected (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0034">10</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0160s0000p0005">Collection of stools for parasite detection should always be performed before barium is used for radiological examination. Stool specimens containing the opaque, chalky sulfate suspension of barium are unacceptable for examination, and intestinal protozoa may be undetectable for 5 to 10 days after barium is given to the patient. Certain substances and medications also interfere with the detection of intestinal protozoa, including mineral oil, bismuth, antibiotics (metronidazole and tetracyclines), antimalarial agents, and nonabsorbable antidiarrheal preparations. After administration of any of these compounds, parasites may not be recovered for a week to several weeks. Therefore, specimen collection should be delayed for 5 to 10 days or at least 2 weeks after barium or antibiotics, respectively, are administered (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0025">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0160s0000li0026">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0160s0000li0035">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0160s0000li0036">12</link>).

      <para id="ch0160s0000p0006">Fecal specimens should be collected in clean, wide-mouthed containers; often, a waxed cardboard or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid is selected for this purpose. The specimens should not be contaminated with water or urine, because water may contain free-living organisms that can be mistaken for human parasites, and urine may destroy motile organisms. Stool specimen containers should be placed in plastic bags when transported to the laboratory for testing. If postal delivery services are used, any diagnostic specimens must be packed according to national or international rules (e.g., labeling with UN code 3373; three-container approach). Specimens should be identified with the patient’s name and identification number, the physician’s name, and the date and time the specimen was collected. The specimen must also be accompanied by a request form indicating which laboratory procedures should be performed. In addition to the presumptive diagnosis and travel history, the state of U.S. residence may be helpful information (e.g., if<emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> is being considered in the differential diagnosis) and should accompany the test request. In some situations, it may be necessary to contact the physician for additional patient history.</para>

      <para id="ch0160s0000p0007">In the past, it has been recommended that a normal examination for stool parasites before therapy include three specimens. The use of three specimens, collected as outlined above, has also been recommended for posttherapy examinations. However, patients who have received treatment for a protozoan infection should be checked 3 to 4 weeks after therapy, and those who have been treated for<emphasis>Taenia</emphasis> infections should be checked 5 to 6 weeks after therapy. In many cases, the posttherapy specimens are not collected, often as a cost containment measure; if the patient becomes symptomatic again, additional specimens can be submitted (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0027">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0160s0000li0028">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0160s0000p0008">Although some recommend collection of only one or two specimens, there are differences of opinion regarding this approach. It has also been suggested that three specimens be pooled and examined as a single specimen; again, this approach is somewhat controversial. However, physicians should be aware that the probability of detecting clinically relevant parasites in a single stool specimen may be as low as 50 to 60%, but the probability of detection is &gt;95% if three samples are examined (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0028">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0160s0000p0009">If a series of three specimens is collected, they should be submitted on separate days. If possible, the specimens should be submitted every other day; otherwise, the series of three specimens should be submitted within no more than 10 days. If a series of six specimens is requested, the specimens should also be collected on separate days or within no more than 14 days (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0025">1</link>). Many organisms, particularly the intestinal protozoa, do not appear in the stool in consistent numbers on a daily basis, and the series of three specimens is considered the minimum for an adequate examination. Multiple specimens from the same patient should not be submitted on the same day. One possible exception would be a patient who has severe, watery diarrhea, in whom any organisms present might be missed because of a tremendous dilution factor related to fluid loss. These specimens should be accepted only after consultation with the physician. It is also not recommended that the three specimens be submitted one each day for 3 consecutive days; however, use of this collection time frame would not be cause to reject the specimens.</para>

      <para id="ch0160s0000p0014">Fresh specimens are mandatory for the recovery of motile trophozoites (amebae, flagellates, or ciliates). The protozoan trophozoite stage is normally found in cases of diarrhea; the intestinal tract contents move through the system too rapidly for cyst formation to occur. Once the stool specimen is passed from the body, trophozoites do not encyst but may disintegrate if not examined or preserved within a short time after passage. However, most helminth eggs and larvae, coccidian oocysts, and microsporidial spores (the microsporidia are now classified as fungi; additional information can be found in the mycology section) survive for extended periods. Liquid specimens should be examined within 30 min of passage, not 30 min from the time they reach the laboratory. If meeting this general recommendation is not possible, the specimen should be placed in one of the available fixatives (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0026">2</link>). Soft (semiformed) specimens may have a mixture of protozoan trophozoites and cysts and should be examined within 1 h of passage; again, if this time frame is not possible, fixatives should be used. Immediate examination of formed specimens is not as critical; in fact, if the specimen is examined any time within 24 h after passage, the protozoan cysts should still be intact. The trophozoite stage of <emphasis>Dientamoeba fragilis</emphasis> has also been recovered from formed stool.</para>

      <para id="ch0160s0000p0015">If there are delays from the time of specimen passage until examination in the laboratory, the use of stool fixative should be considered. To preserve protozoan morphology and prevent the continued development of some helminth eggs and larvae, the stool specimens can be placed in fixative either immediately after passage (by the patient or hospital staff, using a collection kit). Several fixatives are available; however, regardless of the fixative selected, adequate mixing of the specimen and preservative is mandatory. Specimens preserved in stool fixatives should be stored at room temperature. It is also important to use the correct ratio of stool and fixative to ensure proper fixation. Commercial vials are marked with a “fill-to” line for the addition of stool to the container.</para>
      <para id="ch0160s0000p0016">Historically, a formalin vial and a fixative vial containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were used for collection; however, there are currently many fixative options, including one-vial and two-vial combinations. When selecting an appropriate fixative, one should keep in mind that a permanent stained smear is mandatory for a complete examination for parasites (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0025">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0160s0000li0026">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0160s0000li0033">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0160s0000li0035">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0160s0000li0038">141</link>) (see <ulink url="ch0161#ch0161s0001">chapter 138</ulink>). The fixative must be compatible with the kit or the method selected. It is also important to remember that disposal regulations for compounds containing mercury are becoming stricter; each laboratory must check applicable regulations to help determine fixative options.</para>

        <para id="ch0160s0000p0017">Formalin is an all-purpose fixative appropriate for helminth eggs and larvae and for protozoan cysts. Two concentrations are commonly used: 5%, which is recommended for preservation of protozoan cysts, and 10%, which is recommended for helminth eggs and larvae. Although 5% is often recommended for all-purpose use, most commercial manufacturers provide 10%, which is more likely to kill all helminth eggs. To help maintain organism morphology, the formalin can be buffered with sodium phosphate buffers (i.e., neutral formalin). Selection of specific formalin formulations is at the user’s discretion. Aqueous formalin permits the examination of the specimen as a wet mount only, a technique much less accurate than a stained smear for the identification of intestinal protozoa.</para>

However, with other stains (those listed above, in addition to some of the “rapid” blood stains), the organisms are detectable on the blood films. The use of blood collected with anticoagulant (rather than fresh) has direct relevance to the morphology of malaria organisms seen in peripheral blood films. If the blood smears are prepared after more than 1 h, stippling may not be visible, even if the correct pH buffers are used. Also, if blood is kept at room temperature (with the stopper removed), the male microgametocyte may exflagellate and fertilize the female macrogametocyte, and development continues within the tube of blood (as it would in the mosquito host). The ookinete may actually resemble a<emphasis>Plasmodium falciparum</emphasis> gametocyte. The microgametocyte may resemble spirochetes; white blood cells serve as the internal quality control for every blood film; if the leukocytes exhibit acceptable morphology, parasites present will also be acceptable per staining and morphology characteristics.</entry>

The organism morphology is not quite as sharp after staining as that of organisms originally fixed in solutions containing mercuric chloride. The pairing of SAF-fixed material with iron hematoxylin staining provides better organism morphology than does staining of SAF-fixed material with trichrome (personal observation). Although SAF has a long shelf life and is easy to prepare, the smear preparation technique may be a bit more difficult for less experienced personnel who are not familiar with fecal specimen techniques.

        <para id="ch0160s0000p0043">Several manufacturers now have single-vial stool collection systems, similar to SAF or modified Schaudinn’s fixative (zinc base) methods (Unifix, zinc PVA [Z-PVA], and EcoFix). From the single vial, both the concentration and permanent stained smear can be prepared. It is also possible to perform immunoassays from some of these vials. Ask the manufacturer about all diagnostic capabilities (concentration, permanent stained smear, immunoassay procedures, and molecular analyses) and for specific information indicating that there are no formula components that would interfere with any of the methods. Like the zinc substitutes, these formulas are proprietary (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0044">20</link>). New formulations continue to be developed, and some of them appear to adhere to the slide without the use of albumin or PVA (which may interfere with immunoassays). These formulations may be used to perform concentrations and some of the immunoassays and to prepare permanent stained smears. There are several commercially available single-vial fixatives for stool specimens that are mercury and formalin free, preserve morphology, and alleviate many disposal and monitoring problems encountered by laboratories. A single-vial fixative that is mercury, formalin, and PVA free is also commercially available.</para>

These parasites include <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Babesia</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Trypanosoma</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Toxoplasma gondii</emphasis>, and microfilariae. Although some organisms may be motile in fresh whole blood, species identification is normally accomplished from the examination of permanent stained thin and/or thick blood films. Blood films can be prepared from fresh whole blood collected with no anticoagulants, anticoagulated blood, or sediment from the various concentration procedures. The request for blood for thick and thin films is considered a “stat” request (ordering, collection, processing, examination, and reporting). If a heparin tube is received in the laboratory, do not reject the specimen; continue testing with thick and thin blood films and reorder an EDTA tube.</para>
      <para id="ch0160s0000p0059">Unless it is certain that well-prepared slides will be available, it is necessary to request a tube of fresh blood (EDTA anticoagulant is preferred) and prepare the smears. The tube should be filled with blood to provide the proper blood/anticoagulant ratio. For detection of intracytoplasmic inclusions (e.g., stippling), the smears should be prepared within 1 h after the specimen is drawn. After that time, stippling may not be visible on stained films; however, the overall organism morphology will still be excellent. Most laboratories routinely use commercially available blood collection tubes; preparation of EDTA collection tubes in-house is neither necessary nor cost-effective.</para>

Microfilariae may be missed if the entire thin film is not examined. Microfilariae are rarely present in large numbers, and frequently, only a few organisms are present in each thin film preparation. Microfilariae are commonly found at the edges of the thin film or at the feathered end of the film because they are carried to these sites during spreading of the blood. The feathered end of the film, where the erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) are drawn out into a single, distinctive layer of cells, should be examined for the presence of malaria parasites and trypanosomes.

Because people tend to scan blood films at different rates, it is important to examine a minimum of 300 oil immersion fields. If something suspicious has been seen in the thick film, the number of fields examined on the thin film is often considerably greater than 300. The request for blood film examination should always be considered a stat procedure, with all reports (negative as well as positive) being relayed by telephone to the physician as soon as possible.

Mouse inoculation with amniotic fluid was used in the past for diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis; this method, however, has mostly been replaced by NAAT.</para>
      <para id="ch0160s0000p0093">Xenodiagnosis is a technique that uses the arthropod host as an indicator of infection. Uninfected reduviid bugs are allowed to feed on the blood of a patient who is suspected of having Chagas’ disease (<emphasis>T. cruzi</emphasis> infection). Beginning 30 to 60 days after feeding, feces from the bugs are examined over a 3-month time frame for the presence of developmental stages of the parasite, which are found in the hindgut of the vector. This type of procedure is used primarily in South America for fieldwork, and the appropriate bugs are raised in various laboratories specifically for this purpose.</para>

      <para id="ch0160s0000p0094">The detection of parasite-specific antigen is indicative of current infection. Immunoassays are generally simple to perform. Some formats allow the processing of large numbers of tests at one time, thereby reducing overall costs; others are specially designed for rapid individual diagnoses. A major disadvantage of antigen detection is that in most cases the method can detect only a single pathogen at one time. Therefore, additional parasitological examinations must be performed to detect other parasitic pathogens. The current commercially available immunoassays for the detection of intestinal protozoa have excellent sensitivity and specificity compared with routine microscopy (<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0056">32</link>–<link linkend="ch0160s0000li0059">35</link>). Specific ordering approaches using both immunoassays and routine O&amp;P examinations are listed in <link linkend="ch0160s0000a0064">Table 6</link>. Rapid tests for the diagnosis of malaria should be used only in parallel with the examination of thick and thin blood smears.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0160s0000a0112"/>
      <para id="ch0160s0000p0095">Molecular testing is becoming more readily available for most diagnostic laboratories. Assays for<emphasis>T. vaginalis, E. histolytica, E. histolytica</emphasis> complex, <emphasis>Giardia, Cyclospora</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> spp. are commercially available and approved by the FDA. Panels are available that can test simultaneously for multiple gastrointestinal pathogens, including bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. As with antigen detection, only selected pathogens can be detected, and other pathogens may be missed. Specific automated panels are listed in <ulink url="ch0162#ch0162s0001">chapter 139</ulink>. Some of these panels are currently available in Europe.</para>
      <para id="ch0160s0000p0096">Nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests (with their inherent potential for highly efficient and specific amplification of DNA) have been developed for almost all species of parasites. However, only a few are routinely used in diagnostic settings. The main reason for their minor role in diagnostic parasitology is the fact that many parasite stages can be adequately diagnosed using established, more traditional techniques (microscopy, detection of antigens and antibodies, and<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> cultivation) that are generally less expensive and technically less demanding than NAAT. Therefore, diagnosis by NAAT is of great value in cases in which these techniques are insufficient, that is, in cases in which (i) the immune response is not informative (e.g., acute infections, short-term follow-up after therapy, and congenital infections), (ii) high sensitivity is needed because of low parasite levels (e.g., cutaneous leishmaniasis), or (iii) morphologically indistinguishable organisms need to be identified (e.g., <emphasis>Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar</emphasis> and eggs of taeniid tapeworms).</para>
      <para id="ch0160s0000p0097">Diagnostic NAAT may become more widespread when simple, fully standardized (commercial) test kits are available and costs are reduced through the implementation of pre- and post-NAAT automated techniques. Furthermore, it is possible not only to detect and identify but also to quantify organisms and determine their genotypes by analyzing the diagnostic NAAT product. Indeed, NAAT coupled with genetic characterization is already widely used in parasitology to address questions such as those concerning parasite host range and host specificity, means of transmission, and molecular epidemiology. Such genotyping applications should increase in the future with increasing knowledge of the relationship between genetic variation in parasites and features such as virulence or drug resistance. An important limitation of NAAT-based diagnosis is the fact that sensitivity dramatically decreases with material stored for more than 1 day in formalin due to the fragmentation (fragment length of a few hundred base pairs) of the DNA. However, by selecting primers that yield products as short as possible, sensitivity might be reasonably high. Therefore, it seems to be the best choice to avoid formalin fixation if NAAT analyses have to be considered.<anchor id="ch0160s0000a0113"/> Many of these tests are highly specific and sensitive and are becoming more widely used for parasite detection; however, cost remains an issue.
