      <para id="ch0056s0001p0001">Members of the genera<emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> are most often associated with infections of the gastrointestinal (GI) and urinary tracts, but may also cause more severe systemic or invasive infections including pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. This chapter provides an overview of each genus and discusses key aspects of taxonomy, epidemiology, and virulence, along with culture-dependent and culture-independent methodologies for the identification and classification of species within these genera. In addition, recent trends in antimicrobial resistance patterns and updates to recommended susceptibility testing modalities and interpretive criteria are discussed to understand the current best practice for treating active infections.</para>

      <para id="ch0056s0002p0001">The genus<emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> is taxonomically located within the order <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>, family <emphasis>Enterobacteriaceae. Escherichia coli</emphasis> is the type species and was first described in 1884 during studies of the intestinal microbiota of neonates. Five additional species—<emphasis>Escherichia albertii, Escherichia fergusonii, Escherichia vulneris, Escherichia hermannii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Escherichia blattae</emphasis>—were initially assigned to the genus (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0002">2</link>); however, <emphasis>E. blattae</emphasis> has since been reclassified as <emphasis>Shimwellia blattae</emphasis> and removed from the genus (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0003">3</link>). In recent years, two additional novel species of <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> have been proposed based on genetic analysis: <emphasis>Escherichia marmotae</emphasis>, originally isolated from fecal samples obtained from wild marmots in China (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0004">4</link>), and <emphasis>Escherichia ruysiae</emphasis>, which has been isolated from human stool but was previously assigned to an unnamed <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> lineage (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0005">5</link>). Both species are now formally recognized taxonomically, bringing the current number of species within the genus <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> to seven. Historically, <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> species were differentiated from other <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> and each other based on phenotypic properties such as biochemical reactivity and physical characteristics such as motility and colony pigmentation. However, similarities in physical and biochemical properties between species hinder accurate phylogeny and identification when used as the sole basis for characterization of isolates (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0006">6</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0002p0002">Molecular techniques such as G+C content analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, and nucleic acid sequence analysis have enabled more accurate phylogenetic studies. The G+C content among<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> falls in a narrow range between 48 and 52%, which is similar to that of <emphasis>Salmonella, Shigella</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Erwinia</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0008">8</link>). Genomes of <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> species range from 4.5 Mbp to 5.7 Mbp in size and encode 4,157 to 5,315 genes (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0009">9</link>). DNA-DNA hybridization that assesses large regions of the bacterial chromosome can provide species-level resolution within the genus. A threshold of &gt;70% nucleic acid association between isolates has been established as defining a species (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0010">10</link>). Association values among a diverse collection of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> isolates of human and animal origin ranged from 85 to 99% (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0007">7</link>). Among <emphasis>Escherichia, E. coli</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. fergusonii</emphasis> share the highest association value (60–65%), while association values between <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. hermannii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. vulneris</emphasis>, range from 31 to 45% (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0011">11</link>). In contrast, isolates of <emphasis>Shigella boydii, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Shigella sonnei</emphasis> exhibit association values of 80 to 89% with <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, supporting a close taxonomic relationship between these genera (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0012">12</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0002p0003">The close taxonomic relationship between<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> is also apparent when utilizing nucleic acid sequence-based methods. Targeted and whole-genome sequence analysis indicates a closer relationship between <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> than between <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and other <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> species (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0013">13</link>–<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0015">15</link>). Phylogeny based on seven conserved “housekeeping” genes resulted in clusters of each <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species interspersed among <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> serotypes, while other <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> species were more distantly related (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0009">9</link>). Genetic analysis based on highly conserved <emphasis>tuf</emphasis> (elongation factor Tu) and <emphasis>atpD</emphasis> (F-ATPase β-subunit) further supports a close relationship between <emphasis>E. coli, E. fergusonii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species, and places <emphasis>E. hermannii</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. vulneris</emphasis> in closer taxonomic proximity to the genus <emphasis>Enterobacter</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0016">16</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0002p0004">The pan-genome of<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> comprises &gt;75,000 unique gene families; however, only approximately 2,400 (3.2%) make up the core genome found in &gt;99% of isolates (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0017">17</link>). The wide diversity of nonpathogenic and pathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> types has driven additional taxonomic study within this species. Five major “phylogroups” (A, B1, B2, D, E, and F) have been proposed based upon sequence homology of seven housekeeping genes (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0015">15</link>). Phylogroups are only loosely correlated with pathogenicity; however, phylogroup A contains primarily commensal strains while other phylogroups are composed primarily of pathogens (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0015">15</link>). For example, 72 to 85% of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> isolates from extraintestinal infections belong to phylogroup B2 (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0018">18</link>). Molecular phylogeny indicates that specific pathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> types (pathovars) including enteroinvasive <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (EIEC), Shiga toxin-producing <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (STEC), enteropathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (EPEC), and <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> serotype K1 arose independently in multiple phylogroups (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0015">15</link>). These data suggest that horizontal gene transfer is the main driver of genetic diversity and virulence, as opposed to random mutation events and selective pressure (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0015">15</link>). Horizontal transfer of genes or multigene cassettes enables the transformation of nonpathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> to a specific pathovar. For example, transfer of genes encoding heat-stable (ST) and heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin has the potential to transform nonpathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> to enterotoxigenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (ETEC) regardless of lineage (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0013">13</link>). The genomes of pathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> such as STEC serotype O157, uropathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (UPEC), and EPEC are approximately 1 Mb larger than their commensal counterparts, owing to the acquisition of additional genes required for virulence (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0019">19</link>).</para>

      <beginpage pagenum="761"/>
      <para id="ch0056s0002p0005">Transfer of virulence-associated genes among<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> pathovars is evident in phylogenetic trees based on whole-genome analysis, in which pathovars sharing specific virulence genes or toxins cluster together independent of the relatedness of housekeeping gene sequences (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0009">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0013">13</link>). Unrelated pathovars share approximately 50% genome similarity but are defined by a small set of pathovar-specific genes ranging from 120 for STEC to 45 for UPEC and just 3 to 6 for EPEC and ETEC (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0019">19</link>). These genes encode pili, toxins, or secretion systems related to the pathogenesis of the pathovar. Pathovar clustering is most pronounced among STEC isolates, which also cluster closely with <emphasis>Shigella dysenteriae.</emphasis> The frequency of horizontal recombination events between strains and a relatively small “core” chromosome presents a barrier to the development of a simple evolutionary tree for this species.</para>

      <para id="ch0056s0003p0001"><emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> spp. are facultative anaerobic, non-spore-forming Gram-negative bacilli 1–3 μm in length and 0.5 μm in diameter, although this can be impacted by temperature, growth state, and exposure to antibiotics (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0020">20</link>). Among motile species, multiple axial flagella mediate motility in liquid (swimming) and semisolid (swarming) matrices. Encapsulated <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> strains are identified by their K-antigen type. These strains demonstrate increased serum resistance and are more frequently associated with extraintestinal infections. <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> spp. are easily cultivated on routine laboratory media including Trypticase soy agar (TSA) with or without blood supplement, MacConkey agar (MAC), Trypticase soy broth (TSB), and various differential and selective media commonly utilized in the laboratory (see “Isolation Procedures” below). Colonies appear round, smooth, convex, and gray in color with a diameter of 3 to 6 mm after 18 to 24 h of incubation at 35°C. Some but not all isolates may demonstrate a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis. Biochemically, &gt; 95% of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> isolates ferment lactose to acid end products with production of gas, are positive for indole production and lysine decarboxylase, reduce nitrate to nitrite, and exhibit negative reactions for oxidase, esculin, and urease (<anchor id="ch0056s0003a0003"/><link linkend="ch0056s0004a0005">Table 1</link>). Approximately 5% of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> isolates are considered “nonreactive” and yield negative reactions for lactose fermentation, indole production, and other biochemical tests commonly used for bacterial identification. These isolates are difficult to differentiate from <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. based on biochemical reactions and may require serotyping. Other <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> spp. have biochemical profiles that differ from that of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, but are similar to other members of the family <emphasis>Enterobacteriaceae</emphasis>, resulting in difficulty in identification or misidentification if biochemical tests are solely relied on (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0021">21</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0022">22</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0056s0004p0001"><emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> spp. exist largely as asymptomatic colonizers of insects, birds, and mammals; however, some species or strains possess sets of virulence factors that enable them to cause gastrointestinal, urinary, or other extraintestinal disease. The primary route of transmission is fecal-oral, including indirect transmission via fecally contaminated food or water. Within the genus <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis>, the various pathovars of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> cause &gt;99% of human disease associated with the genus. The primary reservoir for <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> is the small and large intestine of mammals, including humans, where they are among the most frequently isolated facultative anaerobic species. The ability to easily culture <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> from stool has led to the perception that it is the dominant bacterial species present; however, <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> comprises only 0.1% or less of the total gut microbiome in healthy humans (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0023">23</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0004p0002">Isolation of<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> from environmental soil and water specimens is used as an indicator of fecal contamination (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0024">24</link>), which can be an important source of transmission for diarrheagenic pathovars. <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> can persist in surface water for 5 to 15 days and in soil or sediment for 40 days or longer (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0025">25</link>). In agricultural regions of India and Southeast Asia with poor sanitation, over 25% of water sources used for human consumption contain diarrheagenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0025">25</link>). In these regions, pathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> is the third or fourth leading cause of infectious diarrhea in children, with an incidence of 1 to 2 cases/100 child years (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0026">26</link>). In the United States, diarrheagenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> infections combine for &gt;200,000 cases of infectious diarrhea per year (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0027">27</link>). Most of these infections (60 to 80%) are foodborne, and the most common vehicle for infection is undercooked meat, typically beef contaminated with intestinal contents during slaughter and processing. <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> can also persist on fresh fruit or vegetables tainted with contaminated soil or water, and outbreaks have been attributed to prepackaged vegetables sold direct to consumers or used by restaurant chains (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0028">28</link>). Specifically, Shiga toxin-producing <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> account for approximately 10% of bacterial foodborne outbreaks, 15% of hospitalizations, and 10% of deaths associated with bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0029">29</link>). The infectious dose for diarrheagenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> pathovars ranges from as little as 10 to 100 CFU for STEC to &gt;10<superscript>6</superscript> CFU for EPEC, EIEC, ETEC, and enteroaggregative <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (EAEC) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0004p0003"><emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> is the leading cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) in women of childbearing age, accounting for over 75% of infections (~10 million infections/year in the United States) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0031">31</link>). The primary source of infection is migration of colonizing bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the urethra and ascension to the bladder.

Recent advances in bacterial identification methods such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and PCR sequencing have enabled recognition and raised awareness of these species in human infections.</para>
        <para id="ch0056s0005s0001p0002"><emphasis>E. albertii</emphasis> is the <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> species most closely related to <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, sharing 54 to 60% genetic homology, and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of gastrointestinal infections in humans. The primary reservoir for <emphasis>E. albertii</emphasis> appears to be wild birds and raccoons, in addition to chickens raised for human consumption (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0035">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0036">36</link>). Phenotypic traits including a lack of motility, failure to ferment lactose, and variable indole production make it easy to differentiate from <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> but difficult to differentiate from other <emphasis>Enterobacteriaceae</emphasis> including <emphasis>Hafnia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0038">38</link>). Two large studies found that 14 to 19% of enteropathogenic or Shiga toxin-producing <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> isolates from diarrheal stools were actually <emphasis>E. albertii</emphasis>, based on gene-specific PCR and multilocus sequence typing (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0038">38</link>). These data suggest that the incidence of <emphasis>E. albertii</emphasis> as an enteric pathogen has historically been underestimated. All <emphasis>E. albertii</emphasis> strains encode the intimin protein (<emphasis>eaeA</emphasis>), which mediates bacterial adhesion to the intestinal epithelium (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0038">38</link>). In addition, 85 to 96% of <emphasis>E. albertii</emphasis> isolates contain <emphasis>cdtB</emphasis>, a cytolethal distending toxin found in both <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> and STEC, and 4 to 10% contain the Shiga-like toxin <emphasis>stx2f</emphasis> characteristic of STEC (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0037">37</link>–<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0039">39</link>). Isolates encoding <emphasis>stx2</emphasis> have been associated with severe, bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0039">39</link>). These isolates may be sorbitol positive or negative and will be detected using latex agglutination or ELISA tests for Shiga toxin (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0037">37</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0038">38</link>). <emphasis>E. albertii</emphasis> is primarily associated with acute gastroenteritis, including several foodborne outbreaks, and has been only rarely isolated from infections outside the gastrointestinal tract (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0040">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0041">41</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0056s0005s0001p0003"><emphasis>E. fergusonii</emphasis> is associated with asymptomatic carriage in chickens, turkeys, pigs, and other livestock. While it is rarely isolated from human infections, one study identified <emphasis>E. fergusonii</emphasis> in 11% of positive urine specimens collected from patients with symptoms of UTI (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0042">42</link>). <emphasis>E. fergusonii</emphasis> has also been recovered from stool specimens in patients with diarrhea and, rarely, from bloodstream and traumatic wound infections (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0022">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0043">43</link>). A recent case report associated <emphasis>E. fergusonii</emphasis> with hemolytic uremic syndrome secondary to urinary tract and bloodstream infection in an elderly female; however, production of Shiga toxin was not detected in the isolate (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0044">44</link>). Genetic orthologs encoding ST and LT enterotoxin, intimin (<emphasis>eaeA</emphasis>), and pili present in pathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> have been identified in some <emphasis>E. fergusonii</emphasis> isolates, but definitive mutational studies to confirm the functionality of these genes are lacking (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0022">22</link>). Further, up to 47% of isolates do not contain identifiable virulence-associated genes. Taken together, this complicates the interpretation of clinical significance when <emphasis>E. fergusonii</emphasis> is isolated from a nonsterile site. If deemed significant, susceptibility testing should be conducted to guide therapy, since multidrug resistance including extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-positive isolates has been described (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0022">22</link>).</para>

Isolation of <emphasis>E. hermannii</emphasis> from clinical specimens remains rare, and it is often recovered in conjunction with other established pathogens in polymicrobial wound cultures or other nonsterile specimens such as stool and sputum (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0011">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0045">45</link>). Over half of all invasive infections attributed to <emphasis>E. hermannii</emphasis> are bacteremia, which is more frequent in patients with indwelling venous catheters (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0046">46</link>). Other infections including pyelonephritis, meningitis, and soft-tissue infections remain extremely rare and have been reported primarily in the elderly or those with underlying impaired immune function including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or malignancy. Isolates of <emphasis>E. hermannii</emphasis> are uniformly resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin. Resistance to tetracycline, quinolones, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins (including ESBL phenotype), and carbapenems has been reported in 14 to 33% of isolates (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0046">46</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0056s0005s0001p0005"><emphasis>E. vulneris</emphasis> shares genetic and clinical characteristics with <emphasis>E. hermannii</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0047">47</link>). While <emphasis>E. vulneris</emphasis> is infrequently found in clinical specimens, 74% of isolates are recovered from wounds and 10% are recovered from respiratory sources (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0047">47</link>). In these instances, <emphasis>E. vulneris</emphasis> has not been isolated in pure culture nor demonstrated to be the primary pathogen. Further, <emphasis>E. vulneris</emphasis> is not lethal in intraperitoneal infection models in mice (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0047">47</link>). These factors cast doubt on the clinical significance of <emphasis>E. vulneris</emphasis> when isolated from nonsterile sites. Rare instances of invasive infection, including bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and meningitis, have been reported and are associated with immune compromise or indwelling medical devices (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0048">48</link>–<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0050">50</link>). A case of acute gastroenteritis followed by bacteremia in an infant has been reported (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0048">48</link>). Isolates of <emphasis>E. vulneris</emphasis> may be resistant to penicillins but appear largely susceptible to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, quinolones, and tetracyclines (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0051">51</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0056s0005s0001p0006"><emphasis>E. marmotae</emphasis> was first isolated in 2012 from the stool of Himalayan marmots (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0004">4</link>).

The type strain was isolated from a stool specimen obtained from a patient with recent history of diarrhea, though definitive association of the bacterium with these symptoms was inconclusive (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0005">5</link>). Whole-genome sequencing failed to identify any specific virulence genes, but several genes encoding antibiotic resistance including ESBL were noted. Both commercially available MALDI-TOF MS systems misidentify this species as <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> with a high confidence score; however, <emphasis>E. ruysiae</emphasis> may be differentiated based on biochemical reactivity including an inability to decarboxylate lysine.</para>

          <para id="ch0056s0005s0002s0001p0001">The majority of<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> are nonpathogenic while contained within the intestinal lumen; however, specific groups of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> contain virulence factors that aid in dissemination, persistence, or pathogenesis outside the GI tract. Combined, these are referred to as extraintestinal pathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (ExPEC). Two major groups or pathovars of ExPEC are the UPEC and the meningitis/sepsis-associated <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (MNEC). Both ExPEC pathovars contain similar virulence factors and reside primarily within <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> phylogroup B2. These pathovars can cause infections in a healthy host, for example, uncomplicated UTI; several factors potentiate infection, such as the presence of indwelling urinary catheters, immunocompromised state, and inoculation to normally sterile sites via surgery or traumatic injury. A third group of ExPEC, the septicemia-associated <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (SEPEC), has recently been proposed. Like UPEC and MNEC, SEPEC harbor additional virulence factors that aid in potentiation of infections outside the gastrointestinal tract (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0053">53</link>); however, taxonomically the SEPEC are distributed across all <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> phylogroups (A, B1, B2, D, E, F) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0054">54</link>).

          <para id="ch0056s0005s0002s0002p0001">Urinary tract infections are extremely common, affecting an estimated 150 million people worldwide on an annual basis. This includes 10 to 13 million cases/year in the United States alone, where UTI accounts for nearly 1% of all outpatient physician visits (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0031">31</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0056">56</link>). The majority are uncomplicated UTI in sexually active females of reproductive age, but approximately 10% are classified as complicated UTI due to recurrence, infections in men, persons with urinary tract abnormalities, or persons with indwelling urinary catheters. Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) is among the most common hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), accounting for 12 to 17% of all HAIs (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0057">57</link>); however, in contrast to uncomplicated UTI, <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> represents only 12 to 35% of CAUTI, with other <emphasis>Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> comprising the majority of infections (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0058">58</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0059">59</link>).

Further, 60 to 80% of inpatients with an indwelling catheter receive antibiotics, which results in the selection or development of highly resistant isolates. While resistance rates differ by hospital and geographic location, resistance to commonly utilized antibiotics ranges from 18 to 60% among hospital-acquired UTI isolates, and in one study the presence of ESBL was identified in over 25% of isolates (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0060">60</link>).</para>

This finding suggests potentially increased serum resistance and/or decreased immunogenicity for these O serotypes, which contributes to extraintestinal survival and pathogenesis.

There are five principal types of diarrheagenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>: STEC, (including enterohemorrhagic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> [EHEC]), enterotoxigenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (ETEC), EPEC, enteroinvasive <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (EIEC), and enteroaggregative <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (EAEC).

All STEC isolates encode Shiga toxin 1 (<emphasis>stx1</emphasis>) and/or 2 (<emphasis>stx2</emphasis>), which were named for their close relation to the cytotoxin encoded by <emphasis>Shigella dysenteriae</emphasis> type 1 (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0068">68</link>). Shiga toxins specifically target endothelial cells in the GI tract and microvasculature of the renal glomeruli, where they arrest protein synthesis (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0068">68</link>). Endothelial cell death leads to the characteristic bloody diarrhea often observed in STEC infections and enables migration of Stx into the bloodstream, where subsequent damage to renal microvasculature results in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0068">68</link>). The clinical hallmarks of HUS include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. STEC strains that cause hemorrhagic colitis and HUS are further designated as EHEC. In addition to Stx, EHEC encode the LEE locus (see “Enteropathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>,” below), which mediates tight binding to the gastric epithelium. Improved adherence combined with Stx production contributes to increased severity of GI symptoms associated with EHEC. Stx1 and Stx2 share 50 to 60% protein homology but are immunologically distinct and vary in toxicity (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0068">68</link>). While <emphasis>stx1</emphasis> is associated with mild disease, variants of <emphasis>stx2</emphasis> (e.g., <emphasis>stx2a, stx2d</emphasis>) have been linked to severe bloody diarrhea and increased incidence of HUS (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0068">68</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0069">69</link>).</para>

The predominance of STEC O157 is likely attributable to its extremely low infectious dose of 50 to 200 CFU, which differentiates it from other STEC serotypes (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0069">69</link>). STEC O157 causes both sporadic and outbreak-associated infections, including 35 to 45 outbreaks annually in the United States (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0071">71</link>). Ground beef is the source of 40% of foodborne outbreaks of STEC O157, but contaminated produce and dairy products have also been frequently implicated as vehicles in large multistate foodborne outbreaks (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0071">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0072">72</link>). The low infectious dose also enables person-to-person transmission and transmission from environmental reservoirs including lakes contaminated with agricultural runoff. STEC O157 is prominent and historically has been the focus of diagnostic tests because of an increased association with severe bloody diarrhea and progression to life-threatening HUS. Specifically, infection with STEC O157 is associated with a 17 to 46% hospitalization rate, 4 to 6% incidence of HUS, and a mortality rate of 0.5% (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0071">71</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0073">73</link>).

          <para id="ch0056s0005s0002s0004p0004">The importance of non-O157 STEC serotypes in both mild and severe acute gastroenteritis, including HUS, continues to emerge. In the United States, the incidence of reported non-O157 STEC infections has been steadily increasing since 2005 owing to expanded incorporation of ELISA and molecular methods for the direct detection of Stx toxin or the<emphasis>stx</emphasis> gene(s) in diarrheal stools. Currently, approximately 60% of reported STEC infections in the United States are caused by non-O157 serotypes (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0074">74</link>). Similarly, in Argentina, Australia, and Germany, non-O157 serotypes account for the majority of STEC infections (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0070">70</link>). In the United States and globally, serotypes O26, O103, O111, O121, and O145 are among the most frequent serotypes identified aside from O157 and are associated with increased incidence of HUS compared to other serotypes, ranging from 3 to 22% (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0070">70</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0074">74</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0075">75</link>). Clinically, infection with serotype O157 is more frequently associated with bloody diarrhea (71 to 97%) compared to non-O157 STEC (42 to 57%), while other symptoms including fever and abdominal pain are equivalent (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0070">70</link>). Importantly, non-O157 STEC accounts for 16 to 43% of HUS globally (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0076">76</link>). The proportion of HUS caused by non-O157 serotypes mirrors the prevalence of O157 and non-O157 serotypes isolated from symptomatic patients; therefore, countries with the highest proportion of non-O157 STEC also have the highest proportion of HUS caused by non-O157 serotypes (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0070">70</link>). These data suggest that the presence of specific virulence factors (e.g., <emphasis>stx2a, eae</emphasis>) is a better predictor of disease severity than serotype; however, these genes are more common in some serotypes than others, and this varies by geographic region (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0069">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0070">70</link>). Indeed, one study found the odds ratio of developing HUS to be 5.8 for STEC encoding <emphasis>eae</emphasis> and 9.6 for STEC encoding <emphasis>stx2</emphasis> when compared to STEC lacking these genes (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0075">75</link>). Due to the increased awareness of severe disease caused by non-O157 STEC, as well as increasing incidence of these infections, the Joint Commission introduced Standard QSA.04.06.01 in 2013. This standard requires laboratories to perform tests that specifically detect Shiga toxin or the genes encoding the toxins for all patients with community-acquired diarrhea, to identify non-O157 STEC.</para>
          <para id="ch0056s0005s0002s0004p0005"><emphasis role="strong">ETEC.</emphasis> Enterotoxigenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (ETEC) strains produce heat-labile and/or heat-stable enterotoxins that define the pathotype and are central to pathogenesis. Heat-labile toxin (LT) is an AB<subscript>5</subscript> subunit toxin encoded by <emphasis>eltA</emphasis> or <emphasis>eltB</emphasis> that shares approximately 80% identity with cholera toxin. LT induces overproduction of cyclic AMP in intestinal epithelial cells, which leads to dysregulation of the CFTR chloride ion channel and fluid loss (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0077">77</link>). Heat-stable toxin (ST) induces the production of intracellular cGMP, ultimately resulting in dysregulation of multiple ion channels, leading to fluid loss and impaired reabsorption (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0077">77</link>). The proportion of ETEC isolates containing LT, ST, or both toxins varies widely by geographic region, year, and study. In general, ST is present in 45 to 85% of ETEC, LT is present in 50 to 98% of ETEC, and both toxins are present in 15 to 60% of ETEC isolates (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0077">77</link>). Production of either toxin is sufficient to cause disease, and production of both does not increase severity of symptoms (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0077">77</link>). Colonization of the GI tract is mediated by a combination of &gt;20 fimbrial and nonfimbrial adhesins that enable adherence to intestinal epithelial cells, aggregation of ETEC, and initiation of biofilm formation. These colonization factors (CFs) are plasmid encoded and are absent from 30 to 50% of ETEC isolates. Together, the differences in activity among individual LT types and variation in CFs may explain the continuum of symptom severity and asymptomatic carriage observed in patients with ETEC-positive stool.</para>
          <para id="ch0056s0005s0002s0004p0006">Clinically, ETEC infection results in watery, nonbloody diarrhea that is often accompanied by vomiting in both children and adults (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0077">77</link>). Subtropical and tropical regions of the developing world are areas of endemicity, owing largely to inadequate sanitation and water treatment practices. An estimated 840 million cases of ETEC occur worldwide annually, with 25 to 35% being children under the age of 4 (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>). In regions of the developing world, it is estimated that children will have 0.5 to 1.5 ETEC infections per year (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>). Asymptomatic carriage of ETEC is common in children in regions of endemicity. Case-controlled studies have demonstrated carriage rates of 8 to 19% in children under the age of 5 (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0077">77</link>). Repeated exposure to ETEC may contribute to partial immunity, resulting in the high asymptomatic carriage rates observed in this population. Infected humans are the primary reservoir for ETEC, and transmission is fecal-oral. ETEC infections peak seasonally during the warm months and following monsoon season when surface water may be contaminated in regions of endemicity (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0077">77</link>). Other vehicles of transmission include food prepared by infected individuals, contaminated drinking water, and produce washed or irrigated with contaminated water (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>). In the developed world, ETEC infections are diagnosed primarily in individuals returning from regions of endemicity and account for 20 to 40% of “traveler’s diarrhea.” While less common, significant outbreaks have also been reported in the United States and other developed nations. These were related to imported produce, poor hand hygiene among food preparers, and improper food storage (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0078">78</link>). Recent implementation of multiplex panels for the detection of enteric pathogens has detected ETEC in 0.5 to 2.0% of symptomatic patients in developed countries, raising awareness of this pathogen in patients without significant travel history (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0079">79</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0080">80</link>). Importantly, additional bacterial or viral pathogens were identified in 80 to 93% of these specimens, calling into question the contribution of ETEC to disease and the clinical significance of these results (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0079">79</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0081">81</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0056s0005s0002s0004p0007"><emphasis role="strong">EPEC.</emphasis> Enteropathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> was initially recognized as a common cause of infantile diarrhea in 1945. EPEC strains do not encode classical enterotoxins and are not invasive; rather, they are defined by their unique ability to induce architectural changes within intestinal epithelial cells and microvilli. These lesions are known as attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions because of the tight adherence of EPEC to microvilli followed by induction of pedestal-like protrusions rising from intestinal epithelial cells. The pathogenesis of A/E lesions results from a chromosomally encoded cluster of genes known as the locus of attachment and effacement (LEE). The LEE locus encodes <emphasis>tir</emphasis>, a <emphasis role="underline"><emphasis>t</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis>rans</emphasis>-located <emphasis role="underline">i</emphasis>ntimin <emphasis role="underline">r</emphasis>eceptor which integrates into the host cell membrane and is surface exposed in the intestinal lumen. A second LEE-encoded protein called intimin (<emphasis>eae</emphasis>) is expressed on the bacterial cell membrane and binds tightly to Tir. In this way, EPEC mediates its own specific receptor binding to host cells. Other effectors encoded by LEE modulate actin polymerization to aid in pedestal formation, cause dysregulation of aquaporins leading to cellular fluid loss and diarrhea, disrupt cellular tight junctions, and aid in immune evasion (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0082">82</link>). Additional virulence factors are encoded on an <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> adherence factor (EAF) plasmid. Most notable are the type IV bundle-forming pili (<emphasis>bfp</emphasis>), which mediate initial attachment to the intestinal epithelium, and <emphasis>perABC</emphasis>, which encodes transcriptional activators of <emphasis>bfp</emphasis> and the LEE locus (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>). EPEC strains that encode LEE and contain the EAF plasmid are referred to as “typical EPEC,” while those lacking the EAF plasmid are referred to as “atypical EPEC” (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0082">82</link>).</para>

Like other enteropathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, the major reservoir is the GI tract of humans and other mammals. The infectious dose of EPEC is high, ranging from 10<superscript>8</superscript> to 10<superscript>10</superscript> viable organisms, which reduces its transmissibility and ability to cause significant outbreaks (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0084">84</link>). However, poor hygiene and close contact such as occurs in day care facilities likely increase risk of transmission in both developing and developed countries (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>). Typical EPEC isolates belong to serotypes O55, O86, O114, O27, and O142, while atypical EPEC are commonly O26, O55, O86, O111, O119, and O128 (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>). Both typical and atypical EPEC have been implicated in endemic and epidemic gastroenteritis (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0082">82</link>). Based on culture and serotype analysis, the prevalence of EPEC in symptomatic patients is 8 to 10% but can be as high as 15% in patients with severe diarrhea requiring hospitalization (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0082">82</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0083">83</link>). Importantly, not all isolates in these serogroups harbor LEE (i.e., are not EPEC), and EPEC have been identified in over 200 additional O serotypes. Together, these factors limit the utility of culture and serotyping for diagnosis of EPEC-associated diarrhea.</para>

Approximately 48 to 54% of diarrheal stools containing EPEC contain additional potential pathogens including norovirus, <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> spp., or other diarrheagenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0079">79</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0085">85</link>). Studies comparing symptomatic and asymptomatic adults have found a similar prevalence of 23 to 37% in both groups (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0085">85</link>). In the pediatric population, some studies have demonstrated significantly higher positivity in symptomatic patients versus controls, while others have demonstrated similar prevalence in both groups (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0083">83</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0086">86</link>). This discordance may be the result of differences in pathogenicity among common EPEC serotypes or differences in bacterial load in the GI tract. Quantitative PCR targeting the <emphasis>eae</emphasis> gene in EPEC demonstrated a slightly higher bacterial load in symptomatic children than controls (299 versus 29 CFU/mg, <emphasis>P</emphasis> = 0.016) overall; however, the difference was only statistically significant in children &lt;1 year of age and only when EPEC was the sole pathogen detected (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0087">87</link>). Finally, among immunocompromised patients, the percentage of individuals with EPEC detected in stool specimens was similar in those with history of diarrhea (20%) versus those with no history of diarrhea (23%), as well as in a matched asymptomatic immunocompetent cohort (23%) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0085">85</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0056s0005s0002s0004p0010"><emphasis role="strong">EIEC.</emphasis> EIEC shares a high degree of genetic and phenotypic similarity with <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. Cellular invasion, intracellular survival, and direct spread of EIEC to adjacent host cells are mediated by multiple gene clusters located on the virulence plasmid pINV. This plasmid is found in all EIEC and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> isolates, but was likely acquired by each species independently (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0088">88</link>). Destruction of endothelial cells results in the bloody diarrhea sometimes observed in EIEC infections. Chromosomally encoded enterotoxins <emphasis>set2</emphasis> and <emphasis>sigA</emphasis> further potentiate cellular fluid loss, leading to watery diarrhea. Further details of this process can be found in the chapter section below describing the clinical significance of <emphasis>Shigella.</emphasis> Importantly, the effector <emphasis>ipaH</emphasis> is present in multiple copies on both pINV and the bacterial chromosome and has been used as a target for molecular tests that identify EIEC and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> in stool specimens (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0079">79</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0056s0005s0002s0004p0011">The epidemiology and clinical impact of EIEC are difficult to ascertain because of its close relationship to<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> and the difficulty in distinguishing EIEC from <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> by using biochemical, phenotypic, and molecular methods. Definitive differentiation requires multiple tests including PCR detection of genes more common in <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> and serotyping analysis, though cross-reactivity between EIEC and some <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> serotypes is common (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0088">88</link>). The reservoir for EIEC is the GI tract of humans and non-human primates. Transmission is primarily fecal-oral resulting from poor hand hygiene, but small foodborne outbreaks have been reported in Africa, Asia, and the Americas including the United States (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0088">88</link>). This contrasts with <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, which is a well-documented cause of food- and waterborne outbreaks affecting 150 to 200 million people globally on an annual basis. Overall, EIEC may account for 10% or fewer of the total symptomatic infections attributed to EIEC and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. combined (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0089">89</link>). The stark contrast in cases of EIEC versus <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> results from two key factors. First, clinical symptoms associated with EIEC infection, including the presence of blood in stool, are often mild when compared to those accompanying classic <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infection and likely contribute to underreporting of infection. This may be the result of reduced expression of <emphasis>ipa</emphasis> and several other virulence genes that reduce invasiveness, cell-to-cell spread, and the inflammatory response to EIEC (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0090">90</link>). Second, the reduced invasiveness of EIEC results in an infective dose that is 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, which in turn reduces the transmissibility of EIEC (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0091">91</link>). Treatment of EIEC infection should be driven by symptom severity and individual patient risk factors such as age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. Mild cases often resolve with only supportive care and oral rehydration therapy. The use of antibiotics may be appropriate for severe cases and in patients with identified risk factors. Choice of antibiotic should be based on results of susceptibility testing or local antibiograms but may include ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>).</para>

          <para id="ch0056s0005s0002s0004p0013">Typical symptoms of EAEC infection include persistent, nonbloody, watery diarrhea. Chronic colonization and biofilm formation can disrupt normal intestinal function and lead to secondary sequelae of malnutrition and growth retardation even in the absence of diarrheal symptoms (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0092">92</link>). The impact of EAEC infection is greatest in children living in regions of endemicity, where the number of symptomatic infections can surpass those caused by ETEC (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0094">94</link>). Individuals with uncontrolled HIV infection may also be at increased risk for persistent and severe diarrhea resulting from EAEC infection (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0092">92</link>). Humans are the primary reservoir for EAEC and transmission is likely via the fecal-oral route. A high infective dose of 10<superscript>8</superscript> to 10<superscript>10</superscript> CFU is required to cause symptomatic infection; however, lower doses are likely sufficient to initiate subclinical infection and asymptomatic carriage (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0084">84</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0092">92</link>). Contaminated water supplies are likely a major source of infection. EAEC was detected in 4 to 36% of water sources tested in Australia and Bangladesh (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0092">92</link>). Fresh foods contaminated by use of unclean water for washing or irrigation, or by infected individuals during preparation, have also been implicated in outbreaks (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0092">92</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0094">94</link>). In the developed world, EAEC has long been recognized as a cause of traveler’s diarrhea, but the implementation of molecular diagnostic panels has increased awareness of EAEC as a potential cause of sporadic acute gastroenteritis in healthy adults and children without travel history (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0079">79</link>–<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0081">81</link>). These studies place EAEC among the top four most common enteric pathogens detected in diarrheal stools (EPEC, <emphasis>Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile</emphasis>, EAEC), accounting for 5 to 7% of total positive results. Like other diarrheagenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, EAEC is frequently found in stools containing other potential pathogens (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0079">79</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0081">81</link>). Further, comparative studies of children living in areas of endemicity have demonstrated a high rate of asymptomatic carriage and similar overall prevalence of EAEC in symptomatic cases and controls (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0092">92</link>).</para>
          <para id="ch0056s0005s0002s0004p0014">An important development in the evolution of EAEC as a pathogen is the ability to acquire additional virulence factors through bacterial conjugation or phage transduction.

The most notable of these is the acquisition of Shiga toxin <emphasis>stx2</emphasis> by a strain of EAEC that resulted in two large foodborne outbreaks in Germany in 2001 and 2011. These isolates belonged to serotype O104, which is typical of EAEC but infrequently associated with EHEC (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0095">95</link>). The increased pathogenic potential of this strain was demonstrated by the 3,842 reported cases of diarrhea, 855 (22%) of which were complicated by HUS (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0092">92</link>).</para>

The diffusely aggregative <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (DAEC) are named for their diffuse adherence pattern to cultured epithelial cells. DAEC tend to cover a larger surface of host cells, as opposed to aggregating in a focal pattern like EAEC or EPEC (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>). Specific receptor-mediated binding by DAEC induces structural and functional changes in epithelial cells, including loss of microvilli, which ultimately results in diarrhea. The cytotoxin <emphasis>sat</emphasis> is produced by some but not all DAEC strains. No correlation between <emphasis>sat</emphasis> and diarrhea has been found in adults; however, in children, expression of <emphasis>sat</emphasis> is more common in children with diarrhea than controls who harbor DAEC lacking <emphasis>sat</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0096">96</link>). Asymptomatic carriage is common in older children and adults, and DAEC does not appear to be a primary cause of diarrhea in these groups. However, chronic colonization has been suggested to contribute to inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn’s disease (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>). Acute symptomatic DAEC infection is observed most commonly in children &lt;5 years of age, potentially due to intestinal barriers and other host defenses that are not yet fully developed (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0096">96</link>). In this group, DAEC has been isolated from up to 23% of stool specimens obtained from symptomatic patients (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>). Reporting of the actual epidemiology and incidence of DAEC is hampered by the lack of a true definition of this pathovar and genetic heterogeneity among individual isolates. Identification based on serotype analysis may provide some additional value, as demonstrated by a study that found 19 DAEC serotypes unique to patients with diarrhea while other serotypes were found in both symptomatic patients and controls (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>).</para>

A correlation between Crohn’s disease (CD) and AIEC infection has been recognized. Multiple studies have isolated AIEC from 30 to 40% of patients with CD as compared to 0 to 6% of asymptomatic controls (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>).

      <para id="ch0056s0008p0001"><emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species are responsible for &gt;160 million human infections and 1.1 million deaths worldwide on an annual basis (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0102">102</link>). Greater than 99% of infections occur in developing countries, where <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> accounts for a median 2 to 22% of all diarrheal episodes and is the leading cause of diarrheal illness in children 1 to 5 years of age (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0102">102</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0103">103</link>). A recent longitudinal study examined stool specimens collected monthly for &gt;1,500 children in developing countries over the first 2 years of life. <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> was present in 3% of diarrheal stools collected from children 0 to 5 months of age, and increased to 37% of stools in children 18 to 23 months of age. Perhaps most interesting, <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> sp. was detected in approximately half as many stools collected from asymptomatic children in matched age groups (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0104">104</link>). This not only indicates widespread exposure to the pathogen, but also a large reservoir among asymptomatic children. Children are also at the highest risk for severe disease, with a historic crude mortality rate of 1 to 3%. In developing countries, approximately 70% of infections and 60% of deaths attributable to <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> occur in children under 5 years of age (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0102">102</link>). In the United States, the incidence of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infection is comparatively low, accounting for an estimated 350,000 to 500,000 cases annually, and incidence has remained largely unchanged since the mid-1970s (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0105">105</link>–<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0107">107</link>). The incidence of shigellosis is 2 to 3 times higher in males than females, with a peak incidence in males of African descent aged 18 to 59 (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0106">106</link>). Similar to developing countries, the majority of infections occur in children; however, the mortality rate is &lt;0.1% (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0107">107</link>). The lower incidence and mortality rate in developed countries are a result of better sanitation practices, access to clean drinking water, and access to health care (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0100">100</link>). Over the past decade, the childhood mortality rate resulting from <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infection in developing countries has decreased significantly and currently approaches that seen in the developed world. This improvement is potentially related to better nutrition, earlier diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infections, and vitamin A supplementation (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0108">108</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0008p0002"><emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species are strict human pathogens and humans are the primary reservoir for infection, though great apes can serve as accidental hosts. Transmission is fecal-oral, either directly through contact with fecal material (e.g., soiled diapers) or indirectly through contact with food, water, or other fomites containing the bacteria. Sexual transmission via oral-anal contact has also been documented among men who have sex with men (MSM) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0109">109</link>). The infective dose of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species is extremely low, requiring only 10 to 100 organisms to cause symptomatic disease (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0084">84</link>). <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species remain viable in water at a neutral pH for up to 20 days at 25°C and 30 to 40 days at 4°C (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0110">110</link>). In developing countries, contaminated drinking water is the primary source of infection. In the United States, food contaminated during preparation is the vector for transmission in approximately 30% of cases, with an additional 15% of cases attributed to travelers returning from regions of endemicity (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0027">27</link>). The remaining cases are likely transmitted directly or via contact with fomites. Day care facilities and public pools are frequent sites for <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> outbreaks, and multiple family members often become infected due to close personal contact. <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species lose culture viability after 4 h on dry surfaces, but may remain infective for 5 days or longer (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0111">111</link>). Factors associated with the highest odds ratio for transmission in day care centers include the use of pacifiers, presence of training toilets, toilet facilities shared by children of multiple ages, and handling/rinsing of soiled clothing in the day care center (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0105">105</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0008p0003">Differences in historical and regional epidemiology have emerged among the four<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species. In the United States and Europe, <emphasis>S. sonnei</emphasis> is the dominant species causing infection, accounting for 70 to 84% of infections annually. <emphasis>S. flexneri</emphasis> accounts for 15 to 28% of infections, while <emphasis>S. boydii</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> combine for just 2 to 3% (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0106">106</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0112">112</link>). In contrast, <emphasis>S. flexneri</emphasis> has steadily emerged to become the dominant species in Asia and Africa, where it accounts for approximately 60% of infections. The emergence of <emphasis>S. flexneri</emphasis> in the developing world is concurrent with a decline in the prevalence of <emphasis>S. sonnei</emphasis> to approximately 30% in these regions. <emphasis>S. boydii</emphasis> accounts for approximately 5% of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infections in Asia and Africa; however, local prevalence can be as high as 23% in some regions of Asia such as Bangladesh (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0103">103</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0112">112</link>). The prevalence of <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> has declined in the developing world from a high of 7.3% to a current prevalence of 1.5%. This is attributable to an overall decline in large outbreaks caused by the highly virulent <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> serotype 1 in recent years (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0100">100</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0108">108</link>). The last major outbreak of <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> serotype 1 was in Western Africa in 1999 and involved over 4,000 cases with an attack rate of &gt;7% (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0113">113</link>). Since that time, only sporadic or small local outbreaks of serotype 1 have been reported. Outbreaks of other species and serogroups remain frequent in both the developing and developed world, which has kept the overall incidence of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infections static for the past 2 decades (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0102">102</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0108">108</link>). Of recent concern are reports of severe dysentery resulting from <emphasis>S. flexneri</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> serotype 4 harboring <emphasis>stx1</emphasis> in travelers returning from the Caribbean and an outbreak of <emphasis>S. sonnei</emphasis> harboring <emphasis>stx1</emphasis> in California (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0100">100</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0114">114</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0056s0009p0001"><emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> causes bacillary dysentery, which is classically characterized by severe diarrhea containing blood and mucus resulting from destruction of the gastric epithelium. Severity of symptoms can vary based on species, serotype, and host-specific risk factors such as age and immune status (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0106">106</link>). Severe disease requiring hospitalization ranges from 20 to 34% among the four <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0106">106</link>). The presence of blood in stool is observed in approximately 25 to 30% of infections and lacks sensitivity for guiding clinical diagnosis but carries a specificity of &gt;90% as well as an odds ratio (OR) of &gt;4.5 for <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infection when compared to patients with diarrhea of other etiology (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0103">103</link>). Among non-gastric symptoms, fever is most prominent (35–45%, OR 1.74), followed by abdominal cramps (15–22%, OR 1.64) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0103">103</link>). Vomiting was also common, present in 20 to 22% of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infections, but was less frequent (OR 0.73) when compared to patients with non-<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> diarrhea. Individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are 7 to 30 times more likely to acquire <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infection and 3 times more likely to be hospitalized as a result of severe and persistent symptoms (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0115">115</link>). Despite its invasive nature, <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infections remain localized and bacteria only rarely disseminate beyond the large intestine and rectum. Bloodstream infection is rare, but may follow gastrointestinal illness (0.4–7% of cases) and is most frequent in malnourished children &lt;1 year of age (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0106">106</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0116">116</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0056s0009p0002">Systemic complications associated with<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infection most prominently include seizure and HUS, neither of which involves the dissemination of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract. The incidence of seizure following diarrhea in children under the age of 5 years ranges from 1 to 11% (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0103">103</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0117">117</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0118">118</link>). Risk of seizure appears to correlate with severity of symptoms, including dehydration and fever, rather than the presence of a bacterial toxin or other specific virulence factor (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0118">118</link>). In contrast, HUS is the direct result of Shiga toxin-mediated damage to the renal microvascular endothelium. Because of this, HUS is only observed following infection with Shiga toxin-producing isolates, primarily <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> serotype 1. Symptoms of HUS include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency and typically appear 7 to 10 days following onset of diarrhea. The incidence of HUS in children infected with <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> serotype 1 ranges from 8 to 15% and can carry a mortality rate of up to 40% if not managed appropriately (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0117">117</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0009p0003">The pathology and clinical symptoms associated with<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infections result from immune evasion, invasion of gastric epithelial cells, and production of toxins. All species and serotypes of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> migrate to the gastric epithelium via M-cell transcytosis and invade the basolateral surface of gastric epithelial cells (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0119">119</link>). Cell invasion, destruction, and the ensuing inflammatory response result in the bloody, mucus- and pus-laden diarrhea that characterizes <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infections. Fluid loss is catalyzed by enterotoxins <emphasis>set1A</emphasis> and <emphasis>set1B</emphasis>, as well as cytotoxin <emphasis>sigA</emphasis>, which are chromosomally encoded (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0100">100</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0119">119</link>). The majority of virulence genes reside on a 200-kb virulence plasmid, pINV (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0100">100</link>). Specifically, 34 genes encoding a type 3 secretion system (<emphasis>mxi-spa</emphasis>), translocated effector proteins essential for invasion and intracellular spread (<emphasis>ipa-ics</emphasis>), and regulators of virulence gene expression (<emphasis>virB, mxiE</emphasis>) compose the genetic “entry region.” A full review of the molecular pathogenesis of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> has been presented in recent reviews (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0100">100</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0119">119</link>). <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> serotype 1 additionally encodes Shiga toxin <emphasis>stx1a.</emphasis> This toxin originates from Stx-phage P27, which is integrated into the chromosome of <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> serotype 1 and differs from <emphasis>stx1</emphasis> of STEC by a single amino acid (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0068">68</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0119">119</link>). The cytotoxic activity of Stx causes extensive damage to the gastric epithelium which contributes to the severity of diarrhea, while damage to renal vascular endothelium results in HUS (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0068">68</link>). Rarely, <emphasis>stx1a</emphasis> has been identified in other <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species, including <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> serotype 4 and <emphasis>S. flexneri.</emphasis> These strains can cause outbreaks of severe, bloody diarrhea and HUS similar to those typically associated with <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> serotype 1.</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0009p0004">Immunocompetent adults typically recover from<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infection within 5 to 7 days with symptomatic treatment alone. However, without effective antibiotic treatment these individuals may shed viable bacteria for up to 4 weeks and remain infectious even after resolution of symptoms. Individuals with severe diarrhea, and high-risk populations including the immunocompromised and children, show significant benefit from prompt antibiotic treatment. During an outbreak of <emphasis>S. dysenteriae</emphasis> in Africa, the mortality rate for patients not receiving antibiotics was 3 to 6% compared to &lt;1% for patients receiving ciprofloxacin (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0113">113</link>). Effective antibiotic treatment of both moderate and severe infections may also aid in controlling outbreaks by reducing the duration of shedding and transmission of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> to uninfected individuals (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0120">120</link>). Individuals in the food service industry, health care workers, day care providers, and children in school or day care should not return to work or school until 24 to 48 h following resolution of symptoms. Some employers may additionally require documentation of a negative stool culture prior to returning to work. Therefore, laboratories that have adopted a molecular approach for diagnosis of bacterial gastroenteritis should retain the ability to conduct stool culture or have a procedure to send to a reference laboratory if needed.</para>

If a delay of &gt;2 h is unavoidable, fresh stool should be transferred into a non-nutritive buffered transport medium (see “Transport and Storage” below for details on transport media) and stored at 4°C to preserve viability of potential pathogens in the specimen (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0121">121</link>). Collection of stool does not strictly require the use of sterile containers, but the specimen should not be contaminated with toilet water or urine as either could introduce bacterial or other contamination into the specimen. For children still in diapers, multiple commercial collection devices are available; a common collection method is to line diapers with plastic wrap to create a barrier that will prevent the stool specimen from being soaked into the diaper. Because obtaining stool specimens from children can be difficult, laboratories may also accept rectal swabs.</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0010p0002">The performance of rectal swabs is dependent upon the laboratory standard of care. While rectal swabs may be acceptable for culture, they have historically been considered less sensitive than fresh or preserved fecal specimens. A study comparing recovery of a live<emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> vaccine strain in paired rectal swab and fecal specimens demonstrated 81% agreement between fecal specimen and rectal swab. Among specimens with discordant results, 20/30 (66%) were positive from fecal specimens and negative from rectal swabs (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0122">122</link>).

      <para id="ch0056s0015p0002">Identification of non-O157<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> is more difficult, as it requires increased testing of pink (i.e., sorbitol-fermenting) isolates on SMAC demonstrating <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> colony morphology. Stx1- and Stx2-positive enrichment broths that fail to recover colorless isolates on SMAC may indicate a non-O157 STEC, which could prompt laboratories to perform additional testing of pink colonies. These well-isolated colonies from broth should be tested for <emphasis>stx1</emphasis> and <emphasis>stx2</emphasis> followed by O-specific antisera, or the broth can be submitted to the appropriate public health authority for further testing. The most common non-O157 serogroups are O26, O103, O121, and O111, although this can vary based on geographic location (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0155">155</link>). All presumptive STEC isolates should be sent to the public health laboratory for further characterization and national reporting.</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0015p0003">Chromogenic agars for the isolation of STEC have been developed to simplify laboratory workflow and increase detection. CHROMagar STEC (CHROMagar Microbiology, Paris, France) detects several serotypes including O157, O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145, differentiating STEC serotypes from other microbiota through development of mauve color in the colony. Studies evaluating chromogenic media using characterized isolates and stool cultures observed sensitivity and specificity ranging from 85 to 100% (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0156">156</link>). Isolates that fermented sorbitol had difficulty growing on these media (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0156">156</link>). Forty-eight false-positive colonies were also observed, suggesting that confirmatory testing should be performed on all mauve colonies. Chromogenic agar specific for O157 is also available (BBL CHROMagar, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and was found to be 96.3% sensitive compared to SMAC culture (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0157">157</link>).</para>

In the event of suspected outbreaks, laboratories should isolate 5 to 20 mostly lactose-fermenting colonies, with some nonfermenting colonies, to a nonselective slant. Slants can then be submitted to the public health laboratory or reference laboratory for molecular characterization to determine if isolates are ETEC, EPEC, EIEC, or EHEC. Isolates can also be frozen at –80°C in 15 to 50% glycerol for long-term storage.</para>

      <para id="ch0056s0016p0001">Several selective media can be used for the isolation of<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> from stool cultures. Common media include Hektoen enteric agar (HE), Salmonella-Shigella agar (SS), and xylose-lysine-deoxycholate (XLD). These same media are used for the selective isolation and presumptive identification of <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> species based on a positive H<subscript>2</subscript>S reaction. Additional details for the identification of <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> can be found in <ulink url="ch0055#ch0055s0001">chapter 38</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis> Representative images of each genus are pictured in <anchor id="ch0056s0016a0003"/><link linkend="ch0056s0018a0004">Fig. 2</link>. HE agar is a selective agar based on bile salts that reduce growth of Gram-positive organisms. This agar also contains increased amounts of peptone (12 g versus 3 g in MAC) along with bromothymol blue and acid fuchsin (acid base indicators) and two H<subscript>2</subscript>S indicators. The increase in peptone counteracts the inhibitory effects of the bile salts and indicators (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0146">146</link>). <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> colonies will be green to blue-green with no black center, due to a lack of production of H<subscript>2</subscript>S. SS agar is similar in composition to HE agar and allows detection of <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species. Non-lactose fermenters such as <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> will grow as translucent or colorless colonies, while organisms that ferment lactose will appear red. SS agar has increased amounts of peptone compared to MAC, but also includes brilliant green, which inhibits Gram-positive bacteria and reduces swarming of <emphasis>Proteus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0146">146</link>). Although SS agar is highly selective, it can inhibit growth of some <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species such as <emphasis>S. sonnei</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. dysenteriae.</emphasis> XLD agar uses both xylose and lysine as substrates to detect fermentation capabilities of isolates. Xylose fermentation is characteristic of most <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> except <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0146">146</link>). The agar also contains sodium thiosulfate and ferric ammonium citrate to detect hydrogen sulfide production. <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. appear red on XLD, while <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> species will appear red with a black center due to H<subscript>2</subscript>S production.</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0016p0002">Evaluations comparing the ability of these agars to isolate<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species from stools have been performed. One study tested 1,597 stool specimens using both direct and enrichment plating. Specimens were enriched with either GN broth or selenite-F broth and then plated to XLD, HE, or SS agar. Enrichment almost doubled the rate of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> isolation. Parallel plating found that XLD was most efficient at detecting <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> in stool specimens (90%), followed by HE (80%) and SS (68%) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0158">158</link>).

In three separate studies, O’Hara and Miller evaluated three of these systems, VITEK 2 (bioMérieux, Inc., Durham, NC), MicroScan (Dade Behring, Inc., West Sacramento, CA) and Phoenix (Becton Dickinson Co., Sparks, MD), using the same stock isolate collection obtained from the CDC (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0162">162</link>–<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0164">164</link>).

      <para id="ch0056s0018p0005">In recent years, MALDI-TOF MS has been widely adopted for bacterial identification in clinical labs due to the low cost per isolate, short turnaround, and high accuracy. Identification is performed by interrogating isolates for the presence and intensity of specific protein peaks, the majority of which correspond to ribosomal proteins. To date there are two common commercially available systems used for bacterial identification: the Bruker Biotyper CA (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA) and the VITEK MS (bioMérieux, Inc.). The performance of MALDI-TOF MS is directly dependent on the depth and breadth of bacterial isolates used to construct the reference spectral library. Both systems have available FDA-cleared and research-use-only (RUO) libraries. A comparison of system libraries is provided in<anchor id="ch0056s0018a0006"/><link linkend="ch0056s0019a0003">Table 6</link>. The VITEK MS FDA library (V3.2) includes <emphasis>E. coli, E. fergusonii, E. hermannii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. vulneris</emphasis> from the <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> genus, with the RUO library further including <emphasis>E. albertii.</emphasis> The FDA-cleared library for the Bruker Biotyper CA system (Revision J) includes only <emphasis>E. coli, E. hermannii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. vulneris. E. albertii, E. fergusonii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species are frequently undifferentiated from <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> if using the FDA-cleared library. The Biotyper RUO library expands identification to include both <emphasis>E. albertii</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. fergusonii</emphasis>, but still has limitations in identifying <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> (see “Identification of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>,” below). Despite the presence of additional <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> species in RUO libraries, both Bruker and VITEK instruments are less reliable for identification of <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> species other than <emphasis>E. coli.</emphasis> A study using the VITEK MS demonstrated that the accuracy for identification of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> was 100% (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 65), while the accuracy for identifying <emphasis>E. fergusonii</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. hermannii</emphasis> was 66.7% and 85.7%, respectively (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 6 and <emphasis>n</emphasis> = 7) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0165">165</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0018p0006">Due to the close genetic relationship of<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> to inactive <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, MALDI-TOF MS cannot reliably distinguish the two species using standard analysis and libraries. Independent studies have identified specific biomarker peaks within MALDI spectra that may help differentiate between the two species. Using one such approach, 90% of 130 isolates were successfully identified to a species level with only 3% of isolates misidentified (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0166">166</link>). Other approaches have created custom libraries using isolates genetically characterized by multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and have demonstrated 94.4% accuracy among a collection of 180 isolates (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0167">167</link>). These advanced differentiation approaches are currently best classified as research and are unlikely to be easily adapted into routine practice by most clinical laboratories. Because of these difficulties, laboratories may want to consider the use of routine biochemical tests, such as motility, to aid in differentiation of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> and inactive <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> when clinically necessary (e.g., sterile site infection, recurrent infection). Alternatively, isolates may be sent to local state or reference laboratories for definitive identification based on serotyping.</para>

      <para id="ch0056s0020p0012">Molecular panels range from high-complexity tests, requiring off-line extraction and manual setup of individual real-time PCR reactions, to moderate-complexity sample-to-result platforms capable of generating a result in approximately 1 hour. Clinical trials and independent evaluations consistently report high sensitivities for all molecular platforms when compared to routine culture and broth-enriched EIA methods. Specifically, reported sensitivities range from 82.7 to 100% for<emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> species, 95.9 to 100% for <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species, and 93.7 to 100% for STEC including <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> serotype O157 (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0079">79</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0170">170</link>–<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0172">172</link>). Importantly, these studies also reported nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-based identification of these pathogens in a significant number of stool specimens that were reported as negative by routine culture/EIA. This included a 40 to 58% increase in specimens positive for <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species and a 15 to 100% increase for specimens positive for STEC, including <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> serotype O157. The increased rate of detection is directly related to a 1- to 2-log<subscript>10</subscript> difference in limit of detection between culture/EIA and NAAT. Using an FDA-cleared NAAT, Anderson et al. reported 100% sensitivity for <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species and STEC O157 at a concentration of 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml and 69 to 100% sensitivity at 10<superscript>4</superscript> CFU/ml in stool matrix. This contrasts with culture methods, which only demonstrated 100% sensitivity for these targets at 10<superscript>7</superscript> CFU/ml. Sensitivity diminished to 75% for STEC O157 at 10<superscript>6</superscript> CFU/ml and was ≤81% for both pathogens at 10<superscript>5</superscript> CFU/ml (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0141">141</link>). The use of broth culture enrichment prior to Stx-specific EIA increases sensitivity when compared to EIA performed on raw or preserved stool; however, this method is still only 29 to 74% sensitive when compared to NAAT performed on primary specimens (i.e., without enrichment) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0142">142</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0173">173</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0020p0013">Turnaround time is dependent on the level of automation of each test but ranges from 8 h for manual tests to as little as 1 h for fully automated tests. The decreased time to result has the potential to positively impact patient management and infection control efforts. Empirical antibiotic treatment is not recommended in uncomplicated cases of gastroenteritis; however, antibiotics are frequently prescribed and may be appropriate for children &lt;3 months of age, persons with severe diarrhea, or systemic disease (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0174">174</link>). In these cases, a rapid test with a strong negative predictive value may result in discontinuation or prevention of empirical antibiotic administration targeted at treating a bacterial etiology. Likewise, rapid identification of STEC O157 or <emphasis>stx</emphasis> in a stool specimen may prevent the prescription of empirical antibiotic therapies, some of which have been associated with an increased risk of HUS (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0175">175</link>). A rapid result can also aid infection control efforts by identifying patients positive for <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species or STEC O157 who are highly infectious even at a low bacterial burden.</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0020p0014">Broadly multiplexed NAATs often include genetic targets specific to multiple<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> pathovars, including EPEC, EAEC, and ETEC, which are indistinguishable from nonpathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> isolates in culture. Multiple studies conducted using broad panels have reported these <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> pathovars to make up 12 to 24% of all positive results, suggesting that these pathogens may be underrecognized and underestimated causes of bacterial gastroenteritis (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0079">79</link>–<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0171">171</link>). Independent laboratories have similarly developed multiplex tests for the identification of other pathogenic <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> species, including <emphasis>E. albertii</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. fergusonii</emphasis>, which are likely not detected or misidentified when using routine culture and identification methods (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0176">176</link>). The clinical interpretation of positive NAAT results for these agents is complicated by several factors. First, EPEC and EAEC have been identified in up to 7 to 23% of asymptomatic patients, suggesting a carrier or colonization state (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0083">83</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0085">85</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0086">86</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0092">92</link>). The carrier state appears to be more common in children and in regions of the world where these pathovars are endemic; however, large studies examining asymptomatic carriage of specific <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> pathovars have not been performed in developed countries. Second, EPEC, EAEC, and ETEC are frequently identified in specimens containing a second (or third) definitive pathogen such as norovirus or <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> species. Three studies have reported 45 to 83% of EPEC, EAEC, and ETEC detections to be part of multipathogen or “mixed” infections (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0079">79</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0081">81</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0171">171</link>). Combined, the dubious significance of these <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> pathovars and the recommendation to not treat uncomplicated acute gastroenteritis have called into question the clinical necessity of broad NAAT panels that identify these organisms. If broad panels are employed, laboratories may want to consider selective utilization or the addition of interpretive comments acknowledging the potential for asymptomatic carriage and the self-limited nature of symptoms resulting from infection with these organisms in otherwise immunocompetent individuals.</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0020p0015">A major consideration for the utilization of molecular diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis is the increased cost of the test, as well as the associated cost to the patient or insurer. For outpatients with uncomplicated gastroenteritis and no systemic symptoms, the medical necessity of expensive broad molecular panels has been called into question. Several studies supporting the use of molecular panels have demonstrated small but significant reductions in endoscopic procedures, imaging studies, and antibiotic utilization in patients who received a molecular test versus routine culture (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0177">177</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0178">178</link>). These findings are likely the result of the high negative predictive value of broad molecular tests as well as the higher rate of positive results compared to culture, both of which help to provide a definitive answer and reduce further unnecessary testing or procedures. This in turn can also reduce the total cost of care, which offsets the comparatively higher cost of molecular tests (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0178">178</link>). Despite these potential benefits, current guidelines for the diagnosis of infectious diarrhea recommend a selective and targeted approach, including testing for only <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> species, <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species, <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> species, <emphasis>Yersinia</emphasis> species, STEC including serotype O157, and <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> based on known exposure, risk factors, and clinical symptoms associated with these pathogens (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0174">174</link>). In these cases, narrow or focused NAAT panels will provide a more rapid and sensitive method for detection than stool culture and may approach cost-neutrality for the laboratory when considering the media and labor required for routine stool culture and organism identification (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0179">179</link>). Diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended for mild cases of acute gastroenteritis or traveler’s diarrhea lasting &lt;7 days unless the patient is at risk for severe disease (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0174">174</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0180">180</link>). For patients with persistent diarrhea (&gt;7 days), fever, leukocytosis, history of travel, and immunocompromised status, and for infants, a broader pathogen differential including parasites and uncommon bacterial pathogens may be considered (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0174">174</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0180">180</link>). For these patients, traditional culture-based or antigen-based testing can be utilized; however, in the case of negative results, the use of a broad molecular panel may be warranted as part of a comprehensive testing strategy. The use of NAATs for follow-up or “test of cure” in patients who have resolved symptoms is discouraged because of the inability of NAAT to differentiate viable from nonviable organisms. For some specific populations including food handlers, health care workers, and children returning to child care facilities, a negative stool culture can be considered to support a low risk of transmissibility (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0174">174</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0056s0020p0016">An unintended consequence of culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) such as NAAT is the negative impact on public health and epidemiology efforts. Recovery of a bacterial isolate is critical to outbreak investigation and identification of emerging bacterial serotypes associated with gastroenteritis. Additionally, lack of a cultured isolate prevents antimicrobial susceptibility testing, which should be used to guide targeted therapy and is essential to recognize changing resistance patterns. Therefore, the ability to conduct routine bacterial culture on stool specimens should be maintained. However, if NAAT is employed as a first-line diagnostic test, culture may be selectively utilized for only those specimens that test positive or when antimicrobial susceptibility results are necessary for clinical care. Maintenance of routine culture methods is also important to support public health and surveillance goals (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0174">174</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0056s0021p0001">Several non-stool NAATs are available for the detection of<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> in positive blood culture broth, CSF, and respiratory specimens.

The sensitivity of these assays for detection of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> in various specimens typically exceeds that of culture, with the additional benefit of a rapid turnaround time. A complete description of the performance of these assays is provided in <ulink url="ch0023#ch0023s0001">chapter 8</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0021p0002">Rapid detection of<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> in CSF using antigen or NAAT can be performed to aid in patient management; however, latex agglutination and other antigen-based tests have poor sensitivity, significantly limiting their clinical utility. Studies evaluating antigen testing have shown sensitivities ranging from 66 to 80% compared to Gram stain and culture (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0181">181</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0182">182</link>). Overall, these data suggest that antigen testing does not provide actionable results and that the risk of false negatives can delay treatment and generate greater health care costs (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0181">181</link>). For these reasons, antigen testing is no longer offered by most laboratories. Molecular detection from CSF is promising to decrease turnaround time and improve sensitivity. One commercially available assay, the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis panel (BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT), detects 14 targets including <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> capsular K1 organisms within 1 hour (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0067">67</link>). <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> strains that express K1 have increased capabilities to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause 80 to 90% of all neonatal meningitis (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0065">65</link>).

Furthermore, development of public central tracking systems such as the U.S. FDA’s GenomeTrakr Network, in which sequenced outbreak genomes are deposited and indexed, has allowed geographic mapping of outbreak lineages in real time. In this section, we begin with traditional classification schemes based on antigenic typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and then cover newer molecular and NGS-based approaches, including ribosomal MLST (rMLST), whole-genome and core-genome MLST (wgMLST and cgMLST), and whole-genome single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based strain tracking.</para>

      <para id="ch0056s0023p0001">Antigenic typing methods employ antibodies to distinguish bacterial strains based on differences in exposed protein and carbohydrate chemical groups on the surface of the cell or flagella. Though modern technologies allow for the production of monoclonal antibodies to almost any antigenic target, polyclonal antisera are still used for much serologic typing performed on<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species. The two antigenic targets on which most classical typing methods have been based are the O (somatic) antigen and H (flagellar) antigen. The O antigen often consists of 10 to 25 repeating units of two to seven sugar residues in linear, branched, or double-branched topology and constitutes the outermost segment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the bacterial membrane (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0185">185</link>).

In part, this diversity is made possible by the large number of different sugars that are synthesized in bacterial O antigens, including pentoses, deoxyhexoses, lactyl-substituted hexoses, heptoses, and nonuloses (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0185">185</link>). In contrast, the H antigens are protein in nature and reside within the flagellin subunit of the bacterial flagellum present in motile <emphasis>E. coli.</emphasis> The serologically defined H antigen determinants in these species have been mapped to sequence variation in the <emphasis>fliC</emphasis> and <emphasis>fliB</emphasis> genes (the latter primarily in dimorphic <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> species) (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0187">187</link>–<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0190">190</link>).</para>

Molecular methods have the advantage of providing a universal approach that does not require the production of strain-specific reagents. One of the most widely used classical molecular methods has been pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE involves digestion of the total extracted DNA of the isolate of interest using specific restriction endonucleases, followed by electrophoretic separation of digest fragments. The resulting banding pattern was used to discriminate between closely related bacterial strains. While historically effective, PFGE has been largely supplanted by higher-resolution sequence-based methods such as MLST and WGS.</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0026p0002">MLST is a sequencing-based technique that works by indexing sequence variation in a small set of core genes (often seven) that are common to all members of a given species (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0193">193</link>). Each core gene allele with a novel sequence is assigned a unique number, and each novel combination of alleles is assigned a unique sequence type (ST). The use of the allele as the elementary unit of analysis, as opposed to the SNV conveniently deals with the fact that single molecular events can introduce variation at multiple nucleotides in a contiguous region, as happens with recombination or mobile genetic element insertion (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0193">193</link>). MLST is often performed by PCR amplification of the target genes followed by Sanger sequencing, though MLST allelic sequences can also be extracted from WGS assemblies. The sequences are then compared with the appropriate scheme for classification, or assigned new allele numbers within the scheme if novel.

      <para id="ch0056s0027p0001">The increasing use of WGS technologies and the availability of a large number of reference genomes have made possible new approaches to bacterial strain typing and outbreak tracking. As useful as classical MLST schemes have been as a universal standardized system for organizing great diversity within<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, these schemes are based on analysis of &lt;0.2% of the genome. Consequently, classical MLST-based approaches are not always able to make distinctions within clonal lineages that are needed for epidemiologic purposes (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0193">193</link>). Analysis of the whole genome provides a much more complete source of information from which to reconstruct phylogenies and to compare strains, and the MLST method of approach, in which the unit of analysis is the allele, can be expanded to whole-genome data in a variety of ways. These methods, which have been particularly useful for strain typing of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species, include rMLST, wgMLST, and cgMLST.</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0027p0002">The rMLST method is based on analysis of the ribosomal protein subunit (<emphasis>rps</emphasis>) genes, which usually number 53 in bacteria. The <emphasis>rps</emphasis> genes are relatively conserved within <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species, but provide enough diversity between clonal groups for strain typing schemes that have finer resolution than classical MLST-based classification (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0193">193</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0194">194</link>). The <emphasis>rps</emphasis> genes have the additional advantage of being distributed throughout the genome, making rMLST schemes relatively robust to local recombination events (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0193">193</link>). The wgMLST schemes, in contrast, analyze all loci in a given isolate. This approach works best for very closely related isolates that share all or almost all loci in common, usually members of a clonal outbreak (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0193">193</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0194">194</link>). As most bacterial genomes are structured with a set of core genes that are common between isolates of a species or strain, plus a variable number of accessory genes that may differ between isolates, a derivative of this approach, cgMLST, was developed that classifies bacterial isolates based on the shared core gene content (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0193">193</link>). The cgMLST methods have been shown to be highly reproducible and have been used successfully for outbreak tracking and surveillance (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0195">195</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0196">196</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0056s0027p0003">An alternative to the above described WGS MLST is direct SNV-based genomic comparisons. In these methods, phylogenies and clonal lineages are constructed through a comparison of single nucleotide differences across genomes between isolates. Implicit in many of these approaches is the assumption that single SNVs represent independent molecular events and that the neutral substitution rate at all positions is equivalent. Though these assumptions are often not strictly true, the impact of non-independent SNVs (due, for instance to mobile genetic element insertion) and variability in neutral substitution rate across sites may be negligible for outbreak tracing in some cases. Difficulties in determination of clonal relatedness can arise with hypermutator strains. Modeling techniques exist for correcting for many of these features, but are beyond the scope of this chapter. Whole-genome SNV-based approaches have now been used successfully for epidemiologic typing and tracking of<emphasis>E. coli, Shigella</emphasis> species, and other bacteria in outbreaks (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0197">197</link>–<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0200">200</link>).

      <para id="ch0056s0029p0001">Antimicrobial therapy for STEC diarrhea or HUS is controversial: some publications have suggested that antibiotics increase the risk of HUS (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0228">228</link>), while a meta-analysis of published reports found no significantly increased risk (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0229">229</link>). There is a lack of evidence to support routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing of STEC strains. STEC isolates are almost uniformly susceptible to antimicrobial agents used in human medicine. Data from the CDC in 2018 documented resistance rates for 181 human isolates of O157 STEC of 4.5% for ampicillin, 6.4% for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 1.9% for ciprofloxacin, and 17.5% for tetracycline (<ulink url="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/narmsnow/">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/narmsnow/</ulink>).

      <para id="ch0056s0030p0001">Shigellosis is typically self-limiting, but antimicrobial therapy can shorten duration of illness and bacterial shedding, thereby preventing transmission. Because antimicrobial resistance among<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species is a major concern, all isolates recovered by the laboratory should undergo susceptibility testing. CLSI recommends that susceptibility results be reported routinely for ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and a fluoroquinolone and warns that <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> should not be reported as susceptible to first- and second-generation cephalosporins, cephamycins, and aminoglycosides, because these drugs are often not effective clinically (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0230">230</link>). In the United States, resistance rates to ampicillin (40.8% in 2018), ciprofloxacin (14.8% in 2018), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (63.7% in 2018) are high, resulting in the need for testing of additional agents. Testing methods and interpretive criteria for azithromycin, which is considered a first-line agent for the treatment of shigellosis in both adults and children, were published by CLSI for <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. in 2021 (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0180">180</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0227">227</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0231">231</link>). Using these breakpoints, resistance to azithromycin is also high, reported at 30.8% in the United States in 2018 based on data published by the CDC (<ulink url="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/narmsnow/">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/narmsnow/</ulink>). This makes testing for azithromycin an important consideration for laboratories. Resistance to azithromycin in <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. is due to acquisition of <emphasis>ermB</emphasis>, which encodes a methylase that modifies the target site, or <emphasis>mphA</emphasis>, a phosphotransferase that inactivates azithromycin (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0232">232</link>). Men who have sex with men have been identified to be at particular risk for infection by azithromycin-resistant <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. isolates, and several international outbreaks of drug-resistant <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infections have been associated with sexual transmission (<link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0233">233</link>, <link linkend="ch0056s0030s0002li0234">234</link>).</para>
