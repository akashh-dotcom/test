        <para id="ch0148s0001s0001p0001">For many years, the etiologic agents of dermatophytosis have been classified, along with some nonpathogenic relatives, in three genera:<emphasis>Trichophyton, Microsporum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Epidermophyton</emphasis>, in the family <emphasis>Arthrodermataceae</emphasis> of the order Onygenales (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0001">1</link>), phylum Ascomycota. These generic names were historically based on anamorphic (asexual state) names. Any dermatophytes capable of reproducing sexually, i.e., producing ascomata with asci and ascospores, also had historical teleomorph names in the genus <emphasis>Arthroderma</emphasis> or <emphasis>Nannizzia</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0002">2</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0148s0001s0001p0002">As part of the ongoing molecular revolution in biology, fungal taxonomy is ever more strongly influenced by our greatly increased understanding of population genetics (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0003">3</link>). Dermatophytes show two population genetics patterns differing among species that have “population hosts” (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0004">4</link>) in different zoological families, orders, or classes (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0006">6</link>). (A population host, which is the normal epidemiologic reservoir of the species, is distinguished from “occasional host” species that may acquire infection but that do not support ongoing populations; for example, <emphasis>Microsporum canis</emphasis> has mostly feline population hosts, and while humans are frequently infected by feline carriers, the species is seldom directly transmitted from human to human, making our species only an occasional host.) Some dermatophyte species, including pathogens with population hosts in the rodent, rabbit, pig, dog, and cat families, are potentially sexual, with sexual reproduction occurring only off the host, i.e., on hair or other keratinous debris in contact with the ground. Other species, particularly those with human, ungulate, equine, or avian population hosts, have no access to a soil-based location suitable for sexual reproduction and host reinfection; not surprisingly, these species are found on investigation to be asexual and clonal. They consist, in all known cases, of genetically highly uniform isolates (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0007">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0009">9</link>) sharing, where known, a single mating type factor (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0010">10</link>). Most appear to have evolved from a single strain of a sexual ancestral species that was able to make the rare successful switch to ongoing contagious infection of a new animal host. A few epidemiological and phenotypic characteristics in the clonal species appear to have undergone accelerated evolution due to strong selection for increased compatibility with the new host. This process has tended to produce differences that allow relatively easy laboratory identification of these species. At the same time, the basic cellular “housekeeping” genes investigated in phylogenetic taxonomic studies have evolved at a normal rate and thus strongly tend to resemble forms seen in ancestral species-complexes or in sibling species. This has led to considerable recent confusion about species concepts.</para>
        <para id="ch0148s0001s0001p0003">Fungal nomenclatural rules have evolved in parallel with novel taxonomic approaches, resulting in the “one fungus, one name” system (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0011">11</link>) that came into force on 1 January 2013. Under that system, it appeared likely that the clinically familiar anamorph (<emphasis>Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, Microsporum</emphasis>) names would be chosen over <emphasis>Arthroderma</emphasis> for ongoing use in this group of fungi. However, recent multilocus phylogenetic studies of type and reference strains of members of <emphasis>Arthrodermataceae</emphasis>, while broadly supporting earlier phylogenies, demonstrated that <emphasis>Trichophyton</emphasis> is polyphyletic (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0012">12</link>) and supported the recognition of seven genera of dermatophytes and dermatophyte relatives. Under this scheme, <emphasis>Trichophyton</emphasis> currently contains 22 species, <emphasis>Epidermophyton</emphasis> 1 species, <emphasis>Nannizzia</emphasis> 13 species, <emphasis>Microsporum</emphasis> 3 species, <emphasis>Lophophyton</emphasis> 1 species, <emphasis>Paraphyton</emphasis> 3 species, and <emphasis>Arthroderma</emphasis> 27 species. In this classification, almost all anthropophilic dermatophytes were retained in <emphasis>Trichophyton, Microsporum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Epidermophyton</emphasis>, together with several zoophilic species regularly associated with human infections. Conversely, most geophilic species and those zoophilic organisms that rarely cause human disease are divided among <emphasis>Arthroderma, Lophophyton, Paraphyton</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Nannizzia.</emphasis> Even with such multilocus approaches, certain recently diverged lineages are still narrowly delineated (for example, <emphasis>Trichophyton tonsurans</emphasis> and <emphasis>Trichophyton equinum</emphasis> [13]), suggesting that polyphasic approaches incorporating ecological, phenotypic, life cycle, and functional genomics features will be required to fully validate all species and definitively determine species borders. Moreover, it is likely that the geophilic dermatophytes have been insufficiently studied to date, raising the future possibility of numerous additional hitherto unsampled taxa. It is important to note that proteomic approaches support the same phylogenies as those previously proposed based on phenotypic, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0013">13</link>). Since these recent taxonomic proposals have not been fully adopted in reporting practices by the medical mycology community, this chapter retains a relatively conservative approach to the ongoing taxonomic restructurings in this group of fungi. The list of heretofore recognized species is given in <anchor id="ch0148s0001s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0148s0001s0003a0003">Table 1</link>, with proposed new names given alongside the current names. Previous anamorph names and long-used <emphasis>Arthroderma</emphasis> names are included to facilitate comparison with earlier literature.</para>

        <para id="ch0148s0001s0002p0001">Dermatophytes are keratinophilic fungi that are capable of invading the keratinous tissues of living animals. They are grouped into three categories based on host preference and natural habitat (<anchor id="ch0148s0001s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0148s0001s0003a0028">Table 2</link>) (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0014">14</link>). Anthropophilic species almost exclusively infect humans; animals are rarely infected. Geophilic species are soil-associated organisms, and soil <emphasis>per se</emphasis> or soilborne keratinous debris (e.g., shed hairs, molted feathers) is a source of infection for humans as well as for other animals. Zoophilic species are essentially pathogens of non-human mammals or, rarely, birds; however, animal-to-human transmission is not uncommon. Understanding this ecological classification for case isolates may be helpful in determining the source of infection; e.g., human infections caused by <emphasis>M. canis</emphasis> are often the result of contact between susceptible children and newly acquired or stray kittens (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0015">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0016">16</link>). Clinical species identification of dermatophytes assists in controlling infections that may have a family pet or other domesticated animal as an ongoing source of inoculum. Moreover, scalp infections with <emphasis>M. canis</emphasis> require a treatment regimen differing from that used for scalp infections caused by the more common agents of tinea capitis (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0017">17</link>). This underscores the importance of correct identification of the etiological agent.</para>
        <para id="ch0148s0001s0002p0002">Some dermatophytes, e.g.,<emphasis>Trichophyton rubrum</emphasis>, are cosmopolitan, whereas others, e.g., <emphasis>Trichophyton concentricum</emphasis>, are geographically limited (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0016">16</link>). <emphasis>T. concentricum</emphasis> is found only in the Pacific Islands and regions in Southeast Asia and Central and South America. However, the ability of dermatophytes to spread to new geographical niches in conjunction with population movements should not be underestimated. In the United Kingdom, the large-scale introduction of <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis> and the historic emergence of <emphasis>Microsporum audouinii</emphasis> in rural areas could be correlated, respectively, with troop repatriation from the Far East and evacuation of children from major cities during the first and second world wars. Similarly, the reemergence of <emphasis>T. tonsurans</emphasis> as the preponderant agent of tinea capitis in British cities has been driven by large-scale immigration from the Caribbean (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0017">17</link>). The appearance in various countries worldwide, since approximately 2018, of the problematically therapy-resistant, newly recognized <emphasis>Trichophyton indotineae</emphasis> from India (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0019">19</link>) reflects modern travel and population movement patterns. Thus, care should be taken against complacent assumptions based on historical epidemiological patterns.</para>
        <para id="ch0148s0001s0002p0003">Anthropophilic fungi are usually transmitted either directly through close human contact or indirectly through sharing of clothes, combs, brushes, towels, bedsheets, etc. Tinea capitis is highly contagious and may spread rapidly within a family, institution, or school. Transmission of tinea cruris is associated with shared clothing, towels, and sanitary facilities. The transmission of tinea pedis and tinea unguium often involves communal showers, baths, or other aquatic facilities but may depend on both environmental and host factors (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0020">20</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0021">21</link>). Acquisition of chronic <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis> tinea pedis has been suggested to require a dominant autosomal susceptibility gene (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0022">22</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0148s0001s0002p0004">Infections with geophilic dermatophytes involve transmission of soilborne inoculum to humans or other mammals. Outbreaks originating from infected soil with secondary human-to-human transmission have been reported (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0023">23</link>). Infections by zoophilic species result from animal-to-human contact (cats, dogs, cattle, laboratory animals, etc.) or from indirect transmission involving fomites. The fungi may then be transmitted among humans to a limited extent, especially in institutions (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0024">24</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0148s0001s0003p0001">The dermatophytoses (tinea or ringworm) generally manifest as infections of the keratinized tissues (hair, nails, skin, etc.) of humans, other mammals, and birds. Cutaneous infections resembling dermatophytoses may occasionally be caused by yeasts or by unrelated filamentous fungi that are normally saprobes or plant pathogens; these infections are referred to as opportunistic dermatomycoses (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0021">21</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0148s0001s0003p0002">Dermatophytes are among the very few fungal species that cause contagious, directly host-to-host-transmissible diseases of humans and animals. The transmission of these fungi is usually carried out by arthroconidia that have formed in or on infected host tissue. These conidia may be spread by direct skin-to-skin contact or via fomites containing free arthroconidia, shed skin scales, or hairs. Typical fomites include such divergent materials as hats, shoes, shower room floors, bedding, clothing of nursing staff in chronic care institutes, animal bedding/nesting material, and farm fenceposts used by animals for scratching. Tissue invasion is normally cutaneous; dermatophytes are usually unable to penetrate deeper tissues as a result of nonspecific inhibitory factors in serum (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0025">25</link>), inhibition of fungal keratinases (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0026">26</link>), a barrier formed of epidermal keratinocytes (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0027">27</link>), and other immunological barriers (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0028">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0029">29</link>). In acute cases, there is a strong Th1 reaction mediated in part by CD4<superscript>+</superscript> lymphocytes (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0030">30</link>), while in chronic cases, there is an immediate hypersensitivity-type reaction characterized by high levels of IgE and IgG4 antibodies and production of Th2 cytokines by mononucleocytes (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0031">31</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0148s0001s0003p0003">Dermatophytes tend to grow in an annular fashion on most affected skin regions, producing a “ringworm” infection form with a more or less raised and erythematous active area at the periphery and a relatively scaly inactive zone at the center of established lesions. The organism can often only be isolated from the active, peripheral ring. Infection may range from mild to severe, partly as a consequence of the reaction of the host to the metabolic products of the fungus. Also important in determining the severity of infection are the virulence of the infecting strain, the anatomic location of the infection, the status of the host’s immune system, and local environmental factors. Occasionally, especially in immunocompromised patients, subcutaneous tissue may be invaded, e.g., in Majocchi’s granuloma, kerion, mycetoma-like processes (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0033">33</link>), or more rarely, a generalized systemic infection (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0034">34</link>). A <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis> infection suggestive of cutaneous blastomycosis has been reported in an immunocompromised patient (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0035">35</link>), and a fungal culture-negative, chronic ulcerated foot lesion was diagnosed by PCR and DNA sequencing as <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis> tinea pedis in a chronic granulomatous disease patient (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0036">36</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0148s0002p0001">Infections caused by dermatophytes are named according to the anatomic location involved, e.g., tinea barbae (beard and moustache), tinea capitis (scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes), tinea corporis (face, trunk, and major limbs), tinea cruris (groin, perineal, and perianal areas), tinea pedis (soles and toe webs), tinea manuum (palms), and tinea unguium (nails). Different dermatophyte species may produce clinically identical lesions; conversely, a single species may infect many anatomic sites.</para>
      <para id="ch0148s0002p0002">Tinea barbae, usually caused by zoophilic fungi, e.g.,<emphasis>Trichophyton verrucosum</emphasis> and granular, zoophilic forms of the <emphasis>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</emphasis> complex, is typically highly inflamed and may present as acute pustular folliculitis that can progress to suppurative boggy lesions (kerion). A less severe form that appears as dry, erythematous, scaly lesions also occurs. Tinea capitis may vary from highly erythematous, patchy, scaly areas with dull gray hair stumps to highly inflamed lesions with folliculitis, kerion formation, alopecia, and scarring. <emphasis>T. tonsurans</emphasis> and <emphasis>M. canis</emphasis> are the most common agents, depending on the precise geographic location (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0017">17</link>). Favus (tinea favosa), usually caused by <emphasis>Trichophyton schoenleinii</emphasis> but also potentially caused by <emphasis>Trichophyton violaceum</emphasis> or the <emphasis>Nannizzia gypsea</emphasis> (<emphasis>Microsporum gypseum</emphasis>) complex (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0012">12</link>), is a now very rare chronic infection of the scalp and glabrous skin characterized by the formation of cup-shaped crusts (scutula) resembling honeycombs. Tinea corporis, which can be caused by any dermatophyte but is often associated with zoophiles, classically manifests as circular, erythematous lesions with scaly, raised, active, and often vesicular borders. Chronic lesions on the trunk and extremities usually are caused by <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis>, in particular by Afro-Asiatic forms of this fungus (formerly often called <emphasis>Trichophyton raubitschekii</emphasis>). Tinea cruris (“jock itch”), usually caused by <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis> or <emphasis>Epidermophyton floccosum</emphasis>, typically appears as scaly, erythematous to tawny brown, bilateral and asymmetric lesions extending down to the inner thigh and exhibiting a sharply marginated border frequently studded with small vesicles. Infection with the new epidemic <emphasis>Trichophyton indotineae</emphasis> generally consists of inflamed tinea corporis and tinea cruris (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0044">44</link>). Tinea pedis varies in appearance: the most common manifestation is maceration, peeling, itching, and painful fissuring between the fourth and fifth toes, but an acute inflammatory condition with vesicles and pustules can also occur, as can a hyperkeratotic chronic infection of the sole (“moccasin foot”). Members of the <emphasis>T. mentagrophytes</emphasis> complex frequently cause the more inflammatory type of infections, whereas <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis> usually causes the more chronic type. Infection of the sole by human-adapted forms of <emphasis>Trichophyton interdigitale</emphasis>, one of the members of the <emphasis>T. mentagrophytes</emphasis> complex, can be recognized by the formation of bullous vesicles in the thin skin of the plantar arch and along the sides of the feet and heel adjacent to the thick plantar stratum corneum (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0046">46</link>). Tinea unguium, or nail infection by dermatophytes, is a subcategory of the more general phenomenon of onychomycosis, fungal nail infection. It is most often caused by <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis> and usually appears as thickened, deformed, friable, discolored nails with accumulated subungual debris. This type of presentation results from invasion of the underside of the distal nail and is therefore termed “distal-subungual onychomycosis.” A less common infection type usually caused by <emphasis>T. interdigitale</emphasis> typically manifests, especially in its earlier stages, as “superficial white onychomycosis,” i.e., white patches in the superficial portions of the nail. “Proximal-subungual tinea unguium” may also occur. This infection, in which the nail is subungually infected beginning near its point of origin in the area of the lunula, is usually caused by <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis> and often signals immunosuppression, e.g., AIDS (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0047">47</link>).</para>

These are ideal for collection as laboratory specimens, though in some cases diagnosis may be done by Wood’s light alone. The fluorescent hairs, considered “Wood’s light positive,” typically show a small-arthroconidial, ectothrix type of hair invasion in direct microscopy. Apart from <emphasis>M. canis, M. audouinii</emphasis> and <emphasis>Microsporum ferrugineum</emphasis> also cause this type of fluorescent ectothrix infection.

The Wood’s lamp can also be used to differentiate between dermatophytosis and nonfungal skin conditions that may be similar clinically, e.g., erythrasma. In erythrasma, the skin fluoresces orange to coral red, whereas in dermatophytosis, the skin is not fluorescent.</para>

      <para id="ch0148s0004p0001">Sufficient clinical material should be collected for both direct microscopic examination and culture. However, if clinical material is limited in quantity, direct microscopic examination should always be preferred over fungal culture. It is the more sensitive technique (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0017">17</link>), and the microscopic detection of fungal elements in dermatology specimens is diagnostic of fungal infection and should be sufficient to elicit antifungal therapy. Whenever feasible, aseptic technique is used to minimize contamination during the collection and transport of specimens, and the following equipment should be available: forceps for epilating hairs, sterile no. 15 scalpel blades or sharp curette, sterile nail clippers, scissors, sterile gauze squares, 70% alcohol for disinfection, sterile water for cleansing painful areas, and clean pill packets or clean paper envelopes to contain and transport the clinical specimens such as hairs, skin scrapings, or nail clippings. Black photographic paper or strong black paper may be used for collecting and better visualizing scrapings. After collection, the paper is folded, tightly taped in the corners, and placed in an envelope for transport. Several commercial transport package systems are available; MycoTrans (Biggar, Lanarkshire, United Kingdom) and Dermapak (Toddington, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom) are two of these. Closed tubes are not recommended for specimens, since they retain moisture, which may result in an overgrowth of bacterial as well as fungal contaminants. Disposable sterilized brushes have been recommended for collection of specimens from the scalp or from the fur of animals (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0048">48</link>). Indeed, in the United States, disposable toothbrushes are often used to sample skin, with the bristle portion being pushed into the culture media in several locations after sampling. If histopathological processing is done, the nail plate may be placed in a 4% formaldehyde solution (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0049">49</link>).

Nonfluorescent hairs, especially those infected with endothrix fungi such as<emphasis>T. tonsurans</emphasis>, may need to be dug out with the tip of a sterile scalpel blade because the hairs often break off at scalp level and are thus difficult to grasp with a forceps. Rubbing with a sterile moistened swab has been successful with pediatric patients (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0050">50</link>). In the rare event that favus is seen, the scutulum at the mouth of the hair follicle is suitable for culture and microscopic examination. In lower body dermatophytoses, lesions with defined borders should be preliminarily disinfected with alcohol or cleansed with sterile water, and then active border areas should be scraped with a scalpel (or toothbrush; see above) to collect epidermal scales. Where borders are not visible to indicate the area of maximal fungal activity, as in tinea manuum, the preliminarily cleansed infected area can be broadly scraped to obtain specimen from a variety of areas that may imperceptibly differ in current fungal activity. In vesicular tinea pedis, the tops of the vesicles can be removed with sterile scissors for direct examination and culture. Culture of the vesicle fluid is not recommended.</para>
      <para id="ch0148s0004p0003">Nails should be disinfected with alcohol gauze squares. The most desirable material for culture in typical subungual onychomycosis is the waxy subungual debris, which contains the fungal elements. The highest proportion of viable elements for culturing is often found close to the juncture of the nail bed. To remove contaminating saprobic fungi and bacteria, the crumbly debris directly underneath the nail near the tips is removed with the scalpel before material is collected for culture. Some investigators will clip the nail short first and perform this scraping-away of contaminated material on the clipping. If the dorsal nail plate is diseased (superficial white onychomycosis), scrape and discard the outer surface before removing the underlying material for culture. In rare cases with a presentation consistent with<emphasis>Trichophyton soudanense</emphasis> endonyx nail infection (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0051">51</link>), in which the internal strata of the nail plate are milky white but the upper and lower nail surfaces appear relatively unaffected, clippings may be taken or the milky area may be exposed and scraped.</para>

Dermatophytes in dry specimens of skin, hair, and nails may be stored for years in viable condition, provided the material is not subjected to temperature extremes.</para>

      <para id="ch0148s0005p0001">Direct microscopic examination of skin, hair, and nails is the most rapid method of determining fungal etiology and is traditionally accomplished by examining the clinical material in 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) (freely interchangeable with the cheaper sodium hydroxide [NaOH]) (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0052">52</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0053">53</link>). Another common procedure is to use 25% potassium or sodium hydroxide mixed with 5% glycerin to impede desiccation (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0052">52</link>). Addition of fluorescent brighteners such as calcofluor white (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or Blankophor (Blankophor GmbH, Ankum, Germany) significantly increases accuracy, especially where staff is not highly experienced in visual detection of fungal elements (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0054">54</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0055">55</link>).

The suggestion, however, that biopsy/periodic acid-Schiff can also replace culturing (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0056">56</link>) is unsound, in that this technique does not permit reliable distinction of dermatophytes from other nail-invading species (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0057">57</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0148s0005p0002">Nail clippings should be aseptically cut into smaller fragments and, where possible, either pounded with a heavy object inside their collection packet or scraped with a sterile scalpel blade to release friable, flaky material containing the greatest amount of dermatophyte inoculum. Skin or nail scrapings, nail fragments, or hair roots are placed in 1 or 2 drops of one of the above-mentioned KOH or NaOH solutions on a clean glass slide. A coverslip is placed on top, and the preparation is heated gently (short of boiling) by being passed rapidly over a Bunsen burner or other heat source three or four times and then allowed to sit at room temperature for a few minutes for clearing. The exact time needed depends on the concentration of hydroxide used, the thickness of specimen fragments, and the exact amount of heat imparted by contact with the flame. A slide warmer set at 51 to 54°C may also be used to heat the slides for 1 h (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0052">52</link>). Alternatively, samples may be incubated with alkali in closed sterile microtubes at room temperature for 1 to 2 h, prior to addition of fluorescent enhancer. Clearing is evident to the naked eye as a pronounced decrease in the opacity of the scraping. Laboratories using 10% KOH or NaOH solution for skin may find that nail scrapings require a stronger alkali solution (up to 25% KOH or NaOH). Demonstration of fungal elements may be facilitated by the use of glucan-binding fluorescent brighteners such as calcofluor white (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0053">53</link>) or Congo red (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0052">52</link>). These require a fluorescent microscope set up to visualize the specific fluorescence obtained. Calcofluor white is added directly to the KOH drop on the slide as an approximately equal drop of 0.1% solution (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0058">58</link>).

This type of medium is available commercially as, for example, Mycobiotic agar (Acumedia Manufacturers, Lansing, MI; Remel, Lenexa, KS; Delasco, Council Bluffs, IA), Mycosel (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), or Dermasel Selective Supplement (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom; note that Remel is currently the U.S. distributor for Oxoid). An alternative medium promoting more rapid conidiation and colony pigmentation development is potato flake agar amended with cycloheximide and chloramphenicol (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA). For the isolation of cycloheximide-susceptible fungi that cause clinical infections resembling dermatophytosis, any type of SGA with chloramphenicol (Remel, BD), inhibitory mould agar (BD, Remel, Hardy), or Littman oxgall agar (BD) is recommended (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0053">53</link>).

      <para id="ch0148s0007p0001">Numerous techniques have been published for directly detecting dermatophyte DNA in tissue, but as yet none is established as a routine diagnostic procedure. This is mainly due to the relatively low cost of traditional procedures. However, in terms of accuracy, traditional procedures are by no means optimal; in onychomycosis, for example, they disclose at best ~85% of true-positive cases from the initial patient specimen, and this percentage is much lower in many laboratories (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0057">57</link>). This has created a strong incentive for the development of molecular detection techniques. At present, a large number of primary studies related to rapid PCR of dermatological specimens for dermatophytosis and related mycoses (e.g., nondermatophyte filamentous fungal onychomycosis) have been published. Techniques employed include PCR–enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0066">66</link>), PCR-reverse line blot (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0067">67</link>), PCR coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism study (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0068">68</link>), multiplex PCR (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0069">69</link>), nested PCR (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0070">70</link>), PCR based in part on a microsatellite locus permitting strain typing of <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0071">71</link>), and direct PCR with sequencing (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0051">51</link>). Also, related techniques such as real-time PCR (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0072">72</link>–<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0074">74</link>) have been shown to work well in trial studies but need to prove themselves as consistently practical and cost-effective in interlaboratory studies related to routine diagnosis.

        <para id="ch0148s0007s0001p0001">At present, the great majority of dermatophytes are identified phenotypically. Identification is often based on (i) colony characteristics in pure culture on SGA and (ii) microscopic morphology (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0079">79</link>). These criteria alone, however, may be insufficient, since colonial appearance may vary or be similar for different species. Characteristic pigmentation may fail to appear, and isolates, especially <emphasis>Trichophyton</emphasis> species, may not sporulate. Special media may be required to stimulate pigment production; it may be necessary to use sporulation and physiologic tests in conjunction with morphology to identify the species correctly. The majority of isolates are easily identified when visual examination is combined with any needed testing for characteristic growth factor requirements; as a consequence, phenotypic studies remain the least expensive option for routine identification. However, although seldom practically applicable except in high-level reference laboratories, molecular identification strategies involving PCR amplification and sequencing of ITS regions (currently the “gold standard” for mould identification [75, 76]) identify unusual isolates that are misbehaving phenotypically. Moreover, several recent studies have demonstrated that rapid discrimination of the most common dermatophyte genera is possible by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Indeed, MALDI-TOF identifications correlated more closely with the results of ITS sequencing than with identifications based on conventional phenotypic approaches (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0078">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0079">79</link>). However, many available MALDI-TOF platforms (Axima CFR-Plus, VITEK MS, and the Bruker Biotyper) currently lack the capacity to robustly discriminate between closely related dermatophyte species within the recently evolved genus <emphasis>Trichophyton</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0013">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0078">78</link>, <link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0080">80</link>).</para>

The numbers in the table body indicate the relative degree of growth according to traditional 1+ to 4+ visually approximated scale: 0, no growth; 1, slight growth, strongly nutrient-deprived colony morphology (very sparse, subsurface colonial growth only or colony diameter strongly reduced compared to Sabouraud agar control); 2, partially stimulated growth, but still significantly suppressed compared to that of the control; 4, growth comparable to that of the control (the table includes no 3+ reactions); v, variable. Blank spaces in the chart indicate growth responses that are not customarily examined but that are insignificantly different from control growth responses on Sabouraud agar. Percentages refer to the proportion of isolates in a given species that produce the given response.</para>

First, caution is required when comparing the sequences obtained with those in public synchronized databases, which are strewn with erroneously identified fungi. Second, relatively few conserved nucleotide positions separate the different <emphasis>Trichophyton</emphasis> species, principally due to the relatively slow evolution rate of the nuclear ribosomal repeat region.

The three genera are classically grouped according to the presence or absence of these two types of conidia and the appearance of the surface of the macroconidia, i.e., rough versus smooth. In reality, when atypical isolates and species are taken into account, the genera show considerable overlap in morphology (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0103">103</link>). For this reason, it is often more convenient to identify isolates directly at the species level than it is to try to identify them at the genus level first. Identification of species is based on the microscopic appearance and arrangement of the conidia (<link linkend="ch0148s0011s0001a0003">Fig. 5</link> through <link linkend="ch0148s0001s0003a0016">17</link>), colonial morphology on SGA (<link linkend="ch0148s0012s0001a0003">Fig. 18</link>), and physiological tests (<anchor id="ch0148s0010s0001a0003"/><link linkend="ch0148s0012s0001a0004">Table 5</link>).</para>

The direct microscopic result, however, is still reported immediately. For patients without risk factors for <emphasis>Neoscytalidium</emphasis>, qualified physicians may make presumptive diagnoses of dermatophytosis for sole and palm skin as for other skin sites. In onychomycosis, over 35 mould species may be involved in producing conditions clinically and microscopically resembling tinea unguium (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0052">52</link>), particularly in geriatric patients. The presence of a nondermatophyte mould may be suspected upon direct microscopic examination, which often reveals intact distorted hyphae (as opposed to arthrospores) with pronounced terminal fronding or hyphal swellings. Microscopic results are still reported promptly, but culture results are of high interest. At the same time, outgrowth of known onychomycosis-causing nondermatophytes may or may not be significant, excepting the nail-infecting <emphasis>Neoscytalidium</emphasis> species, which are always considered significant when grown. The complexities of accurately reporting nondermatophytes from nail specimens are beyond the scope of this chapter but are discussed in light of rigorous validation studies on this topic by Summerbell et al.

These fungi have been the subjects of numerous false and questionable case reports in the literature, and there may be some confusion about their status. If such a fungus were to infect human epidermis, the gold standard for scientifically evidencing the case would be three successive, consistent repeat isolations of the fungus from the lesion in specimens collected on different days, plus demonstration of compatible fungal elements in direct microscopy of the affected tissue. No inferential diagnoses from lower-quality evidence should be accepted as conclusive, even if the patient is said to have been successfully treated. A common dermatophyte such as <emphasis>T. rubrum</emphasis> that failed to grow out in initial culture(s) is very likely to be the actual etiologic agent in such cases (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0057">57</link>). In onychomycosis, in particular, true causal dermatophytes have only at best an ~75% chance of being grown from the initial specimen taken from any given patient; another ~15% will be recovered from a second specimen, while ~10% can only be detected by testing three or more serial specimens, something very seldom done in practice (<link linkend="ch0148s0016s0001li0054">54</link>). Cycloheximide-tolerant dermatophytoids that grow (in any quantity whatsoever) from single, otherwise unproductive specimens should not be assumed to be causal simply because they share a genus name with dermatophyte species.</para>
