      <para id="ch0021s000000p0001"><emphasis>Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology</emphasis>, first published in 1923, once served as a primary resource for laboratories attempting to identify unknown bacterial isolates of interest. Identifications were based on growth characteristics and biochemical testing (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0001">1</link>). Identification of an unknown organism would start with a group number and from there, users would follow the corresponding table and charts to arrive at a genus and then, perhaps, a species-level identification. Additional texts and guides, combined with advancements in the field, simplified this process over time (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0002">2</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0004">4</link>). This method of identification took days and in some cases weeks, due to the need for pure subcultures in addition to the time to conduct the necessary biochemical studies. For yeasts and molds, similar physical and biochemical properties were used to make identifications. Many algorithms can be found in the second volume of <emphasis>Bergey’s Manual</emphasis> or in others like <emphasis>Larone’s Medically Important Fungi: A Guide to Identification</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0005">5</link>). To this day, colony appearance and lactophenol blue tape preparations are still used to identify filamentous fungi.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0002">The methods described above often took significantly longer compared to today’s more automated methods. Though considered innovative at the time, these manual methods led to delays in patient care and stressed the need for faster, less cumbersome methods for proper identification. Over the course of history, innovation allowed for the development of reliable automation, starting with automated blood cultures in the 1970s (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0007">7</link>). Further progress led to automation of bacterial identification systems and, subsequently, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0008">8</link>). The culmination of these advances has led to an overall decrease in the analytical time required to provide actionable results to clinicians. Recent developments in total laboratory automation (TLA) have improved workflow efficiency by ensuring that cultures can be assessed as soon as adequate incubation is completed (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0009">9</link>). TLA presents a major opportunity to reduce the time between the inoculation of media and the initial assessment for microbial growth, resulting in quicker pathogen identification. The overall downstream effect has the potential for better outcomes in the management of infected patients.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0003">While automation of biochemical analysis has significantly reduced turnaround time, results can still take 6 to 12 h or more. A proteomics-based approach, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), was introduced in clinical microbiology laboratories between 2005 and 2010 as a highly reliable and much more rapid method for identifying bacteria and yeast. MALDI-TOF MS was invented decades ago but was not adopted for use in clinical microbiology laboratories until much later. Since that time, it has been implemented in many laboratories throughout the world and has become an important method for organism identification. The method has proven to be cost-effective and more rapid than the automated biochemical platforms that have been a mainstay in many laboratories.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0004">In addition to MALDI-TOF MS, nucleic acid sequencing has become an increasingly viable option for many laboratories with difficult-to-identify bacteria and fungi. These procedures typically involve amplification and sequencing of specific regions of the bacterial or fungal genome, though amplification may not be needed in some approaches. This can be done on isolates or, more recently, directly from specimens. DNA sequencing can be performed using chain termination (i.e., Sanger) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) (massively parallel sequencing) approaches depending on the workflow and strategy employed by the laboratory. Next-generation sequencing strategies may include a targeted or shotgun approach with an appropriate informatics pipeline. As the cost of instrumentation and reagents has declined and workflows and instrumentation have become more user-friendly, identification using genetic sequencing is now accessible beyond academic laboratories and has established a presence in some community hospital laboratories.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0005">Sample-to-answer molecular techniques (covered in<ulink url="ch0023#ch0023s0001">chapter 8</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>), employing both multiplex syndromic panels and more-targeted cartridge or disk-based tests, exist to identify bacteria and fungi from a variety of specimen types. Large panels exist for blood culture, gastroenteritis, meningitis/encephalitis, bone and joint infections, and upper and lower respiratory infections. The advantages of these panels and smaller cartridge-based tests are that they are quick and easy to use and reduce overall hands-on time as compared to more traditional means. In addition to identifying pathogens in a sample, many of these tests provide information regarding antimicrobial resistance and strain typing by detecting specific genetic markers. Despite these advantages, syndromic panels are not without their limitations. The panels have limitations in scope and are only approved for certain specimen types. In addition, they tend to have a higher reagent cost than conventional methods and face increased scrutiny from health care payers demanding proof of clinical impact to justify their substantial cost. For these reasons, important discussions on appropriate utilization of these powerful tools are vital to their successful implementation.</para>

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0006">Ultimately, the laboratory has numerous options to identify bacteria or fungi, and the choice of which method to use depends on a variety of factors. This chapter is intended to provide an overview of these methods and technologies. Thoroughly established longstanding methods as well as newer testing platforms will be covered. The circumstances and elements of consideration when introducing a newer technology into the laboratory are briefly covered, as is the need for verification and validation. Discussions relevant to systems for blood culture, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), immunoassays, molecular diagnostics, and detection of mycobacteria can be found in their relevant chapters throughout this<emphasis>Manual</emphasis>.</para>

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0007">For nearly a century, microorganisms have been identified based on their physical (phenotypic) characteristics. When solid media are initially examined for the presence or absence of bacteria or fungi an initial impression of the organism’s identity is formed based on the observations of colonies growing on the agar plates. An experienced laboratory scientist will notice the colony’s morphology, including the color, texture, edges, and shape, along with hemolytic patterns and odor. These initial observations are then coupled with results of Gram staining, agglutination tests, and biochemical tests to provide a more definitive identification. Over time there was a desire to standardize, miniaturize, and automate the use of biochemical tests to identify bacteria and yeast.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0008">The initial step in the evolution of systematic pathogen identification was to establish a battery of high-yield biochemical and enzymatic reactions that could quickly resolve the possible identification of common organisms to a single genus or species (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0010">10</link>). In most cases, these tests are designed to detect the presence or absence of a specific enzyme or other phenotypic characteristic by one of the following mechanisms: pH change, release of a chromogenic or fluorogenic compound, tetrazolium-based indicators of metabolic activity, detection of volatile or nonvolatile compounds, or recognition of visible growth under certain conditions. The biochemical profiles of common pathogens based on the results of these tests were cataloged into databases. Navigating such databases can be complicated, as biochemical reactions in the database do not always have equal importance, and the probability that a biochemical test will be positive or negative for an organism is rarely 100%. Therefore, an algorithm based on Bayes’ theorem or a modification of it can incorporate these probabilities when comparing the biochemical profile of an unknown organism to the database and provide an accurate identification.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0009">Using an array of biochemical assays and manually referencing databases can provide an accurate identification, but it can be quite time-consuming, expensive, and in some cases, unnecessary. For some common pathogens, there are abbreviated algorithms that can provide an identification based on growth characteristics combined with a few rapid biochemical tests that can provide an indication within minutes to hours (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0011">11</link>). This approach can be valuable to detect common pathogens such as <emphasis>Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>. It can also serve to quickly detect potential select agents, including <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Francisella</emphasis> spp., that pose a serious threat to exposed laboratory staff. Because these approaches are quick and cost-effective, they continue to serve as a primary method for identifying pathogens in resource-limited settings. It is important to be aware of the limitations to using abbreviated algorithms, as they may misidentify common organisms displaying rare phenotypes or uncommon organisms mimicking the phenotype of common organisms.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0010">Advances in molecular tools have allowed proteomics and genomics to have a substantial role in the identification of bacteria and yeast in clinical laboratories. Proteomic analysis by MALDI-TOF MS of a small sampling of bacterial or fungal colonies can provide an identification in under an hour. In many laboratories, MALDI-TOF MS has become the primary method for bacteria and yeast identification, supplanting biochemical analysis, including automated methods. Molecular methods come in two major forms, ones that amplify genetic targets to identify a specific genus or species and more broad ones that amplify unique regions within conserved genes, followed by sequencing to identify rare and unusual microorganisms. Assays that target specific organisms are typically commercial assays and are accessible to most laboratories, whereas assays that require sequencing are often limited to commercial laboratories or those affiliated with universities or research institutes.<anchor id="ch0021s000000a0006"/><link linkend="ch0021s000000a0008">Table 1</link> summarizes the technologies available for microorganism identification.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0011">Regardless of the method of identification, series of biochemical tests, proteomic spectra, or genetic sequence, the resulting data on the unknown pathogen are compared to a database of known organisms. It is important to understand that the strength of any identification method is primarily based on the breadth and depth of the database and the ability of the algorithms to compare the data from an unknown organism to the database and arrive at an accurate identification. Most databases are digital, which allows for constant updating with new organisms and taxonomic changes. Atypical organisms may not be reliably identified by commercial systems unless they are adequately represented in the system’s database. Some systems may allow users to modify or even build their own databases, whereas others are limited only to updates provided by the manufacturer. Clinical microbiologists must understand the limitations of the identification system(s) used in their laboratories and be skeptical of an identification that does not fit with other laboratory data. In such cases, it is important to seek out alternative methods to verify unusual findings before reporting an identification. Laboratories should notify manufacturers of identification errors when they occur, to facilitate improvements to the system.</para>

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0014">As robotics and computers became more sophisticated, automated instruments were developed to perform the many biochemical tests and database inquiries required to identify bacteria and yeasts. The major advantage of these systems is the reduction in hands-on time for laboratory staff. The instruments are capable of performing the entire analysis, interpreting the data, and providing an identification with an accuracy score, all while laboratory staff perform other tasks. There are multiple platforms currently available on the market, and this section will highlight their attributes with respect to organism identification. Some of the instruments can also perform automated susceptibility testing, but this will be addressed in<ulink url="ch0093#ch0093s0001">chapter 75</ulink>.

        <title>BD Phoenix</title>
        <anchor id="ch0021s000003a0002"/>
        <anchor id="ch0021s000000a0011"/>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0015">The BD Phoenix automated microbiology system (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD) consists of the BD Phoenix M50 instrument, the BD Phoenix Automated Processor (AP) for automated sample preparation, or the BD PhoenixSpec for manual preparation and its accessories, in addition to the BD EpiCenter software. The BD Phoenix M50 is capable of testing 49 panels with one temperature control panel. The BD Phoenix 100, a previous iteration of this ID/AST system, is capable of testing 99 panels plus a control panel. Globally, there are 65 combination ID/AST panels and three ID-only panels, encompassing the identification of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeast. Identification is based on a series of conventional chromogenic and fluorogenic biochemical tests to determine the identification. For combination ID and AST panels, there are 51 wells devoted to identification and 85 employed for susceptibility testing.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0016">The BD EpiCenter Microbiology Data Management System provides an integrated microbiology middleware that consists of a bidirectional laboratory interface. When interfaced with the BD Phoenix instrument, the activated BD EpiCenter modules, BDXpert and BD EpiCARE, act as an open expert system allowing customization of rules, surveillance, and epidemiology. The system allows for communication and consolidation of result reporting among instruments such as the BD Phoenix and the Bruker MALDI Biotyper (Billerica, MA). BD EpiCenter allows for electronic-mapping of MALDI target plates, eliminating the paper-based plate mapping that is common in many laboratories.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0017">Sample processing for the BD Phoenix can be done manually, but for high-volume microbiology laboratories, the Phoenix AP should be considered, as manual processing doubles the hands-on time as compared to using the AP to process isolates (177.7 s versus 89.5 s) (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0012">12</link>). The Phoenix AP reduces hands-on time through automation and standardization of the inoculum used for testing. The user places ID and AST broths into racks that hold up to five isolates at a time and loads them onto the Phoenix AP to prepare the McFarland suspension needed for susceptibility testing and identification. Following inoculum preparation, the broths are taken to the inoculation station, where the user pours the inoculum into the corresponding panels, seals them, and loads them on the M50 instrument. A limitation of the AP system is its inability to be used to prepare the inoculum for yeast panels. Once loaded onto the instrument, panels are scanned every 20 min for up to 16 h, if necessary. Results are then transmitted to the laboratory information system (LIS) via EpiCenter. There has been a dearth of recent publications on the performance of the BD Phoenix system with regard to identification of bacteria, although one study by Whistler et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0013">13</link>) found that the BD Phoenix was able to identify 187 of 204 (91.7%) previously unidentified Gram-negative nonfermenting bacteria to the genus level, showing the utility of the system. A recent publication by Er et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0014">14</link>) demonstrated excellent concordance (99.2%) between the BD Phoenix and MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species. Marucco et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0015">15</link>) found a similar rate of agreement (95%) between the BD Phoenix and MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Microflex LT Biotyper 3.1) for the identification of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis>. The accuracy of the Gram-negative identifications has been shown to be &gt;95% for <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> and nonfermenting Gram-negative bacteria (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0016">16</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0017">17</link>). The performance of the Phoenix for Gram-positive organisms is also quite good, although accuracy seems to decrease with alpha-hemolytic Gram-positive bacteria (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0018">18</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0020">20</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0018">The first automated identification system to become available for clinical laboratories, named AutoMicrobic System (AMS), appeared in 1980. The system was the by-product of a joint venture between McDonnell Douglas and NASA to study microbial growth and identification in zero gravity. The instrument was transitioned to a commercial platform under Vitek Systems, Inc. (Hazelwood, MO). The initial AMS platform had the ability to identify a limited number of enteric Gram-negative organisms (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0021">21</link>). The system uses a disposable plastic card about the size of a playing card. The cards initially contained about 30 wells each with a unique biochemical used to identify the organism. The company was acquired by bioMérieux, Inc. (Marcy-l’Étoile, France) and renamed the VITEK AMS.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0019">Since its inception, the instrument has undergone major updates to the hardware and software but still operates using disposable test cards. The current version, called the VITEK 2 system, consists of a reader/incubator and FlexPrep software installed on a separate computer station. The FlexPrep software allows users the ability to efficiently set up ID/AST cards as well as to review and finalize results remotely. The software associates the isolate with the test card using a barcode system. A cassette is loaded with the appropriate test card and a standardized suspension of the isolate to be tested. The cassette is loaded into the VITEK 2, which automatically instills the suspension into the card for analysis. Multiple identification test cards are available for the VITEK 2 and include Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens (fermenting and nonfermenting) as well as cards for the identification of anaerobes and coryneforms, yeast, and<emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> and <emphasis>Haemophilus</emphasis> species. Identification of these organisms is based upon detection of metabolic changes of a variety of substrates by colorimetry based upon pH changes. Time to identification of organisms varies depending upon the panel and ranges from 6 to 18 h. There are three sizes of VITEK 2 systems to accommodate a range of testing volumes and laboratory space. The VITEK 2 Compact is the smallest and can be configured to accept 15, 30, or 60 cards. The VITEK 2 has a 60-card capacity and the VITEK 2 XL has a 120-card capacity (<anchor id="ch0021s000000a0014"/><link linkend="ch0021s000000a0016">Table 2</link>). Although the VITEK 2 Compact and the VITEK 2 are both capable of testing 60 cards, the VITEK 2 has automated sample preparation. The instrument has bidirectional interface capability with several laboratory information systems (<ulink url="http://www.biomerieux-usa.com/clinical/vitek-2-healthcare">www.biomerieux-usa.com/clinical/vitek-2-healthcare</ulink>) and through bioMérieux’s MYLA software can relay information between bioMérieux instruments. The system also contains an advanced expert system that matches 3,732 organism phenotypes and 59,000 MIC distributions (9.02 software version; <ulink url="http://www.biomerieux-usa.com/">www.biomerieux-usa.com/</ulink>).</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0047">Despite the extensive use of the VITEK 2 system, there is a limited number of new publications regarding this platform. There are a handful of studies directly assessing the VITEK 2 system (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0022">22</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0025">25</link>) and others comparing its performance to other automated biochemical identification platforms, and overall, the systems are comparable in their performance (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0026">26</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0029">29</link>). The more recent publications revisit these systems in comparison to identification using molecular strategies and MALDI-TOF MS platforms (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0030">30</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0034">34</link>). Together, these studies can be useful for laboratories planning to purchase one of the VITEK systems.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0048">There are two studies worth highlighting. A notable multicenter study compared the three most widely used platforms, VITEK 2, MicroScan, and BD Phoenix, for testing over 11,000 isolates of<emphasis>Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli</emphasis>, and <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> obtained from hospital laboratories throughout the world (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0026">26</link>). Each isolate was tested simultaneously on all three platforms starting from the same plate. Overall, the organism identification to the species level was 99% concordant (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0026">26</link>). VITEK 2 had the best performance with only 5 misidentifications, whereas Phoenix and MicroScan misidentified 50 isolates each. The MicroScan misidentified <emphasis>A. baumannii</emphasis> significantly more often than the other two platforms, with 16 isolates erroneously reported as <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species. Identification errors for the other organisms were uncommon and without any clear patterns of misidentification.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0049">The second study, by Garza-Gonzalez et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0035">35</link>), is a comparison of MALDI-TOF MS to the VITEK 2 system that included over 4,000 clinical isolates. Of the 2,669 Gram-negative organisms, <emphasis>E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> made up 80% of the tested isolates. The overwhelming majority of the 1,479 Gram-positive isolates were <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>, followed by a variety of coagulase-negative staphylococci, <emphasis>Enterococcus faecium</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Enterococcus faecalis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0035">35</link>). Overall, the study demonstrated ≥99% concordance with MALDI-TOF MS for several organism groups. In fact, the only Gram-negative that did not meet this threshold was <emphasis>Enterobacter cloacae</emphasis> (<emphasis>n</emphasis> = 90; 98.88% concordance). A few more of the Gram-positive groups did not meet this threshold, including several coagulase-negative staphylococci, <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis>. These findings contrast with prior studies comparing these two platforms, which indicated a lower species-level concordance in the 90 to 95% range for common bacterial pathogens (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0034">34</link>). Thus, this study highlights ongoing improvements being made to the VITEK 2 platform and provides evidence that automated biochemical identification systems still have a place in the clinical microbiology laboratory despite the rise of newer proteomic methods.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0050">Despite the ability of the VITEK 2 system to accurately identify many organisms, the platform does have known limitations. A study published by Paim et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0023">23</link>) demonstrated that only 78% of 36 coagulase-negative staphylococci and 73% of 41 non-<emphasis>faecalis Enterococcus</emphasis> were accurately identified to the species level. A more recent study by Garza-Gonzalez et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0035">35</link>) indicates that these limitations are being addressed in updates to the platform, with over 500 coagulase-negative staphylococci exceeding 90% agreement and 200 <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> spp. exceeding 80% agreement with MALDI-TOF MS.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0051">More recent literature on the VITEK 2 system has focused on the accuracy of yeast panels compared to MALDI-TOF MS and nucleic acid sequencing. A study by Mizusawa et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0036">36</link>) demonstrated that none of the currently available automated identification systems were capable of accurately identifying the multidrug-resistant yeast <emphasis>Candida auris</emphasis>. Recent updates to the VITEK 2 database include the capability to identify <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>. However, a recent study showed the VITEK 2 (V 8.01) was only able to correctly identify 52% of 35 <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> isolates (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0037">37</link>). Misidentification occurred in 21% of the 35 isolates, with the most common misidentification (&gt;90%) being reported out as <emphasis>Candida duobushaemulonii</emphasis>.

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0052">The MicroScan WalkAway system by Beckman Coulter (Brea, CA) includes the autoSCAN-4, the WalkAway-40 Plus and the WalkAway-96 Plus, and the DxM MicroScan WalkAway system. The DxM MicroScan WalkAway instrument is an update to the WalkAway 40 and 96 Plus systems. It is an option for large laboratories, while smaller laboratories can use the autoSCAN-4 system, which reads one panel at a time. The DxM and the WalkAway Plus models automate incubation, test interpretations, and reagent control. The DxM has onboard illuminated indicators that provide information to the user regarding the overall status of the instrument including waste and reagent levels. By comparison, the autoSCAN-4 system automates only the reading portion of bacterial identification and susceptibility plates. Thus, offline incubation and handling of the plates are required with the autoSCAN-4 system. The LabPro Data management system, available for all instrument configurations, manages the ID and AST data generated by the WalkAway system. In addition, the LabPro Alert EX, a component of the LabPro software, combines the ID and AST data and analyzes them against predefined rules such as those contained in the CLSI M100 document (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0041">41</link>) or user-defined rules and notifies the end user of any unusual results. Finally, a third component of the software, LabPro MBT, takes the identification from the Bruker MALDI Biotyper and displays it within the LabPro data management system.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0053">The MicroScan system has a variety of panels that can provide identification results in as little as 2.5 h for the Rapid ID panels and 16 to 18 h for conventional panels. The workflow of the MicroScan is like others presented in this chapter. To inoculate the broth, users can manually generate a 0.5 McFarland suspension or use the Prompt inoculation system. This system uses the Prompt wand to touch three isolated colonies that are the same size or larger than the wand tip. The tip is then removed and placed into the Prompt bottle containing 30 ml of buffer, which is capped and shaken vigorously to ensure a homogeneous mixture. The mixture is poured into the seed plate. At this point the plate is inoculated using the RENOK rehydrating inoculator (recommended) or an alternative method. Plates are then sealed and barcoded prior to placement on the instrument or incubation offline. The conventional panels can be read on the instrument or manually if incubated offline. Rapid identification panels must be read by the instrument, as they utilize fluorogenic substrates and indicators.</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0054">There are no new large-scale studies evaluating the identification panels for the MicroScan WalkAway system. Although there have been no multicenter or large single-center studies, smaller studies have been occasionally published regarding the performance of this platform. In addition to the studies that follow, the reader is referred to the following publications to help gauge performance (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0042">42</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0047">47</link>). Lee et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0048">48</link>) showed that MicroScan correctly identified 153/154 <emphasis>A. baumannii</emphasis> group bloodstream isolates, though it struggled with non-<emphasis>baumannii Acinetobacter</emphasis> isolates for which there was no database entry. In the study, 22 non-<emphasis>baumannii Acinetobacter</emphasis> isolates were misidentified as <emphasis>A. lwoffi, A. baumannii/A. haemolyticus</emphasis>, or <emphasis>Providencia stuartii</emphasis> rather than giving no identification. A recent publication comparing the MicroScan WalkAway system to the BD Phoenix, VITEK 2, and MALD-TOF MS found that the MicroScan system demonstrated relatively poor performance with the identification of <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis>, misidentifying 20 of 71 isolates as <emphasis>Enterococcus casseliflavus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0049">49</link>). All other systems correctly identified the <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis> isolates, which were confirmed using whole-genome sequencing. Each instrument had lower identification rates of <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> compared to whole-genome sequencing. Previous studies by Iwen et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0050">50</link>) and Tritz et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0051">51</link>) showed better performance for <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. faecium</emphasis> with MicroScan. However, comparison between studies may be difficult given updates to taxonomy, the advent of MALDI-TOF MS, and the use of sequencing in the laboratory. Microorganisms of public health importance should be readily identified by automated identification systems. <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> is a highly drug-resistant, pathogenic yeast of public health importance. Since the last edition of this chapter, published studies continue to demonstrate that MicroScan misidentifies this yeast (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0036">36</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0052">52</link>). Misidentifications of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> included <emphasis>C. famata, C. guilliermondi</emphasis>, and other <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species. Of note, <emphasis>C. auris, C. haemulonii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. duobushaemulonii</emphasis> are not included in the MicroScan library.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0055">As the world struggles with health disparities, the MicroScan system was evaluated as a potential means of providing identification capability in resource-limited settings. Ombelet et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0053">53</link>) chose to evaluate the system and determine if it met the requirements for an affordable and transportable all-in-one bacteriology laboratory called the Mini-Lab Project. The decision was based on the ability to manually read the panels, in addition to their long shelf life. For the study, the authors included a research use only (RUO) panel that combined all test wells for the identification of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, the authors utilized the dried overnight Gram-positive ID type 3 (PID3) panel and the dried overnight Gram-negative ID type 2 (NID2) panel. The RUO, PID3, and NID2 panels are based on classical biochemicals and can be manually read, whereas the other MicroScan identification-only panels use fluorogenic substrates and must be read by a MicroScan instrument. The NID2 panel can identify 116 species while the PID3 can identify 51 species. The panels were tested against 367 isolates (332 clinical isolates and 35 reference strains) from various resource-limited areas throughout the world (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0053">53</link>). Of the 367 isolates, 195 were Gram-negative and 128 were Gram-positive. The three panels correctly identified 94.9% of Gram-negative isolates compared to 86% of Gram-positive isolates that are included in its database. Common misidentifications of Gram-positive isolates included <emphasis>Streptococcus mitis/oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus parasanguinis</emphasis>; and <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis> as <emphasis>Rhodococcus equi</emphasis> and <emphasis>Gemella</emphasis> species. The authors also found that when isolates not included in the database were tested, incorrect identifications with a high probability score were achieved with 53% (26/49) of the tested isolates. Testing isolates with the wrong panel (e.g., Gram-negative isolate on a Gram-positive panel) resulted in an incorrect identification with a high probability score for 32% (47/144) of the isolates. The highest risk of this type of misidentification occurred when Gram-negative isolates were inoculated into a Gram-positive panel. The lack of accuracy in the above scenarios represents a potential obstacle when trying to implement MicroScan in laboratories/medical sites with limited resources and expertise. This would be a barrier to its implementation as part of the Mini-Lab project. Despite these limitations, the study showed that MicroScan achieved a level of success and outperformed the accuracy of conventional biochemical testing performed in these settings. The authors concluded that some improvements to component stability, ease of use, and robustness are needed prior to widespread use in resource-limited settings, but overall, the results were promising for underserved areas of the world.</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0056">Thermo Scientific Sensititre (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) has two panels meant to identify the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, although they are best known for their standard and customizable broth microdilution AST panels. The identification panels are 96-well plates divided into 32-well sections, allowing for the identification of up to three bacterial isolates per plate. The wells on identification panels contain biochemicals adapted for fluorometric reading, meaning the end user cannot manually read these plates, which differs from Sensititre AST panels. The workflow for inoculation consists of using a nephelometer to generate a 0.5 McFarland suspension and then using a multichannel pipette or the automated inoculation delivery system (AIM) to inoculate the plates. Manual pipetting of plates will suffice for low-volume testing, though the use of the AIM decreases technician hands-on time, generates less aerosols, and produces a more consistent inoculation. Once the plates are inoculated, they can be scanned in and incubated on the ARIS HiQ or ARIS 2X instruments or placed in a standard incubator. Once the necessary incubation time has passed, the plates are read on the ARIS HiQ or, for smaller laboratories, the OptiRead. Results are generated in the form of an identification with a probability score denoting the confidence of the identification. Results are managed with the SWIN software, which has a bidirectional interface to allow results to transmit to the LIS. The SWIN software also flags biochemical results that are borderline positive or negative and will suggest supplemental testing to allow the end user to generate a definitive identification. Finally, the SWIN software assures that identification results match the expected AST results and will flag suspicious or discrepant results so that the end user may address them appropriately.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0057">The ARIS HiQ and ARIS 2X systems are benchtop automated plate management devices that combine incubation and plate reader functions. The ARIS HiQ is capable of handling 100 plates at a time. One other change incorporated into the new ARIS HiQ system is the ability to shuffle plates within the instrument, allowing for plate consolidation when it comes time for removal. Gram-negative plates can be read in as little as 5 h, although 18 h of incubation is required for definitive identification. Gram-positive panels are read at 18 h and then reincubated up to 24 h if no identification is provided during the first read. Compared to other automated systems, the clinical identification database is comparatively small and contains 42 Gram-positive and 128 Gram-negative entries. For veterinary laboratories, there are 148 Gram-negative entries. There are no contemporary studies evaluating the system’s performance with regard to identifying Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. A 1991 study comparing the API 20E for the identification of 120 clinical Gram-negative isolates and 12 ATCC reference strains found the Sensititre Gram-negative identification had 65% concordance after 5 h, which rose to 82.5% after 18 h of incubation (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0054">54</link>). When only the ATCC strains were considered, concordance was merely 66.6% at 5 h but achieved 100% following 18 h of incubation. A 2010 study by Garza-Gonzalez et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0032">32</link>) studied the ability of the system’s Gram-positive identification panel to identify coagulase-negative staphylococci and found that, using the Sensititre GPID, only 68.9% of isolates were identified correctly. This may be due in part to the limited number of Gram-positive taxa represented in the system’s database, which may limit the panel’s utility.</para>

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0058">MIDI, Inc. (Newark, DE;<ulink url="http://www.midi-inc.com">www.midi-inc.com</ulink>), manufactures the Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIS), which has been available since 1991; it emerged from a partnership between Hewlett-Packard Co. (now Agilent Technologies) and the University of Delaware’s Plant Pathology Department. The system can identify a broad range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (approximately 1,500 species) by gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of cellular fatty acids (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0055">55</link>). Prior to extraction, organisms to be tested are subcultured to specific media and incubated for 24 h; then a defined biomass is transferred to culture tubes for fatty acid extraction before GC analysis is performed. The extraction method requires about 90 min for a batch of 30 samples and kills the organism in the process, making it safe to use with select agents. The analytical run time is then 9 min per sample. The Sherlock MIS software identifies the sample by qualitative and quantitative pattern matching of the unknown fatty acid profile to stored libraries of known species. In 2017, MIDI established a partnership with Shimadzu Scientific Instruments (SSI) to establish the Sherlock Chromatographic Analysis System (CAS), which enables Shimadzu GC-2010/2030 to perform fatty acid analysis and microbial identification similar to the MIS. The Sherlock MIS and CAS are used as reference methods in plant pathology, by environmental laboratories, and in some clinical laboratories (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0056">56</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0058">58</link>). The Sherlock MIS was AOAC (Association of Official Agricultural Chemists) International and FDA 510(k) cleared in 2006 for the identification of <emphasis>Bacillus anthracis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0059">59</link>). The Sherlock Mycobacteria Identification System (MYCO-LCS) has been used since 2003 to identify mycobacteria and related species by high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of cellular mycolic acids. The Sherlock MYCO-LCS was FDA 510(k) cleared in 2003 for the identification of <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> from solid growth media and can separate <emphasis>Mycobacterium bovis</emphasis> BCG from the <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> complex (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0060">60</link>). A study by Parrish et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0061">61</link>) demonstrated the ability of Sherlock MYCO-LCS to use HPLC analysis of total mycolic acid to determine the susceptibility testing of first-line agents currently used against <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis>. Based on current information from the manufacturer, the Sherlock MYCO-LCS is now considered a legacy product, and new systems are no longer sold (<ulink url="http://midi-inc.com">http://midi-inc.com</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0059">The Biolog Microbial Identification Systems (Biolog, Hayward, CA) were introduced in 1989. While they are not currently approved for human<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic use, they are extensively used in agricultural and veterinary laboratories. The system identifies organisms based on their ability to utilize or oxidize a panel of 71 carbon sources, in addition to determining reactivity to 27 chemical assays (such as lactic acid and salt tolerance). The test system uses a 96-well microtiter plate, with each well containing a specific substrate plus a patented tetrazolium dye as an indicator of carbon source/chemical utilization (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0062">62</link>). A single GEN III MicroPlate is used for the identification of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. There are also separate MicroPlates for identifying anaerobes, yeast, and filamentous fungi. The MicroPlates can be manually incubated and read, or they can be analyzed using the MicroStation ID System, an automated reader which provides consistency and accuracy in reading reaction patterns (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0063">63</link>). An automated OmniLog ID system has the capacity to incubate, monitor, and analyze up to 50 Biolog MicroPlates (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0063">63</link>). The current Biolog database contains over 2,900 species of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and fungi (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0063">63</link>). A specialized software tool, the RetroSpect 2.0, supports data management and generation of customizable reports. A requirement for testing is subculture of isolates to proprietary Biolog universal growth agar (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0062">62</link>). There are several published studies assessing the Biolog system over the last 2 decades (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0056">56</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0062">62</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0064">64</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0065">65</link>). The most recent, comprehensive study was reported by Wragg et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0065">65</link>) and compared the Biolog GEN III aerobic MicroPlate (GEN III database, version 5.2.1) with MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for the identification of 100 bacterial isolates recovered from clinical veterinary specimens. Fifty-six isolates were correctly identified to species level, a further 29 to genus level, and 15 could not be identified even though they were represented in the database. These latter organisms were described as “less metabolically active” than the correctly identified isolates. None of the organisms was misidentified (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0065">65</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0060">The BIOMIC V3 (Giles Scientific, Santa Barbara, CA) is an open digital imaging system that automates the reading and interpretation of manual identification kits. The system is programmed to read API panels (bioMérieux), RapID tests (Thermo Scientific), MicroScan WalkAway Identification (Beckman-Coulter) Crystal panels (Becton Dickinson), and identification systems offered by Liofilchem (Terramo, Italy). The manual identification panels are incubated offline, after which the user manually places the plate or test onto the instrument for analysis. The system can be interfaced to allow transmission of test results and images to an LIS. The BIOMIC can also be used in the reading and interpretation of disk diffusion tests and gradient strip susceptibility testing. A multilaboratory study of BIOMIC reading of MicroScan identification panels found an overall agreement of 99.5% with 846 Gram-negative isolates and 99.5% agreement with 430 Gram-positive isolates compared to reading by the MicroScan WalkAway (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0066">66</link>), demonstrating that the BIOMIC can serve as a backup to analyze panels from automated systems when the primary platform is down, versus reading the panels manually.</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0063">MALDI-TOF MS is a proteomic technique that can identify bacteria and fungi from a variety of solid media, and from broth in the case of mycobacteria and fungi. MALDI-TOF MS was developed in the 1980s and has been used in research laboratories for decades. The first FDA-cleared instruments for bacterial identification were approved for use in the United States in 2013. Many of the clinical MALDI-TOF MS systems throughout the world, along with their regulatory status, are listed in<anchor id="ch0021s000000a0044"/><link linkend="ch0021s000000a0045">Table 4</link>. This chapter will focus on the two most frequently used systems: the Bruker Biotyper and the bioMérieux VITEK MS. In April of 2021, Hardy Diagnostics (Santa Maria, CA) announced its partnership with Autobio (Zhengzhou, China) to market and distribute the Autof ms 1000. This device received its CE mark in 2018 and is currently undergoing the process for FDA 510(k) clearance. There are few publications on the performance of the system compared to the Bruker and VITEK offerings, so it will not be discussed further. However, the publications that do exist have generally found the platform to perform comparably to the Bruker Biotyper and the VITEK MS systems for bacteria and yeast (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0067">67</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0069">69</link>). Regardless of the platform, the general principles of MALDI-TOF MS are the same.</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0065">MALDI-TOF MS begins by using a loop, toothpick, or other sterile device to transfer a small portion of a bacterial or yeast colony to a spot on a MALDI-TOF MS target plate and overlaying the spot with matrix (<anchor id="ch0021s000000a0048"/><link linkend="ch0021s000000a0051">Fig. 1</link>). For yeasts or bacteria that yield unacceptable results with direct testing, on-plate formic acid protein extraction may provide an acceptable identification. The use of formic acid in this manner may also be referred to as an extended direct transfer (eDT) procedure (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0070">70</link>). Acid-fast bacilli and filamentous fungi require a more formal extraction utilizing chemical and physical methods to disrupt cells. Commercial kits are available from bioMérieux for processing molds, <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> spp., and mycobacterial isolates. Such kits provide standardized extraction and processing, though common processes used in the lab are outlined below.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0066">Mycobacteria extraction can occur by a variety of methods, as summarized by Alcaide et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0071">71</link>). Extraction begins by suspending a biomass in water, followed by heat inactivation at 95°C for 30 min, which is followed by suspension in ethanol at a final concentration of 75%. If cell disruption occurs by sonication, the mass is centrifuged and the ethanol is allowed to evaporate. Acetonitrile and zirconia/silica or glass beads are added and vortexed for 5 s, followed by sonication for 15 min. Seventy percent formic acid is added to the sample and vortexed. The sample is then centrifuged, and the supernatant is pipetted onto a MALDI target plate. Bead beating is an alternative to sonication and involves a 1-min bead-beating step followed by transfer of the liquid to a new, clean tube, centrifugation, and removal of the supernatant. Once the pellet is thoroughly dried, formic acid is added, followed by acetonitrile after a 5-min incubation step. The extract is then pipetted onto a MALDI target. Bruker’s MycoEx protocol consists of 1 min of vortexing the biomass in the presence of acetonitrile after heat inactivation and ethanol treatment. Formic acid is added and the sample is further vortexed. After a centrifugation step, the supernatant is pipetted onto a MALDI target. The spots are then overlaid with matrix consisting of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 50% acetonitrile and 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid.</para>

A colony from an acceptable culture plate is picked and smeared evenly as a thin film on a spot on the target plate. The target plate can be a reusable or a disposable plate or slide, depending on the system. Formic acid is applied to the target as applicable and allowed to dry. This is followed by the addition of matrix. Once dried, the target plate is placed into the mass spectrometer, where a mass spectrum is generated and compared against the system’s database. Results are displayed as an identification (<emphasis>Candida parapsilosis</emphasis> in position A4 in the example).

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0067">There are numerous extraction protocols for fungi that vary primarily in their preprocessing steps, such as bead beating and heat inactivation. Extraction of fungi involves transferring the leading edge of the mycelium or other part of the fungal biomasss to ultra-pure water with low UV absorbance and a specific conductivity (16 to 18 mega ohms). The suspension is pelleted, then resuspended in 70% ethanol. The fungal mass is then pelleted and allowed to air dry after removal of the supernatant. From 10 to 100 μl of formic acid is added to the dried biomass and incubated for 5 min, followed by an equal volume of acetonitrile and a 10-min incubation period. The suspended fungal mass is then centrifuged and 1 μl of supernatant is added to a MALDI target. Extraction from liquid media proceeds in the same fashion after pelleting 1.5 ml of sediment from liquid culture (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0072">72</link>). Once the extraction is completed, the material is spotted onto a MALDI target plate and overlaid with matrix.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0068">The matrix is integral to the performance of MALDI-TOF MS. The matrix absorbs the energy from the laser to create an ionization state without fragmenting the proteins. The ability of the matrix to prevent the fragmentation of proteins makes MALDI-TOF MS a soft ionization technique. Once the matrix has dried, the plate is placed into the instrument and enters the ionization chamber. In the ionization chamber, a laser transfers its energy to the spots, which leads to desorption of the matrix, proteins, and other biomolecules into a gaseous plume of matrix and sample. During desorption, energy from the laser is transferred to the matrix, which then transfers its charge to proteins during the random collisions taking place in the ionization chamber. Once desorption and ionization take place, the proteins are accelerated through the positively charged time-of-flight (TOF) tube. This tube is under a vacuum, and the proteins are separated by their mass-to-charge (<emphasis>m/z</emphasis>) ratio, which is equivalent to the mass of the protein because the charge imparted by ionization is typically +1 (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0073">73</link>). The proteins collide with the ion detector at the end of the flight tube, with smaller proteins colliding with the detector first. The information gathered from the ion detector is then processed, with the output being a mass spectrum (<anchor id="ch0021s000000a0052"/><link linkend="ch0021s000000a0055">Fig. 2</link>). This mass spectrum consists of the most abundant proteins, which are usually ribosomal proteins. The identification algorithms between the two predominant commercial systems are somewhat different. Bruker’s Biotyper system employs a pattern-matching algorithm that generates a score from 0 to 3.000. Scores above 2.0 are considered high-confidence identifications, corresponding to a species-level identification. Scores of 1.7 to 1.999 are considered low confidence and should be followed up with on-plate formic acid extraction or a more traditional extraction method. It is possible for some laboratories to report species-level identification in this range, but proper validation of a lowered score must be completed before reporting such results. Scores below 1.7 are interpreted as no identification. bioMérieux’s VITEK MS uses a bin-weight matrix that computes a result based on the spectra of multiple strains for each species represented in the database. The spectra are divided into 1,300 bins in which the presence or absence of peaks is recorded. The bins are weighted such that bins specific for one species are weighted higher than those that are not as specific for that species. The sample’s spectrum is compared to the bin-weight matrix matched to individual species and normalized by the advanced spectrum classifier. The identification is reported with a confidence score ranging from 0 to 99%, with a color-coded confidence level of green (high confidence), yellow (medium confidence), or red (no identification). Identifications with medium confidence require further review and may be acceptable based upon additional laboratory data and validation.</para>

The target plate is placed in the mass spectrometer. Spots to be analyzed are shot by a laser, desorbing microbial and matrix molecules from the target plate. Charge is transferred from the matrix to microbial molecules, and the ionized molecules are funneled through a positively charged electrostatic field into the mass analyzer, a tube under vacuum. The ions travel toward an ion detector, with the smallest analytes traveling fastest, followed by progressively larger analytes. As ions emerge from the mass analyzer, they run into the ion detector, thereby generating a mass spectrum representing the number of ions hitting the detector over time. Although separation is by mass-to-charge ratio, since the charge is typically single for the described application, separation is by molecular weight.

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0069">The performance characteristics of both MALDI-TOF MS systems are exceptional (<anchor id="ch0021s000000a0056"/><link linkend="ch0021s000000a0059">Table 5</link>). Therefore, the decision as to which instrument to purchase is largely (although not entirely) based on equipment present in the laboratory, as each manufacturer has middleware capable of communicating with other instruments within their branded offerings. While middleware solutions exist for use across differently branded instruments, it may require substantial time for the laboratory and the LIS team to build and validate the middleware interface. It is important for readers to exercise caution when using published studies as aids in their decision-making, as databases for both systems have undergone significant updates to greatly expand the number of microorganisms able to be identified and have increased the number of database entries to enhance identification accuracy, thus limiting the usefulness of studies based on previous database versions. In addition, some studies examine the accuracy of RUO or laboratory-generated databases, adding to the potential confusion of laboratory personnel who are considering purchasing their first MALDI-TOF instrument.</para>

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0071">One of the historic shortcomings of the Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS has been differentiating between<emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> from other members of the <emphasis>Streptococcus mitis</emphasis> group. The latest evaluation of the Bruker Biotyper examined its ability to accurately identify <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> from other <emphasis>S. mitis</emphasis> group streptococci (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0070">70</link>). In the study, all 30 <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> isolates were identified correctly using a combination of direct transfer, extended direct transfer, or tube extraction. Two out of 73 <emphasis>S. mitis</emphasis> group, non-<emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> isolates were misidentified using the direct or on-target extraction method. Correct identification of the two isolates was achieved using formal extraction. Yahiaoui and colleagues (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0074">74</link>) also assessed the performance of the Bruker database and found that use of ethanol-formic acid extraction accurately identified 495 of the 496 isolates of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. However, only 37 of 83 non-<emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> isolates were correctly identified (45%), suggesting that users should continue to use additional testing such as bile solubility or optochin disk to aid in their identification of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. The VITEK MS also accurately identifies <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. van Prehn et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0075">75</link>) studied the ability of the VITEK MS (database version 3.2.0) and the Bruker microflex (verison 3.1.66) to differentiate species within the <emphasis>S. mitis</emphasis> subgroup using PCR assays targeting <emphasis>lytA</emphasis>, Spn9802, and <emphasis>recA</emphasis> as the reference method.

The Bruker microflex identified 9/11 <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>, 0/13 <emphasis>S. pseudopneumoniae</emphasis>, and 13/13 <emphasis>S. mitis/oralis</emphasis> correctly. A single-center study with a larger collection of isolates examined the performance of the VITEK MS (database version 2.0) to differentiate <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> from other members of the <emphasis>S. mitis</emphasis> group (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0076">76</link>). Branda et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0076">76</link>) found that 94/95 (95%) of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> isolates were correctly identified, with one isolate resulting in no identification. For other members of the <emphasis>S. mitis</emphasis> group, only 1 of 116 was misidentified as <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>.

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0072">Laboratories inevitably encounter organisms such as<emphasis>Francisella tularensis, Brucella</emphasis> species, and other organisms that are considered select agents. These microorganisms should not be routinely identified using commercial id systems, including by MALDI-TOF MS. The reason for this is 2-fold. First, processing samples for MALDI-TOF MS represents a hazard to the staff working with the microorganism. Although the process is theoretically safe if performed in a biosafety cabinet, there is debate whether the microorganisms can survive the formic acid or matrix overlay. A study by Cunningham et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0078">78</link>) suggested that overlaying a potentially hazardous bacterial colony with formic acid or matrix inactivates the bacteria, thus rendering it safe to test via MALDI-TOF MS. However, this is contradicted by a study by Rudrik et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0079">79</link>), which showed that 18% of isolates subjected to direct or extended direct preparation methods remained viable, presenting an exposure and health risk to staff. The second issue with identifying select agents in the laboratory is the potential for misidentification. In theory, select agents should yield no identification by the Bruker and VITEK MS methods as these organisms are not included in the commercial databases, with the exception of <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis>, which is included in the VITEK MS FDA-cleared database. Bruker’s security relevant database and users of the RUO SARAMIS Knowledge Base V4.16 database on the VITEK MS may find that misidentifications of these microorganisms occur. Common misidentifications include <emphasis>Burkholderia mallei</emphasis> as <emphasis>Burkholderia thailandensis, Bacillus anthracis</emphasis> as <emphasis>Bacillus cereus</emphasis> group, and <emphasis>Yersinia pestis</emphasis> as <emphasis>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0079">79</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0086">Mycobacteria have a waxy cell wall that necessitates a formal protein extraction process, as mentioned earlier in this chapter. Some laboratories have had success with alternative processing methods such as heat inactivation; however, required incubation time may delay testing more than chemical inactivation and bead beating. Several studies have evaluated various extraction protocols with success (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0080">80</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0082">82</link>). Currently the VITEK MS has FDA clearance to identify mycobacteria from solid and liquid media, with the latter requiring additional processing steps and consumables. The FDA-cleared database of the VITEK MS includes 19 claimed entries. According to the package insert, <emphasis>Mycobacterium fortuitum</emphasis> and <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis> are reported at the group and complex level, respectively. Species-level identification within these groups is difficult to distinguish with MALDI-TOF MS. RUO and, in some laboratories, user-created libraries are available to identify <emphasis>Mycobacteria</emphasis> spp. In an interesting finding, Leyer et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0083">83</link>) determined that the IVD 3.0 library for the VITEK MS outperformed the SARAMIS 4.12 VITEK MS-Plus RUO database when identifying nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM). From solid media, the IVD library identified 94% of 111 isolates correctly, compared to 67% for the SARAMIS 4.12 database. In MGIT (BD) broth, the IVD library identified 91% of 108 mycobacteria correctly, compared to the SARAMIS library at 62% (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0083">83</link>). Rodriguez-Sanchez et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0084">84</link>) found similar accuracy when comparing the Bruker Mycobacteria Library v3.0 to v2.0 of the library. These authors found that the v3.0 library identified 91.7% of 109 NTM with a high level of confidence, compared to 83.5% with the v2.0 library (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0084">84</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0087">Yeast species are included in both the Bruker and VITEK FDA-cleared databases, while only the VITEK MS includes filamentous molds in its FDA-cleared databases. Yeasts are processed in much the same way as bacteria, using either the direct or eDT/on plate formic acid extraction method. Performance of both databases has been found to be excellent for common yeasts, and current versions of the library can identify<emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0068">68</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0085">85</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0087">87</link>). <link linkend="ch0021s000000a0059">Table 5</link> provides information on the performance of these databases on yeasts and filamentous fungi. Filamentous fungi present a challenge for MALDI-TOF MS users. Extraction methods have typically involved chemical inactivation of the mold with 70% ethanol, followed by various downstream processing steps to eventually yield a protein extract that undergoes MALDI-TOF MS analysis. When users examine the literature, they should exercise caution when comparing studies, as several variables aside from the library used can affect the accuracy of identification, including methods used to extract proteins, incubation temperature, age of the fungal culture, media used to grow the fungus, and, if on solid agar, the area of mycelium chosen for analysis (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0088">88</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0089">89</link>). All of these could impact the quality of the result generated by MALDI-TOF MS. A recent study by Lau et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0090">90</link>) evaluated the National Institutes of Health Mold database and the Bruker filamentous fungus database across eight academic centers utilizing the Bruker Biotyper in the United States. The performance varied from 33 to 77% accuracy, highlighting the need for standardization (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0090">90</link>). With the clearance of the latest version of the VITEK MS database, a kit was constructed to standardize the method of extraction, allowing users to take some of the guesswork out of the processing steps. The kit utilizes ethanol to inactivate the organisms and acetonitrile and formic acid to extract the proteins. A recent study by Shin et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0091">91</link>) assessed the ability of the VITEK MS v3.2 system along with the VITEK MS Mould Kit to correctly identify a library of 105 clinical filamentous fungi compared to sequence-based identification. Initial testing yielded a 59% accuracy, but retesting isolates not identified during initial testing increased the overall accuracy to 80%. VITEK MS provided 95% and 78% identification rates for <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> and dermatophytes, respectively (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0091">91</link>). For processing of molds for Bruker’s MBT filamentous fungi library, readers are referred to the beginning of the proteomic section of this chapter, <ulink url="ch0141#ch0141s0001">chapter 120</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>, and external references <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0092">92</link> through <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0094">94</link>. While the Bruker Biotyper does not have a standardized kit for extracting molds, it does have the ability for users to create custom databases which has proven useful for the identification of molds. A Bruker database constructed from 294 isolates (both reference strains and clinical isolates) was assessed using 421 clinical isolates identified in parallel, using morphology followed by sequencing to resolve any discrepancies between MALDI-TOF and morphologic identification (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0095">95</link>). The custom database provided species-level identification for 89% of the isolates, and there were no incorrect identifications. Many laboratories have moved to using MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of dimorphic fungi. The latest version of the VITEK MS library, v3.0, was found to identify 100% of isolates including <emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis/posadasii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Sporothrix schenkii</emphasis> complex to the species of complex level (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0096">96</link>). The use of custom, user-built MALDI-TOF databases with other platforms has also been shown to aid in the identification of dimorphic molds including <emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0097">97</link>), <emphasis>Sporothrix brasiliensis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0098">98</link>), and <emphasis>Talaromyces marneffei</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0099">99</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0088">MALDI-TOF MS has proven itself to be revolutionary in the clinical microbiology laboratory. End users experience significantly decreased turnaround times for a fraction of the price of automated biochemical cards and plates (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0100">100</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0102">102</link>). Recent updates by both manufacturers have led to the introduction of new instruments with purported improvements in the speed of target acquisition and decreases in time to generate a vacuum. Bruker has added a negative ion mode to increase future capability (e.g., detection of colistin resistance), while bioMérieux has added walkaway slide loading functionality and a slide prioritization feature. While there are many clear advantages to MALDI-TOF MS, a major hurdle to adopting this technology is the substantial initial cost, which can easily exceed $200,000.00 USD. Many laboratories in smaller community and rural hospitals may find it difficult to justify such an exorbitant expense in an environment that is constantly looking for ways to reduce costs. Ambitious users, in all their excitement for a faster and seemingly more accurate testing platform, may view the MALDI-TOF MS as a means to remove antiquated methods such as the Gram stain, automated identification systems, and rapid biochemical testing, but such thoughts are foolhardy. MALDI-TOF MS is not perfect, and there are sources of variability including the age of the culture and media used to cultivate the isolate (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0103">103</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0105">105</link>). Gram stain provides confirmation when the morphology on the plate does not match the identification. Rapid biochemical testing, such as spot indole for <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, may provide a faster identification than MALDI-TOF MS. The automated biochemical identification platforms discussed earlier in the chapter serve as a backup to MALDI-TOF when the instrument is down for service or maintenance. In addition, these platforms can confirm unique identifications when MALDI-TOF MS yields an unusual or partial identification. That said, the limitations of the backup system must be kept in mind when adjudicating results between identification methods.</para>

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0089">DNA target sequencing may be performed on organisms growing in pure culture. This is typically performed when automated systems in the laboratory are unable to yield an identification or they provide an unusual identification or one that conflicts with phenotypic characteristics. For a comprehensive review on sequencing-based identification, refer to articles and guidelines that specifically address this topic (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0106">106</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0108">108</link>). The selection of DNA targets to identify bacteria and fungi relies on the concept that some genes have conserved segments flanking variable regions. Conserved regions of gene targets allow for the use of generic or universal primers in the identification of any bacteria or fungi. Variable regions have unique nucleotide sequences, enabling sequencing-based identification of a genus and species. The gene target most used for bacterial identification is the 16S rRNA gene (16S ribosomal DNA), an approximately 1,500-bp gene that encodes a portion of the 30S ribosomal subunit (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0106">106</link>). Partial (500-bp) 16S rRNA gene sequencing is commonly used for sequence-based identification of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, and mycobacteria (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0106">106</link>). For genera with high conservation of the 16S rRNA gene, a full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing or sequencing of an alternative target may be useful. Examples of alternative DNA targets for sequence-based bacterial identification include <emphasis>rpoB</emphasis> (the β subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase), <emphasis>tuf</emphasis> (elongation factor Tu), <emphasis>gyrA</emphasis> or <emphasis>gyrB</emphasis> (gyrase A or B), <emphasis>sodA</emphasis> (manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase), and heat shock proteins (<anchor id="ch0021s000000a0069"/><link linkend="ch0021s000000a0070">Table 6</link>). Although alternative targets may provide better discrimination between species than the 16S rRNA gene, because they are less conserved, genus- or group-specific primers are often required. In addition, there may be fewer sequence database entries for comparative analysis with these genes than exist for the 16S rRNA gene. Potential targets for identification of yeasts and medically relevant molds include the internal transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2, which are variable regions located between conserved genes encoding 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs and the D1-D2 region of 28S rRNA (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0109">109</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0110">110</link>) (<link linkend="ch0021s000000a0070">Table 6</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0021s000000p0091">The initial amplification of the cultured organism can be performed in the microbiology laboratory using a standard thermocycler. Once the PCR is complete, the amplified product is typically sent to a core molecular facility for sequencing using chain-termination sequencing, also referred to as Sanger sequencing. While it is possible for a microbiology laboratory to purchase its own sequencing platform, the use of such a platform is only needed in instances where more commonplace methods are unable to provide an acceptable identification. Therefore, it is often difficult for a clinical laboratory to justify the purchase and maintenance of a sequencing platform that will rarely be used (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0111">111</link>). Once the sequence is obtained, it is compared to reference sequences found in public (e.g., GenBank) and/or private (e.g., MicroSEQ ID [Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA], SmartGene [Lausanne, Switzerland], and/or Ripseq [Pathogenomix Inc., Santa Cruz, CA]) databases. After comparing the query and reference sequences, the number of nucleotide matches between the query and reference sequences are used to determine relatedness and the result is reported as percent identity. The acceptable percent identity to identify a microorganism to the genus or species level is variable and depends on the DNA target and microorganism. 16S rRNA genes are multicopy targets in most bacteria, and variations in sequence among 16S rRNA genes in single organisms can result in difficulty interpreting sequence data (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0106">106</link>). A computer program and database called Ripseq Mixed for Sanger (Pathogenomix Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) can be used to computationally deconvolute underlying sequences in such cases. Nucleotide databases must be carefully evaluated for accuracy, quality of sequence data, frequencies of database updates, software, cost, and breadth of nucleotide entries. The advantage of public databases is that they contain a multitude of entries, but they are not curated, and anyone can submit sequencing data without verification of its accuracy. The private databases are fully annotated but often have fewer entries (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0106">106</link>). The CLSI published a consensus document for identifying microorganisms to the genus and species levels by DNA target sequencing (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0108">108</link>). This document can serve as a useful guide for laboratorians who wish to pursue or have already implemented DNA target sequencing.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0092">The introduction of massively parallel sequencing, also called NGS, into clinical laboratories has provided the capacity to obtain the genetic sequence of an organism’s entire genome (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0111">111</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0113">113</link>). The information provided by such a powerful tool goes far beyond simple organism identification. Sequence analysis of an organism’s entire genome has the potential to provide information about the diversity of the species, their virulence properties, strain typing, and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0113">113</link>). While it can also be used for routine pathogen identification, the cost is prohibitive for this purpose.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0093">Beyond identification of isolates, sequencing strategies can be used to identify bacteria and yeast directly from patient specimens. Sequencing direct from samples, also known as metagenomics, has become common in recent years (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0112">112</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0114">114</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0115">115</link>). This service is typically provided by reference laboratories and has found success with tissues, respiratory fluids and secretions, and body fluids that are otherwise considered sterile. A full description of the steps involved in the sequencing workflow is beyond the scope of this chapter, but briefly, the process is as follows. First, the DNA is extracted from samples. Proteinase K treatment is typically required prior to extracting DNA from tissues. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues require further processing prior to DNA extraction (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0116">116</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0117">117</link>). Laboratories may also use kits that selectively lyse human cells and remove human DNA from the sample.</para>

      <beginpage pagenum="115"/>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0094">After removal of the host DNA, bacterial or fungal DNA is usually liberated by means of physical and/or enzymatic action, after which the microbial DNA can be extracted. At this point, the extract can undergo subsequent targeted PCR (targeted metagenomics) or shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Targeted metagenomics is performed using target-specific PCR, such as the 16S rRNA gene for bacterial DNA or ITS for fungal DNA. Shotgun metagenomics is performed by sequencing all of the DNA within the extract without any prior enrichment. Targeted metagenomic workflows can leverage Sanger sequencing or NGS technologies. Shotgun metagenomics utilizes NGS exclusively. In either case, if NGS is utilized, subsequent library preparation and workflow steps are completed in advance.</para>
      <para id="ch0021s000000p0095">Correlation of sequencing results with culture has typically been very good. Gomez et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0118">118</link>) reported a sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 98.2% in patients with a known diagnosis of invasive fungal infection. Interestingly, the authors found no difference in sensitivity of fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. For patients with proven invasive fungal disease, a fungal pathogen was found in 71.3% (57/80) of samples meeting EORTC/MSG criteria and in 17.6% (3/17) of patient samples that did not. Many studies have shown utility of broad-range sequencing in the setting of infective endocarditis (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0119">119</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0120">120</link>), to the point that some have called for its inclusion in the Duke Criteria for infective endocarditis. In a multiyear review of 16S rDNA sequencing, Miller et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0121">121</link>) found the sensitivity and specificity of 16S rDNA sequencing to be 92.0% and 77.8%, compared to heart valve tissue culture (46% and 100%) and Gram stain of the heart valve tissue (26% and 100%), respectively. Similar studies have also used this method to identify pathogens causing periprosthetic joint and respiratory infections (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0122">122</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0125">125</link>). Care must be taken to minimize the risk of contamination, and appropriate thresholds must be set so that background or low-level contamination is not incorporated into a patient’s result, as this could have adverse consequences (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0126">126</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0128">128</link>). CLSI provides guidance on identification of bacteria and fungi by DNA sequencing from extraction to amplification and the use of controls and data interpretation and reporting (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0108">108</link>). Currently, all sequence-based methods for identification of bacterial and fungal pathogens from culture or directly from patient specimens are laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) and must undergo rigorous internal validation prior to being used for patient testing. Next-generation sequencing generates a tremendous amount of data that require a significant digital storage infrastructure and bioinformatics expertise in order to translate the data into an interpretable report. Microbiology laboratories must consider these needs carefully if they are interested in pursuing such innovative methods (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0112">112</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0096">Selecting an identification platform for purchase is one of the most significant decisions the laboratory will make. Such decisions should be made in consultation with appropriate stakeholders and experts. In addition to the laboratory personnel, stakeholders include information technology (IT), LIS analysts, and building engineering to assess infrastructure needs. Infectious diseases and pharmacy services should also be consulted, as these identification systems often have antimicrobial susceptibility testing capability combined with alerts for multidrug-resistant organisms. Input from and partnership with these stakeholders are crucial to ensuring that everyone’s needs are met. Often the list of potential vendors can be narrowed based on some fundamental questions. Perhaps the most significant question is what benefit the patient will receive from the laboratory adopting the new system. Second, the laboratory should ask how the test system will provide a benefit to the laboratory (e.g., streamlined workflow, simpler interfaces, more robust identifications or shortened turnaround times). Other aspects to address include the capability of the platform to fit (literally and figuratively) into the laboratory environment without extensive overhauls to the LIS or physical environment. The type of IT access will need to be determined, as well as evaluating whether current institutional security protocols will allow for remote access by the vendor to upload updates and assist in troubleshooting. If remote access is not an option, it will be important to ensure the vendor can provide the level of service needed to properly operate and maintain the equipment. An initial review of published, peer-reviewed data and feedback from current users can help further narrow the options. First-generation instruments and instruments that fall below 95% accuracy for common isolates should be looked at skeptically, if not dismissed outright. Once a potential list of testing platforms is generated, a more formal request for information or request for proposal (RFP) can be conducted. Questions in this process are often more thorough, and during this time vendors may present their testing platform to the laboratory and stakeholders.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0097">During an RFP, a deeper dive into peer-reviewed publications can help tease out differences in testing platforms that may be important to the laboratory. If the laboratory cannot readily access such publications, vendors can provide them. In addition to literature reviews, site visits can be arranged by vendors and are an invaluable source of information during the decision-making process. During a site visit, laboratory personnel can view the workflow in the setting of a functioning laboratory. The observing laboratory should use this opportunity to ask questions regarding performance of the platform, workflow issues the laboratory has encountered, and the performing laboratory’s thoughts on the performance of the equipment. If the laboratory schedules multiple site visits, an effort should be made to ensure that the same staff attend each visit so that accurate comparisons can be made.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0098">A final consideration when deciding on an automated identification platform is whether the platform includes antimicrobial susceptibility testing. It is unlikely that an automated platform selected for identification of microorganisms (other than MALDI-TOF MS) would not have a susceptibility component. The laboratory needs to ensure that the performance and capability of antimicrobial susceptibility testing provided by the system meets the needs of the laboratory. It is not unreasonable to accept a lower performance on pathogen identification if it means gaining a higher performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing instrument. Susceptibility testing platforms are covered in<ulink url="ch0093#ch0093s0001">chapter 75</ulink>.</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0099">Once equipment is purchased and placed in the laboratory, the process of verification or validation can begin. Verification is the one-time process to determine performance characteristics before a test is placed into service, while validation establishes the performance characteristics of the test. The latter is most often utilized with FDA-modified or laboratory-developed tests. There are numerous guidance documents and peer-reviewed literature to direct laboratories through the verification and validation process. Sources of guidance are found in<anchor id="ch0021s000000a0077"/><link linkend="ch0021s000000a0078">Table 7</link> and in the references at the end of this chapter (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0129">129</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0133">133</link>). For unmodified FDA-approved tests, laboratories are required to verify the following characteristics: accuracy, precision, reportable range, and reference range. Validation of FDA-modified or laboratory-developed tests also requires studies assessing their analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity as well as other characteristics such as interference and specimen stability, as appropriate. The accuracy of an identification platform should be at least 90% overall and 95% for common microorganisms. The overall minimum of 90% accuracy allows for discrepant results due to improvements in databases, libraries, and technology. Ideally, laboratories would use a third method as an adjudicator of discrepant results and determine the final accuracy based on that adjudication. For modified FDA or laboratory-developed tests, accuracy should be 95% or higher. MALDI-TOF MS is unique in that users may have the ability to see unclaimed identifications in addition to identifications from the FDA-cleared database. Laboratories may also have access to RUO databases or create their own. Users must validate any unclaimed identifications as a laboratory-developed test, including acceptance of lower scores, and patient results must include language denoting that the results were generated with a laboratory-developed test. In addition to guidance laid out by CLIA ’88, some states such as New York have their own requirements for verification/validation before a test is put into service for patients of their state. The rules can typically be found on the state websites.</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0101">As of 1998, the FDA no longer performs premarket [510(k)] evaluations to “clear” identification systems. An in-depth look at recent FDA submissions for combination identification/antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems shows the submissions focused on antimicrobial susceptibility testing. MALDI-TOF MS and methods utilizing probes and nucleic acid amplification test technologies are still required to undergo premarket evaluation. Because of the lack of oversight of identification platforms, it is imperative that laboratories delve into the literature to help guide their verification studies and understand the limitations of the platform they have purchased. Regardless of the size and resources of the laboratory, verification studies should be of suitable rigor to support its clinical implementation. Laboratories in the community, reference laboratories, colleagues, and vendors may all have resources such as bacterial or fungal isolates to aid in these studies. Freezing of rare or unusual isolates will improve the breadth of verification studies. Low-volume laboratories may also consider freezing routine isolates to ensure that any accuracy studies encompass microorganisms routinely encountered in their laboratory.</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0102">Although technology has improved overall performance and efficiency in the clinical microbiology laboratory, managers and supervisors should be aware of the limitations in using automated platforms. A common issue encountered in the laboratory is the constant taxonomy updates that are published. There is often a lag between these taxonomy changes and when manufacturers update their databases. While there are questions regarding the clinical relevance of such name changes, especially for established microorganisms, regulatory agencies such as the College of American Pathologists require these updates. Users should consult resources such as the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen and MycoBank databases, or the<emphasis>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</emphasis> updates on taxonomy.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0103">Automated biochemical testing and MALDI-TOF MS have made performing identification of yeasts and bacteria simple compared to traditional methods. One consequence of this development is that medical laboratory scientists may find themselves overworking cultures to determine whether an isolate is truly a pathogen or searching for pathogens that can also be commensals. Related to this is the potential for laboratory staff to lose necessary critical thinking skills when it comes to culture workups because of the ease in identifying colonies. It is crucial that laboratory science students and staff remain well versed in proper culture workup.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0104">Finally, proper interpretation and reporting of results can be difficult. Automated systems, MALDI-TOF MS, and sequencing may provide different identifications. Product inserts should be checked to determine if organisms are included in their respective databases if differing results are obtained. Sequencing results directly from the specimen may be difficult to interpret, as it is not uncommon to see multiple “potential” pathogens listed in sequencing results, especially in cell-free sequencing reports. Many of the limitations above can be overcome with appropriate training, standard operating procedures, and communication between laboratory staff and the clinical team.</para>

        <para id="ch0021s000000p0105">Almost 20 years ago, Dunne et al. (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0134">134</link>) provided a guest commentary in the <emphasis>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</emphasis> in which they foretold the clinical microbiology laboratory of 2025. Their commentary, along with others, predicted a world of advanced point-of-care, molecular-based methods that could rapidly identify agents causing pharyngitis, urinary tract infections, gastroenteritis, and other infections (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0134">134</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0136">136</link>). No doubt these predictions were based on companies and technologies emerging at the time just prior to their predictions. While not all the predictions have come true, many clinical settings have access to waived molecular testing for respiratory illnesses, streptococcal pharyngitis, and expansion and adoption of proteomic and sequencing technologies. Other predictions including sequencing directly from the specimen, including cell-free sequencing, are now available and continue to be refined for clinical use.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0106">The future of microbiology will build on the ability of current platforms to further decentralize testing, as prioritization of access to healthcare in rural and resource-poor areas continues to garner support. Syndromic panels like those currently available will become the norm in such settings as a means of providing critical information so that patients can be triaged appropriately. The panel offerings will likely expand, leading to a need for further education on their proper use and interpretation. Sequencing, which has seen an increase in utilization, will become more commonplace as the upfront instrument cost and cost per base continue to decline. That said, traditional culture will always play a key role in the laboratory, as antimicrobial susceptibility testing results are still needed and cannot be furnished by sequencing studies at this time. The introduction of MALDI-TOF MS was a major leap forward in the world of clinical microbiology for identification of pathogens. Advancements in MALDI-TOF MS, high-resolution mass spectrometry, desorption ionization imaging mass spectrometry, or other proteomics-based technology may be able to provide identification and proteomics-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing results quickly, and potentially directly from clinical samples. The role of metagenomics in the clinical microbiology laboratory will continue to expand, most likely to identify fastidious microorganisms or microorganisms that we cannot currently cultivate in the laboratory. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has made its way into the clinical microbiology laboratory, largely due to the digitization of microbiology and increasing technology use. This has been seen most recently in the ability of software modules in laboratory automation to analyze and separate positive urine cultures from negative; to interpret Chromagar cultures for the detection of group A<emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> and methicillin-resistant <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>; and the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to identify peaks specific for <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0074">74</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s000000li0137">137</link>–<link linkend="ch0021s000000li0140">140</link>). Future applications may provide identifications based solely on growth time, colony morphology, and other characteristics. Applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning will likely expand as the interpretation of datasets generated from sequencing and proteomics becomes more complex. These technologies and their automation will grow out of necessity as the labor shortage in medical laboratory science continues to worsen, causing staffing issues throughout the field.</para>
        <para id="ch0021s000000p0107">Overall change is inevitable, and the clinical microbiology laboratory is no exception. As the laboratory becomes more technologically advanced, the education of those entering the field at all levels will need to change to reflect this. Biochemical testing, both automated and manual, will become a second or third option for laboratories and likely serve as a backup method for those laboratories adopting the latest technology. Education may incorporate coding and data management as well as traditional microbiology methods, to ensure that technicians are well-rounded and able to perform in the laboratory of the future. That said, there is always downtime when it comes to technology, and old methods will always be valuable and need to be taught.</para>
