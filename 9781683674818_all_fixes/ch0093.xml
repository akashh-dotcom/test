      <para id="ch0093s0001p0001">Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of clinically significant bacterial isolates is one of the most important functions performed by clinical microbiology laboratories. To address the workload associated with increasing testing volumes and to improve test turnaround time, commercial AST systems were introduced into clinical microbiology laboratories during the 1980s and have been in use in the majority of laboratories since the 1990s (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0001">1</link>). Commercial AST systems may be automated, semiautomated, or manual. Manual and semiautomated AST systems are used for small volumes of testing, while larger laboratories often choose a fully automated broth microdilution AST system. Most AST systems also perform organism identification, as described in <ulink url="ch0022#ch0022s0001">chapter 7</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis> Only one semiautomated system for disk diffusion testing is marketed in the United States; additional systems are available in other countries. AST systems include data management software that may be interfaced with a laboratory information system (LIS) and offer various levels of expert system and epidemiological analyses (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0002">2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0093s0001p0002">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides regulatory oversight for AST systems marketed in the United States. AST systems are class II medical devices (subject to general controls) and require premarket notification with a 510(k) submission for FDA clearance (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0004">4</link>). Automated short-incubation (&lt;16 h) AST systems are subject to additional special controls (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0004">4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0093s0001p0003">A 510(k) submission must demonstrate that a device is substantially equivalent to other devices marketed in the United States. The FDA (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0004">4</link>) recommends a multicenter (three-site) comparison of an AST system to a Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) MIC reference method (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0005">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0006">6</link>). The number of clinical and challenge isolates that must be tested is lower for fastidious organisms (75 clinical per site, 50 challenge per one site) than nonfastidious (100 clinical per site, 75 challenge per one site) (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0004">4</link>). The level of performance considered acceptable for each antimicrobial agent–organism combination is &gt;89.9% categorical agreement (same susceptible, intermediate, or resistant classification with FDA breakpoints), &gt;89.9% essential agreement (MIC results within 1 dilution of the reference method), and ≤3% major errors (ME; false resistance based on the number of susceptible isolates). Criteria for very major errors (VME; false susceptibility) are based on the number of resistant isolates tested with lower and upper 95% confidence limits of ≤1.5% and ≤7.5%, respectively (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0004">4</link>). Antimicrobial agent–organism combinations not meeting these standards must be listed as a limitation in the package insert with a recommendation to use an alternative method. Limitation statements are also required if the evaluation did not include a sufficient number of resistant organisms, showed unacceptable (&lt;95%) reproducibility, or demonstrated an elevated “no growth” rate (&gt;10%) for an organism group (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0004">4</link>). It is important to consult current individual instrument/panel package inserts for specific antimicrobial agent–organism limitations, as significant differences exist between systems and updates occur, sometimes frequently, over time.</para>
      <para id="ch0093s0001p0004">The reporting of AST results for antimicrobial agents without proven clinical efficacy against the specific organisms listed in the pharmaceutical package insert is discouraged (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0004">4</link>). Manufacturers must apply breakpoints recognized by the FDA when evaluating AST results (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0004">4</link>). When FDA breakpoints change, manufacturers must perform a comparative study, and if the new breakpoints affect device performance, a new 510(k) submission is required (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0007">7</link>). Changes to existing FDA breakpoints are generally driven by CLSI breakpoint changes and, subsequently, by clinical laboratory expectations. If an appropriate validation study is completed, laboratories may report results with breakpoints other than those published in the AST device label (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0008">8</link>). Current information describing FDA regulations and a list of approved devices may be found at <ulink url="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance">http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance</ulink>.</para>
      <para id="ch0093s0001p0005">Currently there are significant delays, sometimes up to 5 years, between the time an antimicrobial agent is approved for human use by the FDA and FDA clearance of commercial AST devices to test that agent. There are even longer delays (3 to 8 years) between the publication of revised breakpoints for older antimicrobial agents and FDA clearance of commercial ASTs with these breakpoints. The Susceptibility Testing Manufacturers Association (STMA) reported some progress in obtaining FDA clearance for new drugs or revision of breakpoints when FDA began allowing adjusted (±1 dilution) categorical agreement calculations if breakpoints lack an intermediate category (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0009">9</link>). The FDA has developed draft guidance to assist pharmaceutical companies and diagnostic instrument manufacturers with expediting this process (“Coordinated development of antimicrobial drugs and antimicrobial susceptibility testing devices: guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff”; document issued on September 21, 2016) (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0010">10</link>). The U.S. government has also recently passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which includes a provision to remove breakpoints from drug labeling and may allow FDA clearance of commercial AST systems for organisms that were not specifically evaluated during human clinical trials. Also, the CDC, recognizing the need for improved capacity of laboratories to test newer antimicrobial agents, recently established the Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network, a network of regional testing laboratories whose functions include improved detection of emerging resistance and resistance to newly available antimicrobial agents.</para>

      <para id="ch0093s0001p0006">Registration requirements to market AST devices in countries outside of the United States vary. Many apply criteria published in 2007 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to determine acceptable performance (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0011">11</link>). A revision of ISO 20776-2:2007 guidance expected to be published in 2022 removes assessment of categorical agreement; performance is based on essential agreement (≥90%) and bias (≤30%) for 4-dilution MIC tests (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0012">12</link>). Bias calculations ensure that the fractions of test results less than and greater than the reference are similar and can only be performed when there is an adequate number of isolates across the MIC range (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0012">12</link>). The benefit of focusing on essential rather than categorical agreement is that performance is not impacted by a breakpoint change (i.e., reassessment of performance is not needed if the appropriate dilutions are on the device). Performance of qualitative AST devices is expected to meet sensitivity and specificity targets of ≥95% (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0012">12</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0093s0001p0007">This chapter focuses primarily on commercial AST systems currently available in the United States. The broth microdilution AST systems are manufactured by four companies: bioMérieux (Salt Lake City, UT;<ulink url="http://www.biomerieux-usa.com/">http://www.biomerieux-usa.com/</ulink>), Beckman Coulter (Brea, CA; <ulink url="http://www.beckmancoulter.com">http://www.beckmancoulter.com</ulink>), Becton Dickinson Diagnostics (Sparks, MD; <ulink url="http://www.bd.com">http://www.bd.com</ulink>), and ThermoFisher Scientific (Lenexa, KS; <ulink url="http://www.thermofisher.com">http://www.thermofisher.com</ulink>). The BIOMIC V3 system, manufactured by Giles Scientific (Santa Barbara, CA; <ulink url="http://www.biomic.com">http://www.biomic.com</ulink>), has FDA clearance to read disk diffusion zone sizes. The Accelerate Pheno system (Accelerate Diagnostics, Tucson, AZ; <ulink url="http://acceleratediagnostics.com">http://acceleratediagnostics.com</ulink>) provides rapid AST results for 14 bacterial pathogens directly from positive blood culture broth. Readers should be aware that susceptibility testing system components change frequently in response to reported problems, the emergence of new resistance phenotypes, and advances in technology.</para>

        <para id="ch0093s0001s0001p0001">The Etest (bioMérieux), M.I.C.Evaluator (Oxoid, ThermoFisher Scientific), and Liofilchem MIC Test Strips (Liofilchem S.r.l., Roseto, Italy) are commercial methods for quantitative AST that incorporate a preformed antimicrobial gradient applied to one side of a plastic (Etest, M.I.C.Evaluator) or paper (Liofilchem MIC Test Strips) strip to provide antimicrobial agent diffusion into an agar medium. The test is performed in a manner similar to disk diffusion testing, in that a 0.5 McFarland standard suspension of a test isolate is inoculated onto the agar surface with a swab followed by placement of the test strip onto the inoculated surface. Following incubation, the MIC is read directly from a scale on the top of the strip at the point where the ellipse of organism growth inhibition intercepts the strip (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0001">1</link>). One or several strips, each containing a different antimicrobial agent, can be placed on the surface of an appropriate round agar plate, or they can be placed in opposing directions on large rectangular plates. MICs determined by this method generally agree with MICs generated by standard broth or agar dilution methods (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0013">13</link>–<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0015">15</link>). Etest, M.I.C.Evaluator, and Liofilchem strips combine the simplicity and flexibility of disk diffusion testing with the ability to determine MICs of up to five antimicrobial agents on a single 150-mm-diameter round agar plate. However, agar gradient diffusion strips are more expensive than the paper disks used for diffusion testing. Strengths of these methods include the following: the simplicity of the procedure itself; the ability to determine an MIC of an infrequently tested antimicrobial agent; and the ability to test fastidious or anaerobic bacteria by applying the strips onto specialized enriched media according to instructions provided by the package insert.</para>

        <para id="ch0093s0001s0002p0001">The advantages of using the disk diffusion method for AST include simplicity, reliability, low cost, and a high degree of flexibility in selection of antimicrobial agents tested (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0001">1</link>). Semiautomated systems available for reading and interpreting disk diffusion inhibition zones are listed in <anchor id="ch0093s0001s0002a0003"/><link linkend="ch0093s0001s0003a0003">Table 1</link>. For all systems, agar plates are manually inserted into the instrument after incubation for image acquisition and measurement of the zone of inhibition. Despite advances in imaging technology, a visual review of plates for faint growth or pinpoint colonies within the zone is recommended to assess the need for manual adjustment of the diameter measurement. Data management software determines the categorical interpretation (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) and may be interfaced with an LIS. Although linear regression may be used to generate an MIC from a zone measurement, the validity of this practice for some antimicrobial agent–organism combinations has been questioned (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0016">16</link>). Expert system analysis and epidemiology software are available for these systems. The primary advantages of these instruments are (i) less variability in zone measurement (in comparison to caliper or ruler readings by different technologists), (ii) reduced transcription errors, (iii) labor savings, (iv) improved data management capabilities, and (v) expert review to ensure correct reporting of results that are consistent with known resistance phenotypes. In general, these instruments provide reproducible and accurate results. In evaluations of the systems, bacteria with faint growth accounted for most discrepancies (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0017">17</link>–<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0019">19</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0093s0002p0001">The VITEK system was developed in the 1980s to provide rapid MIC results based on comparative growth curve analysis for control and antimicrobial-containing wells. The current VITEK 2 system with more automation received FDA clearance in 2000. The AST panels are 64-well thin plastic cards with one to six concentrations of 14 to 24 antimicrobial agents. An identification card for common Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria may be run simultaneously with each AST card. The Smart Carrier Station includes a bar code scanner and base unit with microprocessor that holds a cassette with a capacity of 15 cards. After manual preparation of the inoculum, cards are placed in the cassette. A memory chip on the cassette allows the transfer of scanned information to the reader-incubator unit. Work flow for large laboratories can be optimized by placement of Smart Carrier Stations at multiple locations. After placement of a cassette into the VITEK 2 loading station, it is automatically moved through stations for bar code reading, AST dilution preparation, card inoculation, and card sealing. The transport system then places cards on a carousel with a 60-card capacity for incubation. A larger VITEK 2 instrument, VITEK 2XL, is also available and has a capacity of 120 cards. Each card is moved to an optic station every 15 min for measurement of light transmittance that is proportional to growth. Linear regression analysis is used to determine algorithm-derived MICs that are reported in 4 to 18 h. The Advanced Expert System (AES) is discussed in a later section of this chapter.</para>

Placement of BD EpiCenter workstations with bar code printers at each technologist’s bench maximizes workflow efficiency. Each ID broth is labeled with an EpiCenter-generated bar code label and then inoculated manually with a heavy isolate suspension. The ID broth and corresponding AST broth for up to five isolates are placed in a rack that is loaded on the AP instrument for automated standardization of the ID broth inoculum, inoculation of AST broth, and addition of the AST redox indicator. The rack is then transferred to an inoculation station where the ID and/or AST broths are manually poured into the appropriate side of each panel. The panels are sealed with plastic caps and placed on the Phoenix instrument.</para>
      <para id="ch0093s0004p0003">The Phoenix instrument reads panels every 20 min, using both a redox indicator colorimetric change and turbidity to determine organism growth. Growth (metabolic activity) causes the redox indicator to change from an oxidized (blue) state to a reduced (pink) form. A full range of antimicrobial agent concentrations and a “growth” or “no growth” reading for each well allow the system to provide direct rather than calculated MICs. Susceptibility results are completed in 6 to 16 h.</para>

The ARIS 2X instrument fits on the Sensititre OptiRead and holds up to 100 panels (standard 96-microwell panels) available as MIC panels or separate ID panels. Panels are rehydrated and inoculated with the Sensititre AIM automated inoculation system or a handheld multichannel electronic pipette before placement in the instrument’s carousel. In 2012, the inoculum transferred from McFarland suspensions to 11-ml Sensititre Mueller-Hinton broth tubes used to inoculate MIC susceptibility panels for testing Gram-negative and Gram-positive nonfastidious isolates was increased from 10 μl to 30 μl to improve the detection of resistant subpopulations of organisms. The Sensititre HiQ system offers numerous standard microtiter plate MIC formats, including ones for testing susceptibility of multidrug-resistant organisms to several newer agents—including cefidericol, imipenem-relebactam, omadacycline, eravacyline, and plazomicin—and custom formats. An internal bar code scanner identifies the plate type to assign the appropriate time of incubation. After 18 to 24 h of incubation, each AST plate is transported to the OptiRead automated fluorometric plate-reading system for reading of endpoints.

      <para id="ch0093s0006p0001">Advantages of automated AST systems include labor savings, reproducibility, data management with expert system analysis, and the opportunity to generate results more rapidly than manual reference methods. A workflow and performance evaluation of the VITEK 2 and Phoenix systems reported a longer mean setup time per isolate for Phoenix (3 min) than for VITEK 2 (1.5 min), but more monthly maintenance time for VITEK 2 (63.2 min) than for Phoenix (21.2 min) (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0021">21</link>). When the new Phoenix AP instrument was introduced, it reduced hands-on time by 50%, with a manual manipulation time per isolate that was 11.5 s less than that for VITEK 2 work flow (<emphasis>P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) for batches of 14 isolates (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0022">22</link>).</para>

Ligozzi et al. reported that the time required for VITEK 2 AST for Gram-positive cocci was 6 to 17 h, with 90% of results available as follows: <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>, 8 h; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 11 h; enterococci, 9 h; <emphasis>Streptococcus agalactiae</emphasis>, 7 h; and <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis>, 9 h (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0023">23</link>).

Doern et al. reported lower mortality rates and cost savings (fewer diagnostic tests and days in intensive care) associated with the rapid reporting of AST results (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0024">24</link>). Barenfanger et al. also demonstrated reduced lengths of stay and cost savings for patients with rapid reporting of AST results that were attributed to earlier adjustments in antimicrobial therapy (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0025">25</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0093s0006p0003">New technology provided by the Accelerate Pheno system generates AST results directly from positive blood cultures in less time than testing performed on isolates. The Accelerate system is discussed further in the section on other AST systems. In the future, the time required to complete AST testing may also be reduced with the application of molecular techniques. Rolain et al. described a real-time quantitative PCR method to measure the effect of antimicrobial agents on bacterial growth with a shorter time needed to generate results (4 h for Gram-positive cocci and 2 h for Gram-negative bacilli) (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0026">26</link>). Additional research, increased automation, and lower cost are needed to make this molecular technology available for clinical laboratories (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0026">26</link>). Effective communication of the results to clinicians and pharmacists is essential to realize the potential benefits of rapid testing (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0027">27</link>). Communication may be enhanced by software packages that interface with medication records and alert clinicians or pharmacists when adjustments in antimicrobial therapy are needed.</para>

The Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit cassette, which includes 48 flow-cell channels, is loaded with 5 ml of positive culture media. Each cassette contains two gel electrofiltration stations and fluorescent <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization probes (for identification), antimicrobial agents, and other necessary reagents (for automated sample preparation, identification of bacterial and fungal target organisms, and AST of bacterial target organisms). Total labor time for Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit sample loading is less than 10 min per sample. The Accelerate Pheno system performs AST by electrostatic immobilization of live, small-volume (20 to 30 μl) bacterial-cell test suspensions, with and without antimicrobial agents added to individual channels of a disposable multichannel fluidic cassette, and detects growth changes by automated microscopic dark-field image capture. The progeny clones are analyzed by morphokinetic cellular analysis (cell morphology, mass, division rate, heterogeneity, and anomalous growth patterns of cells and microcolonies) as time-lapse images, and image analysis software generates growth probability scores and MICs based on the rate at which progenitor cells grow into clones of daughter cells (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0131">131</link>). The instrument uses software algorithms to derive MIC values from the measured parameters and applies expert rules based on 2016 CLSI and FDA breakpoints. Results are intended to be interpreted in conjunction with Gram stain results. The Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit includes 140 assays for both identification and AST, of which 116 assays were submitted to the FDA and approved; the remaining 24 assays can be run in RUO mode. The kit also includes a monomicrobial test that indicates when a patient’s positive blood culture sample has only one targeted pathogen. The monomicrobial result, matched with the culture Gram stain, allows the reporting of results without additional laboratory workup. Gram-negative bacteria are evaluated against 12 antimicrobial agents, and Gram-positive bacteria are evaluated against six antimicrobial agents and two screening wells, an MRSA screening well with cefoxitin, and an MLS<subscript>B</subscript>screening well for erythromycin and clindamycin.</para>

This chapter will review phenotypic methods. Molecular methods are reviewed in<ulink url="ch0098#ch0098s0001">chapter 80</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis> Most assays produce an AST result in 2 to 6 h and are developed for testing pathogens from a positive blood culture as well as from isolates growing on an agar plate. The assays described below are a sample of assays currently under development (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0136">136</link>).

In the Selux Diagnostics assay (Charlestown, MA;<ulink url="http://www.seluxdx.com">http://www.seluxdx.com</ulink>), europium-cryptate-diamine chelate is used to fluorescently label the outside of bacteria so that cellular changes from exposure to varying concentrations of antimicrobial can be visualized. Specific’s Reveal assay (Mountain View, CA; <ulink url="http://www.specificdx.com">http://www.specificdx.com</ulink>) uses a small-molecule sensor array to detect metabolic by products produced by microorganisms. The arrays are spotted on a microtiter plate cover so that each well of a conventional broth microdilution panel has its own array for detecting growth or no growth, thus producing a MIC result. Gradientech’s Quick MIC test (Uppsala, Sweden; <ulink url="http://www.gradientech.se">http://www.gradientech.se</ulink>) uses a microfluidic system to create a gradient of antimicrobial embedded in agarose. Inoculum is applied to the gradient, and microscopic analysis detects the growth of microcolonies along the gradient to determine a MIC. The QuantaMatrix dRAST assay (Seoul, South Korea; <ulink url="http://www.quantamatrix.com">http://www.quantamatrix.com</ulink>) uses light microscopy to visualize cellular changes in the presence of antibiotics. Q-linea’s ASTar (Uppsala, Sweden; <ulink url="http://www.qlinea.com">http://www.qlinea.com</ulink>) uses high-resolution optics to measure bacterial biomass over time in the presence of antimicrobials.

        <para id="ch0093s0009s0001p0003">Rapid AST systems will also vary in the consumable type, the number of drugs tested per specimen, the instrumentation, and likely the cost per assay. It is unclear if any of these systems will be able to replace conventional AST systems. Replacing conventional AST will require high throughput and accurate results for a wide breadth of pathogens and drugs. Practically, replacement of conventional AST will only occur if rapid AST can be performed at a price that is not significantly higher than conventional AST, or if rapid AST demonstrates sufficient improvement of patient care to justify a higher price per test. The rapid AST is likely to have its greatest clinical impact for Gram-negative infections, because multiple-drug resistance complicates empiric therapy decisions, and will occur when antibiotic stewardship programs provide expert treatment advice to clinicians based upon the rapid AST results. In a randomized-control trial, the Accelerate Pheno system has demonstrated a significant improvement of time to antibiotic modification for Gram-negative bacteria compared to standard of care (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0137">137</link>). Differences in patient outcomes are difficult to measure in the absence of a large, multicenter clinical trial.

MBT resistance testing has included the MBT-STAR (Selective Testing of Antibiotic Resistance)-BL (β-lactamase) assay, the MBT-ASTRA (MALDI Biotyper-Antibiotic Susceptibility Test Rapid Assay), and the MBT-RESIST (Resistance) assay (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0139">139</link>).</para>

An MBT-STAR-Carba Kit<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> diagnostic (IVD) is available from Bruker that, when used together with MBT-STAR-BL IVD software and control strains, allows the rapid detection (30 to 60 min) of carbapenemase activity in a Gram-negative isolate.

The limitation of this method is that alternative mechanisms that may account for β-lactam resistance will not be detected.

The activities of carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides have been determined with the MBT-ASTRA method (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0139">139</link>). Similarly, the MBT-RESIST assay tests for the incorporation of stable-isotope-labeled (nonradioactive) amino acids into newly synthesized bacterial proteins as a signal for bacterial growth when control and antimicrobial-exposed test aliquots are compared (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0148">148</link>). Again, in principle, MBT-RESIST could be applied to any antimicrobial agent but appears most suitable for protein biosynthesis inhibitors. The MBT-ASTRA and MBT-RESIST assays overcome the problem of alternate resistance mechanisms inherent in the MBT-STAR-BL assay. In the MBT-RESIST assay, the amount of isotopically labeled amino acids incorporated into newly synthesized proteins in the presence of antibiotic is used to decide whether a strain is susceptible or resistant. The major limitation of this method is the need for a culture medium that is deficient in the respective amino acid that is used as the heavy marker. Further, the protein masses represented by the investigational peaks have to be known in advance and conserved for all strains of a species. The bacteria in both MBT-ASTRA and MBT-RESIST assays are incubated for an adequate short incubation time (e.g., 2 h) that is species and antimicrobial agent dependent.</para>

Expert systems can enhance work flow by identifying the subset of results that require human expert attention and may also improve the quality of AST results reported from smaller laboratories that may lack a human expert (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0149">149</link>).

However, the software must be frequently updated to reflect the emergence of new resistance and changes in reporting guidelines recommended by national organizations such as CLSI. Users must be aware of what rules and comments are activated in their system and must work closely with manufacturer-provided specialists to customize the expert system for their laboratory. The degree of customization allowed varies among AST systems. Ideally, an expert system will report actual MICs with categorical interpretation before and after recommended changes. Expert systems may also deduce the susceptibility of an isolate to agents not tested and detect inconsistencies between organism identification and AST results (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0149">149</link>).</para>

New testing includes implementing a new AST system, a new AST panel, a new drug, or a new breakpoint. In the United States, this verification process is required by CLIA regulations (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0161">161</link>) and the requirement is enforced by inspection programs like that of the College of American Pathologists. It is important to distinguish verification from validation. Verification of test performance is done when an assay has met the performance requirements of a regulatory authority, for example, if the test meets FDA standards and is cleared for use by FDA or the test meets performance requirements outlined in ISO 20776-2 (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0162">162</link>). Validation is the process of determining the test performance characteristics. This is a more extensive study and it is performed when a test has not been cleared for use by a regulatory authority. Test validation will not be discussed here. Guidelines for performing a verification study of AST systems are published by Patel et al.

It is recommended to test susceptible and resistant isolates for drugs that are tested, especially isolates that reflect the challenging isolates recovered from the institution’s patient population. Identifying a suitable comparator method for the new AST system can be challenging. Optimally, this would be a frozen broth microdilution method that conforms to CLSI M7 (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0006">6</link>) or ISO 20776-1 (<link linkend="ch0093s0010s0006li0163">163</link>) specifications.

Expert analysis may improve workflow as well as the quality of reported results. The labor savings attributed to automated AST systems are particularly important for laboratories in regions with current or projected technologist shortages. In addition, the provision of more rapid AST results with a short-incubation system may improve patient care and lower health care costs if combined with robust stewardship initiatives. Future advances in the development of AST systems may increase their clinical impact by shortening the time required for results. Next-generation molecular approaches must account for the multifactorial nature of antimicrobial resistances, particularly in Gram-negative bacilli, and must generate results equivalent to current reference phenotypic approaches, which are limited by the requirements for large numbers of bacteria, pure cultures, and time.</para>
