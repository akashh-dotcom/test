        <para id="ch0107s0000p0003">All the viruses described in this chapter are enveloped and possess helical nucleocapsids. Particles range in size from ~150 to 500 nm and tend to adopt pleomorphic morphologies that include roughly spherical and filamentous forms; the latter is especially true for HPIV-2 (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0002">2</link>). Virions possess monopartite, minus-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes that measure approximately 15 kb in length and encode 6 to 11 proteins, depending upon the virus. The largest protein, L, is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. L, along with the phosphoprotein, P, and the nucleocapsid protein, N (or NP), together with the viral RNA, comprise the nucleocapsid. The surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion protein (F), project from the viral envelope and can be seen by electron microscopy. Orthorubulaviruses possess a third membrane protein, small hydrophobic protein (SH), which is a 44-amino-acid polypeptide that is believed to inhibit virus-induced host cell apoptosis. The sixth structural protein is an inner membrane, or matrix, protein termed M. In viral replication, N protein binds to viral RNA, L and P function in transcription and replication, and the HN and F surface glycoproteins interact with the M protein, which attracts assembled nucleocapsids to areas of the plasma membrane that will become the envelopes of the new viral particles during budding. The HN surface glycoproteins also function in virus-host cell attachment via sialic acid receptors, and the F proteins function in virus-host cell membrane fusion, which allows the viral nucleocapsid to enter and infect a host cell. Diagrams representing the ultrastructure of respiroviruses and orthorubulaviruses are presented in <anchor id="ch0107s0000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0107s0000a0010">Fig. 1</link>.</para>
        <para id="ch0107s0000p0004">Four species of HPIV have so far been identified. HPIV-4 can be further subdivided into HPIV-4a and HPIV-4b; because they are so closely related, they are referred to as HPIV-4 for the remainder of this discussion. Only one antigenic type of MuV has been identified, although strains show differences in the sequence of the SH protein gene, which constitutes the basis for classification of MuV into 12 genotypes, designated A through L. Among these, genotype G viruses are the most common causes of mumps in the United States. HPIV and MuV are inactivated by temperatures above 50°C, organic solvents, UV irradiation, formalin treatment, low pH (3.0 to 3.4), and desiccation. Preservation by freezing at −70°C or colder is effective, and the addition of 0.5% bovine serum albumin, skim milk, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, or 2% heat-inactivated serum prior to freezing prolongs infectivity of viral stocks. Manipulations of clinical specimens and cultivation of HPIVs and MuV requires biosafety level (BSL)-2 work practices and containment.</para>
        <para id="ch0107s0000p0005">Although they are similar in structure and antigenic composition, HPIVs and MuV present very different clinical pictures. The HPIVs are common agents of respiratory infections in children and adults in the United States, and virology laboratories routinely test for HPIV by direct antigen testing, virus isolation, and, most commonly, molecular methods such as PCR. In contrast, MuV, which was considered one of the common causes of diseases of childhood prior to the introduction of an effective vaccine in 1968, is now relatively uncommon, but mumps outbreaks have become more frequent in recent years. Despite this, most clinical virology laboratories no longer focus on the detection of MuV, relegating testing for this agent to reference and public health laboratories. Because of these differences, the HPIVs and MuV are discussed separately below.</para>

      <para id="ch0107s0000p0007">HPIVs are thought to be transmitted by large-droplet aerosols and by contact with contaminated surfaces. The viruses have been shown to remain infectious for up to 10 h on porous surfaces; however, HPIV-3 experimentally placed on fingers was shown to lose more than 90% of its infectivity in the first 10 min following application (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0003">3</link>). HPIV-1, -2, -3, and -4 represent approximately 5% of all viruses detected in routine hospital diagnostic laboratories (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0004">4</link>). HPIV-1 transmission occurs most often in autumn and biennially. The incidence of HPIV-2 is generally lower than that of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3, occurring biennially with HPIV-1, in alternate years from HPIV-1, or yearly. HPIV-3 occurs yearly, in spring and summer, but can circulate year-round in temperate climates. HPIV-4 is now known to be more prevalent than was previously thought, a result of better and more widely available diagnostic methods, including multiplexed molecular respiratory syndromic panels, but it still accounts for many fewer severe infections than other HPIV species. In a study published in 2014, using data obtained by multiplex molecular testing, Frost and colleagues noted that HPIV-4 is a common respiratory pathogen of children, has year-round prevalence, and peaks during the autumn of odd-numbered years (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0005">5</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0107s0000p0008">HPIVs are associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants, children, and adults; however, severe disease is generally seen only among those with compromised immune systems. The mean incubation period is estimated to be between 2 and 6 days for HPIV infections (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0006">6</link>). These infections are typically mild and self-limited, and mortality is rare in developed countries (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0007">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0107s0000li0008">8</link>). Reinfection is common because natural infection does not induce lifelong immunity. HPIV accounts for most cases of viral croup, which is the most common cause of upper airway obstruction in children of 6 months to 6 years of age. Croup is characterized by inspiratory stridor, barking cough, and hoarseness (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0009">9</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0009">HPIV-1 is associated with up to 50% of cases of croup reported in the United States, with most cases occurring in children of 7 to 36 months of age. HPIV-2 is associated with croup in immunocompromised or chronically ill children. HPIV-2 also causes typical lower respiratory tract syndromes in otherwise healthy children, with about 60% of infections occurring in children younger than 5 years of age; peak incidence is in children between 1 and 2 years of age. HPIV-3 is more frequent in infants younger than 6 months of age, with 40% of infections occurring during the first year of life. Only RSV causes more lower respiratory tract infections in neonates and young infants than HPIV-3. HPIV-4 can cause many of the same respiratory symptoms as HPIV-1, -2, and -3; however, it is generally not associated with croup (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0010">10</link>). As many as 7% of all hospitalizations for viral acute respiratory illness in children younger than 5 years of age have been shown to be due to HPIV infection (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0011">11</link>). HPIV-1, -2, and -3 have also been found in as many as one-third of lower respiratory tract infections in children younger than 5 years of age in the United States and are second only to RSV as a cause of hospitalization for viral lower respiratory tract infections (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0012">12</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0010">Although associated with pediatric infections, HPIVs can cause serious pulmonary disease in adults. According to one review, HPIVs account for between 0.2 and 11.5% of adult hospitalizations for community-acquired pneumonia (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0013">13</link>). Of nine common infections, HPIVs were significantly associated with mortality in those aged ≥75 years; this association was of lower magnitude than that of influenza A virus and RSV—which were significantly associated with mortality in all age groups—but of higher magnitude than that of the other pathogens (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0014">14</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0107s0000p0011">HPIV is increasingly recognized as a source of severe morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, especially in those with congenital immunodeficiencies, and is capable of infecting tissues in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts in these individuals (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0007">7</link>). HPIVs replicate productively in respiratory epithelium and generally do not spread systemically unless the host is severely immunocompromised (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0015">15</link>). HPIVs cause more than 50% of the respiratory infections in pediatric bone marrow transplant recipients and 19% of those in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0016">16</link>). HPIV infection, most commonly HPIV-3 infection, was identified in 3.3% of 5,178 pediatric and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, causing both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and resulting in poor outcomes for those with lower respiratory infections (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0017">17</link>). HPIVs were detected in 3% of pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis, second only to rhinovirus (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0018">18</link>), and, similarly, in 5% of very low-birth-weight infants, next in frequency behind rhinovirus and RSV (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0019">19</link>). In South Korea, HPIVs were the most commonly detected pathogen among 137 pediatric cancer patients with respiratory viral infections, with 80% of these having been acquired in relation to health care (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0020">20</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0012">There are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared antivirals for treatment of HPIV infections. Ribavirin has been used to treat HPIV infections in immunocompromised patients, but results have varied. Elizaga et al. (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0021">21</link>) reported no efficacy for this therapy. In contrast, successful HPIV treatment was reported for intravenous ribavirin therapy (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0022">22</link>), oral ribavirin along with methylprednisolone (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0023">23</link>), and high ribavirin doses used with early intervention (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0024">24</link>). DAS181 (Fludase; Ansun BioPharma), a novel inhaled antiviral agent, offers promise for the treatment of HPIV infections. This agent, a bacterial-human fusion protein with sialidase activity, cleaves α-(2,3)- and α-(2,6)-linked sialic acids, which are receptors for influenza viruses and HPIVs, from the surfaces of host cells (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0025">25</link>). In this way, DAS181 renders the host resistant to infection with these viruses. To date, only a few studies of its efficacy in treating human HPIV infections have been published. In all these studies, participants included either hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant recipients and DAS181 was administered through compassionate-use protocols. In many of the patients, posttreatment viral loads were either undetectable or decreased, and in almost all cases where it was reported, posttreatment pulmonary function improved to some degree (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0026">26</link>–<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0032">32</link>). In addition, DAS181 appeared to be well tolerated by patients and did not appear to have demonstrable side effects in study participants; however, further research is needed to fully evaluate its utility in the treatment of HPIV-associated diseases. To that end, management of HPIV infection symptoms through administration of corticosteroids is recommended (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0009">9</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0013">There are currently no FDA-cleared vaccines for the HPIVs. The search continues for an effective HPIV vaccine using live attenuated recombinant HPIVs carrying various mutations and utilizing a bovine PIV-3 strain to express HPIV antigens. All vaccine candidates are still undergoing evaluation for their safety and efficacy; preliminary data for some vaccine candidates are promising (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0033">33</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0014">The diagnosis of HPIV infection may be based primarily on clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory diagnostic studies may not be needed for all patients. However, laboratory assays to confirm HPIV infection, thus distinguishing it from the many other viral infections that present with similar respiratory tract signs and symptoms, are widely available, and confirmation of infection may improve patient management and decrease costs (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0107s0000li0034">34</link>).</para>

Viral specimen collection, transport, and storage guidelines are provided elsewhere in this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis> For immunofluorescence-based detection, care should be taken to include cellular material in samples collected from respiratory sites. The nasopharynx and oropharynx are primary locations of initial HPIV replication, and children shed virus from 3 to 4 days prior to the onset of clinical symptoms until approximately 10 days post onset. Virus recovery from adults is much more difficult than from children, although immunocompromised patients and adults with chronic diseases, especially lung disease, have been shown to persistently shed HPIV for many months (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0012">12</link>). Throat swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal washes, and nasal aspirates have all been successfully used to detect HPIV, but specimens from the nasopharynx—which is the primary location of initial HPIV replication—are best. For cultivation-based detection, specimens should be collected, placed in viral transport medium, and kept at 4°C until cell culture inoculation. Inoculation within 24 h of collection is recommended (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0012">12</link>).

        <para id="ch0107s0000p0019">HPIV-1, -2, and -3 antigens can be routinely detected in clinical specimens by immunofluorescence techniques that employ fluorophore-labeled monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Cells from nasopharyngeal washes, aspirates, and swabs are fixed on a microscope slide, usually in several cell spots or dots, or by cytocentrifugation (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0035">35</link>). At least 20 columnar epithelial cells must be present if the assay is to be valid. Many laboratories use pooled MAbs containing antibodies against seven common respiratory pathogens; these are adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, HPIV-1, -2, and -3, and RSV. These MAbs are applied in either a direct (DFA) or indirect (IFA) fluorescent-antibody staining protocol that detects antigens of all seven viruses. When a positive result is seen, further testing must be done to determine which virus is present. The sensitivity of HPIV antigen detection compared to virus isolation in cell culture varies from laboratory to laboratory and with the various DFA and IFA staining methods and reagents, but has been reported to range from 70 (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0004">4</link>) to 83% (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0035">35</link>).

A second DFA format allows definitive identification of more than one virus simultaneously using two different fluorescent dyes with overlapping spectra (Light Diagnostics SimulFluor reagents [Millipore Corp.] and Duet reagents [DHI]). The reagents are cleared by the FDA for direct specimen testing and for culture confirmation. When stained preparations are examined with a fluorescence microscope with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter set, one antibody produces apple-green fluorescence, and the second appears gold or golden orange.

DNA polymerase extends perfectly formed complements, at the same time incorporating biotin-dCTP into the extension product. The extension products are added to microwells containing polystyrene microbeads, each of which contains an antitag sequence unique to a specific viral target and all of which are treated with colored dyes to distinguish each bead set. Each tagged primer hybridizes onto its unique anti-tag complement. Biotinylated extension products hybridizing onto the bead surface are detected with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin reporter molecule. Hybridized and tagged beads are sorted and read on the MAGPIX instrument. Most hands-on time of methods shown: 6- to 8-h turnaround. Batch testing.

        <para id="ch0107s0000p0027">The enhanced sensitivity of molecular methods compared to antigen detection and virus isolation is especially important for immunocompromised patients and older patients in whom the viral titer may not be high. Most large virology laboratories employ molecular technologies for detection of all common viral respiratory pathogens. Over the past few years, these technologies have been refined and made more “user friendly” (i.e., requiring less technical expertise, exhibiting faster turnaround, and requiring less sophisticated specimen processing, instrumentation, and facilities due to closed systems), allowing smaller laboratories to adopt them and reap their benefits. Experts in viral molecular diagnostics caution users that molecular panels are expensive and should be selected carefully to best fit the needs of the individual laboratory and the patient population it serves. Large multiplexed viral respiratory panels may not be the preferred assay for diagnosis when clinical symptoms are consistent with a particular viral infection already known to be circulating in the community (e.g., influenza) (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0037">37</link>).</para>

These proteins bind erythrocytes and can mediate their adherence to HPIV-infected cells, a phenomenon called hemadsorption (HAD). HAD can be used as another approach for detecting HPIVs in cell cultures. For HAD testing, the culture medium is replaced with a dilute suspension of guinea pig erythrocytes, and the cell culture tubes are refrigerated at 4°C for 30 min; the tubes are then examined microscopically (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0004">4</link>). When a hemadsorbing virus is present, erythrocytes adhere to the infected cell monolayer. If a hemadsorbing virus is absent, erythrocytes will not adhere and will float free when the tube is tilted or tapped. Uninfected and infected control tubes should be included in HAD testing. HAD testing may be performed at the end of the typical incubation period of 14 days or earlier, after 3 to 7 days of incubation (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0038">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0107s0000li0039">39</link>). HPIV-4 hemadsorbs weakly compared to HPIV-1, -2, and -3 at 4°C and more strongly at room temperature. Of note, mumps virus and influenza viruses also yield positive HAD test results when guinea pig erythrocytes are used. Whether the presence of HPIV is suspected based on the appearance of typical CPE or a positive HAD test result, confirmatory testing must be done to definitively identify the isolate.</para>
        <para id="ch0107s0000p0032">Confirmatory testing is routinely completed by immunofluorescence techniques involving the use of HPIV MAbs in DFA or IFA assays, as described for HPIV antigen detection in clinical samples. MAbs against HPIV-1, -2, and -3 are readily available in the various respiratory virus antibody testing kits. However, HPIV-4 antibodies are not included in most testing kits and must be purchased separately. Infected cells are scraped from the cell culture monolayer, concentrated by centrifugation, applied to a microscope slide, fixed, and stained. The presence of apple-green fluorescence when the smear is viewed with a fluorescence microscope confirms the identification of HPIV. Confirmatory testing may also be accomplished by other methods, including hemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation, neutralization, and molecular assays. These techniques are laborious and time-consuming compared to immunofluorescence methods, so they are seldom used.</para>
        <para id="ch0107s0000p0033">Cell cultures grown on coverslips in shell vials or in microwell plates provide an alternative to traditional tube cell cultures for isolation of HPIVs. Centrifugation of the inoculated vials and plates, usually at 700 ×<emphasis>g</emphasis> for 1 h, is an important feature of the inoculation process. Inoculated vials or plates are incubated for 24 to 48 h or up to 5 days. Detection of viral proliferation depends on pre-CPE detection of viral antigens by application of HPIV MAbs to the monolayers in a typical DFA or IFA staining assay. Use of shell vial cultures with centrifugation-enhanced inoculation and pre-CPE detection by immunofluorescence staining has been shown to be very useful in HPIV detection.</para>

Staining involves pooled MAbs to seven respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, HPIV-1, -2, and -3, and RSV). In a comparison of respiratory virus detection in 3,800 clinical samples in R-Mix and in shell vials of PMK, A459, and MRC-5 cells, 33 of 38 (87%) HPIVs were detected after overnight incubation in the R-Mix cells (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0040">40</link>). This included 26 of 30 HPIV-1 isolates, 2 of 2 HPIV-2 isolates, and 5 of 6 HPIV-3 isolates. Cocultivated MDCK cells and A549 cells constitute R-Mix Too (DHI). This combination was prepared as an alternative to R-Mix. The HPIVs proliferate very well in R-Mix Too (unpublished data) and are easily detected (<anchor id="ch0107s0000a0042"/><link linkend="ch0107s0000a0045">Fig. 4A</link> to <link linkend="ch0107s0000a0045">C</link>).</para>

Briefly, the processed clinical specimen for respiratory virus detection is inoculated into three vials containing R-Mix or R-Mix Too, and the vials are spun in a centrifuge (700 ×<emphasis>g</emphasis> for 1 h). At 16 to 24 h, one vial is stained with respiratory virus screening reagent (which tests for seven respiratory viruses). If fluorescence is observed, the cells are scraped from one of the remaining shell vials, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and spotted onto an eight-well slide; seven of the wells are stained with individual MAbs against the seven respiratory viruses, and the eighth well is used as a control well. If no fluorescence is observed when the first vial is stained, the second vial is stained after an additional 16 to 24 h of incubation. If this vial is positive, the cells are scraped from the remaining vial and stained as described above. If the second vial is negative, the culture may be considered negative for the seven respiratory viruses (i.e., the remaining vial is discarded and the culture is terminated), or the third vial may be observed for CPE for up to 7 days.</para>

        <para id="ch0107s0000p0036">Most children are born with HPIV-neutralizing antibodies of maternal origin, but these diminish by 6 months of age, allowing more than two-thirds of children to be infected by HPIV during the first year of life. Most children have early serologic evidence of HPIV-3 infection, with HPIV-1 and -2 antibodies developing later, at 2 to 3 years of age. Antibodies to HPIV-4 peak in school-age children (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0012">12</link>). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is produced in most primary HPIV infections of children, so IgM detection in a single sample supports diagnosis of current infection. Likewise, measurement of a significant increase in the IgG antibody level—i.e., an increase of 4-fold or more in assays that test serial 2-fold dilutions of serum samples collected 2 weeks apart—supports diagnosis of current infection. Cross-reactivity among the various HPIV types and other paramyxoviruses, such as MuV, makes serologic diagnosis more difficult. Serologic differentiation of the HPIV types is unreliable by all methods; this determination can be made only through virus isolation and typing with MAbs or, most commonly, by molecular methods.</para>
        <para id="ch0107s0000p0037">Antibodies to the HN protein may appear early, but antibodies to both HN and F proteins must be present for protection. Immune status determinations are not useful for HPIV. Serology in general is seldom used as a diagnostic approach for HPIV infection because of the wide availability and improved reliability of direct detection methods (e.g., PCR).</para>

Rapid reporting of positive results is important (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0027">27</link>). As molecular panels that include the HPIVs have become more widely available in formats that produce rapid results, they have become the diagnostic method of choice due to their excellent sensitivity and specificity. Although the sensitivity of HPIV antigen detection by immunofluorescence is lower than that of virus isolation in cell culture or molecular detection, the rapid availability of results and high specificity make such testing useful in patient management. Confirmation of HPIV infection via the serologic route and HPIV immune status determinations is seldom employed due to the difficulties with cross-reactions among the paramyxoviruses.</para>

      <para id="ch0107s0000p0040">More than 150,000 cases of mumps were expected each year in the United States before aggressive vaccination programs were implemented in the late 1960s. The mumps vaccine was combined with the measles and rubella vaccines to make a trivalent vaccine (MMR). In the United States, the initial dose of MMR is administered to children between 12 and 15 months of age. Vaccination produced a dramatic decline in the incidence of mumps, resulting in fewer than 3,000 cases in the United States by 1985. There was a brief resurgence of mumps in 1986 and 1987 that peaked at 8,000 to 12,000 cases. Following the resurgence, a requirement for a second dose of the MMR vaccine was implemented. This dose is administered to children between ages 4 and 6 or 11 and 13 years (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0041">41</link>), but can be given as soon as 28 days following the first dose and has been expected to confer lifelong immunity. The number of mumps cases continued to decline in the United States until the largest U.S. outbreak in 2 decades occurred in the Midwestern states in 2006 (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0042">42</link>). More than 6,500 cases were involved in this outbreak. The highest incidence of mumps was in persons aged 18 to 24 years; 83% of these were college students, and 84% of this group, as well as 63% of all those infected in the outbreak, had received two doses of mumps vaccine. The cause of this outbreak is unclear. Potential explanations include waning immunity and incomplete vaccine-induced immunity to circulating wild-type virus (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0042">42</link>). In addition, the overall estimate of mumps antibody seroprevalence in the United States in 1999 to 2004 was 90% (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0043">43</link>). This is the lower end of the level of immunity (90 to 92%) needed to achieve herd immunity.</para>

      <para id="ch0107s0000p0041">During 2009 to 2010, another mumps outbreak occurred in the United States. The outbreak started at a New York summer camp for Orthodox Jewish boys and resulted in 3,502 cases of mumps, 97% of which were in Orthodox Jewish persons, most of whom lived in three neighborhoods in New York (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0044">44</link>). As with the 2006 outbreaks, a high percentage of infected individuals had received either one (14%) or two (76%) doses of the MMR vaccine, so waning of vaccine-induced protection against mumps was again suggested as a contributing factor. In addition, it was concluded that the level of immunity required to protect against mumps may depend on the size of the inoculum of virus involved in the exposure, indicating that a particular antibody titer versus protection from infection is not absolute (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0044">44</link>). However, in a study of antibody in students prior to the 2006 Kansas outbreak, it was shown that pre-outbreak neutralizing titers were significantly lower among patients who developed mumps than in individuals neither exposed nor infected and in individuals exposed but not infected during the outbreak. However, although those who developed mumps had lower pre-outbreak mumps antibody levels than noninfected individuals, antibody titers overlapped, and no cutoff points clearly separated the groups (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0045">45</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0042">At the time of this writing, the incidence of mumps in the United States is higher than prior to the 2006 multistate outbreak. Case counts greater than 1,000 per year were recorded between 2014 and 2019; in 2016 and 2017, more than 6,000 cases per year were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0046">46</link>). However, in 2020 and 2021, there were only 616 and 154, respectively, cases reported (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0046">46</link>). The decrease in mumps incidence between 2020 and 2021 could be due, at least in part, to the widespread use of respiratory disease transmission mitigation practices among the public (e.g., mask wearing, social distancing, home-schooling, etc.) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, data to support this speculation are not yet available. It remains unclear whether a change in the vaccine itself or in vaccine administration schedules will be needed to prevent future outbreaks in the United States. Studies have suggested that in some vaccinated individuals who later became infected with MuV, susceptibility to the virus could have been associated with either a demonstrably low avidity of vaccine-induced anti-MuV IgG and/or waning concentrations of antibodies over time (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0047">47</link>, <link linkend="ch0107s0000li0048">48</link>). A 2018 comparative genomic analysis of contemporary circulating MuV lineages suggests the emergence of strains against which the current vaccine may not provide adequate protection, indicating the need for vaccine reformulation (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0049">49</link>). Mumps remains common throughout much of the world, usually infecting 6- to 10-year-old children in the spring in unvaccinated populations.</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0043">MuV is transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets or contaminated fomites and is highly contagious, with approximately 85% of susceptible contacts becoming infected when first exposed. Humans are the only known host and reservoir for the MuV. The virus replicates initially in epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract and in regional lymph nodes. Initial replication is followed by viremia, which results in infection of the salivary glands and other sites. The highest viral loads occur closest to parotitis onset and decrease rapidly thereafter. Disease transmission likely occurs before and within 5 days of parotitis onset. Transmission can also occur during the prodromal phase and with subclinical infection (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0050">50</link>). The virus is shed in the urine for as long as 14 days after the onset of illness.</para>

MuV infection is asymptomatic in 25 to 30% of cases and is associated with nonspecific or respiratory symptoms in 50% of cases. Symptoms are typically mild and characterized by slightly elevated temperature and enlargement of one or both parotid glands in 30 to 40% of cases. Complications of mumps include meningoencephalitis (in up to 15% of cases) and, in postpubertal individuals, orchitis in males (in up to 20 to 30% of cases) and oophoritis in females (in up to 7% of cases). Polyarthritis and pancreatitis have also been associated with mumps.</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0045">When mumps was a common disease of childhood, the diagnosis was made largely on clinical grounds alone. With the decrease in incidence of mumps, many physicians no longer readily recognize its symptoms. In addition, typical clinical signs and symptoms may be absent in underimmunized or immunocompromised individuals. Parotitis, the hallmark of clinical diagnosis, is now known to be present in other viral and nonviral diseases or conditions, which can complicate the diagnosis of mumps if clinical signs and symptoms alone are used to render a diagnosis. Mumps-like symptoms in acutely ill children who previously received the MMR vaccine have been associated with Epstein-Barr virus, HPIV, adenovirus, and human herpesvirus 6 (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0051">51</link>).

      <para id="ch0107s0000p0047">For detection of MuV RNA by RT-PCR, the CDC recommends collection of a buccal swab for testing if patients present within the first 3 days following symptom onset. In addition, a serum specimen for MuV IgM testing should be collected at the same time. In patients who present with orchitis, oophoritis, central nervous system disease, pancreatitis, or mastitis, a buccal swab and a urine specimen for RT-PCR, and a serum specimen for MuV IgM testing, should be collected regardless of how long ago symptoms began. Specimens for MuV isolation in cell culture include saliva or buccal swabs, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Virus can be isolated from saliva and buccal swabs 7 days before and up to 8 days after the onset of parotitis, recovered from the urine for up to 2 weeks after onset of symptoms, isolated from CSF during meningitis, and detected rarely in peripheral blood. Throat swabs and urine samples have been shown to have similar efficacies as sources of MuV (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0052">52</link>). It is always advisable to collect samples for molecular or cultivation-based detection early in the course of the infection, when the viral titer is the highest. Samples for molecular testing and isolation should be collected even sooner in previously vaccinated individuals. In these individuals, MuV may be shed in lower quantities and for a shorter duration, so neither virus isolation nor molecular methods are likely to yield positive results unless samples are collected within 3 days after onset of parotitis (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0053">53</link>). The virus is stable for several days at 4°C, although inoculation of susceptible cell cultures within a few hours of specimen collection is recommended for optimal virus isolation.

If the purpose of the serologic testing is simply to determine the patient’s mumps immune status, a single serum sample collected at random is sufficient.

        <para id="ch0107s0000p0054">As with HPIV culture, readers should be aware that several cell lines used to propagate MuV are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2, and culturing respiratory specimens for MuV from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients may lead to the unintended propagation of SARS-CoV-2, which should be avoided at BSL-2. The decision to either continue or discontinue viral culture-based diagnosis of MuV infections should be informed by a thorough risk assessment performed by the laboratory director. Interim laboratory biosafety guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 are available from the CDC at<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/lab-biosafety-guidelines.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/lab-biosafety-guidelines.html</ulink> (accessed 18 January 2022).</para>
        <para id="ch0107s0000p0055">MuV proliferates in traditional cultures of several cell lines commonly used in viral diagnostic laboratories. These include PMK, human neonatal kidney, HeLa, and Vero cells. A marmoset lymphoblastic cell line, B95a, was shown to be as sensitive for MuV isolation as PMK cells (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0059">59</link>). A Vero cell line transfected with a plasmid carrying the gene for human CDw150—a signaling-lymphocytic activation molecule (human SLAM, or hSLAM)—and called Vero/hSLAM has been used for mumps virus isolation (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0060">60</link>). Although used originally for isolation of measles virus, these cells have been shown to be effective for MuV isolation as well (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0053">53</link>, <link linkend="ch0107s0000li0061">61</link>). Directions for cell culture inoculation for swab samples in viral transport medium are the same as those described above in “Parainfluenza Viruses” under “Isolation and Identification.”</para>
        <para id="ch0107s0000p0056">In cells infected with MuV, CPE characterized by rounded cells and multinucleated giant cells is typical (<link linkend="ch0107s0000a0040">Fig. 3C</link>), usually appearing after 6 to 8 days of incubation at 35 to 37°C. However, this characteristic CPE may be very subtle, may not appear at all, or may be confused with a similar CPE produced by endogenous adventitious viruses that sometimes infect PMK cells.</para>
        <para id="ch0107s0000p0057">MuV infection, like that of the HPIVs, results in the insertion of hemadsorbing proteins into the plasma membranes of infected cells, so MuV-infected cells can be detected by HAD testing. The HAD testing protocol is described above in “Parainfluenza Viruses” under “Isolation and Identification.” Whether MuV is detected by CPE production or by a positive HAD result, confirmatory testing must be performed. Confirmatory testing for MuV is routinely performed by fluorescent antibody staining. FDA-cleared mumps MAbs in an IFA format for culture confirmation are available from Millipore Corp.</para>

        <para id="ch0107s0000p0058">Centrifugation-enhanced inoculation and pre-CPE detection of MuV in cultured cells using MAbs within 24 to 48 h after inoculation is an alternative to traditional cell culture. Various cell lines can be used in either shell vial or microwell plate formats for this purpose. The recommended centrifugation speeds and times may vary for inoculation, ranging from 700 ×<emphasis>g</emphasis> for 45 min (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0052">52</link>) to 3,000 × <emphasis>g</emphasis> for 20 min (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0040">40</link>). Up to 66% of MuV-positive samples were identified within 2 days of inoculation in the shell vial system; after 5 days of incubation, the shell vial system was 96% sensitive compared to MuV isolation in traditional cell cultures (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0062">62</link>). When various cell lines were compared for efficacy of MuV isolation in shell vials, Vero and LLC-MK2 cells were the most sensitive (100%), followed by MDCK (78%), MRC-5 (44%), and HEp-2 (22%) cells (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0063">63</link>). MuV can also be isolated in R-Mix cells (<link linkend="ch0107s0000a0045">Fig. 4D</link>). An overview of the recommended protocol from the manufacturer of R-Mix (DHI) is presented above in “Parainfluenza Viruses” under “Isolation and Identification.”</para>
        <para id="ch0107s0000p0059">Because MuV infections in previously vaccinated individuals result in decreased levels of virus shedding into the buccal cavity, virus isolation may be difficult (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0064">64</link>). Specimens collected and cultured within 3 days of onset of parotitis may aid in confirming the presence of mumps virus, but negative results do not rule out the infection (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0042">42</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0107s0000p0060">In MuV infection of unvaccinated individuals, IgM is detectable initially within 3 to 5 days of appearance of clinical symptoms and persists for 8 to 12 weeks. IgG is detectable within 7 to 10 days of the onset of symptoms, is maintained at high levels for years, and remains detectable for life. Traditional serologic diagnosis of mumps is based on the detection of virus-specific IgM in a single sample or measurement of a significant increase in the titer of IgG or total antibody, i.e., a 4-fold or greater increase for methods that use serial 2-fold dilutions, between two specimens collected 2 weeks apart. Antibodies produced in MuV infection often cross-react with related viruses, which complicates the interpretation of results. Assays for mumps immune status indicate whether MuV IgG is present at detectable levels or is absent or undetectable. These qualitative results are sufficient, and reporting of titers is unnecessary given that there is no particular antibody level that correlates with protection (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0044">44</link>, <link linkend="ch0107s0000li0045">45</link>). With the rarity of mumps cases in the United States at present, most laboratories focus MuV serology on immune status testing. Of note, IgG avidity testing, which is available at the CDC, can be used to distinguish primary from secondary MuV infection.</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0061">In previously vaccinated persons, serologic diagnosis has very limited use. IgM may be produced weakly or not at all in a secondary immune response. In a report from 2008, MuV IgM antibodies were detected in fewer than 15% of MuV-infected persons who were previously immunized, and 95% of these patients were positive for MuV IgG (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0053">53</link>). False-positive results for MuV IgM are not uncommon and, in addition to being associated with cross-reactivity to a number of other pathogens, have been obtained from pregnant individuals and others without symptoms of MuV infection. Therefore, MuV IgM testing should be limited to patients with illnesses that are clinically compatible with MuV infection, should be performed in conjunction with additional diagnostic tests such as MuV RT-PCR, and should not be used to determine the immune status of individuals.</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0062">Basic principles of immunoassays are described in<ulink url="ch0024#ch0024s0001">chapter 9</ulink> in this <emphasis>Manual.</emphasis> MuV antibodies can be detected by many types of assays, including hemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation, and neutralization assays; all of these detect total antibody (IgG and IgM). These methods are usually laborious and are available only at reference or specialty laboratories. A detailed procedure for MuV antibody hemagglutination inhibition testing was published previously (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0065">65</link>). The complement fixation technique can be used with two different MuV antigens, V and S. Antibodies against the S antigen appear early and their levels rise quickly, in contrast to the antibodies to the V antigen, which appear later. The presence of both V and S antibodies is thought to signal a recent past infection, while V antibodies alone signal a long-past infection (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0038">38</link>). An IgM capture EIA was used recently for detection of mumps virus IgM (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0053">53</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0063">Most diagnostic laboratories use commercially supplied MuV antibody EIA kits (in either manual or automated formats), IFA testing systems for MuV antibody determinations, and chemiluminescence assays. Most of these tests measure only IgG. Antibodies against various MuV proteins are produced, but protection is most closely correlated with antibodies to the MuV HN protein. Most assays use whole virus or viral extract antigens that detect HN antibody effectively. Written protocols, along with the proper reagents and controls, are included with each commercial product, and each manufacturer’s guidelines must be followed if assays are to yield high-quality results. The procedural steps for performance of antibody testing are not published here, due to the need for strict adherence to manufacturers’ guidelines. None of these MuV antibody assays has been shown to be superior in regard to sensitivity or specificity.</para>
      <para id="ch0107s0000p0064">Standard diagnostic tests that detect virus or virus-specific antibody perform inconsistently for individuals with prior immune exposure via either immunization or natural infection. Detection of activated mumps-specific antibody-secreting memory B cells (ASCs) by EIA has been shown to be a more reliable test (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0066">66</link>). ASCs are detectable in circulation only following recent activation by antigen. In testing for ASCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are cultured in the presence of polyclonal mitogens, and the ASCs are detected by exposure to viral antigen. Trials with this method detected mumps ASCs in recently MMR-vaccinated individuals and in those with clinical mumps during a mumps outbreak. Detection of ASCs appears to be more sensitive for longer periods of time than RT-PCR or IgM EIA and may be useful for diagnosing mumps cases that cannot be confirmed with standard methods and for testing asymptomatic case contacts in an outbreak. Interestingly, mumps ASCs appear to be produced in lower numbers than measles or rubella ASCs, suggesting that mumps infection may not generate robust B-cell memory (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0066">66</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0107s0000p0065">Isolation of MuV in traditional or shell vial/microwell cell cultures is evidence of current or very recent infection. The same can be said for the detection of MuV RNA in clinical samples. Rapid antigen detection may also confirm the presence of MuV. Confirmation of MuV infection via the serologic route is less straightforward. MuV IgM may be detectable, along with significant increases in IgG, in patients infected with related viruses, including the other paramyxoviruses, such as HPIV-1, -2, -3, and -4. In general, cross-reactivity with related viruses can be ruled out by testing for antibodies to the related viruses in parallel with MuV virus antibody testing. The greatest increase in antibody level should identify the true infection. Given the potential lack of serologic test specificity, virus isolation and RNA detection in clinical samples (preferably buccal swabs) remain the most effective ways to confirm infection in unvaccinated individuals.</para>

      <para id="ch0107s0000p0066">Virus isolation and RNA detection have also been recommended for mumps diagnosis in individuals with a documented immunization history. Buccal swabs should be procured early (within 3 days of parotitis onset), as the duration of viral replication is likely to be shorter in these hosts. Despite these recommendations, it should be recognized that none of the traditional diagnostic approaches is highly effective for diagnosis of mumps in previously vaccinated individuals. IgM is not consistently observed, so it is not a reliable indicator of recent infection. Virus detection can also be variable, presumably due to low viral loads. Alternative tests may have better diagnostic efficacy. Data from the 2009 outbreak suggest that the IgM capture assay used at the CDC has improved sensitivity compared to commercially available tests in previously vaccinated individuals (~50% for CDC capture versus 9 to 24% for commercial assays) (<link linkend="ch0107s0000li0067">67</link>). Additionally, use of nucleoprotein RNA as a target enhanced the sensitivity of real-time PCR compared to the historically used SH-based test.
