      <para id="ch0145s000000p0002">The opportunistic hyaline or lightly colored molds constitute a phylogenetically diverse group of common to rare fungi, some of which are only known to reproduce asexually while others possess sexual and asexual life cycles. These fungi typically occur as saprobes in soil, in air, or on plant litter or as facultative plant pathogens. Some may be recovered from patients without having any clinical significance. Others are isolated infrequently enough to challenge the proficiency of a diagnostic laboratory, and critical assessment is required to evaluate the significance of their recovery. While several of the genera treated in this chapter include species that have either lightly colored or dark (melanized) conidia, the emphasis is on those fungi that grow in tissue in the form of hyaline or lightly colored, septate hyphae.</para>
      <para id="ch0145s000000p0003">The term “fusariosis” is used to define infections caused by species of<emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0038">1</link>) (<ulink url="ch0144#ch0144s000000a0011">Table 1</ulink>), but the practice of coining disease names based on the fungal genus is disadvantageous when infections are caused by uncommon or rare pathogens. The wide variety of fungi involved makes it difficult to place the organisms into accessible groups, and problems arise when fungal names are changed. To avoid unnecessary name changes for disease names based on a genus, two major disease groups have been proposed: hyalohyphomycosis and phaeohyphomycosis (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0039">2</link>). Although the groups were defined as encompassing similar clinical spectra, they were distinguished by the presence of septate hyphae in tissue without (hyalohyphomycosis) or with (phaeohyphomycosis) pigmentation or melanin in the fungal cell wall. However, some fungi, such as <emphasis>Scedosporium</emphasis> species or <emphasis>Neoscytalidium dimidiatum</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>Scytalidium dimidiatum</emphasis>) (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0040">3</link>), which form darkly pigmented colonies and conidia <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>, produce hyaline or lightly pigmented hyphae in tissue. Similarly, rare fusariosis cases have been reported to produce darkly pigmented colonies <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> and <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0041">4</link>). The Fontana-Masson stain helps to detect melanin pigmentation of fungal elements in tissue, but the results are not always conclusive (see also the discussion in <ulink url="ch0136#ch0136s0001">Chapter 116</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). Some fungi with variable pigmentation may stain faintly or inconsistently. In practice, the terms for the disease categories have been used to designate infections caused by fungi that are either hyaline or pigmented (melanized, phaeoid, dematiaceous) <emphasis>in vitro.</emphasis> Although it may be useful to have terms for broad categories of mycotic diseases, there are problems in categorizing fungi by color. A subcommittee of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) has suggested that fungal diseases be named by providing a specific description of the pathology and naming the causative agent, e.g., “subcutaneous cyst caused by fungus X” (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0042">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0043">6</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0145s000000p0004">The opportunistic hyaline molds include an ever-increasing number of genera. Most do not produce a teleomorph (meiotic sexual stage) in culture and comprise taxa that are either anamorphs (mitotic asexual stage) of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, or genera for which no sexual state has been described (see<ulink url="ch0138#ch0138s0001s0001">chapter 117</ulink> of this <emphasis>Manual</emphasis>). Today the relationships between many anamorphs (conidial fungi) and their sexual relatives (teleomorphs) are known through discovery of a sexual cycle or are inferred by phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequence data. This knowledge is extremely important in understanding fungal relationships and has allowed placement of fungi that were thought to only reproduce asexually next to their sexual relatives in fungal phylogenies. Rapid developments in this area have focused on circumscribing monophyletic genera and on recognition of genealogically exclusive, phylogenetically distinct species, particularly among the fusaria (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0044">7</link>–<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0054">17</link>). In species that are homothallic or self fertile (see <ulink url="ch0138#ch0138s0001s0001">chapter 117</ulink>), completion of a sexual cycle in culture may be difficult to obtain without the use of specialized media and extended incubation. When dual nomenclature was abandoned on January 1, 2013 (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0055">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0056">19</link>), this allowed for the unitary use of the name <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> over various teleomorph names for their sexual states, such as <emphasis>Gibberella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Neocosmospora</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0057">20</link>). Perithecial sexual states are not useful for the purpose of identification, in part because fewer than 10% are known to reproduce sexually. The majority of fusaria studied to date are presumed to be self sterile or heterothallic because PCR screens for mating type indicate that most possess only one of the two idiomorphs (i.e., <emphasis>MAT1-1</emphasis> and <emphasis>MAT1-2</emphasis>) required for sexual reproduction (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0058">21</link>)</para>

        <para id="ch0145s000000p0005">Prior to the development of DNA sequence-based phylogenetic classification of medically important fungi over the past 3 decades, most of the pathogenic conidial molds considered in this chapter were classified in the artifical group Hyphomycetes because they were not known to produce a sexual state (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0059">22</link>–<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0061">24</link>). Phenotypic identification of Hyphomycetes is based on morphology of the conidia and the mechanisms by which conidia are formed (conidiogenesis; see <ulink url="ch0138#ch0138s0001s0001">chapter 117</ulink>). Three basic tools are necessary for practical observation of these features. (i) An ocular micrometer is essential for determining sizes of conidia or sexual spores when present. Identification of molds often requires comparison with published taxonomic descriptions in which size is often a key criterion for species distinction. (ii) A dissecting microscope with magnification of up to ×60 and basal illumination is useful for examining colonies in plates or tubes for the presence of conidia in chains or slimy heads, specialized structures such as Hülle cells, sclerotia, conidiomata, or sexual fruiting bodies formed on the colony surface, under aerial mycelium, or embedded in the agar. (iii) Microscopic mounts that allow observation of how a fungus forms conidia also are necessary. Slide culture preparations are excellent for many fungi, and generally necessary for those with small, delicate conidia (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0062">25</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0063">26</link>); however, rapidly growing species such as those in the genus <emphasis>Trichoderma</emphasis> should be examined early by tease or tape mounts (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0064">27</link>). Morphologic features important for identification of conidial fungi include (i) conidium size, shape, and pattern of septation; (ii) color of conidia and conidiophore, whether light (hyaline) or dark (melanized or phaeoid); (iii) developmental aspects of conidiogenesis, including the nature of the conidiogenous cell; (iv) mechanism of conidium liberation or dehiscence; and (v) features of a multihyphal structure producing conidia (i.e., conidioma if present). Differences in conidial shape and septation are useful characters for preliminary distinction and have been used traditionally for grouping conidial fungi.</para>

        <para id="ch0145s000000p0006">Conidia may be nonseptate or may have one or more septa. Some fungi produce septate and nonseptate conidia. In a genus such as<emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis>, where large multiseptate and much smaller septate or nonseptate conidia are produced, they are referred to as macro- and microconidia, respectively. Conidia also vary in shape. Some macroconidia are long and narrow, as in <emphasis>Fusarium.</emphasis> Development of a conidium may occur by conversion of an existing cell or several cells (thallicarthric or arthrosporic) or may involve construction of a new wall or blowing out of a portion of a preexisting wall (blastic). Conidiogenesis usually occurs at a particular location on a conidiogenous cell. If development occurs at a site that remains fixed and gives rise to more than one conidium, then the site is referred to as stable or determinate. If conidia develop at new points on the conidiogenous cell (or axis), then the site is described as unstable or indeterminate. New sites may occur on an axis which lengthens (progressive) or shortens (retrogressive). Depending on the species, conidiogenous cells may produce a single conidium or multiple conidia. Sympodial development involves the development of a single conidium at each successive site, resulting in a geniculate conidiophore. Phialides and annellides are specialized conidiogenous cells that produce multiple conidia. Conidia may be produced successively (serially) and develop in slimy masses or in chains, with the youngest at the base of the chain (basipetal) or the youngest at the top of the chain (acropetal). Although it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between the two types of cells, the annellide elongates and sometimes narrows during formation of each new conidium, leaving an often imperceptible series of rings or scars on the conidiogenous cell, whereas the phialide usually does not elongate and sometimes forms a collarette on top of the conidiogenous cell. Scrutiny of the conidiogenous locus by use of an oil immersion objective may be necessary to make this distinction. Holoblastic conidiogenesis, in which the inner and outer cell walls are involved, usually results in the formation of acropetal chains. The distinction between acropetal and basipetal chains may be revealed by comparison of the size and wall morphologies of the distal and proximal conidia in the chain. The youngest conidium is recognizable by its smaller size, lighter color if the conidia are pigmented, and differences in wall ornamentation if the conidia are roughened. Some conidiogenous cells form multiple conidia simultaneously over the surface of the swollen cell. When mature, conidia detach by fission of a double septum (schizolytic dehiscence) or by lysis of a supporting cell (rhexolytic dehiscence). Lytic dehiscence typically occurs in the dermatophytes and other members of Onygenales.</para>
        <para id="ch0145s000000p0007">The presence of different conidial states can make identification difficult. Careful examination and sometimes subculture via a single spore or hyphal tip are required to assess whether the conidial types represent different states of the same fungus or whether the isolate is contaminated with more than one species. Some molds produce more than one type of conidial state (i.e., synanamorphs). These may be represented by simple yeast or yeast-like stages or by the formation of complex conidiomatal structures such as sporodochia (conidiophores borne crowded on a compact mass of hyphae or a hyphal stroma), synnemata (conidiophores aggregated into a compound stalk), or pycnidia (conidiogenous cells formed inside a round or oval fruiting body). Production of synanamorphs may be influenced by the agar medium used and may be lost upon repeated subculture.</para>

Some reports identify the fungus only to the genus level, while others provide the fungus name but without salient details of its colony and microscopic features. A continuing and vexing problem is that authenticity of published reports cannot be verified if the fungus is inadequately described and illustrated and if isolates are not deposited in publicly accessible culture collections. This chapter describes the salient colony and microscopic features of medically important species in the genus<emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> (<ulink url="ch0144#ch0144s000000a0015">Table 2</ulink>) and other select hyaline opportunists (<ulink url="ch0144#ch0144s000000a0032">Table 3</ulink>).

        <para id="ch0145s000000p0009">The spectrum of disease caused by hyaline molds is diverse. The disease is largely determined by the local and general immunologic and physiologic state of the host and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In most instances, the portal of entry for fungal propagules is likely via the lungs, sinus, or through a break in the epidermis due to trauma. Exceptions to this include introduction by means of contaminated surgical instruments, intraocular lenses, prosthetic devices, or other contaminated materials or solutions associated with surgery or routine health care. Individuals who have a severe debilitating disease or immunosuppressive therapy typically suffer from invasive pulmonary or paranasal sinus infections, but in some instances, the infecting fungus may spread to surrounding tissues or disseminate hematogenously to virtually any organ. Fungemia is uncommon except in disseminated<emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> infections. Noninvasive forms of infection also have been noted in debilitated individuals as well as in individuals with apparently normal defense mechanisms. In such cases, the fungus colonizes a preexisting cavity in the lungs such as an ectatic bronchus, a tuberculous cavity, or a lung cyst. Other clinical syndromes usually occurring in immunocompetent individuals include chronic sinusitis, onychomycosis, subcutaneous abscess, keratitis, otomycosis, and allergic manifestations including bronchopulmonary mycosis and sinusitis in atopic patients.</para>
        <para id="ch0145s000000p0010">Although the majority of saprobic and plant pathogenic molds are not considered pathogenic for humans and other animals and appear unlikely to be able to adapt to or take advantage of risk factors predisposing to opportunistic infection, those capable of growing at or near body temperature must be considered to have latent pathogenic capability. The diversity of fungi reported from human tissue has increased dramatically in recent years, concomitant with widespread species-level molecular systematic studies (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0065">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0079">42</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0080">43</link>), as reflected by new reports of proven infection. Moreover, certain fungi are isolated often enough to be suspicious for pathogenic potential. Still, there is a need for definitive evidence of infection due to a normally saprobic mold. The laboratory procedure for confirming fungal etiology includes: (i) detection of hyphae in the specimen that are compatible with the morphology of the isolated mold; (ii) isolation of several colonies of the fungus or isolation of the same fungus from two or more specimens over time; (iii) accurate identification of the isolated mold; and (iv) confirmation of the mold’s ability to grow at or near body temperature. It should be noted here, however, that some species that fail to grow at 35°C are capable of inciting systemic disease in profoundly immunocompromised individuals (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0081">44</link>) and are frequently agents of cutaneous/subcutaneous mycoses. Species of <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> or other hyaline molds isolated from deep tissue or body fluids must be considered potential invasive opportunistic pathogens. No fungal isolate should be discarded as a contaminant without thorough examination of the clinical specimen. Quality control measures are essential to ensure that isolation media are not contaminated (i.e., the fungus is growing from the specimen and not elsewhere on the agar medium). Close communication between microbiologists and physicians also is essential, especially for rare or unusual opportunists seen in individuals maintained on long-term immunosuppressive therapy.</para>

Biopsy material, transtracheal aspirates, and sputum samples collected in the early morning all may be useful specimens for the isolation and detection of hyaline molds, as are infected nails. Swabs taken from mucous membranes and skin lesions are not recommended. Although the reliability in determining whether an isolate is a possible pathogen is increased if cultures of two different specimens yield the same organism, direct microscopic examination with a fluorescent brightener, histological examination, and culture of a tissue biopsy are more informative. Blood cultures are generally of limited use for detecting invasive hyaline molds that produce dry conidia (microconidia in chains) suited for air dispersal, such as <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0082">45</link>), which rarely conidiate <emphasis>in vivo.</emphasis> However, <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> and other species that produce abundant yeast-like microconidia in wet masses, suited for water dispersal, can be disseminated hematogenically (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0083">46</link>). For optimum recovery, the specimen should be inoculated onto several types of media and incubated at 28 to 30°C. Opportunistic molds are variably susceptible to cycloheximide, so media containing this selective agent should be used cautiously. Suspicious isolates, especially of uncommon species, should be tested for their ability to grow at 35 to 37°C.

      <para id="ch0145s000000p0115"><emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species are ubiquitous soil saprobes and facultative plant pathogens that can cause infection or toxicosis in humans and other animals (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0052">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0065">28</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0086">49</link>–<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0088">51</link>). They belong to the order Hypocreales, family <emphasis>Nectriaceae.</emphasis> Clinically significant species are mostly self sterile or heterothallic, with only the conidial or asexual state observed in culture. Prior to the abandonment of dual nomenclature on January 1, 2013, <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> sexual states were classified in <emphasis>Gibberella, Neocosmospora</emphasis>, and other genera; however, these taxa should be reported as <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0057">20</link>). Recently members of the <emphasis>F. solani</emphasis> species complex (FSSC) were erroneously described under the name <emphasis>Neocosmospora</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0089">52</link>) because these authors mistakenly concluded that they were not part of a monophyletic <emphasis>Fusarium.</emphasis> However, based on comparative phylogenetic analyses of a 19-gene, 55.1-kb dataset that strongly supported a monophyletic <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> inclusive of the FSSC, the global clinical microbiological and phytopathological communities voiced nearly unaminous support for the unitary use of the name <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> for members of the FSSC and other early diverging lineages (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0075">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0076">39</link>). Unnecessary name changes of medically important fungi, such as renaming members of the FSSC as <emphasis>Neocosmospora</emphasis> based on the erroneous conclusion that they are not part of a monophyletic <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0089">52</link>), are strongly discouraged by the ISHAM Working Group on Nomenclature of Medical Fungi, to prevent nomenclatural instability (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0079">42</link>). Based on the analysis of a few genes that suggested <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> was non-monophyletic, a proposal was made to split the genus into multiple genera (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0090">53</link>). This proposal was rejected by the International Commission of <emphasis>Penicillium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis>, which opted to accept the broad traditional circumscripton of <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> to avoid name changes of these medically and biotechnologically important fungi. Recent comparative phylogenomic analyses strongly support <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> monophyly (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0091">54</link>) and suggest that the proposed segregation of multiple genera from <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> was premature (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0090">53</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0145s000000p0116">Several molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that fusaria once considered individual species by morphologic features are now known to represent species complexes (SCs) (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0044">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0045">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0051">14</link>–<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0054">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0077">40</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0092">55</link>–<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0095">58</link>). Multilocus phylogenetic studies have revealed that the most frequently recovered clinically important fusaria are nested within the FSSC (<link linkend="ch0145s000000a0049">Fig. 1A</link>). This SC comprises over 110 phylogenetically distinct species within three major clades, with the human and veterinary isolates restricted to clade 3 (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0049">12</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0075">38</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0096">59</link>). Most of the clinically important isolates are represented by three species that were initially designated groups 1 to 4 (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0045">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0054">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0097">60</link>). Subsequently, more robust typing studies identified 34 species within clade 3 of the FSSC and indicated that groups 3 and 4 comprised one phylospecies now recognized as <emphasis>Fusarium falciforme</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0049">12</link>). Because Latin binomials could not be applied to most of the species within clade 3 of this complex, species and multilocus haplotypes were distinguished by an ad hoc nomenclature using Arabic numbers and lowercase Roman letters, respectively (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0049">12</link>). The most important clinically relevant species within the FSSC are <emphasis>Fusarium petroliphilum</emphasis> (FSSC 1), <emphasis>Fusarium keratoplasticum</emphasis> (FSSC 2) (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0098">61</link>), <emphasis>F. falciforme</emphasis> (FSSC 3+4), <emphasis>Fusarium solani sensu stricto</emphasis> (FSSC 5) (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0099">62</link>), and <emphasis>Fusarium lichenicola</emphasis> (FSSC 16). To date, 23 species within the FSSC have been reported to cause mycotic infections of humans and other animals (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0075">38</link>). Although the <emphasis>Fusarium oxysporum</emphasis> SC (FOSC) is best known as an economically devastating group of vascular wilt pathogens on a wide range of agriculturally important plant hosts (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0100">63</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0101">64</link>), members of this genetically diverse complex of clonal lineages are some of the more common fusaria responsible for human disease (<link linkend="ch0145s000000a0049">Fig. 1B</link>). Multilocus sequence typing and AFLP analyses of over 100 isolates from the environment, hospital bronchoscopes, water sources, and clinical isolates identified a geographically widespread clonal lineage comprising &gt;70% of isolates genotyped (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0051">14</link>). These studies have further supported hospital water distribution systems as a potential source of health care-related infection (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0102">65</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0103">66</link>). Several medically important species are included within the species-rich <emphasis>Fusarium fujikuroi</emphasis> SC (FFSC) as defined by multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0044">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0046">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0047">10</link>). These include <emphasis>F. verticillioides</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000a0049">Fig. 1C</link>), <emphasis>F. proliferatum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000a0049">Fig. 1D</link>), <emphasis>F. napiforme</emphasis>, and <emphasis>F. nygamai.</emphasis> Another morphologically and phylogenetically diverse group of fusaria is the <emphasis>F. incarnatum-equiseti</emphasis> SC (FIESC) (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0048">11</link>). The first multilocus phylogenetic analysis of this complex indicated that it comprised at least 28 species (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0050">13</link>), but Latin binomials could be applied to only three of them with confidence (i.e., <emphasis>F. equiseti</emphasis> = FIESC 14, <emphasis>F. lacertarum</emphasis> = FIESC 4, and <emphasis>F. scirpi</emphasis> = FIESC 9). For this reason, an ad hoc informal nomenclature was developed for all of the species within this complex (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0050">13</link>). Recent studies of this complex indicate that it comprises 44 species, most of which have been formally described (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0077">40</link>). The <emphasis>F. chlamydosporum</emphasis> SC (FCSC) is also phylogenetically diverse and comprises at least eight species based on multilocus DNA analysis (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0050">13</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0095">58</link>). Similarly, the <emphasis>Fusarium dimerum</emphasis> species complex (FDSC) (<link linkend="ch0145s000000a0049">Fig. 1E</link> and <link linkend="ch0145s000000a0014">F</link>) currently contains seven named and two unnamed species (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0104">67</link>). Colonies produced by members of the FDSC are unlike those in the aforementioned SCs in that they frequently show slower growth, and aerial mycelium is either absent or only sparsely developed, so colonies appear mucoid to slimy (usually some shade of orange). Moreover, they produce distinctive, predominantly two-celled crescent-shaped macroconidia.</para>

      <para id="ch0145s000000p0118">Numerous toxic secondary metabolites produced by<emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species have been implicated in human disease, especially associated with the consumption of contaminated grain (see <ulink url="ch0151#ch0151s0001">chapter 130</ulink>) (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0106">69</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0107">70</link>).

DNA sequence data from some of the loci mentioned above are essential for identification of most clinically important fusaria to the species level (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0168">131</link>). In addition to NCBI GenBank, which is a valuable but challenging resource to use because many <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> sequences are misidentified (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0169">132</link>), FUSARIUM-ID is the only accessible nucleotide sequence database dedicated to identifying fusaria via a downloadable resource (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0078">41</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0093">56</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0161">124</link>).</para>

Human etiologic agents in the genus <emphasis>Phialemonium</emphasis> previously included <emphasis>P. obovatum</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. curvatum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0065">28</link>). <emphasis>P. obovatum</emphasis> is retained in the genus, and new species added include <emphasis>P. atrogriseum</emphasis> (<emphasis>Acremonium atrogriseum</emphasis>), <emphasis>P. inflatum</emphasis> (<emphasis>Paecilomyces inflatus</emphasis>), <emphasis>P. globosum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. limoniforme</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0198">161</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0232">195</link>). However, species that produced <emphasis>Sporodochium</emphasis>-like conidiomata (species previously reported as <emphasis>P. curvatum</emphasis>) were transferred to the genus <emphasis>Phialemoniopsis</emphasis>, which now includes <emphasis>P. curvata, P. pluriloculosa, P. cornearis, P. ocularis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. hongkongensis</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0198">161</link>). Recently, a study of <emphasis>Thyridium-</emphasis>like sexual morphs were found to produce <emphasis>Phialemoniopsis-</emphasis>like anamorphs. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses revealed that <emphasis>Phialemoniopsis</emphasis> is a synonym of the genus <emphasis>Thyridium</emphasis> and that the familial placement of <emphasis>Phialemoniopsis, Phialemoniopsidaceae</emphasis>, is a synonym of <emphasis>Thyridiaceae</emphasis> in the order Thyridiales. As a consequence, all <emphasis>Phialemoniopsis</emphasis> species were transferred to the genus <emphasis>Thyridium</emphasis> as <emphasis>T. cornearis, T. curvatum, T. endophyticum, T. hongkongense, T. limonesiae, T. pluriloculosum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>T. oculorum</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0233">196</link>). As many of these genera are very similar morphologically, identification to the species level is very difficult without molecular data. Thus, many reports of infection are based on unidentified species (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0052">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0145s000000li0228">191</link>).

The genera <emphasis>Coniochaeta</emphasis> and <emphasis>Phialemonium</emphasis> differ from <emphasis>Acremonium</emphasis> by their formation of short, stumpy phialides without basal septa (called adelophialides) in addition to the more spindle-shaped phialides (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0234">197</link>), but these distinctions are not always readily observed. <emphasis>Coniochaeta mutabilis</emphasis> differs from <emphasis>C. hoffmannii</emphasis> in forming brown chlamydospores on sporulation media (<link linkend="ch0145s000000li0199">162</link>).</para>
