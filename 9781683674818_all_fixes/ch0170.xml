      <para id="ch0170s0000p0002">Nematodes are unsegmented cylindrical worms with a body cavity containing an alimentary canal and genital system; the sexes are separate. They have longitudinal muscles, which allow them to move by flexing their bodies. There are four or five larval stages and the adult worm. In most instances, the third-stage larva is the infective stage.</para>
      <para id="ch0170s0000p0003">Intestinal nematodes include the soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), which are among the most common infections globally with more than 1.5 billion people infected, especially in tropical and subtropical regions and in resource-poor settings where sanitation is inadequate. These parasites are a major cause of poor health, with the greatest morbidity in women and children, and are included in the list of Neglected Tropical Diseases by the World Health Organization (WHO) (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0053">1</link>). By definition, STH infections refer to ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm. Although <emphasis>Strongyloides stercoralis</emphasis> also has a soil-transmitted cycle, it differs from most other helminths in its capacity to reproduce within a human host. However, there has been a compelling argument that the control of strongyloidiasis should be promoted in conjunction with STH control programs (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0054">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0170s0000li0055">3</link>). Control measures for strongyloidiasis are now being included in many STH treatment programs in areas of endemicity (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0055">3</link>). In developed countries, groups such as immigrants and refugees, travelers, and war veterans often unknowingly harbor intestinal helminths for years after leaving an area of endemicity. This has implications for provision of health services and necessitates action to formulate guidelines for managing infections that are not commonly seen in these countries (e.g., guidelines formulated within Australia [4]). Chronic morbidity in humans from STH infections can be reduced by periodic treatment with anthelmintics in high-risk populations. In particular, global efforts to target STH infections in children with school-based chemotherapy have reduced the prevalence of infection in many lower- and middle-income countries (3; <ulink url="http://www.who.int/intestinal_worms/en/">http://www.who.int/intestinal_worms/en/</ulink>). However, monitoring and evaluation of treatment programs is labor intensive, and newer technologies are needed for assessing program effectiveness. Deworming programs need to distinguish between populations where parasitic infection is controlled and those where further treatment is required. Where possible, the use of real-time PCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction or similar high-throughput molecular diagnostics) has been suggested in this context due to its improved sensitivity and specificity when compared to traditional microscopic methods (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0057">5</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0170s0000p0004">Conventional laboratory diagnosis is based primarily on microscopic examination of feces and differentiation of species based on morphology of eggs or larvae detected (<anchor id="ch0170s0000a0002"/><link linkend="ch0170s0000a0006">Fig. 1</link> through <anchor id="ch0170s0000a0003"/><link linkend="ch0170s0000a0010">3</link>). The sensitivity of microscopy is influenced by the method of processing, e.g., direct microscopy, formalin-ethyl acetate concentration, Kato-Katz smears, or mini-FLOTAC (University of Naples Frederico II, Naples, Italy), and is affected by factors such as variability of the number of eggs or larvae excreted. Occasionally adult worms may be processed by histology, and anatomical features of both the adult worm and the eggs may be used in identifying the parasite (<anchor id="ch0170s0000a0004"/><link linkend="ch0170s0000a0011">Fig. 4</link> and <anchor id="ch0170s0000a0005"/><link linkend="ch0170s0000a0012">5</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0170s0000p0005">Molecular diagnosis for intestinal nematodes (including real-time multiplex PCR; 6) is increasingly being introduced in diagnostic laboratories. There are issues with sensitivity of assays for<emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> in particular (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0059">7</link>); in chronic infection, numbers of larvae may be low and they are intermittently excreted in feces. The number of eggs produced by a single adult female <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> is estimated at only 30 to 50 per day. This exceptionally low yield compared to the output of the STH worms accounts for some of the diagnostic difficulties encountered in screening for this species. In research studies, real-time PCR on a single fecal sample has compared favorably to quadruplicate Kato-Katz microscopy performed on 2 separate days and shows markedly improved sensitivity in patients with low-burden STH infection (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0060">8</link>). The sensitivity of real-time PCR assays is dependent on the assay chosen, and some commercial multiplex panels appear to have a sensitivity equivalent to, or slightly lower than, microscopy concentration methods in early evaluations (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0061">9</link>). It should be noted that the method of sample preservation, transport and storage temperature, and choice of DNA extraction method will affect the sensitivity of STH real-time PCR assays (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0062">10</link>). The inclusion of a bead-beating step in the DNA extraction stage is necessary to ensure optimal sensitivity (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0061">9</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0170s0000p0008">There are a variety of morphological features and DNA sequences which form the basis for taxonomy of nematodes. At the anterior end, mouth parts may possess structures for attachment or penetration. These may include spines, hooks, or cutting plates. The pharyngeal cavity may be short, hollowed out, or long and hairlike. Esophageal shape also varies but usually ends in a muscular bulb. In the male, features of the tail may include caudal papillae and copulatory spicules (sclerotized copulatory aids) or bursa. Studies strongly suggest that nematodes are actually related to the arthropods and priapulids in a newly recognized group, the Ecdysozoa. All these nematodes belong to Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Nemathelminthes (Nematoda). The nematode infections described in detail in this chapter are by no means exhaustive but include those commonly associated with human infection on a worldwide scale. This chapter is confined to consideration of the soil-transmitted helminths (including<emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis>) and <emphasis>Enterobius vermicularis.</emphasis> From time to time, other less common species may be encountered, and the assistance of reference laboratories covering both human and veterinary diagnostic services may be required.</para>

It is important to transport and process feces specimens for parasitic examination as soon as possible following collection. Clinicians and collection staff should be encouraged to send fresh specimens to the laboratory without delay. It should be noted that formalin-based fixatives will damage DNA and may not allow subsequent molecular analysis. If delay is inevitable, specimens should be refrigerated or transported in commercially available vials or kits with a preservative recommended by the testing laboratory. If these are not available at the point of collection, preservative should be added as soon as the specimen is received in the laboratory. Excellent directions for proper collection are available with these kits. Discussion on which preservative to use depends on various considerations such as whether permanent-stained smears or immunoassays are required. Two or three specimens collected over a period of 7 to 10 days is optimal. Specimens that are very small in volume or obviously dry should be rejected and a fresh specimen should be collected. Refrigeration and the use of preservatives should be avoided if agar plate culture (APC) or Baermann procedures for culture of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> larvae are required (for details, see reference <link linkend="ch0170s0000li0066">14</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0170s0000p0023">Eggs passed in feces (diagnostic stage) have an unsegmented ovum; this develops in the soil over 10 to 15 days to reach an infective-stage larva (<anchor id="ch0170s0000a0029"/><link linkend="ch0170s0000a0038">Table 1</link>). Eggs may survive in this form for years under favorable conditions of heat and humidity. Infection follows the ingestion of embryonated eggs (infective stage) that hatch in the small intestine. Larvae penetrate the intestinal mucosa, and the venous circulation carries them to the lungs. From here they migrate to the trachea and are swallowed. They then complete their development into mature adult worms in the small intestine, with eggs produced after 60 to 70 days. A minority of individuals develop heavy infections and act as an important source of transmission.</para>

      <para id="ch0170s0000p0025">Initial infection is usually asymptomatic. Migration of larvae through the lungs may result in an eosinophilic pneumonitis with cough, fever, and dyspnea. This may occur up to 2 weeks after infection and lasts approximately 3 weeks. Bronchospasm can be prominent and, although rare, may be fatal.</para>
      <para id="ch0170s0000p0026">The clinical features in established infections relate to the worm burden. Most infections are light and asymptomatic, but nonspecific abdominal symptoms may occur. Heavy infections are associated with malnutrition and impaired growth in children. Intestinal obstruction is an uncommon complication in children with a very large worm burden and may have a high mortality rate in some settings (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0055">3</link>). Ectopic ascariasis occasionally occurs when adult worms attempt to escape the gut lumen. This may be a spontaneous event or may occur in response to febrile illness, medication, or anesthesia. Worms may enter hepatobiliary and pancreatic ducts or the appendix and cause obstruction, resulting in biliary colic, cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, acute pancreatitis, appendicitis, or a hepatic abscess. It occurs more commonly in countries with high rates of infection where the parasite is endemic.

        <para id="ch0170s0000p0028">The primary diagnosis of infection is by demonstration of<emphasis>A. lumbricoides</emphasis> eggs in feces. The fertilized eggs are round to oval, bile stained, mammillated, and thick walled and 50 to 80 μm long by 40 to 60 μm wide. Both fertilized and unfertilized eggs may be found in the same specimen; fertilized eggs are more elongate (up to 90 μm) than unfertilized eggs. Multiple specimens taken on separate days may be required. Concentration methods such as formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation or saturated solution flotation methods should be used for optimal yield. Decorticated fertile and infertile eggs may be difficult to recognize (<link linkend="ch0170s0000a0007">Fig. 2B</link> and <link linkend="ch0170s0000a0022">C</link>).

        <para id="ch0170s0000p0045">The primary diagnosis of infection is by demonstration of the presence of eggs on the skin in the perineal area by using the “sticky tape” method (eggs adhere to cellulose tape and can then be detected microscopically). Briefly, a strip of cellulose tape, folded onto a microscopy slide with adhesive side outwards, is pressed firmly against the right and left perianal folds, preferably early in the morning. The tape is then spread back over the slide with the adhesive side down and examined directly under the microscope. Visibility of eggs can be improved by lifting the tape from the slide, adding a drop of xylene or xylene substitute, and pressing the tape back down on the slide. This helps clear the preparation, and the eggs can be observed clearly (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0074">22</link>, <link linkend="ch0170s0000li0075">23</link>). If a frosted tape is submitted by mistake, a drop of immersion oil on the top of the tape will clear it enough for microscopy. Repeated preparations on 2 to 3 consecutive days may be required. Commercial collection kits (Evergreen Scientific, Los Angeles, CA, or Swube [Becton Dickinson], Sparks, MD) are available in some countries. Eggs are occasionally present in feces. Eggs are non-bile stained, ovoid, asymmetrical with a characteristic shape (concave on one side and flat on the other), smooth, and thick walled and may contain a partially or fully developed larva (<link linkend="ch0170s0000a0007">Fig. 2F</link>).

      <para id="ch0170s0000p0058">The major clinical manifestation of hookworm infection is iron-deficiency anemia due to intestinal blood loss and depletion of iron stores. The degree of iron deficiency induced by hookworms depends on the intensity and duration of infection, the species of hookworm, and the iron status of the host. It has been estimated that a single<emphasis>A. duodenale</emphasis> worm can withdraw as much as 0.2 ml of blood per day, whereas <emphasis>N. americanus</emphasis> withdraws approximately 0.05 ml. <emphasis>A. ceylanicum</emphasis> has also been recorded as causing a similar jejunal infection with associated anemia.

Young children, women of reproductive age, and pregnant women are most at risk for iron-deficiency anemia because of inadequate dietary iron and reduced iron reserves. Anemia during pregnancy is linked to maternal morbidity and mortality, impaired lactation, and prematurity and/or low-birth-weight infants. In children, iron-deficiency anemia may be associated with impaired neurocognitive development, reduced school performance, and exercise intolerance.</para>

Other manifestations (e.g., dermatological, pulmonary) are less common.</para>
      <para id="ch0170s0000p0081">Recurrent pruritic, slightly serpiginous, erythematous rashes may develop rapidly due to larval migration in the skin (“larva currens”). These are seen most commonly on the buttocks, groin, and trunk; movement under the skin is relatively rapid (several centimeters per hour) and may continue for 1 to 2 days. Other, less distinctive urticarial and papular rashes also occur. In contrast, cutaneous larva migrans due to animal hookworm species is very serpiginous and develops very slowly over weeks to months. Although pulmonary symptoms are uncommon in uncomplicated strongyloidiasis, passage of larvae through the lung may be associated with a cough, wheezing and dyspnea, and patchy infiltrates upon radiography (Loeffler-like syndrome).</para>
      <para id="ch0170s0000p0082">In chronic infection it is thought that there is a balance between immunity and the level of infection. However, this equilibrium may be lost when illness or drug therapy leads to immunosuppression. Exacerbation of symptoms can occur in as little as 6 days after commencement of treatment with corticosteroids. The resulting disseminated strongyloidiasis or hyperinfection syndrome has a very high fatality rate (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0085">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0170s0000li0097">45</link>, <link linkend="ch0170s0000li0098">46</link>).

      <para id="ch0170s0000p0083">In disseminated disease, migration of larvae extends to multiple organs, and this can be associated with bacteremia and even meningitis caused by Gram-negative bacilli carried from the gut during migration of the larvae. Hyperinfection results from proliferation of worms with no spreading beyond the normal pattern of migration. Large numbers of larvae (and occasionally embryonated eggs) in stool and sputum produce severe gastrointestinal and/or respiratory symptoms (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0099">47</link>). Within the bowel, the range of symptoms include generalized inflammation, colitis, proctitis, and mucosal ulceration. Most cases of strongyloidiasis associated with solid organ transplantation have been due to the reactivation of a latent infection in the recipient as a result of the immunosuppressive therapy; however, donor-derived infections are becoming increasingly frequent (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0100">48</link>). Current practice guidelines need to be updated to incorporate immunological and molecular techniques for the rapid screening for strongyloidiasis prior to transplantation, and empirical treatment with ivermectin should be considered (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0095">43</link>).</para>

In chronic infection, the sensitivity of microscopy is generally low, as larvae are shed sporadically and numbers depend on the stage and severity of the infection. For this reason, multiple specimens collected over several days should be examined. Coproculture is an alternative method of detection of larvae in freshly passed stool specimen. Ideally, this should be attempted for all suspected cases, especially with patients from areas where the infection is endemic. It is important that the specimen be sent directly to the laboratory, without refrigeration or addition of preservative. The critical factor in culture methods is that large quantities of stool can be processed. This improves the sensitivity compared with standard procedures such as formalin-ethyl acetate concentration or Kato-Katz smear. Care should be exercised in the handling of these cultures, as the larvae present are filariform or infectious and capable of crossing intact skin.

It should be noted that a small number of patients with active infection (especially those immunocompromised) will not generate detectable antibody responses, and therefore APC or PCR may be necessary to include in any diagnostic algorithm. Multiple commercial and noncommercial diagnostic ELISA assays are available, employing crude <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> or <emphasis>Strongyloides ratti</emphasis> larval antigens or newer recombinant antigens such as NIE (31 kDa antigen). The sensitivity and specificity of these assays vary by antigen, but are generally between 75 to 94% and 82 to 96%, respectively (<link linkend="ch0170s0000li0114">63</link>).

If antibodies are detected, efforts should be made to establish a parasitological diagnosis (microscopic and culture) and to exclude infection with other parasites that could result in cross-reacting antibodies. <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> serology should be performed for all at-risk candidates for immunosuppressive therapy (see below). Assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of serological methods is difficult because of the lack of sensitivity of a fecal-based reference (“gold”) standard.
