      <para id="ch0067s000000p0001"><emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> spp., which are found in domestic animals and among wildlife, including marine mammals, cause infections in humans that can mimic other infectious and noninfectious diseases, posing challenges to health care providers in reaching a diagnosis. The remittent/undulant fever of brucellosis was first confused with other diseases, such as malaria and typhoid fever, and has had many synonyms pertaining mainly to the geographic locations where the disease occurred: Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Gibraltar fever, and Cyprus fever (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0002">2</link>). Over the past decade, there has been renewed interest in this organism due to its inclusion in the potential biological weapons lists of most authorities (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0003">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0004">4</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0067s000000p0002">The taxonomy of the family<emphasis>Brucellaceae</emphasis> and its phylogenetic aspects have been an ongoing challenge over the years and are currently a matter of debate, especially as it relates to the proposed reclassification of members of the genus <emphasis>Ochrobactrum</emphasis> into the genus <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0005">5</link>). The family <emphasis>Brucellaceae</emphasis> comprises zoonotic pathogenic species belonging to the genus <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> as well as the environmental genus <emphasis>Ochrobactrum</emphasis>, some species of which are considered opportunistic pathogens. Recently, a group of taxonomists addressed this while reviewing in-depth phylogenetic, genomic, and taxonomic studies and concluded that the genera <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ochrobactrum</emphasis> must be maintained apart. This is especially so since the epidemiology, prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of the diseases they cause are unrelated. Merging free-living <emphasis>Ochrobactrum</emphasis> organisms with highly pathogenic <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> organisms brings evident risks for veterinarians, medical doctors, and public health authorities who confront brucellosis, a significant zoonosis worldwide (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0006">6</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0067s000000p0009">The exact pathophysiologic aspects of infection remain to be defined, especially since this “stealth pathogen” can infect and survive without inducing a massive inflammatory response (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0017">17</link>–<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0021">21</link>). The intracellular location and survival of the organism contribute to its virulence and pathogenesis. Virulence determinants include urease to avoid stomach acid through oral passage and <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis>-containing vacuoles, which enable escape from immune system recognition and provide an acidic environment to hamper antibiotic activity. A <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> LPS cell component (containing a poly-<emphasis>N</emphasis>-formyl perosamine O chain and a CuZn superoxide dismutase) and outer membrane protein 25 (OMP25) help the bacteria survive within mononuclear phagocytes. In addition, <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> LPS poorly induces gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha, both of which are essential for T-helper 1-type cell-mediated immunity for elimination of the organism (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0020">20</link>–<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0022">22</link>).</para>

After entry into a cell, the first step entails establishment of an intracellular replication niche; <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> LPS and a periplasmic cyclic β-glucan are essential for this step. <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> spp. escape from phagocytic killing by inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion and hence evade the immune system. These factors, together with the <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis>-containing vacuole, aid in the organism’s survival, propagation, and persistence within macrophages and other cells. As <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> spp. remain within macrophages, they are transported through regional lymph nodes into the circulatory system and are subsequently seeded throughout the body, with tropism for the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in different clinical phases of disease (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0018">18</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0067s000000p0012">Protective immunity, though not long term, is conferred by antibodies to LPS and T-cell-mediated macrophage activation, triggered by protein antigens. Lymphocytes are the main stimulant of the immune response.

The epidemiology of human brucellosis differs between areas of endemicity and nonendemicity in terms of age, sex, season, and risk factors. In regions of endemicity, such as the eastern Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, the Arabian Peninsula, Mexico, Central and South America, southern Europe, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent, the disease occurs among the general population mostly due to ingestion of unpasteurized goat, sheep, cow, and camel milk or its products (e.g., soft cheese and ice cream) (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0031">31</link>–<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0034">34</link>). In areas of endemicity, brucellosis in childhood is as prevalent as that in adults and presents in a similar manner (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0033">33</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0035">35</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0067s000000p0015">In areas where the disease is not endemic, infection is seen predominantly among adult males, acquired occupationally by transmission through direct skin contact (e.g., through cuts and abrasions) with infected animal parts, inhalation of aerosolized infected particles, and accidental inoculation (e.g., sprays or aerosols inoculated into the eye, mouth, and nose). These infections occur mostly among dairy industry professionals, veterinarians, abattoir workers, and clinical and research microbiology staff (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0002">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0028">28</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0067s000000p0043">In the United States, serologic diagnosis of brucellosis is primarily performed at large reference or public health laboratories. For serologic diagnosis, EIAs are frequently used to screen samples due to their higher throughput, and when IgM and/or IgG are detected, results are confirmed by agglutination prior to reporting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers<emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> microagglutination testing (BMAT) (<ulink url="https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/serology.html">https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/serology.html</ulink>) which can be beneficial in situations where reference laboratory testing is challenging to interpret.</para>
        <para id="ch0067s000000p0044">Brucellacapt (Vircell, Granada, Spain) has been introduced as a rapid (18- to 24-h) and easy-to-use serologic test. The test is based on an immunocapture agglutination method that can detect, in a single step, IgG and IgA antibodies; it seems to be useful in the follow-up of disease activity. The sensitivity and specificity are similar to those of Coombs test. However, since the latter test is cumbersome because of multiple washing steps, centrifugation, and a long turnaround time (48 h), Brucellacapt can offer a valuable alternative and can be helpful in patient follow-up (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0077">77</link>). Immunochromatographic lateral-flow dipstick tests have been advocated for screening/surveillance of patients with brucellosis in areas of endemicity during outbreaks and as field tests. They are simple, rapid, and easy to perform and have high (&gt;90%) sensitivity and specificity (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0078">78</link>).</para>

        <para id="ch0067s000000p0046">Interpretation of serologic test results in relation to exposure, diagnosis, and prognosis of the disease necessitates an accurate assessment of the patient clinical history, immune status, and symptom duration, alongside an understanding of the usefulness and pitfalls of the laboratory tests (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0027">27</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0062">62</link>). Positive cutoff titers in the <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> SAT or serum microagglutination test for diagnosis have generally been ≥80 or ≥160, respectively, for symptomatic patients. However, lower titers with the SAT have been reported for patients with active disease (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0026">26</link>). Moreover, one must be careful when negative serology is encountered when brucellosis is suspected, since this may be due, for example, to infection with <emphasis>B. canis</emphasis>, which can be missed by serologic assays using <emphasis>B. abortus</emphasis> or <emphasis>B. melitensis</emphasis> antigen. In addition, this may be due to early disease presentation or use of slide tests or SAT alone; repeat testing after 1 to 2 weeks may be warranted (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0072">72</link>). A combination of agglutinating (SAT) and nonagglutinating (e.g., Brucellacapt or indirect Coombs) tests is recommended to definitively exclude <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> species infection.</para>
        <para id="ch0067s000000p0047">Research studies show that in acute brucellosis, elevations in<emphasis>Brucella</emphasis>-specific IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, IgG1, and IgG3 occur, while in patients with chronic brucellosis, elevations in IgG, IgA, IgE, IgG1, and IgG4 are usually observed (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0026">26</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0060">60</link>). Monitoring treatment response requires sequential follow-up of serologic titers. A decline indicates a good prognosis, with persistently high titers necessitating continuous monitoring and a resurgence in antibody titers indicating relapse or reinfection. Slide and tube agglutination titers fall faster than with Coombs test, Brucellacapt, and EIA, because the latter titers can stay positive for years (e.g., 2 to 3 years). Persistence of residual positive titers in cured fully treated patients is not unexpected (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0060">60</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0073">73</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0075">75</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0080">80</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0081">81</link>).

Markers for differentiating active from inactive disease are being sought. For example, anti-<emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> cytoplasmic or periplasmic protein antibodies, as determined by EIA, increased only in patients with active brucellosis and are a better predictor of cure than anti-LPS antibodies (<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0080">80</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s000000li0082">82</link>–<link linkend="ch0067s000000li0084">84</link>).</para>
