      <para id="ch0013s0001p0001">The<emphasis>Manual of Clinical Microbiology</emphasis> (MCM) is the most authoritative reference text in the field of clinical microbiology. This edition of the <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> ushers in a new era with ClinMicroNow. In response to authors’ and readers’ concerns that some content is out of date by the time the book is printed, an online version with periodic updates to keep pace with emerging pathogens and rapid changes in taxonomy and diagnostic modalities was introduced. Just as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was accelerating, the authors of the <emphasis>Corona</emphasis><emphasis>virus</emphasis> chapter added new content resulting in three updates over the last three years. We appreciate ASM Press Director Christine Charlip for her vision and leadership in the development and establishment of ClinMicroNow as a new tool for accessing this important content.</para>
      <para id="ch0013s0001p0002">In addition to updates in each chapter, this edition of the<emphasis>Manual</emphasis> has exciting new content. A valuable new chapter on diagnostic stewardship was added, and the chapters on the <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> were expanded to better organize the content. Additionally, taxonomic updates have been included with every chapter, and the use of nucleic acid sequencing and MALDI-TOF MS in the identification of fungi and parasites has also been expanded.</para>
      <para id="ch0013s0001p0003">This 13<superscript>th</superscript> edition benefited from the talents of a team of 22 editors and over 300 authors who were supported by a very capable production team at ASM Press. All editorial board members are proud members of the American Society for Microbiology and strong supporters of its book publishing arm, ASM Press. In this edition, we are excited to welcome Esther Babady, Matt Binnicker, Marc Couturier, Nate Ledeboer, Benjamin Pinsky, Patricia Simner, and Christine Turenne as new section editors. We are very pleased that James Karlowsky, previously a Section Editor for diagnostic strategies and general topics, and Bobbi Pritt, previously a section editor for parasitology, returned in new roles as Volume Editors. We are also grateful to the returning volume editors, Marie Landry, Alexander McAdam, and Robin Patel, and returning Section Editors, J. Stephen Dumler, Elizabeth Johnson, Elisabeth Nagy, Jean Patel, Johann Pitout, Gary Procop, and Yi-Wei Tang.</para>
      <para id="ch0013s0001p0004">We have followed in the footsteps of previous authors and editors of the<emphasis>Manual</emphasis> and remain steadfastly committed to the utmost quality and timeliness that the MCM readership has come to expect. We hope that readers of the <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> will recognize the commitment to excellence by everyone associated with its production.</para>
      <para id="ch0013s0001p0005">We represent the sixth and seventh editors in chief in the 50-year history of the<emphasis>Manual</emphasis>. We are grateful for the example set by our predecessors and for the sage advice offered by recent editors in chief Patrick Murray, James Versalovic, and James Jorgensen. We offer our deep appreciation to Ellen Fox, who provided calm competence in driving the editorial production process.</para>
      <para id="ch0013s0001p0006">This is a very dynamic era in clinical microbiology, with new technical tools (MALDI-TOF MS, Sanger, and second- and third-generation next-generation sequencing, and other molecular methods) that are profoundly influencing our approaches to organism detection and identification. The<emphasis>Manual</emphasis> continues to include classic microbiological techniques such as microscopy and culture as a foundation in addition to the newer methods cited above. Some organisms have become prominent causes of disease recently, e.g., Ebola, SARS CoV-2, Monkeypox, enterovirus D-68, Gram-negative bacteria that produce carbapenemases, and multi-drug-resistant fungi such as <emphasis>Candida auris</emphasis> and <emphasis>Lomentospora prolificans</emphasis>. Every effort was made to include up-to-date information in the <emphasis>Manual</emphasis> on these emergent organisms. Likewise, advances in molecular taxonomy have resulted in major changes in genus and species designations among bacteria, fungi and protozoan parasites. Applications of sequencing technologies to elucidate the human microbiome have led to the discovery of many novel species and the reorganization of entire families of bacteria. All of these changes are reflected in this version of the Manual.</para>
      <para id="ch0013s0001p0007">In conclusion, we are profoundly grateful for the privilege of guiding the<emphasis>Manual</emphasis> through the publication of this 13th edition. We hope that the efforts of the editors and authors will prove useful to the clinical microbiology community until the next edition is available in about 4 more years.</para>
