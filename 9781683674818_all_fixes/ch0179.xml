      <para id="ch0179s0001p0002">Accurate methods for ascertaining responses of parasites to antiparasitic drugs can prove useful at several levels. Depending on the test, they can assist in the clinical management of individual patients, yield epidemiologic information that may guide drug use policies and public health interventions, and offer crucial research tools for the development of new and better drugs. Drug susceptibility tests can be separated into four broad categories:<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> tests, <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> tests, tests with experimental animals, and molecular tests.</para>
      <para id="ch0179s0001p0003"><emphasis>In vivo</emphasis> tests with patients directly assess the clinical efficacies of existing compounds. These tests are performed as part of epidemiologic investigations, and their modest technical requirements make them suitable for use under field conditions in developing countries. The interpretation of <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> tests is limited by potential interference by factors related to the host (e.g., immunity or variations in drug intake or metabolism) or to the environment (e.g., reinfections). However, such tests have proven instrumental in guiding drug use policies, particularly for malaria.</para>
      <para id="ch0179s0001p0004"><emphasis>In vitro</emphasis> tests circumvent these interferences by isolating the parasites from their hosts and investigating them in culture under controlled laboratory conditions, which provides opportunities for repeated assessments against multiple compounds, including experimental compounds. <emphasis>In vitro</emphasis> tests, however, are technically more demanding and therefore less amenable to performance under field conditions. They are most feasible for investigation of unicellular parasites (formerly known as protozoa) that multiply rapidly in culture. They are of limited use for assessing inactive drug precursors that must be activated by the host or drugs whose antiparasitic activities necessitate the synergistic effect of the host’s immune defenses.</para>
      <para id="ch0179s0001p0005">Tests with experimental animal models permit investigations of parasites that cannot be grown in culture or of drugs not yet approved for use in humans. This approach accommodates the advantages of human<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> drug testing without the potential of exposing persons to toxic drugs that may be ineffective. However, its use is predicated on a suitable animal model for the infection and on the availability of appropriate facilities for maintaining the test animals. Furthermore, for animal models to be relevant for extrapolating to human, the pharmacokinetics of the drug under investigation should be similar in the particular model used and in humans.</para>
      <para id="ch0179s0001p0006">Molecular tests detect genetic DNA variations that are potentially linked with resistance. Such tests offer unique advantages. Molecular tests can be performed even with minute amounts of nonviable parasite genetic material. They can be run in batches, allowing large-scale epidemiologic studies. Molecular analysis can circumvent potential ambiguities associated with the polyclonality of parasites infecting a single host, which are occasionally encountered in<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> or <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> tests, and allows the differentiation of such within-host parasite populations. Because of their short duration (hours), molecular diagnostic procedures could potentially be used to guide patient management. <emphasis>In vivo</emphasis> and <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> tests usually require more time (days to weeks) and yield results that are used mainly for epidemiologic surveillance and experimental chemotherapy studies. Drawbacks of molecular tests reside in their technical requirements and in the need to be certain that the markers or genes evaluated correlate with functional resistance. However, thanks to the development of more practical protocols and more robust automated equipment, as well as a better understanding of the genes that confer resistance, molecular techniques are being used in an increasing number of laboratories, including field facilities.</para>
      <para id="ch0179s0001p0007">These different categories of tests provide complementary information. At one end of the spectrum, molecular tests analyze parasites at their most basic biologic level, without any outside interference. At the other end,<emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> tests in patients reflect complex interactions between host and parasite and are most relevant for clinicians and public health practitioners. While a good correlation based on various test methods is desirable, some degree of discrepancy should be expected to result from factors linked to the host or the culture conditions. Indeed, a judicious analysis of such discrepancies might provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of drug action and resistance.</para>
      <para id="ch0179s0001p0008">These points are illustrated in the following discussion of test methods used for five parasitic diseases, selected for their particular chemotherapeutic challenges. However, tests to screen new antiparasitic drugs have also been developed for other medically relevant parasites, such as<emphasis>Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia duodenalis</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Toxoplasma gondii</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0001">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0002">2</link>), but are not detailed in this chapter.

        <para id="ch0179s0001s0001p0001">Most drug resistance tests in malaria focus on<emphasis>Plasmodium falciparum</emphasis>, the most prevalent and virulent species. Initial recognition of drug-resistant malaria occurs most often in a clinical context, and confirmation is frequently sought by <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> tests. <emphasis>In vivo</emphasis> tests aim to document the parasitological and clinical response of a malaria infection in a patient treated with a standard dose of the test drug and monitored under controlled conditions. Initially standardized by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the response of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> to chloroquine, <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> tests have been modified several times for increased performance and assessments of other drugs (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0003">3</link>). An increasing number of <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> tests comparing drug schemes have been performed since 1996, as it was necessary to assess the response of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> to artemisinin-based combined therapy (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0004">4</link>). With regard to the fast-acting artemisinin derivatives, robust measurement of parasite clearance time has been introduced (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0005">5</link>). Nevertheless, the diversity of study designs and analytical methods can affect the estimated drug failure rates in therapeutic efficacy studies (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0006">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0007">7</link>). Among key variables considered to determine the therapeutic response are <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species, outcome measured, level of immunity, and adjustment to classify parasite recurrence as recrudescence of the initial infection from either dormant liver forms (e.g., for <emphasis>Plasmodium vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>Plasmodium ovale</emphasis>) or incomplete clearance of erythrocytic forms or as new infections arising during the several-week follow-up period in drug trials. Incorporating consideration of pharmacokinetic parameters is important for identifying true resistance to drugs partnered with artemisinins, because the partner drugs are frequently poorly absorbed or slowly eliminated drugs (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0008">8</link>), and for identifying poor drug metabolizers in specific cases such as primaquine treatment failure (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0009">9</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0179s0001s0001p0002">Experimental humanized mouse models containing human hepatocytes and erythrocytes are seeing early success and will permit preclinical investigations of human parasites and drugs not yet approved for use in humans (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0010">10</link>–<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0012">12</link>) and the development of powerful approaches for investigating the genetic architecture of drug resistance (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0013">13</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0179s0001s0001p0003">The standard<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> antimalarial drug susceptibility assay determines the <emphasis>ex vivo</emphasis> growth of intraerythrocytic parasites from the ring stage (the only asexual stage generally found in patient peripheral blood) to the schizont stage in 24 to 72 h in the presence of serial drug concentrations under conditions close to <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> conditions. With regard to the standard assay, a well-suited 96-well microtiter plate format was designed using the Trager and Jensen cultivation parameters (hypoxia and buffered RPMI medium with human serum), which is the basis of the most-used tests (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0014">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0015">15</link>). The simplest test format has been adapted to field work and uses 100 μl of fingerstick capillary blood mixed with medium, a 24- to 30-h candle jar incubation, a microscopic count of multinucleated schizonts, and calculation of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<subscript>50</subscript>) and IC<subscript>90</subscript> or IC<subscript>99</subscript> of the drug from a dose-response curve (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0016">16</link>). Beyond this simplest format, for which standard reagents were prepared and commercialized through the WHO from 1980 to 1990, other <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> tests that offer valuable advantages have been developed (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0017">17</link>). All tests are applicable both to field-collected parasites and to the parasites growing asynchronously in long-term laboratory culture and can also be used for screening potential new antimalarials and for investigations on a drug’s modes of action or resistance.</para>
        <para id="ch0179s0001s0001p0004">The activities of and resistance to some antimalarials address only a part of the asexual erythrocytic cycle (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0019">19</link>). This implies that when long-term laboratory culture of patient isolates or reference clones is used, tight synchronization at the ring stage improves the reproducibility of susceptibility results. Parasite growth and inhibition can be assessed using different methods. A parasite count by microscopic examination of culture smears is cumbersome and often poorly reproducible. Measurement of uptake of [<superscript>3</superscript>H]hypoxanthine offers a semiautomated, quantitative, high-output approach but necessitates the use of radioactive material and specialized equipment in authorized laboratories, leading to high costs because of the handling of nuclear waste (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0020">20</link>). Measurement of highly produced <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> proteins, such as parasite lactate dehydrogenase (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0021">21</link>) or histidine-rich protein 2 (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0022">22</link>), by double-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrates a higher sensitivity than the use of radioisotopes, although these tests are time-consuming and commercial kits are costly (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0023">23</link>). Other tests measure the production of DNA during the maturation of parasites using SYBR green I fluorescent dye (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0024">24</link>, <link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0025">25</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0179s0001s0001p0005">The successful completion and interpretation of all<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> tests depend on several factors that in turn depend on the characteristics of the samples, materials, conditions of culture, and statistical methods to generate inhibitory constants. Sample-related factors to be considered include recent intake of antimalarial drugs by the patient, which may decrease the test success rate; high parasite inocula, which can lead to an overestimation of resistance to some drugs (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0018">18</link>); and the presence of folate and <emphasis>para</emphasis>-aminobenzoic acid in the culture medium, which antagonize the <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> effect of antifolate drugs (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0026">26</link>). Another sample factor is the short life of erythrocyte <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> parasites outside the host; each day that passes at 4°C diminishes their capacity to survive and grow <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0027">27</link>).</para>
        <para id="ch0179s0001s0001p0006">Critical aspects of the laboratory methods include the necessity of preparing and distributing dilutions of drugs in wells of plates, which results in particular difficulties for some drugs other than chloroquine, as most are poorly soluble or have limited shelf lives. Culture necessitates supplementation of RPMI medium with human serum or Albumax, although this can affect IC<subscript>50</subscript>s, as they interact with drugs differently (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0028">28</link>). All these methodological issues undermine accurate comparisons of <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> susceptibilities either between laboratories or within a single laboratory over time. Consensus exists on parameters of culture, and suggested improvements include measures of quality control of key parameters, such as predosed plates (titrated drug solutions) and reference of endpoints of isolate susceptibilities to those of reference clones with known susceptibilities (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0029">29</link>). Finally, standardized mathematical analysis of concentration inhibition assays is possible through free web-based tools (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0030">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0031">31</link>). Drug concentrations associated with the IC<subscript>50</subscript> are determined by a modified sigmoid maximum-effect (<emphasis>E</emphasis><subscript>max</subscript>) model-fitting algorithm and display the precision of IC<subscript>50</subscript> estimation. The standard <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> antimalarial drug susceptibility assays described above, however, do not permit discrimination of parasites that are susceptible and resistant to the fast-acting artemisinin derivatives for which specific protocols have recently been developed (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0018">18</link>, <link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0032">32</link>, <link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0033">33</link>). These new assays test the capacity of early-ring-stage parasites to survive a brief pulse exposure to high artemisinin concentrations (the so-called ring-stage survival assay), better mimicking the situation faced by parasites <emphasis>in vivo.</emphasis> In a study with Cambodian parasite isolates, the survival rate estimated with the ring-stage survival assay correlates with <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> parasite clearance half-lives (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0018">18</link>). Decreased susceptibility to piperaquine is also better explored using IC<subscript>90</subscript> rather than IC<subscript>50</subscript> estimation or a piperaquine survival assay (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0034">34</link>, <link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0035">35</link>).</para>

Differentiation of these possible causes for treatment failure is important for both individual patient care and general public health (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0090">90</link>).

Promastigote cultures are easier to perform, are more readily adapted from clinical isolates, and have higher throughput.

The protocol used for the tests on <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> facilitated its development. The SYBR green incubation times vary according to protocols from 1 to 12 h, and incubation is carried out at 4°C or room temperature with protection from light. The use of qPCR devices has simplified this experiment. One qPCR cycle is sufficient, heating to 95°C eliminates small fragments generated by apoptosis (our unpublished data), and slow cooling of the sample to 4 to 10°C facilitates the incorporation of SYBR green (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0102">102</link>). Each of these methods of detection has unique advantages and limitations. Acid phosphatase and conversion of tetrazolium salts are colorimetric assays that can be read with standard microplate readers, while resazurin assays require readers that can detect fluorescence.

Investigation of drug resistance has typically been performed by obtaining eggs from an unsuccessfully treated mammalian host, infecting the appropriate snail intermediate host, isolating cercariae from the infected snail, and infecting and treating experimental animals. A protocol to determine the 50% effective dose of antimicrobial compounds in mice has been developed and demonstrates good reproducibility among different laboratories (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0123">123</link>). This approach has the drawbacks of being very time-consuming and technically challenging, especially in areas of endemicity that may not have well-developed experimental snail and rodent colonies.</para>
        <para id="ch0179s0001s0005p0002">Fifty-percent effective doses can also be estimated in an<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> assay by assessing contraction or metabolism of worms following perfusion and incubation with praziquantel, and these values correspond well with <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis> results (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0124">124</link>–<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0126">126</link>). Although this approach is less complicated than infecting, treating, and perfusing additional mice, it still requires the availability of naive snails and mice to obtain the adult worms, along with the time and expertise needed to perpetuate the life cycle. In addition, the parasites that successfully infect mice may not accurately represent the diversity of the field isolates. An <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> method that circumvents these problems has been adapted to field use (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0127">127</link>, <link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0128">128</link>). Eggs from stools of infected individuals are isolated and hatched to release miracidia, which are then exposed to praziquantel, and effects on morphology are monitored. When this technique was used, the miracidia from persons who cleared their infection following treatment were more affected by drug than miracidia from stools whose donors did not clear their infections. Evaluating changes in the parasite’s population structure using miracidia obtained from eggs in patients’ stools is another approach to monitor development of potential drug resistance. Whole-genome sequencing of 198 <emphasis>Schistosoma mansoni</emphasis> larvae from 34 Ugandan children from regions with contrasting praziquantel exposure revealed extensive diversity with limited selection despite mass drug administration (<link linkend="ch0179s0001s0007li0129">129</link>). Ongoing surveillance for development of drug resistance will be an important component of schistosomiasis control programs that are dependent on mass drug administration.</para>

        <para id="ch0179s0001s0006p0001">Most susceptibility tests for antiparasitic drugs are not routinely available in clinical diagnostic laboratories, because these procedures are not in frequent demand and they present special technical requirements and because the delay in obtaining the results does not allow the treatment of patients to be adapted according to the result. Such tests are performed mainly in reference or research laboratories or during epidemiologic investigations in areas of endemicity. Thanks to recent advances in laboratory technology and genetic analysis of parasites, available tests are increasingly sophisticated and informative. The development of tests that are robust and simple to use will facilitate field studies that aim at optimizing the deployment of currently available drugs. These field tests usefully complement the more sophisticated procedures used in research laboratories whose main orientation is toward the development of novel antiparasitic compounds and deciphering drug resistance mechanisms.</para>
