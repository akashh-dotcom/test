The sound level that is measured depends not only on the source, but also the environ-
ment (e.g., the proximity of surfaces that may reflect sound). Thus, sound levels are usually

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>During the operation of the magnetic resonance (MR) system, various types of acoustic  noises are produced. The problems associated with acoustic noise for patients and healthcare  workers are wide ranging, from simple annoyance and difficulties in verbal communication  between staff and patients, to heightened anxiety or discomfort, and even potentially per- manent hearing impairment (1-9). Acoustic noise may pose a particular problem for specific  patient groups that may be at increased risk. For example, patients with head injuries or  psychiatric disorders, the elderly, young children, and infants may be confused or suffer  from heightened anxiety during MRI procedures (2). Patients taking medications may ex- perience increased hearing sensitivity (3). Additionally, neonates with immature anatomical  development may be at increased risk for adverse effects associated with acoustic noise.  For example, significant fluctuations in vital signs of newborns have been reported during  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, which may partly be attributable to  acoustic noise (4). High levels of acoustic noise may also impact the quality of the MRI  procedure by causing distress in the patient.</para>

</table><para>Due to several of the issues listed above and the more specific issues discussed below,  acoustic noise levels also pose a significant problem for one particular area of MRI: the in- creasing amount of research in functional MRI (fMRI) studies of brain activation. Typically,  patients and volunteer subjects will be provided earplugs to wear during fMRI. However,  these may impair vocal communication with staff members and also the perception of study  stimuli. The acoustic noise associated with fMRI procedures can often be comparatively  loud, as the use of fast acquisition sequences (e.g., echo planar imaging, EPI) are normally  used. Acoustic noise can often lead to motion-related artifacts and degraded image quality.  Furthermore, acoustic noise has been reported to interfere with auditory functional studies,</para>

      <para>and more broadly, with cross modal neural activity (10-14). A summary of the potential is- sues related to the acoustic noise that is associated with fMRI is shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>MR system-related acoustic noise will interfere with the communication of activation  task instructions that often must be provided during scanning. One area of particular interest  is the study of auditory and language function (13). In this work, the response to pure tone  stimuli is analyzed. Therefore, any background levels of unwanted or uncontrolled acoustic  noise can interfere with the delivery of these sound stimuli and affect experimental integrity.  Solutions specific to controlling acoustic noise exposure during fMRI are generally se- quence-related and a full discussion of this topic is presented later in this chapter.</para>
      <para>Acoustic noise levels during echo planar imaging have been reported to significantly  increase pure tone hearing thresholds in the optimal frequency hearing range (0- to 8-kHz)  (15). These effects vary across the frequency range and the threshold changes depend on  the characteristics of the sequence-generated acoustic noise. It may be possible to take into  account, or adjust for, the MR system-induced auditory activation by using a control series</para>

      <para>The problem of acoustic noise may also have implications for the operational costs of  an MRI facility. Notably, there can be a potential decrease in image quality due to patient  movement resulting from the patient being startled or uncomfortable in association with  acoustic noise. This may add to the need to repeat scans or to interrupt studies that can ad- versely impact the efficiency of an MRI facility. For all the above reasons, it is important  that the MRI-related acoustic noise is quantified and characterized as part of a safety and  quality assurance program. Furthermore, any exposure to acoustic noise that is excessive  must be controlled or alleviated.</para>
      <para>Acoustic noise experienced during routine clinical MRI examinations can generally be  confined to levels within permissible limits with relatively little effort by using passive  hearing protection (e.g., disposable earplugs). Several more sophisticated methods are also  under investigation by researchers, offering more comprehensive and elegant solutions with- out the disadvantages of passive methods. This chapter will discuss acoustic noise and hear- ing, describe the common characteristics of MRI-related acoustic noise, explain the current  permissible levels for acoustic noise, and present the main methods used for measurement  and control of this potential hazard.</para>

      <title>ACOUSTIC NOISE AND HEARING</title>
      <para>The ear is a highly sensitive wide-band receiver, with the typical frequency range of 2- Hz to 20-kHz for normal hearing (17). The arrival of sound waves at the ear sets up a fluc- tuating pressure just outside the entrance to the external auditory canal. These fluctuations  are then transmitted as pressure waves along the auditory canal. Normally under slight ten- sion, the eardrum, or tympanic membrane, is physically moved by these pressure waves.</para>
      <para>On the other side of the membrane, three tiny bones known as the ossicles, transmit  this movement across the middle ear cavity to another membrane, the oval window, which  forms the end of the spiral-shaped, fluid-filled cochlea. The vibration of the membrane and  hair cells in the cochlea is transformed, via the auditory nerve, to give a sense of hearing.  <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> shows the main components of the hearing mechanism.</para>
      <para>At high sound intensities, the muscles that control the motion of the ossicles alter their  tension creating the acoustic reflex to protect the ear from damage. However, this reflex  occurs approximately 0.5-milliseconds after the insult, such that the ear is particularly vul- nerable to impact noise of high intensity. The human ear does not tend to discern sound  powers in absolute terms, but assesses how much greater one power is than another. Re- flecting the very wide range of powers that exist, the logarithmic decibel scale, dB, is used  when referring to sound power.</para>
      <para>The sound level that is measured depends not only on the source, but also the environ- ment (e.g., the proximity of surfaces that may reflect sound). Thus, sound levels are usually  quoted in terms of sound pressure level (SPL), which accounts for the environment of the  measurement. <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> displays a range of sound pressure levels for some typical sources  of acoustic noise.</para>

      <para>The sensitivity of the ear is also frequency dependent, as shown is <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> (18). Peak  hearing sensitivity occurs in the region of 4-kHz. This is also the region where potential  maximum hearing loss will occur, with damage spreading into neighboring frequencies.  Since the ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies, measured data may be weighted  using the dBA measurement or “A-weighted” scale, which biases the meter to respond sim- ilarly to the human ear. The quality, or efficiency of hearing, is defined by the audible thresh- old, which is the SPL at which one can just begin to detect a sound. This is normally defined  as 0 (zero)-dB.</para>
      <para>Acoustic noise is defined in terms of frequency spectrum (measured and indicated in  Hz), intensity (indicated in decibels or dB), and duration (or time). Additionally, noise may  be steady state, intermittent, impulsive, or explosive. Time-varying noise is reported in  terms of Leq, which is defined as the continuous SPL that contains the same sound energy  as the time-varying sound over the measurement period. This can be considered as the av- erage noise level. Stimulation of the ear by acoustic noise has three potential effects: 1)  Adaptation, 2) Temporary threshold shift (TTS) (post-stimulation fatigue), and 3) Permanent  threshold shift (PTS) (permanent impairment).</para>
      <para>In hearing adaption, loud sounds cause a small muscle attached to one of the bones of  the inner ear to contract. This attenuates the transmission of sound vibration to the inner  ear, which is a protective mechanism that does not work well for short duration, very intense  sounds. Transient hearing loss may occur following loud noise (&gt;100-dBA), resulting in a  temporary threshold shift (i.e., a shift in audible threshold). With a TTS, subjects may ex- perience a dulling in hearing at the end of the noise and tinnitus in some cases. Recovery  typically occurs quickly (1). However, full recovery can take up to several weeks if the  noise insult is particularly severe. Intense impulsive noises at 650-Hz with cut-offs at 300-  and 1-kHz have also been shown to generate substantial TTS (19). Noise above 100-dBA  can cause disturbances of the microcirculation in the cortical organ and short impulsive  noise at levels of 120- to 130-dBA can lead to mechanical damage in this organ.</para>
      <para>If the noise is sufficiently severe, this may result in a permanent threshold shift at spe- cific frequencies (20, 21). Hearing damage from steady-state noise usually takes the form</para>

      <para>of inner ear damage. That is, destruction of the hair cells that convert acoustic energy to  electrical impulses transmitted via the nervous system to the brain. These cells cannot re- generate and, therefore, the damage is irreversible. This damage is similar to age-related  hearing loss (presbycusis) in that it progresses slowly, with the affected hearing threshold  rising. Mean hearing loss is a function of noise frequency and duration (20). Permanent  damage is primarily a risk for prolonged daily exposure to loud (&gt;85-dB) occupational noise  or short impulsive noise around 140-dB. Excessive noise is known to be one of the most  common causes of hearing loss (20). The risk of hearing damage increases with the noise  level, duration of the noise, the number of exposures to the noise, and the susceptibility of  the individual (20, 21). Along with sensitive groups, children have a lower threshold for  hearing damage and, therefore, restricting exposure levels to around 120-dB or lower is  recommended (22). It is generally accepted that exposure to noise levels up to a maximum  of 75-dBA will not result in PTS irrespective of the duration of exposure (22). Over the  years, several instances of noise-related incidents have been reported in the literature (see  below).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Noise That Is Not Perceived By the Ear Canal </emphasis></para>
      <para>The ear canal is not the only path for transmission of sound to the cochlea. Sound may  be conducted via air and bone conduction, through the ear canal, head, and body. Protection  of the ear canal via earplugs will, thus, never lead to silence, due to the remaining sound  conduction via the other paths. Sound can be conducted directly to the cochlea, to the middle  ear and then to the cochlea, or through the walls of the middle ear, along the ear canal to  the middle ear, and then to the cochlea (23). When the ear canal is relatively unprotected,  this path will be the dominant one for perception of sound. However, as noise is attenuated  along the ear canal, the other paths become increasingly dominant and further hearing pro- tection measures will have little effect on the residual noise. Using a helmet in addition to  conventional earplugs and “defenders”, Ravicz and Melcher, (24) studied the impact of iso- lating the head and ear canal from sound. Isolating the head enabled the original noise at- tenuation of 39- to 41-dB to increase to 55- to 63-dB.</para>

Indeed, Hepper  and Shahidullah, (26) reported that the responsiveness of the fetus to audio stimuli occurs  between 19 to 35 weeks, with initial responses being to sounds at low frequencies. They  measured an initial response at 20 weeks to a 500-Hz pure tone. As the pregnancy pro- gressed, there was a significant reduction (20- to 30-dB) in the intensity of sound required  to elicit a response. Studies report that maternal tissues and fluid surrounding the fetal head  act as efficient low-pass filters for sound (27-31).</para>
      <para>Acoustic noise is known to be a concern for neonates who generally have sensitive  hearing. Aside from artifacts introduced from involuntary motion related to startle reflexes,  the noise can provoke adverse responses such as autonomic instability (32-36). Neonatal  intensive care unit guidelines often suggest minimizing the risk of physiological stress by  adhering to a limit for exposure to acoustic noise (see below ).</para>

      <title>CHARACTERISTICS OF MRI-RELATED ACOUSTIC NOISE</title>
      <para>Early measurements of MRI-related acoustic noise offered little more than an assess- ment of intensity levels. Over time, researchers began to investigate the noise in more detail  and to characterize it in terms of frequency components, variability with pulse sequences,  and the contribution of individual gradients.</para>
      <para>The gradient magnetic field of the MR system is the primary source of acoustic noise  associated with MRI. This noise occurs during the rapid alterations of currents within the  gradient coils. These currents, in the presence of the strong static magnetic field of the MR  system, produce significant (Lorentz) forces that act upon the gradient coils. From basic  physics, a conductor element dl carrying a current <emphasis role="bold">I</emphasis> = I i placed into a magnetic uniform  field <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> = B k, will experience a Lorentz force <emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis> per unit length given by,</para>
      <para>where θ is the angle between the conductor and the field direction and <emphasis role="italics">i</emphasis>  <emphasis role="italics">j</emphasis>  <emphasis role="italics">k</emphasis> are unit  vectors along the conductor, force, and magnetic field direction, respectively. Therefore,  simplistically we would expect acoustic noise to be theoretically linear with the static mag- netic field of the MR system (37). In fact, Moelker, et al. (38) reported on a measured non- linearity, with noise levels measured at high field being lower than that expected with a  linear dependence The noise from these mechanical forces is then transferred into airborne  acoustic noise or sound pressure, due to an acoustic noise transfer function (38).</para>
      <para>Acoustic noise, manifested as loud tapping, knocking, and other sounds is produced  when the forces cause motion or vibration of the gradient coils as they impact against their  mountings, which then also flex and vibrate. All structures have intrinsic resonance fre- quencies and these frequencies have their own modal shapes. In fact, there are several path- ways of noise generation associated with MRI (40).</para>
      <para>If the gradient coil modal shape due to deformation corresponds to the shape of the ex- citing Lorentz force distribution, then large gradient coil displacements occur and result in  the generation of significant acoustic noise. Current designs of gradient coils are often man- ufactured to have a high stiffness, which minimizes coil motion and, thus, the structural  resonances of the coils.</para>
      <para>Various factors have been shown to affect the acoustic noise generated during MRI, in- cluding the strength of the static magnetic field (mentioned above) and alteration of the gra- dient output (i.e., rise time and amplitude). Interestingly, Price, et al. (39) reported that there  is greater impact on acoustic noise levels generated from imaging parameters than the field  strength. Acoustic noise is enhanced by decreases in section thickness, field of view, repe- tition time, and echo time. The physical features of the MR system and its environment as  well as the material and construction of the gradient coils and support structures also affect  the transmission of the acoustic noise and its perception by the patient and MR system op- erators.</para>

      <para>Gradient magnetic field-induced noise levels have been measured during a variety of  pulse sequences for clinical and research MR systems with static magnetic field strengths  ranging from 0.35- to 4-T, with acoustic noise levels of over 130-dB reported (39-54). Ob- viously, since the gradient magnetic field is primarily responsible for acoustic noise, the  ability of the MR system to produce noise is dependent upon the specifications for the gra- dients (amplitudes and slew rates) as well as the types of imaging parameters that are avail- able on the scanner.</para>
      <para>Not surprisingly, fast gradient echo pulse sequences produce, comparatively, louder  noise during MRI than spin echo sequences. Three-dimensional and diffusion MR pulse se- quences, where multiple gradients are applied simultaneously, are among the loudest. Many  studies have focused on assessing the maximum MR system acoustic noise, which is usually  related to using EPI methods, due to the associated high gradient performance inherent in  these ultrafast sequences. Echo planar sequences, in collecting a complete image in one ra- diofrequency (RF) excitation of the spin system, require extremely fast gradient switching  times and high gradient amplitudes. The increased interest in diffusion imaging and fMRI  has meant a heightened interest in using high field strength MR systems (i.e., mostly 3-, 4- , and 7-T) with fast gradient capability (switching rates and high amplitudes) to acquire  multi-slice, EPI images of high quality (see below for more on high field issues).</para>
      <para>Shellock, et al. (43) reported relatively high levels of acoustic noise, up to 102- to 103- dBA on the two 1.5-T MR systems tested when running EPI sequences with parameters se- lected to represent a “worst-case” protocol. Nevertheless, these acoustic noise levels were  within current permissible limits for MR systems. Miyati, et al. (50) conducted an extensive  survey of EPI sequences performed on eleven MR systems. The results of the sound level  measurements reported to be at levels within permissible limits.</para>
      <para>Price, et al. (39) surveyed fifteen MR scanners, with static magnetic field strengths from  0.2-T to 3-T, reporting worst case noise levels in the range 82.5- to 118.3-dBA, but for two- dimensional MRI techniques, only. They reported the lowest noise levels for the lowest  static field strength scanner and the highest noise recorded for the highest field strength  scanner, but noted low levels of acoustic noise recorded for a 1.5-T scanner fitted with vac- uum-encased gradient coils. Higher acoustic noise levels have been reported by Ravicz, et  al. (52) (up to 138-dB for 3-T) and More, et al. (53) (130-dB for 4-T).</para>
      <para>Foster, et al. (54) reported EPI-related acoustic noise levels of 123- to 132-dBA for a  3-T research scanner. Since EPI sequences are significantly shorter in duration than con- ventional sequences, in terms of acoustic noise exposure, higher sound exposure levels are  possible for the shorter times involved. However, these levels, when converted to eight hour  equivalent values (Leq = 108-dBA), are higher than the limits for occupational acoustic  noise exposure used in the United Kingdom (UK) and in the United States (U.S.). Therefore,  hearing protection must be used for patients undergoing MRI procedures under these cir- cumstances. Conventional EPI sequences generally comprise constant readout gradients  and a train of very short high level trapisoidal phase encode gradient ‘blips’. It is not sur- prising that the blipped gradient contributes the larger proportion of the sequence-related  acoustic noise (55). As the gradient blips are at higher frequency than the readout gradient,  the resultant acoustic noise will have a larger proportion of high frequencies.</para>

      <para>Measurements of sound pressure levels offer a limited amount of information with re- gard to the quality of the noise and its impact on hearing. In addition to measurements of  noise level, several groups have recorded and analyzed the acoustic noise. Similar noise  levels and characteristics are found when comparing different clinical MR systems. Fre- quency analysis of the noise shows that noise is pseudo-periodic, with variations in the de- gree of periodicity depending on the pulse sequence used and the vibrational characteristics  of the gradient coils (46).</para>
      <para>For conventional pulse sequences used for MRI, peak noise levels are found at the low  frequency region of the spectra. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis> shows an example of the octave band spectra for  a 1.0-T and 1.5-T MR systems (44, 45). Spectral peaks in the sound levels were found in  the range of 0.2- to 1.5-kHz (22). Cho, et al. (48) have also reported that pre-scan noise  generated high levels (100-dB, C-weighted scale) across a wide spectral range up to 4-kHz  with peaks around 2.4-kHz.</para>
      <para>More, et al. (53) noted that repetition time (TR) had a minimal impact on overall SPL,  while increasing the echo time (TE) increased attenuation, in agreement with Price, et al.  (39). Unlike the use of conventional sequences, EPI-related sound levels have been reported  to contain a larger fraction of high frequency noise (around 4-kHz) with most noise com- prising the fundamental frequency and harmonics in the frequency range of 0.5- to 4-kHz  (52). For EPI sequences, More, et al. (53) also noted considerable non-harmonic noise flank- ing the harmonics. The acoustic noise was also noted to contain a higher proportion of broad  frequency spectrum noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). For their pulse sequence, More, et al. (53) found the  even harmonics to be associated with the phase-encoding gradient, the frequency encoding  gradient generated the odd harmonics and non-harmonic acoustic noise, while the slice-se- lective gradients generated the broad spectrum noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>).</para>

      <para>In addition to the dependence on pulse sequence parameters, MR system hardware and  construction, acoustic noise is dependent on the immediate environment. Spatially, the  acoustic noise will vary along the bore of the scanner. However, how it varies will depend  on the MR system’s structure and design. Price, et al. (39) presents acoustic noise measure- ments across a range of scanner geometries and designs, systems ranging from static mag- netic field strengths of 0.2 to 3-T. Reports providing values of acoustic noise tend to disagree  because of differences related to whether the maximum acoustic noise levels were measured  at the isocenter of the bore or not (39, 47, 49). The noise distributions along radial and axial  directions are also likely to be asymmetric, due to standing wave effects in the scanner’s  bore (53).</para>
      <para>Furthermore, noise levels have been found to vary by as much as 10-dB as a function  of the patient’s position inside the MR system (47) such that the presence and size of the  patient affects the level of acoustic noise. For example, an increase of 1- to 3-dB has been  measured with a patient present inside of the MR system (47), which may be due to pressure  doubling (i.e., the increase in sound pressure close to a solid object, caused when sound  waves reflect and undergo in-phase enhancement).</para>

Interestingly, research is on-going for possible human  scanning using MR systems operating up to 20-T (56).

      <para>increase significantly for UHF scanners. When increasing the static magnetic field strength  from 1.5-T to 11.7-T, a simple linear model predicts an increase in the acoustic noise level  by approximately 22-dB. But, in fact, in line with earlier results (38), this has not been ob- served in practice (57). Applying a logarithmic scale, changing from 7-T to 20-T, a 9-dB  increase in acoustic noise level would be predicted. However, building in additional effects  such as Lorentz damping (58), results in increases in acoustic noise levels that are actually  lower than expected, and in some cases very similar to reported noise levels at 3-T (59-60).</para>
      <para>Notably, one practical difference (61) is that head coils at 7-T are generally more tightly  fitting that those used at 3-T because they are comprise of a multi-channel insert. This makes  using double passive hearing protection (earplugs and earmuffs) impractical and, thus, the  acoustic noise is only attenuated by earplugs alone.</para>
      <para>Presently, findings obtained at 7-T remain sparse (61-64). Costagli, et al. (62) reported  acoustic noise levels of 89.9 -/+ 0.7-dBA for conventional T1-weighted, fast spoiled gradient  recalled (FSPGR) pulse sequences at 7-T. Speck, et al. (64) reported acoustic noise levels  of 101-dBA for a standard EPI sequence, also at 7-T. Importantly, these levels are consid- erably lower than early measurements recorded on 3- and 4-T scanners. Therefore, there</para>

(67) developed the simulation of a cylindrical whole-body  gradient coil housed in a 4-T MR scanner and driven by triangular and trapezoidal gradient  pulses. The simulation was based on finite element (FE) analysis. Acoustic frequency re- sponses predicted by the simulation were compared to experimental measures, showing  broad agreement. Further reports investigated experiments and simulation of purpose-built  gradient coils, including vibration and acoustic noise measurements (68, 69). In their finite  element model, Lorentz forces were used as the system load, with acoustic radiation mod- eled using the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz equation. These researchers performed the analysis for  a small head geometry gradient coil and achieved reasonable agreement of theory and ex- periment (68, 69).</para>
      <para>Further work in this field has been conducted by Kuijpers, et al. (75), who created a  mathematical model of acoustic noise radiation in finite ducts. Shao and Mechefske (70)  reported on the development of a predictive analytical model, allowing for inclusion of  acoustic liners inside the gradient coil inner wall. They also compared analytic and boundary  element models. The analytical model was comparative in terms of results, but computa- tionally more efficient. Additional papers investigated the dynamic behavior of gradient  coils of varying wall thickness (71-74) and by applying shell theory (76). Investigators have  also investigated the coupling of gradient coils to other associated structures, reporting on  structural analyses (77). Recently (and mentioned above), Winkler, et al. (57, 58) utilized a  vibroacoustic FE approach to predict acoustic noise levels for UHF scanning that included  the effects of Lorentz damping.</para>

      <title>ACOUSTIC NOISE LEVELS AND PERMISSIBLE LIMITS</title>
      <para>Several of the available guidance documents discussed below adopt a similar frame- work, referring back to the same source for action levels and permissible limits. Much of  the international guidance is based on occupational exposure limits that assume chronic ex- posures. These are not entirely satisfactory for application to patient exposures associated  with MRI, which can be short but with potentially intense noise, causing discomfort. When  time-averaged, these types of exposures can fall below action levels but still present a haz- ard. For normal individuals, the typical threshold for discomfort related to acoustic noise is  approximately 120-dB in the 1- to 5-kHz range (78), however, those with particular sensi- tivity can experience discomfort at much lower acoustic noise levels (79).</para>
      <para>For acoustic noise exposure involving <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">staff members</emphasis></emphasis>, the current UK occupational  guidelines are based on the Control of Noise at Work legislation, published in 2005 (80).  This document sets out the responsibilities of the employer and makes a number of recom- mendations based on a small set of action levels. Acoustic noise is graded to that which is  below 80-dBA, a lower action level at 80-dBA daily or weekly exposure (peak 135-dBC),  and upper action level at 85-dBA daily or weekly exposure (peak 135-dBC). It should be  noted that values for lower and upper action levels have been reduced by 5-dBA, compared  to previous Noise at Work action levels published in 1989. This document also recommends  that hearing protection should be available for all staff members, and that its use be manda- tory for noise above the upper action level. For MRI healthcare workers, there is generally  little need to be in the MR system room during scanning. Because the acoustic noise levels  that exist outside the scanner’s bore are relatively low, the risks are similarly low.</para>

European  guidance is published as directive 2013/35/EU (82) and has similar limits and action levels  to those in the UK.</para>
      <para>In the United States (U.S.), occupational limits are mandated by the Occupational Safety  and Health Authority (OSHA) (83) and have also been adopted by the Food and Drug Ad- ministration (FDA) (84). OSHA guidance is geared towards traditional ‘heavy’ industries  where there are very noisy environments and medium-to-high risk to hearing. Their list of  affected industries does not include MRI/Healthcare. Now somewhat outdated, the OSHA  guidelines apply to a slightly raised action level of 90-dBA (daily or eight-hour average) in  line with the older UK guidance (85).</para>
      <para>Current UK guidance on noise exposure limits for MRI <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">patients and volunteer subjects</emphasis></emphasis>  (including staff members) is presented in the MHRA guidelines (86). For patients and vol- unteer subjects, it suggests hearing protection should always be offered unless noise levels  are proven to be below 80-dBA. Hearing protection should reduce levels at the ear to below  85-dBA. The recommended action levels are based on the noise at work regulations (72)  and are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis>. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Pro- tection (ICNIRP) (87, 88) notes the range of guidance from the International Electrotech- nical Commission (IEC) (89), but accepts the need for a conservative approach to protect  vulnerable patient groups, also recommending the MHRA action levels. The MHRA docu- ment shows the relationship between the acoustic noise level and time necessary to reach  the daily action level (86) (<emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis>). Recommendations for acoustic noise and hearing pro- tection are, as follows (86):</para>
      <para>The use of hearing protection is highly recommended. Protection should be avail- • able and all patients and volunteers should be encouraged to use it. Protection  should always be worn by vulnerable patients.</para>

      <para>In the U.S., various patient exposure guidelines related to the MRI environment were  initially recommended in a document issued by the American College of Radiology in 2002  (90) and this was updated in 2013 (91). The ACR document makes little mention of the  risks associated with acoustic noise, however, it does recommend that all patients should  be offered hearing protection and that this is mandatory for those undergoing MRI proce- dures using research pulse sequences.</para>
      <para>While the acoustic noise levels suggested for patients exposed during MRI examinations  on an infrequent and short-term temporal basis are considered to be highly conservative,  they may not be appropriate for individuals with underlying health problems who may be  sensitive to noise at certain levels or at particular frequencies.</para>
      <para>Overall, the acoustic noise produced during MRI on a modern-day scanner should rep- resent a minimal risk to patients if good quality hearing protection is used. However, the  possibility exists that substantial gradient magnetic field-induced noise may represent a  heightened risk in certain patients who are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects  of loud noises or for those with poorly fitting hearing protection. In fact, there have been  unconfirmed claims of permanent hearing loss associated with MRI examinations (9).  Therefore, vigilance and care is essential when controlling noise levels associated with MR  procedures.</para>

      <para>Due to lack of data and a full understanding of response, UK guidance (86) suggests a  cautious approach to scanning the fetus and pregnant patients. Scanning during the first  trimester is discouraged unless justified by a critical risk assessment. Because acoustic noise  is known to be a concern for neonates who have sensitive hearing, neonatal intensive care  unit (NICU) guidelines suggest minimizing the risk of physiological stress by adhering to  a limit for noise exposure to 65-dBA (92).</para>
      <para>Fetal MRI has become increasingly important, particularly in diagnosis of fetal abnor- malities and for the management of the mother. Although discouraged, if necessary MRI  procedures may be performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. In a survey conducted  by De Wilde, et al. (93), 83% of the clinics that responded suggested that they would scan  patients during the first trimester in cases of clinical need. While the mother may wear hear- ing protection, the fetus is protected only by the attenuation provided by the intra-uterine  fluid and the maternal abdomen. Thus acoustic noise has the ability to impact the fetus (94).  To minimize motion-related artifacts, fast imaging techniques are required for fetal MRI  examinations, which results in the potential for exposures to comparatively high levels of  acoustic noise.

However, this study was a very limited approximation to scanning a pregnant patient  and the associated sound absorption. The strength of the static magnetic field of the MR  system, which directly affects acoustic noise levels generated, was also low (0.5-T) com- pared to the majority of clinical scanners in current use. Certain research has reported high  frequency hearing loss, shortened gestation, and decreased birth weight following exposure  to high levels of acoustic noise (&gt;99-dBA) (96).</para>
      <para>To investigate this particular safety issue, there have been a number of follow-up studies  (97-106). For example, Reeves, et al. (97) investigated the rates of cochlear impairment for  a cohort of second and third trimester neonates who had been exposed to acoustic noise  during 1.5-T MRI examinations. Their data showed no association between exposure to  noise and an increased risk of hearing impairment. General guidelines for managing expo- sure to acoustic noise produced by the United Kingdom (UK), Medicines and Healthcare  products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (86) and based on evidence in several reports (98- 100) suggest that the data on the effects of noise on the health of the fetus is inconclusive.</para>
      <para>Bouissant-Kobar, et al. (101) followed-up (i.e., at approximately 24 months) on a cohort  of 72 pre-school children scanned at 1.5-T during their mothers’ pregnancies (mean gesta- tional age at scanning, 30 weeks). All children were born at term and achieved age-appro- priate scores in the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS) tests. In addition, all study  subjects passed their new-born otoacoustic tests and demonstrated normal hearing at pre- school age. These findings confirmed a lack of MRI-related impact on functional outcomes  or hearing impairment at pre-school age. De vita, et al. (102) and Jaimes, et al. (103) inves- tigated the effects of higher field strength scanning on pre-terms (4.7-T and 3-T, respectiv).  Both groups noted no increase in risks in moving to a higher field strength MR system.  Clements, et al. (104) report similar normal findings, in this case for a smaller cohort (20  cases) whose mothers had been exposed to echo planar imaging (EPI) at 0.5-T four times  between 20 weeks and term. Thus, the current data appears to provide general reassurance  in that there is low risk present when applying MRI in prenatal and neonatal patients (101- 106). An optimized solution for neonatal imaging with clear benefits was reported by Tkach,  et al. (107, 108). This group scanned 15 non-sedated neonates in an adapted small-bore (di- ameter 22- cm) 1.5 -T orthopedic MR system. Although the scanner has approximately  twice the gradient strength (70-mT/m) and slew rate (300-mT/m/s) of conventional full- size MR systems, the gradient coil was smaller and shorter, leading to lower levels of  acoustic noise or equivalent pulse sequences (107). Using specifically designed hearing  protection,, high quality images were obtained for and all MRI examinations that were com- pleted successfully, suggesting minimal impact of the acoustic noise. Of further note is that  De Vita, et al. (102) reported successful imaging of nine ventilated neonates at 4.7-T without  any acute adverse effects.</para>
      <para>Overall, the use of a combination of hearing protection (e.g., earplugs and earmuffs or  headphones) and the additional attenuation of having the neonate placed inside the transmit  RF coil, mean that the acoustic noise at the ear is likely to be lower for neonates than for  adults, which may explain why no adverse effects have been reported, to date.

      <para>As mentioned above, short-term exposure to intense noise (&gt;100-dBA) can induce a  temporary shift in the hearing threshold. Brummett, et al. (1) reported temporary shifts in  hearing thresholds in 43% of the patients scanned without hearing protection or with im- properly fitted earplugs. Normal hearing returned after 15-minutes. Notably, noise levels  during scanning were not measured as part of their study. However, Hurwitz, et al. (42)  made measurements using the same scanner, reporting values for gradient echo sequences  (likely to be some of the loudest sequences on this system) of around 93-dBA. Of the 14  patients scanned without hearing protection in their study, six suffered TTS with threshold  loss greater than 15-dB. For those using hearing protection, only one experienced a TTS. It  should be noted that these data were associated with scans performed on a comparatively  low field strength MR system (0.35-T). A study by Wagner, et al. (109), found conflicting  results.</para>
      <para>Ulmer, et al. (16) measured changes in pure tone thresholds in volunteer subjects wear- ing hearing protection exposed to EPI pulse sequences. Intense impulse noise at 0.65-kHz  with cut-offs at 0.3-kHz and 1.0-kHz were also shown to generate substantial hearing thresh- old shifts. In 2011, Govindaraju, et al. (110) reported a possible incidence of TTS for a man  scanned while wearing earplugs on a 3-T scanner. The patient experienced unilateral hearing  loss and tinnitus immediately following the MRI examination. The hearing loss resolved  completely within 24-hours but the tinnitus persisted. Acoustic noise levels were checked  for the conventional sequences that were performed and found to be in the range of Leq  101- to 112-dBA (Lpeak 115- to 124-dB).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">(B) Permanent Threshold Shifts (PTS) </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>If the noise exposure at intense levels is prolonged, or repeated in close time intervals,  threshold shifts can be permanent. The threshold for permanent hearing damage is approx- imately 140-dB for short impulsive noise and around 85-dB for chronic exposure. Com- mercial MR systems that are designed to be compliant with IEC standards are not able to  generate noise in excess of 140-dB (89). De Wilde, et al. (9) reported one case of excessive  acoustic noise that occurred in the United Kingdom. The patient reported severe headaches,  dizziness, and ear pain following the MRI examination. Importantly, this patient was not  provided hearing protection because the manager of the MRI site was confident that the  noise levels generated by the 0.5-T MR system were not at a level of concern.</para>

      <para>The simplest, most convenient, and least expensive means of preventing problems as- sociated with acoustic noise during MRI procedures is to use disposable earplugs and/or  headphones. Earplugs, when properly fitted can abate noise by 10- to 30-dB (depending on  the frequency), which is usually an adequate amount of sound attenuation for the MRI en- vironment. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis> shows examples of the octave band spectra of some commercially  available earplugs and other hearing protection devices, demonstrating typical noise atten- uation values. The use of earmuffs, headphones, or disposable earplugs has been shown to  provide a sufficient decrease in acoustic noise that, in turn, would be capable of preventing  the potential temporary hearing loss associated with MRI procedures (1).</para>
      <para>The level and frequency range of noise attenuation will vary with the type and design  of hearing protection that is utilized. If data is unavailable for the noise abatement device,  the protector should be tested. Since the designs of hearing protectors do vary, care should  be taken when offering these to patients. Additionally, proper fitting instructions must be  provided. A patient who may be confused, young, or have difficulty in correctly fitting the  hearing protection may need additional assistance to prevent poorly fitting the device and  having compromised noise attenuation.

      <para>Unfortunately, earplugs, earmuffs, and headphones suffer from a number of problems.  These devices tend to hamper verbal communication with the patient during the operation  of the MR system. In certain circumstances, these devices can also create discomfort or im- pair immobilization of the patient’s head, which is problematic when optimal immobiliza- tion is required for certain studies that are particularly sensitive to patient movement (e.g.,  diffusion and phase-sensitive studies).</para>
      <para>Standard foam-based earplugs are often too large for the ear canal of infants. Some  small sizes are available from certain MRI accessory companies, although snug fit is es- sential if acoustic noise is to be efficiently attenuated. Neonates present a particular chal- lenge when trying to use conventional earplugs or other similar devices. Nordell, et al. (111)  reported on a patient-independent device constructed from absorbent padding, which can  be placed over the neonate during the MRI examination. Reductions in peak noise levels of  16- to 22-dBA averaged over the hearing spectrum of 4- to 13-dBA were reported. Spe- cially-designed small earplugs or earmuffs (e.g. MiniMuffs Neonatal Noise Attenuators,  Natus Newborn Care, www,newborncare.natus.com) can be used in these cases.</para>
      <para>Passive devices used for hearing protection may attenuate noise non-uniformly over  the hearing range. While high frequency sound may be well attenuated, attenuation can be  poor at low frequency. This is unfortunate because the low frequency range is also where  the peak in MRI-related acoustic noise is often generated, however, this may be balanced  by the lower hearing sensitivity also in this frequency range (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>Passive protection devices will also offer poor attenuation of noise transmitted to the  patient through bone conduction (112). The effect of vibration being conducted during MRI  and affecting noise has been reported by Glover, et al. (95). The presence of an insulating  foam mattress on the patient couch has been found to reduce vibrational coupling to the pa- tient and noise levels by around 10-dB. This underlying bone conduction transmission path  puts a practical attenuation limit for passive protection at around 40-dB (113). As previously  indicated, Ravicz and Melcher (24) studied the potential for isolating the body from the  MR system using a helmet to minimize acoustic noise transmission via bone conduction.  They used passive hearing protection in combination with the helmet system. Adding pro- tection, they reported a total noise attenuation of 55- to 63-dB, by using a combination of  earplugs (25- to 28-dB alone), ear defenders (i.e., headphones) (39- to 41-dB alone), and  an isolating helmet. While the use of a helmet may suit research studies with volunteer sub- jects, it may not be clinically acceptable for use in patients. However, in general, earplugs  and ear defenders can also be used effectively, offering added hearing protection for patients  undergoing MRI examinations.</para>

      <para>The loudspeaker producing this anti-phase noise can be built into the scanner bore or  built into a pair of headphones for the patient (thus, harnessing passive protection as well).  A major disadvantage of this technique is that, if it performs poorly at certain frequencies  or in some spatial regions, noise levels may be enhanced rather than attenuated by the su- perposition of the additional anti-noise.</para>
      <para>Controlling acoustic noise from a particular source by introducing anti-phase noise to  interfere destructively with the noise source is by no means a new idea (116, 117) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">9</emphasis>). For use in the MRI environment, conventional active-noise control (ANC) systems re- quire some modification. Notably, loudspeakers and microphones designed to be utilized  in the MRI setting must be used to acquire scanner noise and to transmit control anti-noise  and, secondly, the ANC controller must be optimized and synchronized to the scanner.</para>
      <para>The initial results for the use of anti-noise applied to MRI achieved only modest noise  attenuation. Goldman, et al. (41) acquired MR system noise with a microphone, performed  a Fourier transform (FT) of the noise, and generated control noise by inverting the phase of  the major components of the FT, and then transmitted this anti-noise through a loudspeaker  built into a set of headphones (i.e., a combination active-passive system), achieving an av- erage noise reduction of around 14-dB. The performance of this system was not much better  than that of some standard passive headphones, alone, in the low frequency region of the  hearing range. The control sound was delivered using long tubes, introducing a time delay,  which limited control efficiency.</para>

      <para>Advances in digital signal processing (DSP) technology permit efficient modern ANC  systems to be realized at a modest cost (118). The essence of an anti-noise system involves  either a continuous feed-forward or feedback loop with continuous sampling of the sounds  in the noise environment so that the gradient magnetic field-induced noise is attenuated.  Thus, it is possible to attenuate the pseudo-periodic MR system-related noise while allowing  the transmission of vocal communication or music to be maintained. The feedback loop  uses a sampling microphone placed close to the ear, where noise reduction is required. It  will attempt to attenuate all noise propagating into the ear. A feed-forward algorithm uses  a sampling microphone close to the problematic noise source, offering a potentially more  selective cancellation of noise source. Frequently, time limitations in anti-noise getting from  the loudspeaker to the subject as well as stability requirements set a practical upper fre- quency limit for ANC systems. This problem of poorer high frequency attenuation perform- ance is mitigated by building the systems into complementary passive ear defenders,  resulting in a better broad frequency noise reduction.</para>
      <para>Similar to Goldman, et al. (41), commercial manufacturers have offered ANC systems  based on delivering anti-noise to patient headphones (42), however, the long tubing imposes  a time delay in getting noise to the ear, limiting the performance of such a system. In 1995,  Pla, et al. (119) reported improved results using a system based on an x-filtered least mean  squares (LMS) algorithm, driving piezoelectric speakers near the patient’s ears. These re- searchers achieved noise attenuation up to 25-dB for frequencies below 1.2-kHz and for  the first few harmonics only. In 1997, McJury, et al. (114) reported on the performance of  a multichannel filtered U-least mean squares algorithm for acoustic noise control. Acoustic  noise was recorded digitally from a series of typical clinical MRI protocols performed on  a 1.0-T Siemens Impact. This noise was then replayed through a bench-top adaptive real- time DSP ANC system (Motorola DSP 56001). A typical peak sound attenuation of approx- imately 30-dB was achieved over the frequency range from 0- to 700-Hz (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>In 1999, Chen, et al. (115) published results using an ANC system based on a modified  feedback method with a second order cascaded neural network architecture, with loud- speaker mounted in a headset. For acoustic noise up to 3-kHz, they achieved an average at- tenuation of 19-dB. This study was also based on recorded scanner noise attenuated with a  lab-based ANC system.</para>
      <para>More recently, Chambers, et al. (120) demonstrated improved results over a wide fre- quency range using an ANC system that was based on an LMS feed-forward algorithm and  built into a set of ear defenders (i.e., headphones). From 600-Hz to 4-kHz, peak attenuation  of around 40-dB was measured for scanner noise. Importantly, the use of feed-forward  methodology allows cancellation of scanner noise with less attenuation of any noise stimuli  introduced during the use of fMRI protocols. However, this system did not acquire its ref- erence noise in real-time, but required a recording phase to obtain reference data.</para>
      <para>To date, some of the most successful solutions for acoustic noise reductions were the  results from Li, et al. (121) and Lee, et al. (122). Li, et al. (121) reported results with a  patented, ANC system based on a feed-forward, x-LMS algorithm that uses multiple refer- ence signals. The ANC system was built into a headset to also benefit from the passive at- tenuation of noise at higher frequencies. Impressive acoustic noise reductions of up to 55-dB</para>

As for passive noise control, bone conduction remains a residual issue, limiting  noise control. Lee, et al.

Results from  their studies show that a significant amount of low frequency noise is associated with shell  vibration (123, 124), which is directly applicable to an MR system with a similar cylindrical  geometry. Their methods of using active vibration control are also transferrable, however,  until more recently (40, 125), they received little attention from the MRI community. These  methods aim for global control of the entire gradient loudspeaker, not just the noise impact- ing on the ear canal, and would also control noise from bone conduction.</para>

      <para>Because the dominant effect of acoustic noise levels is associated with the signal details  of a particular MRI protocol rather than the structure of the MR system (47), it follows that  it should be possible to reduce the noise level by optimizing the choice of pulse sequence  parameters. Simply using a spin echo (SE) sequence rather than a gradient echo (GE) pulse  sequence and running the sequence with reduced gradient parameters (i.e., rise-time and  amplitude) can significantly reduce the levels of acoustic noise. Skare, et al. (128) designed  so-called “quiet” sequences in this way and defined a simple “quietness factor” (<emphasis role="italics">QF</emphasis>) as,</para>
      <para>where the <emphasis role="italics">RT</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis> is the rise-time of the modified sequence and <emphasis role="italics">RT</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">s</emphasis> , the original/default  rise-time. On a 1.5-T MR system, a <emphasis role="italics">QF</emphasis> of six resulted in a noise attenuation of 20-dB. This  procedure, however, lengthens the echo time (TE), reduces the number of acquisition slices,  and results in a longer examination time.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">(B) Minimizing the Number of Gradient Echoes </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>A reduction of acoustic noise levels may also be achieved by reducing the level of gra- dient pulsing in a pulse sequence (129, 130). A rapid, single-shot, multi-slice imaging tech- nique (i.e., STEAM-Burst) is based on stimulated-echoes without the rapid gradient  switching necessary in other single-shot techniques such as echo planar (130). The STEAM- Burst sequence uses a combination of the “Burst” technique (131), involving the application  of multiple RF pulses under a constant gradient and subsequent refocusing of the resultant  set of echoes, and the STEAM-stimulated echo acquisition mode (132). Limited data on  acoustic noise measurements shows peak noise attenuation of 15-dB compared with a sim- ilar EPI sequence (130).</para>
      <para>This pulse sequence offers the potential for rapid acquisition of MR images, but it is  sensitive to artifacts due to static magnetic field inhomogeneities while generating reduced  levels of acoustic noise. The sequence suffers from two main problems. First, the signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) is low compared with other rapid imaging techniques. Second, the im- ages acquired at 3-T have an SNR of approximately of 20:1. Thus, these pulse sequences  remain more suited to specific research applications than routine use in the clinical MRI  setting.</para>

      <para>used in modern reduced acoustic noise sequence optimization and was first suggested by  Hennel, (133). Notably, this technique may be applied to minimize the acoustic noise gen- erated by a range of conventional MRI pulse sequences. As mentioned above, it has been  shown that the acoustic response of the gradient system to current pulses is linear (47).  Thus, the sound generated by a gradient waveform can be derived from a product of the FT  of the source input and the frequency response function (FRF) of the gradient system (see  Equation 2). If gradient pulses are designed such that their current waveforms contain no  frequencies for which the amplitude of the FRF is high, then resultant acoustic noise levels  should be minimized (133). The FRF of the gradient system in a 3-T MR system was meas- ured and a very low response noted at low frequencies (below 200-Hz). Frequency compo- nents below this threshold should be attenuated in the acoustic spectrum of any pulse  sequences.</para>
      <para>In minimizing high frequency components in the gradient pulses, it is possible to avoid  or reduce sharp transitions, such as step functions in the waveform, and to replace these  with more slowly varying sinusoidal transitions. This may be accomplished by following  three simple rules:</para>
      <para>(1) Use sinusoidal ramping rather than trapezoidal ramping.</para>
      <para>(2) Maximize ramp duration (keeps cut-off frequency low for efficient band limiting).</para>

      <para>The use and efficiency of soft pulses are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 12</emphasis>. With the sinusoidal ramp- ing, high frequency acoustic components above 500-Hz are severely attenuated. Acoustic  noise levels, averaged over 1-second, were measured for spin echo and gradient echo se- quences as a function of echo time (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>). Good quality MR images may be acquired  with sound levels dropping as echo time (TE) increases. At echo times of 30- to 50-msec,  good quality images are still possible and acoustic noise levels are below the ambient room  noise (i.e., with the air-conditioning running, room sound levels approach 45-dBA). Three  main limitations were identified with the initial implementation of this technique, as follows:  1) there was an increased sensitivity of the pulse sequences to vascular flow, 2) the high- speed MRI pulse sequences tended to be unsuitable for clinical applications, and 3) in- creased voltages by factor of two were needed to produce sinusoidal ramps instead of linear  ramps.</para>
      <para>The pulse sequence strategy was extended to fast imaging sequences (FLASH and  RARE) in 2001 (134).

However, acquisition time remained at around one second per  slice, which is unsuitable for an fMRI examination. Loenneker, et al.

      <para>this pulse sequence with optimized sampling scheme on a 2-T MR system, an average noise  reduction of 22-dBA was achieved. The use of sinusoidal gradient waveforms continues to  be common (137 - 139).</para>
      <para>An algorithmic approach to sequence optimization involving gradient reshaping has  been reported by Heismann, et al. (140). Here, gradient waveforms are smoothed (spline  interpolation) and optimized, with the algorithm adapting some sections of the pulse se- quence, and leaving others unchanged. This can be successfully applied to conventional  imaging sequences (141).</para>
      <para>Rather than re-shaping the waveform, a further method is to revise the sampling of k- space. Spiral scanning was used successfully to substantially reduce acoustic noise (136).  Initially, this was used to counteract the long acquisition times resulting from increased  (and lower) gradient durations to reduce acoustic noise. Later, this method has been incor- porated into highly successful “silent” ultrashort TE methods, and techniques for diffusion- weighted MRI (see below).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">(D) Using Parallel Imaging</emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>Similar to the slew rate reduction associated with a soft gradient pulse technique, De  Zwart, et al. (142) used SENSE parallel imaging techniques to obtain significant reductions  in gradient slew rates and achieved reductions in acoustic noise. The use of sensitivity en- coding in combination with multi-channel detector arrays allows reduced gradient switching  through reduced k-space sampling. Using anther type of MRI sequence (i.e., SENSE), a  gradient slew rate reduction was achieved at constant image acquisition time and image  spatial resolution. For two-fold SENSE under sampling, the gradient amplitude was reduced  to 50% (13-mT/m), and ramp time doubled (360-microseconds), resulting in a slew rate of  37-T/m/sec (a 4-fold reduction in the maximum slew rate). SPL reductions for two scanners  were reported: 14-dBA (1.5-T) and 12-dB (3-T).</para>
      <para>Moelker, et al. (143) reported an interesting variant of this approach. This group built  a manual controller to reduce gradient slew rates and the associated acoustic noise for use  during interventional MRI, where acoustic noise may be particularly unpleasant for staff  members, while small degradations to image quality can be tolerated. Their controller al- lowed a 16-fold reduction in slew rate, with acoustic noise reduced by up to 21-dBA.</para>
      <para>In several more recent optimized sequences, parallel imaging forms a part of the opti- mization, especially in challenging areas such as fast imaging and diffusion-weighted MR  imaging (139, 144).</para>

This group demonstrated, that by al- tering the read-out frequency of the EPI gradient (and, hence, the bandwidth) to avoid  known vibrational resonances, significant reductions in acoustic noise could be achieved.  Altering the read-out frequency from 720-Hz to 920-Hz resulted in a noise reduction of 12- dB.</para>

      <para>A similar approach was reported by Schmitter, et al. in 2008 (138). These researchers  devised the so-called “sEPI” technique, which is a low noise EPI pulse sequence for use  with fMRI. This sequence produces a narrow acoustic frequency spectrum by using a sinu- soidal read-out gradient waveform with smooth ramps and constant phase encode gradient.  By varying the switching frequency of the read-out gradient, this narrow band can be shifted  in frequency to match the minima of the scanner frequency response function, avoiding  major resonance modes and minimizing acoustic noise. These researchers reported that the  average SPL of the standard EPI, 82.5-dBA, was reduced to 61.7-dBA. This sequence did  not include optimization of the slice selection gradient, and so this work was extended in  2010 with the introduction of noise-optimized “VERSE” pulses, and a parallel imaging ap- proach.(139). Zapp, et al. (139) further expanded sEPI with the use of parallel imaging.  Segbers, et al. (146) and Ott, et al. (147) have also used a combination of methodologies,  including frequency-shifting, to avoid acoustic noise resonance modes.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">(F) Ultrashort and Zero TE methods</emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>In recent years, imaging tissues with very short T2 (for example cortical bone or lung)  has been improved by the emergence of ultrashort TE (UTE) or zero TE sequences (ZTE)  (148, 149). UTE sequences offer effective TE reductions of 10-200 times that offered by  more conventional sequences. In ZTE sequences, the readout gradient starts simultaneously  with signal excitation (ramping up prior to the excitation pulse), producing an effective TE  of zero. Measurement times are short, but acquisition is inherently three dimensional.</para>
      <para>Both these techniques generally involve (non-Cartesian) radial imaging of k-space. TRs  are also very short, so there is no need to switch off gradients between excitations, and this  lowering of gradient activity results in almost silent sequences. ZTE methods require high- bandwidth excitation, so the specific absorption ratio (SAR) can become an issue, particu- larly at high field. The wide bandwidth excitation can be achieved either using short hard  RF pulses, or by sweeping the frequency of an arbitrary length pulse, the so-called SWIFT  technique (150, 151).</para>
      <para>These methods are highly successful in reducing acoustic noise, producing almost silent  MR sequences, with sequence noise at the level of ambient levels. Hence, they have gen- erated significant commercial interest, and form the basis of solutions implemented by GE  and Siemens.</para>
      <para>GE were early implementers of UTE methods, basing their Silenz<superscript>TM</superscript> product on the  RUFIS sequence (152). A prototype Silenz implementation on a 3-T scanner and running  neuro sequences, produced acoustic noise levels which were similar to room ambient noise  (68.8-dB) (153). Ohlmann-Knaufo, et al. (154) reported on a comparison of the image qual- ity of Silenz T1-w and T2-w scans versus non-Silenz versions at 3-T for neuro patients. The  Silenz scan quality compared well, with the main drawback being the significantly longer  scan times for the T1-w sequences. Others reported on UTE variants for quiet MR, for fast  imaging applications (155, 156).</para>
      <para>Due to the acquisition of signal from free induction decays (FIDs) rather echoes,  UTE/ZTE methods are less sensitive to motion. The long readout time can also cause image  blurring. Holdsworth, et al. (157) compared Silenz-based and conventional MR angiography</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">(G) Using Gradient Cancellation Pulses </emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>Some researchers proposed a technique involving additional “follow-up” gradient  pulses, to cancel the initial pulses that would generate unwanted acoustic noise. This is ef- fectively a type of an anti-noise approach, using anti-phase gradients instead of anti-phase  acoustic noise (161, 162). There is, in effect, a change to the gradient input function, such  that initial impulsive forces generated by the gradients are cancelled by subsequent counter  impulsive forces, minimizing the potential for the generation of acoustic noise. These ideas  can be seen as an extension of the initial observations of the acoustic noise characteristics  of trapezoidal gradient pulses as reported by Wu, et al. (163). Shou, et al. (162) demonstrated  that follow-on trapezoidal gradient pulses can cancel two frequencies and their harmonics.  The initial studies from this group showed that a significant noise reduction was possible  (around 13-dB) when cancelling at least three of the dominant acoustic noise spectral peaks.</para>

These researchers ran versions of EPI and turbo spin echo sequences with  optimized gradient pulse sequences on a 3-T MR system. The gradient coil had a maximum  gradient strength of 21-mT/m and slew rate of 200-mT/m/ms. Using a combination of single  and double follow-on trapezoidal gradient pulses, Segbers, et al. (146) managed to suppress  several of the main acoustic noise spectral frequencies and achieved a maximum noise re- duction of 12-dB.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italics">1) fMRI Methods.</emphasis> As mentioned above, MRI-related acoustic noise can interfere  with the presentation and processing of functional stimuli and generate blood oxygen  level dependent (BOLD)-related contrast in the auditory cortex. Passive hearing pro- tection may not offer sufficiently quiet conditions for psychological studies of hearing  (164). Unfortunately, residual noise can often be loud enough to mask the perception  of experimental sound stimuli (11). Due the inherent requirement for ultrafast image  acquisition, quiet MRI sequences employing shallow gradient ramps or soft gradient  pulses frequently cannot easily be applied to fMRI without compromising data quality.  Marcar, et al. (165) modified a fMRI acquisition using soft gradient pulses (133 ) at 2- T. In achieving a silent sequence, the time penalty results in a 24 sec acquisition time  for a set of 4 slices. Rather than using the approach of Hennel, et al. (133), using sinu- soidal readout gradient switching and continuous phase gradients is popular and effec- tive (139, 166). It is common to manage these issues using different types of  sequence-related solutions: (1) sparse imaging (167-169) and (2) using event-related  strategies (170).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">i) Modified Block Designs for fMRI.</emphasis> These sequences (also called clustered vol- ume acquisition, flat car design, sparse, and behavior interleaved gradients), involve  using a TR that is longer that the acquisition time, allowing time for interleaving  short (1- to 4-seconds) silent gaps within fMRI sequences. In the brain, the peak  hemodynamic response to noise occurs after a time delay of around 5-seconds fol- lowing stimulation. Knowing this, it is possible to present stimuli in these silent  gaps where the scanner is silent and then to acquire the subsequent images when  the peak response will occur. This cycle is then repeated for the entire block. The  duration of the gap is dependent on the number of slices acquired and the repetition  time (TR) used. Therefore, care is needed to avoid extending the sequence length,  which can have penalties in terms of patient motion and image quality. An under- lying assumption is also made with simple modified block designs, that any BOLD  response to scanner noise during acquisition will apply equally when stimulus is  on and when it is off. Optimization of the block design involves two additional cri- teria. If the silent gap is extended to 9- to 10-seconds, enough time will have elapsed  to allow any hemodynamic response produced by the previous acquisition to return  to baseline. Sampling of any BOLD signal relating to acoustic noise from the pre- vious acquisition will then be minimized. Lastly, keeping the acquisition time under  2-seconds will prevent measurement of any hemodynamic response (HR) from the  current acquisition.</para>

      <para>Interleaved silent steady-state imaging (ISSS) (171) is a popular variation of  sparse imaging. This sequence uses continuous excitation pulses (which maintain  a steady state longitudinal magnetization) and variable readout gradients. Like  sparse imaging, stimuli are presented in the quiet gaps, but longer data acquisition  is used for multiple volumes, improving the sequence temporal resolution. As the  data sampling rate is not consistent, it can be challenging to analyze ISSS data.  Andoh, et al. (172) reported encouraging results with a comparison of a resting- state version of ISSS and conventional resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">ii) Event-Related Designs for fMRI.</emphasis> This method involves sampling the peak  of the stimulus HR, followed by a waiting period to avoid acquisition during scan- ner noise HR. When scanner HR has dissipated, baseline sampling then occurs. The  speed of data collection directly determines study data quality and the repetition  time should be kept to a minimum. This type of sequence typically allows one meas- urement every 20-seconds (173).</para>

They  have modified k-space sampling, including acceleration with parallel imaging via re- constructing with Cartesian (179) and non-Cartesian (180) methods. Rather than re- porting acoustic noise levels, they report on modest gains in efficiency for some  sequences.</para>

      <para>Arguably the best, if not the most technically challenging, solution to minimize acoustic  noise is to eliminate the noise at the source by designing a “quiet” gradient coil which gen- erates no acoustic noise or vibration. Acoustic noise and vibration arises due to physical  buckling and resonance of the gradient coil (and former), as well as coupling to other struc- tures. Noise control may be achieved by special designs taking into consideration the con- struction and materials of the gradient coil formers, coupling with other structures, use of  noise insulation materials, and finally the design of the coil windings themselves. This how- ever, represents (for existing scanners) probably the most inconvenient and expensive so- lution. This section discusses each of these aspects in more detail.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italics">Stiffness and Damping.</emphasis> As suggested above, greater gradient coil stiffness should reduce  mechanical vibration and associated noise. Stiffness is dependent on material properties  and geometrical factors. Altering gradient coil dimensions or materials to increase Young’s  modulus will help reduce acoustic noise due to vibration. Lin, et al. (181) reported on the  use of a variety of reinforcements to increase the gradient coil stiffness, reduce vibration,  and the associated acoustic noise. These investigators found that increasing the stiffness of  the gradient coil former reduced the amplitude of the forced vibration response of the gra- dient coil at low frequencies and the noise generated by the coil. In addition, the gradient  coil demonstrated a reduced number of resonance modes in the low and medium frequency  ranges, in turn, reducing the chance of the system being excited into resonance and gener- ating high levels of acoustic noise.</para>
      <para>Damping the gradient coil may also attenuate the mechanical vibration. This can be  achieved by using particular materials for construction or by mounting the coil in such a  way that an acoustic absorber surrounds it. Damping is most efficient at or near resonance  and, unfortunately, will reduce the overall stiffness of the coil structure. Several commercial  manufacturers use damping techniques for their gradient coil systems (46, 51). A reduction  of around 3-dBA due to the use of acoustically damped commercial gradient systems have  been reported (46). Mechefske, et al. (182) reported improved results by mounting an  acoustic liner inside the bore of a 4-Tesla research scanner, with damping material applied  to the back. The bore of this MR system was also fitted with an “endcap”. Running an EPI  sequence, acoustic attenuation of around 20-dB was possible, however the scanner did not</para>

(75). This group modeled the use of an  absorptive liner inside the gradient coils and tested predictions with measurements made in  a 4-Tesla MR system. They found that an acoustic noise reduction of the order of 10-dB at  the low frequency end of the spectrum was possible, but the practicality of using thick ma- terials in limited space is doubtful.</para>

As acoustic waves can only travel  in a medium, mounting or encasing the gradient coil in a vacuum should avoid transmission  of any generated noise (183-186). Edelstein, et al. (185) controlled acoustic noise by using  a combination of evacuating the gradient coil structure and using a magnet with a non-con- ducting inner cryostat bore. They achieved total reduction in acoustic noise of around 20- dB (peak). Their results showed that eddy currents caused by gradient shielding leakage  can generate significant Lorentz forces on the inner cryostat bore. These forces contribute  a significant level of the total scanner acoustic noise. Edelstein, et al. (185) reported that is</para>

The modeled power reductions associated with  the system predicted a reduction in acoustic noise of approximately 25-dB.</para>
      <para>Tkach, et al. (108) reported on the acoustic noise levels generated by a purpose-designed  neonatal 1.5-T MR system. One of the design features was a cantilevered patient couch.  The couch effectively suspends the patient inside the scanner bore, isolating or decoupling  the patient from vibration from the gradient coils and bore panels. For a range of 6 clinical  sequences, they recorded noise levels of 77.3- to 88.0-dB, representing an average reduction  of 11-dB for this system compared to typical adult scanners running similar clinical se- quences.</para>
      <para>Katsunuma, et al. (183), evacuated the area surrounding the gradient coil system so that  insulation would prevent propagation of sound and a separate mount (i.e., floor mounting  the gradient coil former) that prevented transmission of vibration from other structures.  Acoustic noise reduction levels of around 30-dB (peak) were possible, but this is an expen- sive solution and not suited for retrofit. “Enclosure” is a traditional technique used in noise  control, which involves enclosing the noise source in an airtight skin, damping the source  side of the enclosure, and decoupling the enclosure from the source (51).</para>
      <para>Perforating a noise-generating surface has been found to significantly reduce the levels  of acoustic noise generated (188). Systems involving the use of micro-perforated panels  (MPPs), first suggested by Maa (189), are typically used with an air-filled backing cavity  and rigid back wall. These methods can also be difficult to implement efficiently in MR  systems due to additional space requirements. More recently, Li and Mechefske (190) in- vestigated the implementation of an MPP system for use in MRI. Their basic expansion  modeling showed that the MPP systems can be particularly efficient at low frequencies.  However, optimized parameters also allow good efficiency over a wider band. As with  poorly designed ANC systems, noise levels have been found to increase with poorly de- signed perforation systems (190).</para>
      <para>Insulation has also been successful in increasing noise attenuation when applied to  transmit RF coils. For example Ireland, et al. (191) reported on the results of additional in- sulation built into a head RF coil (18-cm inner diameter) for neonatal imaging. The insula- tion achieved an average additional attenuation of 9-dBA across a range of six different  clinical imaging sequences at 1.5-T, resulting in noise levels of approximately 82-dBA, that  were then further attenuated with passive hearing protection.</para>

      <para>Rather than trying to mount a vibrating gradient coil to a heavy and immovable former  or somehow damp the coil, if the coil is considered as a harmonic oscillator and coupled to  another, back-to-back, and if masses and spring constants are equal, the center of mass of  the system will be constant without the need for a heavy mount (192, 193).

Thus, a light coupling  structure of high strength may perform as well as a heavier structure. Composite materials  have been tested and found to perform well with a frequency response up to 20-kHz (single  loop coil of dimensions 30-cm x 20-cm) (125). Using a bench-top prototype 2-coil system  (a square coil design measuring 40-cm along each size, powered by a 10-A sinusoidal cur- rent), the reported noise attenuation, when powered in balanced mode, was approximately  40-dB at 100-Hz, dropping to 0-dB at 3.5-Hz (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 18</emphasis>). The results of attenuation levels  agree reasonably well with a theoretical prediction (curve D) (192).</para>
      <para>Designs have also been extended and tailored to include the capability of current bal- ancing, acoustic screening and magnetic field screening in one coil (195). A head gradient  coil has been designed analytically using co-axial return paths to minimize localized Lorentz  forces and acoustic noise. When performing EPI (3-mm slice thickness, gradient switching  frequency 830-Hz, current 207-A) in a 3-T MR system, noise levels of 102-dB (root mean  square) have been reported (192).</para>
      <para>The implications for gradient coil characteristics of the acoustic screening design mean  a loss of gradient strength and an increase in coil inductance, thus, reducing high-speed per- formance. Estimates of the increase in inductance for a three-cylinder coil system (i.e., fully  force shielded as well as acoustically and magnetically shielded) over a gradient coil with  only active magnetic shielding is a factor of approximately eight.</para>
      <para>To counteract this in keeping performance constant, an increase in driver current of the  square root of 8 is required that will, in turn, increase the acoustic noise output of the coil.  Throughout the data on sound generation in relatively simple gradient structures (37), the  highest sound pressure levels were noted to come from spurious resonances, thought to be  due to bending and buckling of the coil structures (Chladni resonances). Designing coil sys- tems that completely cancel acoustic noise including contributions from these sources is a  considerable challenge.</para>

This involves asymmetric magnet design, and associated changes to hardware such  as the gradient coils (202, 203). Wang, et al.

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Auditory Perception of Radiofrequency (RF) Electromagnetic Fields </emphasis></para>
      <para>When the human head is subjected to pulsed RF radiation at certain frequencies, an au- dible sound perceived as a click or knocking noise may be heard (212-214). This acoustic  phenomenon is referred to as “RF hearing”, “RF sound” or “microwave hearing”. Thermo- elastic expansion is believed to be the mechanism responsible for the production of RF  hearing, whereby there is absorption of RF energy that produces a minute temperature ele- vation (i.e., approximately 1 x 10<superscript>-6</superscript> ˚C) over a brief time period (i.e., approximately 10-mi- croseconds) in the tissue of the head (212-214). Subsequently, a pressure wave is induced  that is sensed by the hair cells of the cochlea via bone conduction. In this manner, the pulse  of RF energy is transferred into an acoustic wave within the human head and sensed by the  hearing organs.</para>
      <para>The sounds that occur with RF hearing appear to originate from within or near the back  of the human head, regardless of the orientation of the head in the RF field. The actual type  of noise that is heard varies with the RF pulse width and repetition rate. The relative loudness  is dependent on the total energy per pulse. RF energy-related acoustic noise has been ob- served at frequencies ranging from 216 to 7500-MHz (212-214).</para>
      <para>RF hearing is mathematically predictable from classical physics and has been studied  and characterized in laboratory animals and human subjects. Individuals involved with the  use of microwaves in industrial and military settings commonly experience RF hearing.  With specific reference to the operation of MR systems, RF hearing has been found to be  associated with frequencies ranging from 2.4- to 170-MHz (212).</para>
      <para>The gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise that occurs during MRI procedures  is significantly louder than the sounds associated with RF hearing. Therefore, noises pro- duced by the RF auditory phenomenon are effectively masked and not perceived by patients  or MR system operators (212). Furthermore, there is no evidence of any detrimental health  effects related to the presence of RF hearing. However, Roschmann, et al. (212) recommends  an upper level limit of 30-kW applied peak pulse power of RF energy for head coils and 6- kW for surface coils used during MR imaging or spectroscopy to avoid RF-evoked sound  pressure levels in the head increasing above the discomfort threshold of 110-dB.</para>

      <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>MRI procedures can generate significant levels of acoustic noise under certain condi- tions (41, 54). This noise can be an annoyance, hinder communication with staff members  and, at high levels, presents a potential safety hazard to patients that must be managed and  controlled.</para>
      <para>Many groups have measured and analyzed the acoustic noise associated with MRI.  Acoustic noise levels increase with changes in imaging parameters including a decrease in  section thickness, field-of-view, gradient ramp time, and an increase in the gradient ampli- tude. The environment, hardware design, and the presence of the patient in the MR system  will also affect noise levels.</para>
      <para>Although many options are available for noise control, the use of simple passive pro- tection in the form of earplugs is generally sufficient to decrease noise to levels within per- missible limits for the great majority of patients. However, care must be taken to ensure  passive protection is properly fitted and in good condition (1). Noise measurements or data  for the scanner should also be acquired and checked in association with the attenuation of  the passive protection to ensure resultant noise levels at the ear will be within safe limits.</para>
      <para>Current documents regarding permissible limits vary, but a general consensus appears  to set a permissible average noise level at the patients ear of 85-dBA (80, 88, 96). Noise  levels outside the MR system’s bore are lower and present reduced risks for an MRI health- care worker present during the MRI examination.</para>
      <para>Of course, passive methods have limitations and more elegant and effective solutions  are possible. These methods range from optimizing the MRI pulse sequences in terms of  minimizing gradient activity, to the utilization of active noise control and active vibration  control systems, or entirely redesigning the gradient coils.</para>
      <para>As with many aspects of MRI, the specifications for achieving high noise attenuation  often run counter to fast acquisition of high quality diagnostic images and compromises  must be made. Optimizing procedures to lengthen gradient ramp times, lower amplitudes,  or minimize pulsing can result in sequences with reduced performance (133-135). Designing  gradient coils that are force-balanced to minimize acoustic resonances will compromise  performance in terms of increasing inductance and loss of gradient strength (37, 192-195).</para>
      <para>A solution that presents a minimal impact on the performance of the MR system is  active noise control using anti-noise (114-122). This is a promising technique but an optimal  system has yet to be fully implemented on clinical scanners.</para>
      <para>Over the last decade, the most effective solutions reported, are those involving sequence  optimization. UTE-type sequences which incorporate spiral k-space trajectory acquisition,  and very low gradient activity produce almost silent MR scanning (148-160). Gradient fil-</para>

      <para>tering or re-shaping has also been proven to be very effective. It is no coincidence that two  commercial solutions (Silenz<superscript>TM</superscript>, and Quiet Suite<superscript>TM</superscript>) are based on these approaches.</para>
      <para>These solutions (UTE methods in particular) have not been applied to every MR se- quence, and are not suited to certain applications, such as ultrafast MR. However, given the  comparative low cost and ease of install for these acoustic noise solutions, coupled with  their efficiency, it seems likely that ongoing research in these directions will prove fruitful  and silent MR sequences will multiply on clinical scanners over time.</para>
      <para>Current trends in MRI include increasing static magnetic field strengths and improved  gradient performance for rapid clinical imaging applications. The need for ultrafast se- quences for fMRI and other advanced techniques continues. These developments will result  in increases in MRI-generated acoustic noise levels. This will mean a continuing interest  and evolution in acoustic noise control methods that warrant continued investigation, de- velopment, and commercial implementation of these techniques.</para>
