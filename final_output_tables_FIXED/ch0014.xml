      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>More than 8 years after the first report of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), inci- dental retention of gadolinium (Gd) was reported to occur in the brain following exposure  to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) (1). The main finding was increased T1- weighted signal intensity (SI) on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images  in certain portions of the brain (e.g., dentate nuclei and globi pallidi), particularly in in- stances where patients had undergone multiple contrast-enhanced MRI examinations. Fol- lowing studies also implied Gd retention in brain tissues by determining change in SI or  R1 relaxation rate on unenhanced MR images of the brain (2,3). Confirmation that those  imaging findings were indeed related to retention of Gd in the brain required direct deter- mination of Gd presence by means of analytical chemistry methods, such as inductively  coupled plasma combined with mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). ICP-MS is a highly sensitive  but destructive technique that reports only on the elemental composition and not on form  of the Gd, i.e., whether it is still present as intact contrast agent molecule or other chemical  forms (3). A large body of studies has clearly shown that indeed traces of Gd remain in the  brain following exposure to GBCAs including in people with normal kidney function (3).  The magnitude of observed retention is always in the order of few micrograms per gram of  wet tissue. In animal studies, the highest levels of retained Gd have been observed after in- travenous administration of gadodiamide (Omniscan™), followed by gadopentetate dimeg- lumine (Magnevist® and generic equivalents). Lower levels have been reported after  administration gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance®) and gadoxetate disodium (Primo- vist®/Eovist®). The lowest levels were found after exposure to gadobutrol (Gadovist®/Ga- davist®), gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem® and generic equivalents, e.g., Clariscan™),   and gadoteridol (ProHance®).</para>

      <para>Although it had been known for decades that Gd is retained in other tissues, such as in  skin, bone and liver tissues, and Gd retention is lower in the brain than in other organs (2,  3), the discovery of possible Gd retention in brain tissues raised a number of questions re- lated to the safety of GBCAs, that is, chronic retention of traces of residual Gd species from  GBCAs associated with damage of involved tissues? Is there evidence of clinically relevant  harm to patients? Does the available evidence change the benefit/risk balance of GBCAs?  This chapter is aimed at providing evidence to address these fundamental questions.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Long-term Gd retention in the brain: any evidence of chronic neurotoxicity? </emphasis></para>
      <para>Data in the context of possible neurotoxicity after exposure of cells and tissues to Gd  exist within a hierarchy that is not always acknowledged and considered throughout exper- imentation, discussion of results and especially when drawing conclusions. At the bottom  of the hierarchy are data obtained <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> under extreme experimental conditions, which  usually do not occur <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> in any biological system. For instance, several <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> experi- ments aimed at assessing the potential for neurotoxic effects of GBCAs investigated the ef- fect of direct and prolonged exposure of Purkinje cells, astrocytes, or cortical neurons to  Gd ions from the dissociation of Gd chloride (GdCl3) (4-6). However, free Gd ions cannot  survive in biological fluids or tissues because they have a high affinity for abundantly pres- ent anions like phosphates, carbonates and citrates, and, to a lesser extent, macromolecules.  As a matter of fact, preliminary speciation analysis showed that Gd appears to be retained  in insoluble forms (most likely bound to anions), soluble high-molecular-weight complexes  (Gd bound to macromolecules), or low-molecular-weight molecules (most likely intact  GBCA molecules) (7, 8). Therefore, the concept of direct toxicity of Gd ions, acting as cal- cium antagonists and blocking voltage-gated calcium channels in the human brain and other  tissues following the release of the metal from GBCAs is a pure myth, which, however, ap- pears pretty difficult to debunk.</para>
      <para>Data more predictive of possible neurotoxic effects in humans may be provided by <emphasis role="italics">in </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">vivo</emphasis> studies in animals. Several studies in different animal species have confirmed long- term brain retention of traces of Gd-containing species following doses of GBCAs exceed- ing clinical doses by several orders of magnitude but always failed to demonstrate any  evidence of injury to neurons, glial cells, or the brain interstitium from retained Gd (3, 8- 11). Some of these studies also found no adverse effects of long-term retention of the metal  on cognitive or motor function in neonatal, juvenile and adult animals (12-14). These results  are consistent with those of a recent investigation aimed at assessing the adverse central  nervous system effect of Gd deposition by using a rotarod performance test (15). The authors  concluded that Gd deposition did not lead to alterations in locomotor abilities in healthy  mice, although their mouse model was obtained by long-term (90 weeks) oral administration  of GdCl3.</para>
      <para>Some evidence of potential neurotoxicity was reported by Khairinisa, et al. (16) in preg- nant BALB/c mice. Prenatal exposure (embryonic days 15 to 19) to intravenous gadoterate  meglumine (Dotarem®) or gadodiamide (Omniscan™) was associated with abnormal be- haviors and decreased muscle strength of offspring. Of note, the sponsor Bracco had already  conducted two perinatal/postnatal studies the effects of the macrocyclic GBCA gadoteridol  (ProHance®) and of the linear GBCA gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance®) on the off-</para>

      <para>spring of female mice exposed to intravenous bolus injections up to 4 times the clinical  dose for 12 consecutive days during gestation (17,18). The evaluation went from implanta- tion throughout the fetal period and continued through sexual maturity of the offspring until  day 70 postpartum. Among the observations performed during the two studies, the Func- tional Observational Battery (FOB) included sensorimotor responses to visual, acoustic,  tactile and painful stimuli (reactivity and sensitivity). These two studies did not show any  effect of the two GBCAs on the cognitive or motor function of the offspring, nor decreased  muscle strength. Anyway, the study by Khairinisa, et al. (16) drew the attention to a possible  effect of exposure to GBCAs during pregnancy on brain development of the fetus, despite  existing data and even if the transferability to humans of the results from the mouse model  used in that small animal study could not be properly assessed due to significant limitations  of the study. That led the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request all  marketing authorization holders to carry out additional, large juvenile and perinatal/postnatal  mice studies with all the GBCAs in clinical use. As expected, the preliminary results of  these regulatory safety animal studies do not confirm the findings reported by Khairinisa,  et al. (16)</para>
      <para>In conclusion, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> studies in several animal species have not yet provided evidence  of chronic toxicity arising from retained Gd in brain tissues.</para>
      <para>At the pinnacle of the hierarchy of scientific evidence are data obtained from human  subjects. Several post-mortem studies assessed potential signs of neurotoxicity using struc- tural histopathology assessments and transmission electron microscopy and energy-disper- sive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX) to identify possible ultrastructural changes (18-23).  Histologic examination of brain tissues did not show gross histologic changes between con- trast and control groups in hematoxylin-eosin–stained tissue samples examined with visual  light microscopy. In one study of pediatric patients, dentate tissue from two patients, one  with pontine glioma and one with neuroblastoma who received high cumulative doses of  gadodiamide (Omniscan™), had mildly to severely gliotic regions with prominent axonal  spheroids (22). It is likely, however, that these changes were associated with prior external  beam radiation therapy. TEM-EDX DID not show ultrastructural abnormalities.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">In vivo</emphasis> studies in humans also showed a substantial absence of clinical neurological  and neuropsychological worsening related to cumulative GBCA doses. Cao, et al. (24) con- ducted a retrospective study aimed at comparing brain T1 signal changes in patients exposed  to GBCAs while on chronic hemodialysis to matched control patients with near-normal  renal function (eGFR &gt;60 mL/min per 1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>). Because dialysis patients were regularly  evaluated by nurses and physicians, typically 3 times per week, there was also an opportu- nity to search for patterns of clinical events that might be occurring after each exposure to  GBCAs in these patients. An electronic medical records search of 2 large medical centers  identified 25 patients who received linear GBCAs while on hemodialysis and had unen- hanced T1-weighted images of the brain before and after. T1-weighted SI analysis was per- formed to detect abnormal T1 shortening in the dentate nucleus (DN) and globus pallidus  (GP) in the patients on hemodialysis compared with 25 age/sex/GBCA exposure–matched  control patients with normal or near-normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration  rate &gt;60 mL/min per 1.73m<superscript>2</superscript>). Two additional control groups included 13 patients on he- modialysis without GBCA exposure and 13 age/sex-matched patients with estimated</para>

      <para>glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>. The 25 dialysis patients re- ceived 44 administrations of linear GBCAs. A greater T1 SI change in the dentate nucleus  (but not in the globus pallidus) was observed in dialysis patients receiving GBCA compared  to matched patients with normal or near-normal renal function. Despite evidence of abnor- mal T1 shortening and Gd retention, there was no increase or unique pattern of clinical  events occurring within 30 days after any of the 44 GBCA exposures in this cohort. In par- ticular, 7 neurological issues described during the 30 days following GBCA doses (migraine  headache, loss of consciousness, memory loss, falling, lightheadedness, and ataxia) were  also present before GBCA exposure.</para>
      <para>Welk, et al. (25) conducted a population-based study to assess the association between  Gd exposure and parkinsonism using multiple and linked administrative databases from  Ontario, Canada. Patients who were exposed to GBCA-enhanced MRIs, modeled as a time- varying, cumulative count variable, were compared with patients who received unenhanced  MRIs and were never exposed to GBCAs. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of  parkinsonism based on a validated definition (sensitivity, 81.7%; specificity, 99.7%; positive  predictive value, 78.0%; negative predictive value, 99.8%; accuracy, 99.5%; and disease  prevalence, 1.4%) using diagnosis codes from hospital admissions and physician visits or  a dispensed Parkinson disease–specific medication (24). Since medication coverage is pro- vided in Ontario, Canada for those older than 65 years, only patients of 66 years of age or  older were included in the study. At the same time, to avoid confounding factors, patients  who underwent MRI of the central nervous system (CNS), neurosurgery or had pre-existing  Parkinson’s disease or parkinsonism were excluded. Of the 246,557 patients undergoing at  least 1 non-CNS MRI during the study period, 146,818 (59,5%) underwent 1 or more un- enhanced MRI and 99,739 (40.5%) received at least 1 GBCA dose. Among patients who  underwent contrast-enhanced MRIs, 81,827 (81.5%) were exposed to a single GBCA in- jection, 11,278 (15.8%) to 2-3 injections, and 6,634 to 4 or more injections. Incident parkin- sonism developed in 1.16% of unexposed patients and in 1.17% of those exposed to GBCAs.  In adjusted analysis, there was no significantly increased hazard of parkinsonism among  patients with cumulative exposure to GBCAs compared with those never exposed to the  agents. Of note, the incidence rate of parkinsonism was lower (0.70%) in the cohort of pa- tients exposed 4 or more times to GBCAs.</para>
      <para>McDonald, et al. (27, 28) reported findings from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging  (MCSA), a large study of the incidence and natural history of normal and abnormal (mild  cognitive impairment and dementia) cognitive decline over time. While this study was not  initially conceived to identify the neurologic effects of GBCA exposure, it remained an  ideal dataset for such an investigation as it was a prospectively enrolled, population-based  cohort with unique linkage to demographic, clinical and vital records data provided from  the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), a large population-based study of human health  (29). The MCSA continuously enrolled patients in a prospective manner since study initia- tion on October 1, 2004. After enrolment, all patients underwent extensive longitudinal clin- ical (neurologic evaluation, neuropsychological testing) and imaging (unenhanced MRI and  PET/CT) assessment at baseline and 15-month follow-up intervals. After searching the elec- tronic medical record and REP data, patients were segregated into those with no history of  prior GBCA exposure (control group) and those who underwent prior GBCA-enhanced  MRI examinations. The linear GBCA gadodiamide (Omniscan™) was used in all the con-</para>

      <para>trast-enhanced MRI procedures. Of note, GBCA exposure was independent of MCSA par- ticipation and, as a result of MCSA inclusion and exclusion criteria, was not related to an  underlying neuropathologic process that could confound the results of the analysis. All study  subjects underwent a large battery of neurologic and neurocognitive tests. Among 4261  cognitively normal study participants aged 50-89 (mean age at enrolment: 72 years), 1092  patients (25.6%) received one or more GBCA doses (range: 1-28 doses) unrelated to their  participation in the MCSA. The GBCA exposed group was followed prospectively for a  total of 7,104 person years and had a total of 83,119 person-years of retrospective clinical  data available from the REP. Similarly, the control group was followed prospectively for a  total of 16,078 person years with a total of 236,384 person years of retrospective clinical  data available from the REP. After adjusting for over 20 demographic and clinical variables  including age, sex, education level, baseline neurocognitive performance, Charlson comor- bidity index, and ApoE4 status, exposure to the least stable GBCA, gadodiamide (Omnis- can™), did not turn out to be a significant predictor of excess decline in cognitive function  or motor performance. A total of 670 (16%) of the 4261 participants who were initially cog- nitively normal at the time of enrolment progressed to mild cognitive impairment during  the study timeframe. The incidence of progression to cognitive decline in the GBCA-ex- posed group, standardized by age, sex, and education level to the Olmsted County popula- tion, was 29.1 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 25.7-31.2) while the control group was 27.6  per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 24.9-30.4). After adjusting for age, sex, education level,  and other covariates, neither GBCA exposure nor cumulative lifetime GBCA dose was as- sociated with significant excess risk of conversion to cognitive impairment in the study  population.</para>
      <para>The previous studies, showing no effect of exposure to GBCAs on cognitive function  or motor skills in special and vulnerable populations, such as elderly subjects and patients  with impaired renal function, specifically excluded patients with diseases of the central and  peripheral nervous system, to avoid any confounding bias. So, what about possible addi- tional neurological damage in patients with neurological disorders, especially those requir- ing multiple GBCA-enhanced MRI exams? Forslin, et al. (30) conducted a retrospective,  longitudinal cohort study aimed at investigating the relationship of multiple GBCA admin- istrations with SI increase in the DN and GP, and any possible effect on cognitive function  in 23 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who had undergone physical disability assess- ments and neurological and neuropsychological evaluations at 3 time points during 18-years  of follow-up. A cohort of 23 healthy, age-/gender-matched subjects were used as single  time-point controls. All control subjects underwent one unenhanced MRI scan. An increase  in SI in the dentate nucleus was observed in the MS cohort and was associated with lower  verbal fluency scores, which remained significant after correction for several aspects of dis- ease severity. The same group reported cross-sectional cohort study of 85 patients with MS  and 23 age- and sex-matched healthy controls without exposure to GBCAs (31). Single  time-point physical disability assessments and neurological and neuropsychological eval- uations were carried out in MS patients and controls. Longitudinal (T1) and transversal (T2)  relaxation rates relaxometry of dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and thal- amus was used to assess possible Gd retention in those brain areas. Higher relaxation was  associated with lower information-processing speed (dentate nucleus, thalamus) and verbal  fluency (caudate nucleus, thalamus). No associations were found with physical disability</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">369</emphasis></para>

      <para>or fatigue. Because a decrease in verbal fluency and information-processing speed are the  cognitive domains most commonly affected in MS, and the controls in both studies were  just matched for age and sex, the authors of these two studies were not able to separate the  effects of the disease itself from a possible toxicity of the GBCAs. A more recent retrospec- tive study of 74 relapsing-remitting MS patients investigated the relationship between  changes in the expanded disability status scale, T1-weighted hyperintensity and higher lon- gitudinal relaxation rate in the dentate nucleus and (R1) maps, and confirmed the absence  of association between imaging findings suggestive of Gd retention and progression of  physical disability (32). Another retrospective study evaluated the association between life- time cumulative doses of the least stable, linear agent gadodiamide (Omniscan™), increased  SI within the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, and thalamus, and disease progression in pa- tients with early MS (33). A total of 203 patients with MS (107) with baseline and follow- up MRI assessments) and 262 age- and sex-matched controls were included in this study.  Patients with MS had disease duration &lt;2 years at baseline and received exclusively gado- diamide (Omniscan™) at all MRI time points. The mean follow-up time was 55.4 months,  and the mean number of gadolinium-based contrast agents administrations was 9.2. No sig- nificant association was observed between imaging signs of Gd retention and outcomes of  disease severity, i.e., accumulation of lesion burden, development of brain atrophy, occur- rence of relapses, or increase in disability over the years of follow-up. Finally, two studies  assessed possible structural damage to the dentate nuclei in patients with MS exposed to  multiple administrations of either linear or macrocyclic GBCAs. Despite visible, abnormal  T1 hyperintensity, interpreted as a sign of Gd retention, either diffusion-weighted MRI or  sodium (<superscript>23</superscript>Na) MRI at 3T indicated no changes of tissue integrity of the dentate nuclei in  any the MS patients in the two studies (34, 35).</para>
      <para>In conclusion, although there is data that all GBCAs leave trace amounts of residual  Gd in brain tissues after intravenous GBCA administration, there is no convincing evidence  indicating chronic neurotoxicity arising from long-term Gd retention, harmful effects, and  potential interaction with neurological disease processes. (36).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Long-term Gd retention in non-CNS tissue: any clinically meaningful effects? </emphasis></para>
      <para>It is clear that Gd retention in a number of non-CNS tissues, including bone, skin, and  liver, may occur with all types of GBCAs (3). While most <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> studies in different animal  species and models focused on Gd retention in tissues, a few reports describe the results of  histologic assessment of potential toxicity of retained Gd, with emphasis on the skin, to as- sess the possible association of exposure to GBCAs with the development of nephrogenic  systemic fibrosis (NSF). In healthy rat, histologic evidence of skin lesions was observed  only in animals administered the linear GBCAs associated with the highest levels of Gd re- tention, i.e., gadodiamide (Omniscan™) and gadoversetamide (OptiMARK®) (37-41). Sim- ilar findings were reported using animal models of renal impairment (42-44). Fretellier, et  al. (44) demonstrated that hyperphosphatemia induced in partially nephrectomized rats by  a high phosphate diet increased the frequency and severity of gadodiamide-induced skin  lesions. The observed skin changes were characterized by dermal fibrosis and infiltration  of different cells, including mononuclear cells and CD34-positive cells (43, 45). One study  (41) showed elevation of several proinflammatory cytokines in the serum of gadodiamide- treated rats, suggesting the involvement of inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of</para>

      <para>skin damage. However, the skin lesions observed in rats following exposure to gadodiamide  (Omniscan™) were not completely consistent with histopathology of NSF in humans. Some  of the difference between the cutaneous changes described in the gadodiamide (Omnis- can™)-treated rats and human NSF are possibly due to anatomical differences, such as the  presence of the panniculus carnosus in rats, a structure that separates the dermis from the  subcutis and explains the fact that the observed skin lesions were restricted to the dermis in  this animal species (46). All in all, these results of studies in animals might provide clues  about the possible pathogenesis of NSF in humans. However, it should be noted that signs  of possible toxicity in skin tissues from retained Gd were only observed following exposure  to gadodiamide (Omniscan™) and gadoversetamide (OptiMARK™, not available for clin- ical use). Also, one study showed that marked skin lesions, characterized by epidermal hy- perplasia and hyperkeratosis, crusting and ulceration, and dermal infiltration by acute and  chronic inflammatory cells, mast cells and mineralization, were observed after exposure to  the active ingredient of Omniscan™, gadodiamide, and not after exposure to another GBCA  or even to Gd salts, showing a possible role of the intact GBCA and not of retained Gd (47).</para>
      <para>NSF is a serious clinical syndrome associated with Gd retention in body tissues. It has  been observed only in patients with acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (eGFR &lt;30  mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>), end-stage renal disease, or with acute renal insufficiency of any severity  due to hepatorenal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period (48). NSF  cases occurring after the sole administration of one GBCA are defined as “single-agent” or  “unconfounded.” If a case of NSF follows the administration of two or more GBCAs, it is  impossible to determine which agent is associated with the development of the disorder,  and the case is reported as “multiple-agent” or “confounded” (48). Almost all unconfounded  NSF cases occurred after single or repeated exposure to three GBCAs: gadopentetate dimeg- lumine (Magnevist® and generic equivalents), gadoversetamide (OptiMark®), and gado- diamide (Omniscan™) (49). No or very few unconfounded cases were reported following  exposure to any of the other GBCAs available for clinical use, that is, gadoterate meglumine  (Dotarem® and generic equivalents(Dotarem® and generic equivalents, e.g., Clariscan™),  gadoteridol (ProHance® ), gadoxetate disodium (Primovist® /Eovist® ) (49). The available  evidence on NSF with the individual GBCAs is provided and discussed in Chapter 13 of  this book.</para>
      <para>Other entities that have been reported as possibly associated with residual Gd following  exposure to GBCAs are the “gadolinium-associated plaques” and the “gadolinium deposi- tion disease”. “Gadolinium-associated plaques” is the proposed name of a condition ob- served in a total of 4 cases between the first report in 2013 and the last in 2019 (50-52).  Three patients presented with 0.5-2.5 cm plaques that resembled dermal infiltrative  processes such as granuloma annulare or cutaneous sarcoidosis in two cases (51); in one  case, it was an accidental finding in excisional specimens obtained during surgical removal  of squamous cell carcinoma (50). One patient showed ill-defined, hyperpigmented and vi- olaceous macules coalescing into ill-defined nummular patches with fine scale on the upper  back, right forearm and right lower leg (52). Eosinophilic, collagenous, round, or ovoid  sclerotic bodies in various stages of calcification were the pathognomonic histopathologic  feature of the condition. Renal function was impaired in three patients and normal in the  remaining one. In one case, the patient could not recall exposure to any GBCA (52). Two  cases have been reported after administration of gadodiamide (Omniscan™, total cumulative</para>

When exposure to GBCAs was ascertained, the interval  between last exposure and onset of the skin lesions ranged between 3.5 and 5 years. Plaques  were asymptomatic in three cases, and pruritic and burning in one. The association between  the observed skin lesions and exposure to GBCAs was suggested because sclerotic bodies  and osseous metaplasia have been described as a late finding in the course of NSF, and the  observed plaques were seen in two patients exposed to a GBCA (gadodiamide, Omniscan),  a GBCA known to be associated with NSF. The diagnosis of NSF was always ruled out,  however, as no other clinical or pathological sign of the disease was observed.</para>
      <para>First reported by Semelka, et al. in 2016 (53, 54), “gadolinium deposition disease”  (GDD) is still only a proposed disease process with no clear proof of its true existence.  GDD describes a condition in which a patient with normal or near-normal kidney function  develops long-lasting symptoms reportedly after exposure to one or more GBCAs, assuming  that alternative conditions and causes have been excluded (55). All the publications about  GDD cases came from the same small group of investigators, who very recently acknowl- edged that this entity had been met with skepticism among physicians because their papers  describing the disease had been criticized for flaws in their methodology (55). Over the  years, those investigators provided several definitions of GDD. The most recent definition  (55) indicates that a diagnosis of GDD requires that: i) the patient has to be exposed to a  GBCA in the last month prior to onset of symptoms; ii) the symptoms should be new to the  patient, i.e., not reflecting any pre-existing disease or symptoms observed before exposure  to GBCAs; iii) symptoms include brain fog, pins and needles sensations, glove and stocking  distribution of symptomatology, skin discoloration, pain (including bone pain and a burning  sensation), and/or subcutaneous tissue thickening; iv) whenever possible, evidence should  be obtained that Gd remained in the patient’s system for more than 30 days after exposure  to GBCAs; v) the patient should have had normal or near-normal renal function at the time  of the exposure to GBCAs. Symptoms reportedly may arise within the first 24 hours after  exposure to any of the GBCAs in clinical use and may last for weeks, months or even years  (55). The group of investigators reporting these cases indicated that GDD is a rare encounter,  and that this presumed disease process might initially resemble an acute hypersensitivity  reaction to the GBCAs; therefore it may not be related to Gd deposition but rather involve  the immune system in the presence of host factors such as genetic susceptibility and/or  adaptive immune response (53-55). However, possible predisposing conditions or risk fac- tors were never reported. The same group of investigators also reported that chelation ther- apy with Ca-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid increased urine Gd content and serum levels  of some cytokines in patients with presumed GDD and caused an exacerbation of symptoms  (flare) within the first 24 hours (56-57). All in all, the published literature to date failed to  validate the existence of a novel condition characterized by the development of long-lasting  symptoms following exposure to GBCAs and possibly maintained by Gd retained in tissues.  The very few reports always came from the same group of investigators, showed significant  selection bias, lacked clinical information to exclude alternative medical diagnoses and/or  to substantiate findings, and sample sizes were always so small to render the results difficult  to interpret. In the absence of evidence from well-designed clinical studies that could vali- date the existence of GDD and its pathogenesis, the use of chelation therapy in patients</para>

      <para>with no clear evidence-based indication potentially increases the risk of clinically significant  harm from the well-known adverse effects of chelation (58).</para>
      <para>In September 2017, during a meeting of the Medical Imaging Drugs Advisory Com- mittee (MIDAC), the FDA presented a series of patients reporting symptoms potentially  related to GBCA exposure. A total of 132 case reports were identified, with various symp- toms often centering around pain; most were self-reported and lacked significant and vali- dated clinical information. The MIDAC concluded that no association between exposure  to GBCAs, Gd retention and patient symptoms could be established (59). From January 1,  2010 and December 31, 2020, Bracco, the marketing authorization holder of two GBCAs,  gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance®) and gadoteridol (ProHance®) received a total  number of 14 cases of symptoms (7 with gadobenate dimeglumine and 7 with gadoteridol)  persisting for more than 4 weeks, with or without evidence of Gd retention in hair or urine.  The majority (10) of these cases were not confirmed by any healthcare professional. Also,  most of them reportedly followed exposure to multiple GBCAs. The interval between last  exposure to a GBCA and onset of symptoms ranged from 2 hours to years. In one case,  symptoms were pre-existing the exposure to gadobenate dimeglumine. Overall, the reporting  rate of patients with persisting symptoms was lower than 1 case over more than 238,000  exposures to GBCAs. Overall, the reports received by Bracco referred to heterogeneous  clusters of symptoms, without any common suggestive clinical pattern. Relatedness of the  reported symptoms to GBCAs could not be established due to the scarce quality of the avail- able information, together with the multifactorial nature of the reported events and/or the  presence of underlying co-morbidities which could explain the reported symptoms (60).</para>
      <para>In conclusion, besides NSF, there is no evidence suggesting that retention of Gd in non- CNS tissues may be associated with harmful effects and potential interaction with disease  processes.</para>

      <para>While the effectiveness and benefit provided by GBCAs has been properly demon- strated before and after their approval by all regulatory authorities in the world, there is no  evidence of new, additional risk resulting from Gd retention in brain and body tissues. To  date, NSF is the most significant clinical syndrome associated with retention of Gd in body  tissues, and important and effective risk minimization measures for NSF have been intro- duced since 2010, virtually eradicating the disease.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>By enhancing the quality of MR images and improving the diagnostic performance of  MRI and MR angiography, the use of GBCAs has been part of standard clinical practice to  provide treatment guidance for more than three decades. In many instances, GBCA-en- hanced MRI or MRA provide diagnostic information that would otherwise be unavailable.  As such, their use is routine and a crucial component in the diagnosis and follow-up of pa- tients with serious medical conditions, including cancer, vascular pathology, and infection.  While GBCAs provide crucial, life-saving medical information, each time an individual</para>

      <para>GBCA-enhanced MRI or MRA study is considered, it is important to consider its clinical  benefit against the potential risk deriving from its use.</para>
      <para>Known risks associated with exposure to GBCAs include the possible occurrence of  immediate-type reactions and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Immediate-type adverse  reactions are those occurring within 1 hour of injection of a GBCA, and most of them are  hypersensitivity reactions and are unpredictable. Patients at risk for acute hypersensitivity  reactions are those with a history of a previous acute reaction to a GBCA, asthma, or other  allergic disorders. To minimize the occurrence and severity of hypersensitivity reactions,  warnings and precautions specifically related to the risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions  are given in the prescribing information of all approved GBCAs (please see Chapter 10 of  this book for more detailed information on how to minimize the risk of immediate-type re- actions to GBCAs).</para>
      <para>NSF is the most serious clinical syndrome associated with Gd retention in body tissues  to date. It has been observed only in patients with acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency  (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>), end-stage renal disease, or with acute renal insufficiency of  any severity due to hepatorenal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period  (“high-risk patients”). Notably, important and effective risk minimization measures for NSF  have been introduced since 2010, virtually eradicating the disease (please see Chapter 13  of this book for more detailed information on how to minimize the risk of NSF).</para>
      <para>Although it had been known for decades that Gd is retained in other tissues, such as in  skin, bone and liver tissues, the observation of traces of residual Gd in brain tissues of pa- tients exposed to GBCAs raised a number of questions related to the safety of GBCAs.  However, besides NSF, the available evidence failed to demonstrate an association between  Gd retention in brain or body tissues and harm to patients. Notably, following extensive as- sessments, all regulatory authorities around the world agreed on the absence of evidence of  any harmful effect of Gd retention in humans following exposure to any of the approved  GBCAs; however, even if based on the same amount of preclinical and clinical evidence  available in adults and children, regulatory authorities used different approaches resulting  in different actions and decisions regarding the labeling and market authorizations of indi- vidual GBCAs (61).</para>
      <para>Of note, lack of evidence is not conclusive evidence of absence. If Gd retention is as- sociated with clinical harm, the harm is likely rare or occult for the vast majority of exposed  patients. Future studies should be appropriately powered to enable detection of rare or subtle  adverse effects; however, it should be recognized that it is not possible to scientifically  prove the absence of harm, and that the specific signs, symptoms, and diseases to investigate  are unclear (3).</para>
      <para>Until new evidence may become available, the most practical approach may be to treat  GBCAs like ionizing radiation, i.e., to follow an ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable)  approach (2). Exposure to GBCAs should be minimized as much as is reasonable while re- membering that the diagnostic benefits generally still greatly exceed the risks for indicated  contrast-enhanced MR examinations. GBCAs should not be administered freely regardless  of medical appropriateness, but instead should be used when clinically indicated, like any  other medication. To this purpose, the prescribing information for all GBCAs has been up-</para>
