      <title>10.1 Introduction</title>
      <anchor id="ch0022-head-2-123"/>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0003">Supporting a devoted caregiver with the euthanasia of their pet is a regular part of the animal end‐of‐life (EOL) or hospice experience. Animal hospice revolves around the idea that death may come in either form: naturally, when a dying body shuts down on its own, or through the medical act of euthanasia. Euthanasia comes from the Greek words “eu” [good] and “thanatos” [death], and when performed properly, it is a smooth, peaceful passing<citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0001</citation>. The goal of human hospice care is to neither hasten nor postpone death. When working with animals and the inherent differences between human and veterinary medicine, there is often greater permission to quicken death when suffering is present or pending. Euthanasia is generally accepted when an animal’s welfare is <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10304">at risk</ulink>, including when the caregiver burden has become too great, and they are struggling to provide adequate palliative care to their pet.</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0004">Euthanasia is conducted for a variety of reasons across many animal industries, including lab animal research, zoo and wildlife care, hobby farming, animal shelters, and private companion animal practice. Euthanasia tends to refer to a more singular act based on an animal’s physical or behavioral need rather than a large volume of herd animals requiring slaughter and depopulation. Slaughter and depopulation killing methods are very different from those used in companion animal hospice<citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0002</citation>. Euthanasia is accepted by many cultures and religions around the world, although the choice to proceed remains highly personal and is often based on the relationship between humans and animals <citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0003</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0005">As the International Association for Animal Hospice and Palliative Care (IAAHPC) explains, opting for euthanasia during the course of hospice care may be necessary and should not be viewed as a failure<citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0004</citation>. In this situation, a caregiver’s intention may be the natural death of their pet, but the circumstances of their pet’s health, both physical and mental, require euthanasia. These physical and mental ailments include severe <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>, breathing difficulty, uncontrollable <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5444">seizures</ulink>, and fear. Allowing a pet to die when their body picks the time is very attractive to caregivers who would rather not make the decision to end life. In a brief survey of caregivers working with this author, 95% of caregivers given the choice of how they want their pet to die said they prefer a natural death but were open to euthanasia if the veterinarian thought it best. The remaining 5% were split between wanting a hospice‐supported natural death and wanting a planned euthanasia with no <anchor id="ch0022-Page_152"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="152"/>desire for natural death. The goal of animal hospice places more emphasis on the time leading up to death to ensure it is comfortable and safe, and to allow death to come in any form. In other words, hospice is more about the journey than the destination.</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0006">Providing a compassionate euthanasia experience must consider the actions of the veterinary team before, during, and after death. Beforehand, veterinarians and veterinary technicians will be part of the discussion to determine if euthanasia is warranted and to address caregiver perspectives, beliefs, and feelings. These are often complex conversations demanding patience, compassion, and strong communication skills. During euthanasia, veterinarians and technicians work together to ensure the medical procedure itself is problem‐free. After euthanasia, the actions of the staff and how they care for the deceased pet are often just as meaningful to the caregiver. Endings matter, and it’s important for technicians to recognize that the euthanasia experience is more than just the act of giving euthanasia solution during the appointment. It is a collective experience that may span days to weeks.</para>

      <title>10.2 Defining Euthanasia and Dysthanasia</title>
      <anchor id="ch0022-head-2-124"/>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0007">Having a term like euthanasia, which means a good death, gives us something to strive for. It’s a declaration that we want a good death and not a bad one. What actually defines a good death requires a bit more exploration. One person may view the experience very differently than another. Euthanasia in companion animals has been well studied, and some definitions have emerged to guide technicians and veterinary teams in achieving it [<citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0005</citation>, <citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0006</citation>] and avoiding dysthanasia (the opposite of euthanasia, also from the Greek language) <citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0007</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0008">When caregivers are asked what’s important to them during euthanasia, there are five things that rise to the top (see<link linkend="ch0022-c10-tbl-0001">Table 10.1</link>). Caregivers who have these conditions met rank their euthanasia experiences the highest when compared to caregivers who do not. They have confidence in the manner in which their pet died, with more control over the circumstances. Veterinary technicians help to increase caregiver comfort with the euthanasia details that matter most to them. Often just asking what’s important to caregivers is enough to set the stage for a more meaningful death.</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0009">Assisting with euthanasia appointment planning will be a large part of a technician’s role. The nature of animal hospice as a journey provides time for such conversations to occur. Veterinarians will usually be the ones to broach the subject of euthanasia; however, a technician can ask how a caregiver feels about the option. How a caregiver feels about euthanasia is considered a psychosocial factor (<link linkend="ch0022-c10-fea-0001">Communication Corner 10.1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0010">Euthanasia in an <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> situation tends to be the most difficult for caregivers. <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">Emergencies</ulink> by nature are surprising and unexpected, with little to no time to preplan for special touches during euthanasia (e.g. having loved ones present or adequate time to say goodbye). <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">Emergencies</ulink> can feel<anchor id="ch0022-Page_153"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="153"/>very clinical and uncaring even when veterinary teams try their best to create a calm, gentle setting. It’s possible that the veterinarian may decide to forego sedation during euthanasia if the pet’s condition is critical (e.g. struggling to breathe). If an <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> euthanasia has to be conducted, proceeding at home may be the best option to fulfill some important wishes of caregivers.</para>

      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0011">Home tends to be quieter than hospitals and as a general rule, loved ones are more present, including other family pets<citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0008</citation>. Animal hospice euthanasia is often conducted in the home, including during <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergencies</ulink> of all kinds. There are a few key differences from in‐clinic euthanasia, the first being the absence of backup supplies and available personnel. Animal hospice providers will need to bring all necessary items to the home, plus extras in case complications arise. <ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 11</ulink> will describe home euthanasia preparedness in more detail.</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0012">Companion animal euthanasia is defined as the proper use of techniques to end the life of an animal with minimal to no <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> or anxiety, best facilitated through the use of sedatives/anesthetics, that allows the informed pet owner to remain present for the entirety of the procedure<citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0009</citation>. The definition has evolved over the years to include more of the caregiver’s perspective and not just the medical act itself, although this remains at the heart of the definition. It starts by considering what is best for the patient’s welfare during euthanasia, focusing on the need to avoid <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, and even fear in the final moments of life. Caregivers want their pets to be peaceful during every part of the process, especially when euthanasia is part of the hospice journey and the human–animal bond (HAB) is strong. The definition also includes the use of sedatives/anesthetics <anchor id="ch0022-Page_154"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="154"/>that will cause the pet to be either deeply relaxed or sleeping. This pre‐euthanasia sleep has gained popularity in recent years and is now advocated for by groups such as the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), the Fear Free Program, and the Companion Animal Euthanasia Training Academy (CAETA).</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0013">The absence or presence of dysthanasia, the opposite of euthanasia, is determined by those who are present during the appointment. Dysthanasia is a highly subjective impression of how well things went for the patient. Medically speaking, dysthanasia only occurs if the patient has a difficult death, with obvious <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> and distress. Caregivers will find this very upsetting and be understandably unhappy or even angry with the veterinary staff. Beyond the medical procedure, dysthanasia may include the refusal of caregiver involvement, especially when they wanted to be present. They may rationalize that their pet’s death was more difficult without them present to offer love and comfort. Caregivers may feel their pet was alone and afraid. Dysthanasia is preventable by focusing on what leads to the safest and most comfortable experience for both the patient and the owner.</para>

      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0019">Privacy before and after death is a component of euthanasia that has been offered to many caregivers over the years. Providing time alone with the pet is important to some, but not all. The goal is to offer privacy to everyone and let them decide if it’s necessary. Just before the patient is ready for the euthanasia injection/method, technicians may offer privacy by asking, “He/she is ready now for the next medicine to be given to help them to pass. Would you like some private time before we proceed?” This is a gentle way of giving the choice for some alone time and informing them that their pet is ready for euthanasia itself. After the pet has passed, the caregiver may be asked if they want more private time with their now deceased pet before they depart. If time is limited, this author advocates for ensuring the caregiver has privacy after death to help them process the reality of their pet’s passing. Spending time with their deceased pet is important to many people (see<link linkend="ch0022-c10-fig-0003">Figure 10.3</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0033">Depending on the region and regulatory context, it may be permissible for a technician to perform the euthanasia procedure itself under the direction of a veterinarian, either to administer the euthanasia solution or use other physical methods to achieve patient death. Technicians who are properly trained in the complete medical act of euthanasia are highly valuable to the veterinary team and can reduce suffering in animal patients, especially in times of crisis. Even in regions and situations where this is permitted, the attending veterinarian will still need to decide if the technician is suitable to help the patient. There may be times when the veterinarian feels they themselves should be the one to proceed.</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0034">Technicians may learn the same medical skills needed for euthanasia as veterinarians. Skilled technicians can calculate drug doses and assess the patient’s signalment to determine the best euthanasia method. Thats said, it is preferable for technicians to follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) or clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) approved by the veterinarians in charge of patient care. For example, technicians know ahead of the appointment that feline patients in their practice are preferentially euthanized via the intrarenal injection method in their animal hospice service. When preparing for feline euthanasia, they will give the required pre‐euthanasia anesthetics to induce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6231">unconsciousness</ulink>, then administer the proper dose of euthanasia solution into the kidney. When working with canine patients, the SOP may state that an indwelling intravenous catheter should be placed before the administration of the euthanasia solution, and the technician complies. Standard guidelines might require them to auscultate the heart for 30 seconds to verify death, etc. Technicians will be held accountable for tracking drugs used, writing notes in the medical records, and other post‐appointment tasks.</para>

         <beginpage pagenum="160"/>Technicians may be able to perform euthanasia without an attending veterinarian on the premises as long as it is on the orders of a veterinarian. When this occurs, the technician will want clear instructions on how to proceed, what equipment and supplies to have ready, and who to contact if issues arise. At least one veterinarian on the hospice team should be reachable during such a euthanasia to address <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> questions and triage the situation. If the caregiver decides not to proceed with euthanasia, the technician will comply and stop the euthanasia procedure.</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0036">There will be instances when a technician disagrees with the veterinarian’s decision to euthanize a patient. There are many factors a veterinarian must consider and not everything will be discussed with the technician.

When caregivers are present, veterinarians will take the <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> on all decision‐making and communications around euthanasia. Technicians may suggest alternative options to the veterinarian in private and are encouraged to do so if they have a realistic, attainable substitution to euthanasia. When in conversation with a caregiver who is expressing concerns about the euthanasia decision, the technician can excuse themselves and seek out the veterinarian. The technician’s role is to support the caregiver and veterinarian without directly influencing the decision to euthanize.

      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0040">Talking about euthanasia and death can be a difficult part of veterinary medicine. Veterinarians find it more challenging to discuss euthanasia with caregivers than to perform the procedure<citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0006</citation>. Veterinary technicians are expected to discuss various parts of euthanasia with caregivers, sometimes with veterinarians in the room but often on their own. In animal hospice work, euthanasia conversations are a regular part of the job and can be very rewarding. Knowing what to say and how to say it builds confident technicians and is a key factor in job satisfaction.</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0041">When preparing to talk with caregivers about euthanasia, technicians will want to reflect on the goals of the conversation. As mentioned, it can be difficult for veterinary personnel to have such serious life‐changing discussions with caregivers, and it’s expected that it will be scary for the caregiver too. The number one thing caregivers want to learn from the veterinary team is that euthanasia is the right choice<citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0012</citation>. They seek validation in their decision to euthanize their pet, and this therefore should become part of the conversation, either said aloud or as a subtheme supported by other compassionate statements. Euthanasia decision‐making was discussed in <ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 8</ulink>. The focus of this section is practical communication tools and language the technician may apply in euthanasia‐related communication (<link linkend="ch0022-c10-fea-0003">Communication Corner 10.3</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0042">CAETA has developed the seven habits of good death dialogue (see<link linkend="ch0022-c10-tbl-0003">Table 10.3</link>) to aid veterinary teams during the euthanasia appointment. The habits are designed to be used by all team members before, during, and after euthanasia to support the conversation goals listed above. For technicians, these will hopefully become second nature and easy to maintain during every appointment.</para>
      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0043">To illustrate these seven habits, we will consider the steps a technician may take to effectively communicate during a sample euthanasia appointment. Linus, a canine patient, is being euthanized at the hospital due to old age and frailty. The caregivers have arrived with Linus and have settled into the euthanasia room. The technician enters to start the appointment.</para>

Silence within a conversation can feel unnatural and <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> many to want to fill the space with talking. However, too much talking can feel overwhelming to grieving caregivers who are trying to process a lot of information<citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0013</citation>. Taking a pause in the conversation offers everyone a chance to reset and think about what they want for Linus. It is about letting the moment breathe a bit. Finding comfort with silence takes practice. A good way to start is for technicians to take deep breaths during the appointment.</para>

      <para>Building a trusting relationship during the euthanasia experience requires some level of partnership between the veterinary team, the caregiver, and the patient. Conversations with caregivers include words that convey togetherness rather than separation.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0022-head-3-108"/>
      <para>People take years, or entire lifetimes, to master emotional intelligence (EI), but with even a little attention given to it, a technician’s ability to support pet patients and families during euthanasia is limitless. There are five main components to EI: self‐awareness, motivation, empathy, social skills, and self‐regulation. Technicians with strong EI will be better prepared to navigate their feelings and the emotions of caregivers, leading to increased resiliency in animal hospice and euthanasia work.</para>

      <para id="ch0022-c10-para-0094">What is said before, during, and after euthanasia is best recorded in patient medical records. Veterinary medical records usually include some parts of the euthanasia discussion, but details tend to be lacking<citation>ch0022-c10-bib-0014</citation>. Technicians have the skills to capture important discussion details in medical records for future review by the whole team. Such details include caregivers’ psychosocial factors around euthanasia (e.g. previous experiences, concerns) and anything they share related to preplanning expectations. The technician will record the veterinarian’s perspective on such things as timing for euthanasia, options beyond euthanasia (palliative care), and details related to the procedure after it’s complete. The goal is to increase the amount of information entered into medical records to improve patient care and standardization of protocols (<link linkend="ch0022-c10-tbl-0004">Table 10.4</link>).</para>
