      <title>8.1 Introduction</title>
      <anchor id="ch0019-head-2-92"/>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0002">One of the most frequently asked questions to veterinary technicians in end‐of‐life (EOL) care is, “When is the right time for euthanasia?.” Caregivers of companion animals want to avoid making this decision “too early” when they could still have good quality time with their pet, but they also want to avoid making this decision “too late” when they could have spared their pet from unnecessary distress. A carefully considered decision where caregivers have a sense of control reduces the likelihood of decisional regret, which in turn supports a healthier grief process [<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0001</citation>, <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0002</citation>]. The reality is that there is no perfect “right” time. We must shift the perspective toward making the best or most reasonable decision for the family and the pet within their unique circumstances.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0003">The discussion of euthanasia timing is becoming more complex as continued advances in diagnostics and treatment are made available and hospice‐supported natural death becomes more common. Decision‐making frameworks must balance caregiver considerations and animal welfare<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0003</citation> with a focus on quality of life (QOL) rather than longevity <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0004</citation>. Advising caregivers on EOL decisions is ultimately within the scope of the veterinarian. Euthanasia is a treatment that must be prescribed, and hospice‐supported natural death also requires veterinary supervision. With that said, veterinary technicians have important roles in EOL decision‐making, including caregiver education and communication, patient assessment, and liaising with the veterinarian and other members of the EOL care team. The involvement of knowledgeable and compassionate technicians in EOL decision‐making is invaluable for both the caregivers and the veterinary team.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0004">Participation in EOL decision‐making is stressful for the veterinary team and is in fact reported to be more stressful than the euthanasia procedure itself<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0005</citation>. This <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> can be reduced using an ethical approach, seeking further information, and exchanging ideas and support with colleagues. The goal of ethical EOL decision‐making is for the caregiver to arrive at a decision that supports animal welfare within the reality of their circumstances, and one they may reflect on in the future without regret. Veterinary team members can consider their job well done if caregivers feel they have made the best possible informed decision at the best time they could have made it.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0005">This chapter will discuss caregiver perspectives on EOL decision‐making, factors for the medical team to consider, communication guidance for the veterinary technician, and ethical dilemmas<anchor id="ch0019-Page_124"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="124"/>that may be encountered. Technicians must be sensitive to caregivers’ values, culture, and religious considerations, which may shape their perspectives on euthanasia and natural death. Hospice‐supported natural death is currently less common than euthanasia in companion animal EOL care, but it is possible and should be explored in discussion if the caregiver wishes. <ulink url="ch0020">Chapter 9</ulink> examines hospice‐supported natural death in more detail.</para>

      <title>8.2 Communication in EOL Decision‐Making</title>
      <anchor id="ch0019-head-2-93"/>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0006">Approaches to supporting EOL decision‐making range from paternalistic (the veterinarian provides their preferred course of action) to hands‐off (the veterinarian provides the facts only and it is up to the caregiver to make the decision). Between these two extremes are various forms of shared decision‐making, where the veterinary team partners with the caregiver to formulate a mutually agreed‐upon plan.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0007">The paternalistic approach may unduly influence the caregiver and interfere with their autonomy in the decision‐making process. Caregivers may suppress concerns that could be decisive if the veterinary team pushes their own viewpoint without appropriately seeking the caregiver’s perspective<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0006</citation>. For example, if a caregiver wishes to discuss euthanasia as an option and the veterinarian is focused on offering treatment plans, the caregiver may feel guilt or judgement and refrain from asking for euthanasia. Veterinarian‐driven decision‐making may also be associated with feelings of blame if the caregivers experience regret about the actions taken. In failing to gather the caregiver’s perspective, the veterinary team misses valuable information on the animal’s history, routine, and preferences, as well as the caregiver’s psychosocial considerations (see <ulink url="ch0011">Chapter 1</ulink>), which may be pivotal in the decision.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0008">The “hands‐off,” facts‐only approach is where the veterinary team gives no indication of their preferred or recommended option. This could be argued as the only approach to truly autonomous decision‐making for the caregiver. However, if a purely factual approach is taken to advising caregivers on EOL decisions, they may not be able to determine which information is most important. Caregivers may need assistance in understanding the nuances and implications of the information. Interpretation of the facts by the veterinary team can provide crucial context for informed decision‐making. There is arguably no way for the veterinary team to avoid influencing decision‐making if they take care to thoroughly inform the caregiver. Thus, technicians should acknowledge that veterinary influence is an inherent part of the process and to try and be transparent and self‐aware.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0009">Most experts on ethical clinical communication will agree that some form of shared decision‐making is the best approach. Shared decision‐making elicits the caregiver’s perspective, confirms understanding, and negotiates a mutually agreed‐upon plan. This perspective allows veterinary professionals to act as guides and partners in the decision‐making process. Preferences for the type and depth of the veterinary team’s involvement in decision‐making will differ between individuals. Some will need more guidance and emotional support, and others will prefer less input. The caregivers may simply be asked how much involvement they would like from the veterinary team in their decision‐making.</para>

      <title>8.3 Caregiver Perspectives on EOL Decision‐Making</title>
      <anchor id="ch0019-head-2-94"/>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0010">Studies show that there is no consistent approach among veterinary teams in supporting euthanasia decision‐making. Not every caregiver feels empowered by their veterinary team or feels that their feelings and perspectives were effectively explored [<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0003</citation>, <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0007</citation>]. This demonstrates the <anchor id="ch0019-Page_125"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="125"/>importance of focusing on this component of EOL care as a priority for education, training and professional mentorship.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0011">A 2016 study of caregiver perspectives on EOL found that caregivers wanted involvement from the veterinary team in the euthanasia decision‐making process for two reasons. First, they did not feel equipped to assess their pet’s condition or the implications of treatment options on their own. Second, they did not want the burden of making the decision alone (<link linkend="ch0019-c8-fea-0001">Pro Tip 8.1</link>) <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0006</citation>. Caregivers in this study reported that veterinary teams aided them in several ways such as providing expert knowledge and a professional assessment of the animal’s physical status. They appreciated when the veterinary team provided context and interpretation of medical information, and support or confirmation for the decisions they were about to make. If a caregiver is leaning toward euthanasia, the veterinary team showing support or reluctance for this choice can influence the caregiver’s decision in a way that gives them more confidence (<link linkend="ch0019-c8-fea-0002">Communication Corner 8.1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0018">The highest predictor of a euthanasia decision aside from patient QOL is caregiver burden. Financial considerations also play a significant role in euthanasia decisions [<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0003</citation>, <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0008</citation>]. Caregivers find it easier to make euthanasia decisions when there are clear welfare concerns (animal suffering, inability to function, not happy, frequently symptomatic) and/or when there is a perceived exhaustion of treatment options (e.g. a dog with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2644">hemangiosarcoma</ulink> experiences major internal bleeding, or a cat with a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=732">brain tumor</ulink> is experiencing prolonged and frequent <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5444">seizures</ulink>) <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0006</citation>. Euthanasia decisions are more difficult for caregivers in cases of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">chronic illness</ulink> with a slow progression or <anchor id="ch0019-Page_126"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="126"/>fluctuating illness without clear endpoints identified (e.g. cognitive dysfunction, progressive decline in mobility due to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4463">osteoarthritis</ulink>, etc.) (see <link linkend="ch0019-c8-fea-0003">Pro Tip 8.2</link>). The influence and emotional support of the veterinary team is more impactful in circumstances where the family is unsure of the most ethical and appropriate decision for themselves and their pet <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0006</citation>.</para>

         <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0019">The perspectives and feelings of the family will change over time, as will the status of the animal and the context of the circumstances. If euthanasia has been discussed but delayed (by mutual agreement), it is important to revisit the discussion regularly. This ensures the veterinary team remains up to date and the family continues to feel supported.</para>

      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0020">Caregivers report that having more knowledge about their pet’s circumstances and disease(s) would improve their ability to make EOL decisions<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0006</citation>. Thus, a good recommendation for veterinary teams is to ensure caregivers are well‐informed about their pet’s diagnoses, status, and possible progression of disease. This sounds straightforward but can be complex. Caregivers may require time to absorb and process the information, especially if it was provided in a high‐<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> or emotional context (see <link linkend="ch0019-c8-fea-0007">Case Study 8.1</link>). Discussions may need to occur with multiple family members or caregivers, and alternative sources of information may be sought to aid in understanding. This is much easier in situations where a euthanasia decision is a future consideration rather than imminent. In situations where welfare concerns support an immediate decision, the veterinary <anchor id="ch0019-Page_127"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="127"/>team will make the utmost effort to tend to the animal’s comfort while ensuring the caregivers feel prepared to make an informed decision.</para>

         <title>Case Study 8.1 Timber, Evan, and Robyn</title>
         <anchor id="ch0019-head-2-98"/>
         <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0021">Dr. Bolton is a mobile hospice veterinarian who is called by a couple, Evan and Robyn, to request a home QOL evaluation of their 10‐year‐old husky, Timber. They took Timber to a general practice for an exam as they noticed he’d lost some weight. It seemed to them that he was doing fine otherwise, so they were shocked when the veterinarian told them that Timber was in poor condition and recommended euthanasia. With such devastating and unexpected news, Evan and Robyn were not ready to consent to euthanasia and asked to take Timber home. The veterinarian told them this was against medical advice and that they would be reported to the local humane society. They’ve called Dr. Bolton to help them understand what’s going on.</para>
         <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0022">Dr. Bolton agrees to evaluate Timber that day and is able to speak to the general practice veterinarian in advance. Timber has been given a presumptive diagnosis of cardiac <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2644">hemangiosarcoma</ulink> (suspicion of right atrial mass on ultrasound with pericardial effusion) with indicators of cardiovascular instability (muffled heart sounds, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10170">pulse</ulink> deficit) and emaciated body condition. The veterinarian stands by their recommendation for urgent euthanasia and is concerned about Timber’s welfare. They are relieved Dr. Bolton has become involved.</para>
         <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0023">On arrival at Timber’s home, Dr. Bolton is greeted by the couple and Timber. Timber is interactive and able to walk but is moving quite slowly and stiffly. Dr. Bolton takes a few minutes to establish a rapport with Timber, Evan, and Robyn and confirm the recent history, but moves quickly to assess Timber. The exam findings include pale pink mucous membranes, muffled heart sounds, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5832">tachycardia</ulink>, peripheral <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10170">pulse</ulink> deficits, a palpable splenic mass, and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1744">emaciation</ulink>. Despite this, Timber is still interested in affection and moves about the room.</para>
         <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0024">Dr. Bolton explains that their findings match that of the other veterinarian, and the presence of a palpable splenic mass along with the cardiovascular signs would correspond with a primary differential of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2644">hemangiosarcoma</ulink> with pericardial effusion. Together, they discuss the reality of Timber’s cardiovascular instability and the poor long‐term prognosis associated with the likely diagnosis. The options for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> intervention (<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> pericardiocentesis) and stabilization at an <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> center are discussed, as well as home euthanasia.</para>

A home euthanasia is scheduled, and Dr. Bolton is able to report to the humane society and resolve the case file.</para>

      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0028">Caregivers have trouble making EOL decisions when they have conflicting concerns. While finances are a common cause of internal conflict for caregivers, it may arise for multiple other reasons as well. Caregivers may struggle to decide whether the benefits of a proposed treatment plan outweigh any potential <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> it may cause the pet (e.g. <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> surgery, oncology treatments, hospitalization, etc.). In circumstances where the need for humane euthanasia is approaching, caregivers may try to delay the decision because it is too emotionally difficult (see<link linkend="ch0019-c8-fea-0004">Communication Corner 8.2</link>). Guilt is another source of internal conflict for caregivers, particularly when it comes to considering their own QOL and caregiver burden in decision‐making.

      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0031">Making the best possible decision within each situation is challenging due to the number of factors to consider. Building an exact “roadmap” for EOL decisions is impossible, but veterinarians can carefully consider euthanasia decisions in part by referring to scientific definitions of animal welfare<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0009</citation>. Technicians supporting EOL conversations should consider whether an animal is functioning well, feeling well, and expressing behaviors normal for their species (or that individual). The American Veterinary Medical Association suggests that a euthanasia decision may be made when the animal is deemed to no longer have a “life worth living” <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0009</citation>. When an animal’s negative experiences outweigh their positive experiences, the decision to provide a good death with euthanasia is warranted.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0032">While an animal’s health status and welfare are the highest priorities in decision‐making, they are not the only considerations. The caregiver’s situation must also be considered<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0002</citation>. A framework for ethical clinical decision‐making that is commonly used in human medicine is the “four topics” or four‐box method <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0010</citation>. The four topics are: medical indications, caregiver and patient preferences, quality of life, and contextual features.

For instance, if a caregiver hates the idea of having to rush into a 24‐hour veterinary hospital for an <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> euthanasia, they may choose to euthanize before it would be absolutely medically necessary in order to have control over the circumstances.

This may similarly motivate a decision to plan euthanasia earlier than is medically necessary to fulfill this vision. Other caregivers may be less concerned about the circumstances and timing of euthanasia and wish instead to focus on whatever quality time they can spend with their pet until QOL changes necessitate an EOL decision. Understanding the caregivers’ concerns and values allow EOL care teams to plan and provide supports to realize their vision for their pet’s transition. Technicians may be able to help caregivers plan a more beautiful goodbye than they realized was possible. For example, not all caregivers are aware that home euthanasia is possible and that alone may completely change their decision making. A family may be concerned about a sudden decline at home and plan an early euthanasia until a technician mentions the concept of a comfort kit and offers information on home euthanasia (see <link linkend="ch0019-c8-fea-0006">Pro Tip 8.4</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0073">The topic of hospice‐supported natural death will be discussed in more detail in<ulink url="ch0020">Chapter 9</ulink>, but is important to consider in the context of EOL decision‐making. Families who wish to explore this option deserve the same level of information, discussion, and support as any family requesting euthanasia. Veterinary teams not comfortable with providing hospice‐supported natural death due to a lack of knowledge and experience should share this with families but still aim to support their discussion. They may wish to refer caregivers requesting this option to a certified hospice and palliative veterinarian or a mobile veterinary service that focuses on EOL care.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0074">Even if your practice is not familiar or comfortable with supervising hospice‐supported natural death, it is worth knowing something about it so that you can help educate caregivers. In the context of ethical EOL decision‐making, natural death must be supported by palliative care. If supporting a natural death is preferred over euthanasia, this must be done with veterinary guidance to ensure that the animal’s welfare is effectively attended to throughout the dying process.<anchor id="ch0019-Page_132"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="132"/>This includes multi‐modal analgesia, clinical sign relief, general comfort nursing care, and possible palliative sedation.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0075">Proper provision of hospice‐supported natural death requires significant knowledge and team caregiving efforts (potentially 24/7 in the final days). This can be logistically challenging and expensive. Hospice‐supported natural death may not be available in all areas to all caregivers due to a lack of knowledgeable and trained veterinary providers. Even where veterinary providers are available, it may not be reasonable for caregivers to financially commit to the nursing care and veterinary supervision required. There is often a mismatch between a family’s desires for their pet’s EOL care and the financial and logistical realities. It is recommended to provide detailed forecasting of the financial commitments associated with hospice‐supported natural death to best support effective decision‐making<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0012</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0076">Ethical provision of hospice‐supported natural death is accompanied by an agreement that euthanasia may still need to occur if the caregiving team is unable to effectively manage animal welfare. Veterinary teams offering hospice‐supported natural death must thoroughly communicate the realities and requirements of ethical natural death and have specifics regarding this in their informed consent documentation. Veterinary teams must also be prepared to terminate client relationships if they are not able to negotiate a mutually agreed‐upon ethical plan.

      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0077">Shared EOL decision‐making which respects caregiver autonomy is the recommended approach, but there is a potential conflict that can arise when caregiver autonomy and patient welfare are not fully aligned<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0006</citation>. Given that the animal cannot directly express their own wishes, the caregivers make decisions on their behalf. The veterinary team has an obligation to advocate on the patient’s behalf and for the patient’s welfare when participating in shared decision‐making. This can create tension when the veterinary team’s obligation to the caregiver and their obligation to the animal are in conflict, resulting in an ethical dilemma. Effective communication can hopefully expose and resolve conflicts gently <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0004</citation>, but ethical dilemmas may still arise despite a technician’s best efforts.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0078">Ethical dilemmas in EOL care cause <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> for technicians and can interfere with job satisfaction and well‐being. Many veterinarians face ethical dilemmas weekly, with 34% reporting they faced 3–5 per week and 19% reporting daily ethical dilemmas [<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0013</citation>, <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0014</citation>]. The most common ethical dilemmas around euthanasia involve finances, where veterinary teams report performing euthanasia based primarily on financial limitations somewhere between once monthly and once weekly <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0014</citation>. Teams may also face dilemmas involving caregivers wishing to continue treatment despite poor animal welfare.</para>
      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0079">Ethical dilemmas in EOL care outside of finances generally fall into two categories: 1) caregivers wishing to euthanize an animal when it is not deemed medically appropriate, and 2) caregivers declining to euthanize an animal when it is deemed medically necessary to prevent unnecessary suffering<citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0002</citation>. In the first case, the veterinarian has an ethical obligation to prevent unnecessary animal distress. They may need to push for an EOL decision even if the caregiver is not ready. A veterinarian cannot force a caregiver to proceed with euthanasia (although they could consider reporting an owner to local authorities if the situation warranted this). The second type of dilemma allows the veterinarian the opportunity to decline to perform euthanasia if they feel <anchor id="ch0019-Page_133"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="133"/>this is the most ethical response. Eighty percent of veterinarians report declining to perform euthanasia at some point in their career <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0014</citation>, but this is infrequent overall <citation>ch0019-c8-bib-0015</citation>. It is important to acknowledge that everyone’s circumstances are different, and we can never be fully informed about another’s context for their decision‐making. The decisions we will make for ourselves will often differ from those made by others in similar situations. Decisions that differ from your own opinions are not necessarily unethical. The general public lacks the knowledge, skills, and access to care that veterinary professionals possess, making it difficult to compare our decision‐making to that of the caregivers we advise. What seems ethical to one individual may not be perceived as ethically acceptable by another.</para>

      <para id="ch0019-c8-para-0088">An example was previously given of a cat with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3296">kidney disease</ulink> in hospice care whose family is moving internationally in two months. They may choose to euthanize before it would be strictly medically necessary to spare the cat the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> of travel and adjustment to a new home. This is a very different situation from one where the cat was healthy, and the family decided it would be too expensive and stressful for the cat to travel. If they were asking for euthanasia in this circumstance, this would present more of an ethical dilemma as a convenience euthanasia. It was previously mentioned that the majority of veterinarians have declined to perform euthanasia at some point in their career, although it is rare within a given professional’s experience. Convenience euthanasia of a healthy animal, or an animal with a good prognosis is likely when these refusals occur.</para>
