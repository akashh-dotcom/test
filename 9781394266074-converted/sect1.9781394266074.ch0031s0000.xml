      <para id="ch0031-c17-para-0003">Veterinary technicians are considered caregiving professionals, and the emotional impact of caregiving professions has been increasingly explored throughout the last few decades. In the early 1990s, researchers sought to better understand why frontline healthcare professionals and service providers were exhibiting symptoms of post‐traumatic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> disorder (PTSD) without having experienced a traumatic event first‐hand. As a result of their findings, they coined the term<emphasis role="strong">

         <citation>ch0031-c17-bib-0001</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0031-c17-para-0004">Compassion <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2103">fatigue</ulink> is often a result of work‐related <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, more specifically the psychological distress that happens when the worker is exposed to the suffering of others<citation>ch0031-c17-bib-0001</citation>. As time goes on and understanding of this subject evolves, the language is changing too. In this chapter, the phrase <emphasis role="strong">
            <emphasis>empathic strain</emphasis>
         </emphasis> (ES) will be used instead of compassion <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2103">fatigue</ulink>. This shift in terminology is due to emerging research that suggests empathic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5669">strain</ulink> more accurately describes what caregiving professionals experience because of their jobs <citation>ch0031-c17-bib-0002</citation>. The term compassion <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2103">fatigue</ulink> implies that a professional can no longer provide the compassionate care required for their job role. In reality, caregiving professionals do not run out of compassion! What they might really be struggling with is providing empathy.</para>

      <para id="ch0031-c17-para-0005">As discussed in<ulink url="ch0017">Chapter 6</ulink>, empathy is to feel what another person feels. It involves actively resonating with another being's feelings to understand their perspective. Providing empathy is offering comfort on a deeper level; it is what establishes a connection between the helper and who they help <citation>ch0031-c17-bib-0002</citation>. Empathy allows technicians to relate to and share in their clients' and patients’ experiences <citation>ch0031-c17-bib-0002</citation>. When a technician can empathize with who they are helping, they can provide compassionate care (<link linkend="ch0031-c17-fig-0001">Figure 17.1</link>).</para>

This emotional entanglement can blur the lines between their own feelings and those of the patients or clients they are caring for <citation>ch0031-c17-bib-0002</citation>. As a result, it can become difficult for them to emotionally detach from their work, potentially affecting their mental well‐being and their ability to effectively engage with both clients and patients.</para>

Over the past several months, she has gotten to know the Browns and their cat, Muffy. Muffy presented to the clinic with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1400">dehydration</ulink> and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6651">weight loss</ulink>. The veterinarian diagnosed Muffy with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9688">diabetes</ulink> and prescribed <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=11569">insulin</ulink> and a diet change. Emily educated the Browns on Muffy's <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=11569">insulin</ulink> injections and the new feeding schedule that would help Muffy maintain steady <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13529">glucose</ulink> levels. The Browns and Emily were in touch regularly, especially in the early days of Muffy's diagnosis. Despite their efforts, Muffy's <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13529">glucose</ulink> was erratic. After many changes in <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=11569">insulin</ulink> dosing the veterinarian recommended a more expensive, but hopefully more effective type of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=11569">insulin</ulink>. The Browns expressed their concern about the cost of the <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=11569">insulin</ulink> and decided to euthanize Muffy.</para>
         <para>Emily assists with Muffy's euthanasia, but as she is caring for Muffy's remains, she feels a mix of anger and helplessness. Why couldn't the Browns have tried another drug? Was this her fault? Had she, Emily, done enough to educate the family about Muffy's needs? Should she have offered to take the cat in herself rather than allow her to be euthanized? When she voices some of these thoughts to her colleagues, they tell her that events like this are all part of working in veterinary medicine, and she'll just have to get used to it.</para>

Self‐awareness can be enhanced through the practice of self‐care, but self‐care extends beyond temporary relaxation and requires a holistic approach.

However, veterinary organizations must also create spaces where staff can do this effectively. The onus for preventing and mitigating ES does not fall solely on the technician, it must be reinforced by their workspaces. Organizations that put effort into a healthy, cohesive workplace are creating a positive culture for their staff, which can help with staff retention, client engagement, patient care, and improved business practices. This chapter does not have the scope to deep dive into the larger systemic issues that are deeply rooted in veterinary medicine and have a massive impact on the mental health and well‐being of its professionals. There is much work to do to competently address these systems and create healthy and safe spaces for the people working within them.

Technicians can act as advocates for the development of these initiatives. A psychologically healthy veterinary practice is one where employees feel genuinely heard, their insights are valued and taken seriously, and they receive strong support for both their mental and physical well‐being. Practices that provide opportunities for the development of both clinical and communication skills are creating a work environment where professional growth and personal well‐being are prioritized. Leadership should ask themselves the following question: can employees ask questions, give feedback, and express concerns without fear of being humiliated, talked down to, or punished? If not, the workplace isn't psychologically safe. Employees should know that they will receive mutual trust, respect, and support from their team and leadership.</para>

EAPs and employee benefits are valuable resources that help individuals deal with issues affecting their job performance, health, or mental well‐being. Easy access to counseling services is important so that staff can address concerns related to emotional <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. Support from leadership and senior management is key to raising awareness and encouraging the use of these resources. Furthermore, regular team meetings that allow everyone to share their thoughts provide technicians with opportunities to participate in decision‐making and shape workplace culture (<link linkend="ch0031-c17-fig-0004">Figure 17.4</link>). Managers should also review the workday structure, including hours worked, breaks, and vacation time. When leadership reinforces boundaries and encourages breaks, it helps the team manage heavy workloads and long hours. Leadership and technicians can visit the websites of their regional associations such as the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association and American Veterinary Medical Association to learn more about how to implement psychological health and safety in the workplace.</para>

      <para id="ch0031-c17-para-0033">For an organization to address ES, it’s important to have clear policies and protocols on EOL care. A policy is a guideline that outlines a course of action, while a protocol provides specific steps to follow in certain situations. These tools are valuable because they help improve and inform clinical practice and communication during high‐<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> situations<citation>ch0031-c17-bib-0011</citation>. Policies and protocols that emphasize respect and dignity in EOL care give technicians and other staff clear instructions for actions to take in difficult situations, which can reduce anxiety in these scenarios. Policies and procedures that reflect the team’s values and professional regulations provide guidance in decision‐making. For example, practices should consider having guidelines for ethically challenging and emotional cases such as behavioral euthanasia, reporting animal cruelty/abuse, and client safety concerns like suicide. These policies and procedures can be essential for the safety of the veterinary team, clients, and patients.</para>
