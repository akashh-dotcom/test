      <anchor id="ch0018-head-2-77"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0002">Communication is an essential skill for veterinary technicians involved in companion animal end‐of‐life (EOL) care, which can be learned and developed through active practice (see<ulink url="ch0017">Chapter 6</ulink>). The elements of successful communication apply to all situations veterinary technicians encounter, but some situations that involve high stakes or differing opinions result in elevated emotional responses on the part of both the clients and the veterinary team <citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0001</citation>. Many of the conversations involved in EOL care would be considered “difficult.” A difficult conversation can generally be classified as a conversation involving sensitive, emotion‐inducing topics which may cause discomfort or conflict among participants. When caregivers or members of the veterinary team are experiencing grief, anger, guilt, or other disruptive emotions during EOL care, this may interfere with effective communication. Strategic use of core communication skills will help technicians navigate these conversations clearly and confidently. These skills include nonverbal behaviors, asking questions, active listening, and showing empathy. This chapter will demonstrate how to apply these communication techniques to various challenging scenarios.</para>

      <title>7.2 Difficult Clients vs Difficult Situations</title>
      <anchor id="ch0018-head-2-78"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0003">It can be tempting to label clients experiencing strong emotional responses or disagreement with the veterinary team as “difficult.” Caregivers may at times be judged by veterinary team members as ignorant, neglectful, demanding, or cheap<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0002</citation>. These labels dismiss the unique perspectives of the caregivers and have significant impact on the team’s capacity to feel and demonstrate empathy. Rather than viewing caregivers as difficult, technicians may shift their perspective to consider the situation as difficult (see <link linkend="ch0018-c7-fea-0001">Case Study 7.1</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0004">Andy is a long‐time client of <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> regular veterinary clinic. He has brought in his 19‐year‐old cat, Fozzie, for euthanasia. As the technician, Maya, discusses the cost of the procedure, Andy becomes visibly upset. His face red, he says loudly, “I’ve been bringing Fozzie here for his whole life and I’ve probably spent enough to pay for that new addition you got last year. You mean to tell me you charge that much to put her down? That’s ridiculous!”</para>
         <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0005">Maya does her best to calm Andy but leaves the interaction feeling very shocked and upset. She seeks out Brandon, a more experienced technician, to share her feelings. “I always thought Andy was a nice guy. I had no idea he was so cheap! He didn’t have to be such a jerk.”</para>
         <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0006">Brandon thoughtfully replies, “It sounds like Andy’s anger really caught you off guard. Andy has been coming here for a long time, and he is a really nice guy. He and Fozzie have had a very special relationship and I’m sure Andy is really struggling with saying good‐bye. He’s been paying a lot for Fozzie’s medication for at least a year as well. It’s a really tough situation.”</para>
         <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0007">Maya listens thoughtfully to Brandon and responds, “You’re right, I shouldn’t have been so quick to call him cheap. He’s always done everything we recommend for Fozzie. I shouldn’t have judged him like that for just one bad experience. I know how hard it is to say good‐bye.”</para>

      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0009">In addition to the skills discussed in<ulink url="ch0017">Chapter 6</ulink>, there are two communication tools which can be especially helpful in difficult conversations: partnership statements and warning shots.</para>

      <title>7.3.1 Partnership Statements</title>
      <anchor id="ch0018-head-3-63"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0010">It is common for the caregivers of EOL pets to feel that their situation is out of their control, leaving them overwhelmed and feeling helpless. The technician can affirm that the caregiver is an essential part of the EOL care team by creating a sense of partnership. Collaborative partnership statements begin with terms such as “We,” “You and I,” “As a team,” or “Together”<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0001</citation>. For example, “Together we can create a plan to help Snowball feel more comfortable at home.”</para>

      <title>7.3.2 Warning Shots</title>
      <anchor id="ch0018-head-3-64"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0011">EOL conversations often involve the delivery of information that may be upsetting. In these instances a “warning shot” is used to alert the caregiver that there is something difficult to discuss, allowing them time to mentally prepare<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0001</citation>. Examples of warning shots include: “I have something to share that may be distressing for you to hear,” “We need to talk about the changes in Muffin’s condition,” or “I’m afraid I have some bad news today.” Warning shots should always be followed by a pause to allow the client to respond.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0018-head-2-81"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0012">Although each EOL scenario is unique and should be treated as such, it is helpful to have a general plan for how to approach these conversations. The SPIKES model was originally developed for human physicians delivering bad news, and it can be used successfully in veterinary medicine as well [<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0003</citation>–<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0005</citation>]. The steps of the SPIKES approach are setting, perspective, invitation, knowledge, empathize, summarize, and strategize. They are explained in detail below with identification of the communication skills needed during each part of the process.</para>

      <title>7.4.1 Setting</title>
      <anchor id="ch0018-head-3-65"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0013">Consider where EOL conversations will take place. Ideally practices should have a designated “comfort room” designed to promote calm, open communication. Comfort rooms typically are quiet, private spaces with comfortable furniture and adjustable lighting. More information about comfort room design can be found in<ulink url="ch0023">Chapters 11</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0029">16</ulink>.</para>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0014">Consider who should be present for the conversation<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0004</citation>. For example, a distressed caregiver who is alone may wish to invite additional support, while a client with caregiver may not want them included in the conversation.</para>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0015">Establish rapport at the beginning of the conversation. Use open questioning techniques to determine how the caregiver is feeling, followed by reflective statements, and empathy. Acknowledging the difficult nature of the conversation up front can help people feel more at ease<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0005</citation>.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0018-head-3-66"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0016">Before providing medical information or guidance in any decision‐making process, it is important to elicit the client’s perspective. Asking open questions allows the client to share their knowledge of the current situation and their goals of care moving forward<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0003</citation>. For example, “How is Rex doing now?” and “What concerns do you have?”</para>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0017">It is important to determine how much information the client wants to receive. Some detail‐oriented clients will benefit from a thorough discussion of options, while others prefer a big‐picture approach with just enough information to help them make informed decisions. Technicians can determine this preference with a question like, “At times like this, some people prefer to know all the details while others prefer a broader outline. Which would you prefer?” [<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0003</citation>, <citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0004</citation>].</para>

      <anchor id="ch0018-head-3-67"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0018">The technician ensures they are invited to share difficult information by asking for permission from the caregiver [<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0004</citation>, <citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0005</citation>]. This follows smoothly from assessing the level of detail the caregiver wishes to receive, but it is often overlooked. Technicians may simply ask, “Is it alright if I share some information with you now?” Doing so allows the caregiver the opportunity to confirm if they are ready to move forward in the conversation.</para>

      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0019">Once the caregiver gives their permission, the technician can proceed to share their knowledge as appropriate to the situation. Although it was originally developed to help with the delivery of bad news, the SPIKES model is appropriate for conversations at all stages of EOL care. This may<anchor id="ch0018-Page_110"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="110"/>include information about hospice and palliative care options, quality of life or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> assessment, education on treatment administration, or EOL planning.</para>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0020">Provide information in short, easily understandable statements, or “chunks.” Follow new information with questions like “What questions do you have about what you’ve heard so far?” or “What are your thoughts about what I’ve said?” These are “checks” to ensure the client’s needs are met and they are active partners in the conversation [<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0001</citation>, <citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0003</citation>]. This “chunk and check” method of information delivery is useful in many contexts and is especially helpful in EOL conversations when emotions may make it hard for clients to focus.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0018-head-3-69"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0021">Empathy must be demonstrated throughout difficult conversations, starting with rapport building as the setting is created. Use appropriate nonverbal behaviors, maintain compassionate eye contact, and verbalize empathy by acknowledging and supporting the clients' emotions (see<ulink url="ch0017">Chapter 6</ulink> for more information regarding empathy as a communication skill).</para>

      <anchor id="ch0018-head-3-70"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0022">The final step in the SPIKES model is to summarize the discussion and come to a shared decision on the path forward. Technicians can make suggestions and help the caregiver identify additional support systems as appropriate [<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0003</citation>, <citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0005</citation>]. For example, in the case of a QOL conversation, the technician would provide the selected QOL tools and set a plan for frequency of assessment and communication of those results to the veterinary team. Other examples of strategizing in EOL conversations would be the identification of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> care options and/or offering of grief support resources. Providing the client with written documentation and access to online resources will ensure they feel supported when they are ready to process additional information on their own.</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0018s9000-5">
      <title>7.5 Conflict Resolution</title>
      <anchor id="ch0018-head-2-82"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0023">Conflicts may arise during stressful, emotionally charged situations that are often a part of EOL care. This can include conflict among caregivers and other family members, between caregivers and the veterinary team, or among members of the veterinary team. Conflict develops when people perceive that someone else’s actions or beliefs will stop them from getting what they need or want for themselves<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0006</citation>. In EOL situations, conflict can occur when the caregiver's desires for their pet’s care are not in alignment with the options offered by the veterinary team, when caregivers or family have different opinions about the animal’s care, or when the cost of care is too expensive for their financial situation. Conflict can also occur within the veterinary team if there is disagreement about ethical <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10497">case management</ulink>. Further examples of conflict‐related conversations are found in Section 7.6.</para>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0024">Regardless of the cause, conflict can be damaging to the team‐based relationships needed for successful EOL care and this can impact patient care. Caregivers may lose trust in the veterinary team or even develop feelings of hostility. They may feel excluded from decision making and lose interest in working toward solutions<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0006</citation>. Successful, positive resolution of conflict improves patient outcomes and promotes trust and rapport in the veterinary–client relationship. It also safeguards the working environment and wellness of veterinary team members.</para>

      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0037">Anger is a complex emotional state that can be driven by a variety of underlying feelings such as sadness, fear, uncertainty, and guilt. Caregivers may become angry over financial concerns, disagreements, or poor communication with the veterinary team<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0008</citation>. Anger is also a natural part of the grieving process, which is discussed further in <ulink url="ch0027">Chapter 14</ulink>.

Although it is a common emotional response, the veterinary team may feel poorly equipped to effectively communicate with people demonstrating signs of anger <citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0002</citation>.

      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0052">The key to managing and reducing anger in others is to create a safe situation in which people can share their feelings without judgment. This may involve inviting the caregiver(s) to a private space such as an exam room if they are not already there<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0008</citation>. The space should promote comfortable, open communication through the availability of seating without barriers. Use open, positive nonverbal cues such as relaxed arms and calm eye contact and welcome the caregiver to share their perspective and listen closely without interruption. Let them “vent” until they are ready to stop on their own. Listen for cues that may indicate other emotions contributing to the anger as well as the caregiver's primary concerns. In many cases anger is the outward manifestation of other emotions.</para>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0053">Once the technician feels they have successfully identified the emotions and perspectives motivating the caregiver's anger, they can follow up with empathy and reflective listening. This should include paraphrasing to confirm they have successfully understood the caregiver's perspective<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0001</citation>. For example, “It sounds like you are angry because Freddie’s diagnosis has caught you off guard and you don’t feel your questions have been clearly answered.” Remember that acknowledging the person's feelings does not mean that the technician agrees with their perspective, only that they have identified it. Partnership statements play an important role in building rapport with angry caregivers. “Let’s work together to ensure you have all the information you need to make the best choices for Freddie.” It is hard to maintain anger against someone who is on your team, working with you to find solutions (see <link linkend="ch0018-c7-fea-0003">Pro Tip 7.1</link>).</para>

In addition, some caregivers may need to make EOL care decisions from a purely financial standpoint, which may cause moral distress for them and the veterinary team. The good news is that the core communication skills from<ulink url="ch0017">Chapter 6</ulink> and transparency about costs and the value of services will prevent most misunderstandings and conflict regarding finances.

      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0063">The availability of a wide variety of treatment options and the ethical and moral considerations within EOL care may result in disagreements within the veterinary team. There is rarely a right or wrong choice. Instead, decisions must be made with the goal of optimal outcomes for both the animal and caregivers in their unique circumstances. It is possible for technicians in these situations to disagree with the decisions made by veterinarians or other team members. Ultimately, medical recommendations are the responsibility of the veterinarian, but technicians can share valuable insights that will have an impact on these decisions. Often disagreement over medical decisions is related to a lack of sufficient knowledge and understanding of how the decision was reached. Using the techniques identified for conflict resolution, specifically a collaborative approach, will help these conversations proceed more smoothly.</para>
      <para>The power dynamic between a veterinarian and a veterinary technician can make these situations some of the most challenging to handle. In conflicts where there is a perceived power imbalance, many people fall back on the avoidance communication style out of fear of negative responses, including potentially being fired<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0012</citation>. Technicians may feel that their knowledge or opinions should not be shared when they do not align with those of the veterinarian. All the techniques discussed so far come into play when initiating a difficult conversation with a veterinarian or other colleague. Considering SPIKES with a special focus on conflict resolution will ensure technicians are prepared for open, respectful conversation.</para>

      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0071">There may be instances where technicians are asked to participate in activities which they feel go against their own personal moral code. An example would be the case of “convenience euthanasia,” when the decision to euthanize may not appear to be driven by the medical needs or best interests of the pet. While these situations are upsetting and can cause division within the veterinary team, maintaining an open and inquiring mind can help. It is not appropriate to question the veterinarian’s decision in front of caregivers, but technicians can and should respectfully ask for more information privately when they are being asked to perform a task they do not support. If there is not sufficient time to discuss the case, or an understanding cannot be reached that alleviates the technician’s concerns, it is possible to decline to participate. This must be done professionally and respectfully. “Based on the information I have, I’m not comfortable assisting with Timber’s euthanasia today.” Avoid making statements that judge the actions of the veterinarian or other team members and keep the focus on your own personal beliefs and feelings. An event like this requires follow‐up at a time when team members have the capacity to discuss it clearly and calmly. Approach these conversations like any other difficult conversation: Consider the elements of SPIKES and remain open minded and willing to hear the perspectives of others. It is hoped that this will be a rare situation. If a technician feels that their moral and ethical code is repeatedly challenged, it may be time to look for an environment more aligned with their beliefs.</para>

      <title>7.6.6 Disagreement Among Caregivers</title>
      <anchor id="ch0018-head-3-76"/>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0072">There are many decisions required during EOL care regarding palliative treatment options, humane euthanasia, supported‐natural death, body care, and memorialization. When a pet has multiple caregivers or family members involved in decision making, it is possible that disagreements will arise. Technicians may offer to help in situations where caregivers are divided in their opinions about the best path forward. Clients must be willing to participate in a conversation about the disagreement, so technicians will need to seek consent as an important first step. For example, “It sounds like there may be a disagreement about whether to give Sadie subcutaneous fluids. Would you both be willing to talk that through together with me?” This approach both identifies the issue and seeks permission to continue.</para>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0073">After permission is granted, begin by inviting the caregivers to share their thoughts in a calm manner, without interruption. For example, “Sue, why don’t you start by telling us how you feel, and when you are done Peter can share. We want to work together to make sure we all understand.” The use of partnership statements can reduce the feeling of adversity, reminding everyone they are working together as a team in the best interests of the pet. The technician’s role is to help clarify and summarize the perspectives of each caregiver and provide medical information as needed. When mediating conflict between caregivers, the technician must remain a neutral party at all times, regardless of their personal beliefs about the situation<citation>ch0018-c7-bib-0013</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0074">Use the active listening skills of reflective and summary statements to clarify each caregiver's perspective and ensure they feel they are being accurately heard and understood. Once the cause of the dispute is clear, a summary statement presenting both sides of the disagreement can be made. For example, “Based on what you’ve shared, Sue feels that subcutaneous fluids will provide Sadie with improved quality of life and prolong the time before a decision needs to be made about euthanasia. Peter is concerned that the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> of administering the fluids will actually reduce Sadie’s quality of life and damage the special bond you all share. Does that sound right?”</para>
      <para id="ch0018-c7-para-0075">Once the caregivers feel that their perspectives are clear, it is time to work toward a solution through finding common ground and proposing options that may work for both sides. Consider and validate the emotions of the caregivers while suggesting solutions that support the best care for the pet. For example, “At this point we haven’t tried to give Sadie subcutaneous fluids at all, so we don’t really know how stressful she will find the experience. Would you be open to us trying them once to see how she reacts to the procedure? That may help us reach a decision.” Ensure both participants have an opportunity to weigh in on proposed solutions and continue to adjust the plan until they have ideally reached agreement. Once a plan is agreed upon, review it once more and give a final opportunity for the caregivers to respond before implementing the plan. Remaining calm and impartial will help the caregivers work through their disagreement in an open and productive way (see<link linkend="ch0018-c7-fea-0006">Case Study 7.5</link>).</para>

When interactions do not go smoothly, it is important to spend some time on honest self‐reflection and consider if different communication strategies could work better in similar situations in the future. Soliciting feedback from other skilled communicators and bringing scenarios to communication rounds will also support growth and learning. Technicians should also recognize that it is possible to do everything “right” and still not have the desired outcome, because communication always involves other people!
