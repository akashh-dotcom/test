      <para id="ch0032-c18-para-0003">As the skills and knowledge of veterinary technicians become increasingly valued and more effectively utilized, their role in veterinary medicine is evolving. Optimal utilization of technicians promotes career advancement and leads to increased career satisfaction and decreased burnout<citation>ch0032-c18-bib-0001</citation>. Technicians looking for ways to grow their leadership skills and expand their role need look no further than veterinary end‐of‐life (EOL) care. Companion animal hospice and palliative care is a growing field with a rich community of experts. Whether you engage in EOL care within general practice, specialty or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> practice, or in a devoted hospice and palliative care service, there is much opportunity for both personal and professional growth. Technicians interested in further expanding their EOL care knowledge have many opportunities and resources to do so (see Table 18.1).</para>

      <para>Veterinary professionals who choose to focus their efforts on EOL care often consider it a calling. There is much reward to be found in supporting a peaceful and dignified EOL transition for companion animals and their loved ones. It is meaningful work that gives purpose. Pet caregivers seek professionals who prioritize a high standard of EOL care. This is often a defining moment for a veterinary–client relationship. Passionate technicians committed to lifelong learning can be forces of change, helping to advance the standard of EOL care wherever and however they work within veterinary medicine. There are many ways to advocate for the advancement of companion animal EOL care that benefits pets, families, and the veterinary teams serving them. Technicians can develop their own knowledge and then share it with their teams to improve skills and procedures involving many aspects of EOL care, such as:</para>

      <title>18.3 Business Considerations</title>
      <anchor id="ch0032-head-2-252"/>
      <para id="ch0032-c18-para-0034">If there is any hesitation from veterinary practice owners or administration to invest in education and improvement of EOL care, it can be easily argued that doing so is in the best interest of the business. Families that have a negative EOL care experience are not likely to return to that practice, and they are likely to deter others either by word of mouth or online review. Conversely, families that have a positive EOL experience tend to return to the practice with other pets and are vocal in their recommendations<anchor id="ch0032-Page_309"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="309"/>to others. A high quality of EOL care also supports job satisfaction for veterinary teams and reduces moral <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and empathic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5669">strain</ulink>. Investing in the advancement of EOL care knowledge, skills, and procedures is good business on multiple levels. Furthermore, veterinary practices interested in expanding into mobile EOL care can increase their ability to serve more clients and grow their reputation and revenue with minimal increase in overhead costs compared to expanding facilities.</para>
      <para id="ch0032-c18-para-0035">Managers and leaders within veterinary practices should work to establish procedures for effective recruitment and retention of team members who will contribute to a high standard of EOL care. Interviews should include discussion of EOL care experience, ethics, and philosophy. New team members should receive structured onboarding regarding EOL care procedures to ensure a consistent standard of care and minimize negative experiences for both clients and staff. The Companion Animal Euthanasia Training Academy has published a Veterinary Team Euthanasia Training Manual. This template can provide a good starting point for teams to review their EOL care procedures and approach to training.</para>

      <title>18.4 Veterinary Social Work</title>
      <anchor id="ch0032-head-2-253"/>
      <para id="ch0032-c18-para-0036">Any discussion of advancements in the standard of veterinary EOL care must include the important role of social work. Veterinary social workers (VSW) are valuable members of any veterinary team as they support both pet caregivers and families as well as veterinary professionals and staff themselves. In an era where there is an overwhelming demand for veterinary services, VSWs can help veterinary teams safeguard their wellness and take over some of the workload of supporting clients. VSWs can support much of the communication in EOL care by counselling caregivers in EOL decision‐making, EOL planning, and pet loss. They can also help connect families with further resources outside the veterinary practice. Having a VSW on staff is becoming more common at veterinary colleges and large hospitals, and we are likely to see this interdisciplinary team member becoming more integrated throughout veterinary medicine in the future.</para>

      <title>18.5 Specialization and Collaboration</title>
      <anchor id="ch0032-head-2-254"/>
      <para id="ch0032-c18-para-0037">As we look to the future, animal hospice and palliative care (AHPC) is likely to become a board‐certified veterinary specialty through the efforts of the International Association of Animal Hospice and Palliative Care (IAAHPC). Once this occurs, there would be an opportunity to establish a Veterinary Technician Specialty in AHPC. There is also potential for building connection and collaboration between human and veterinary hospice for the betterment of both. Human hospice and animal hospice have very different histories, as human EOL care has not involved medically assisted death until more recently. In contrast, hospice support of natural death in companion animals has been uncommon, with most EOL care historically involving euthanasia. As human and animal hospice converge, there are significant opportunities for collaboration and exchange of ideas between human and veterinary medicine.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0032-head-2-255"/>
      <para id="ch0032-c18-para-0038">Much of modern society is death‐denying, where death is not discussed until it must be, and the dying are moved to hospice centers or hospitals. The result is that death is not integrated into the fabric of daily life in many societies. This avoidance of death can be apparent in veterinary<anchor id="ch0032-Page_310"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="310"/>medicine, where discussion of EOL is left until close to the end rather than being addressed in a proactive manner. For example, quality of life (QOL) tools and conversations are generally not engaged until QOL is already a concern for the caregivers and the animal. What if QOL discussions were integrated into routine care well before the EOL? If so, caregivers would already be familiar with QOL concepts and methods of evaluation. They may notice changes in their pets sooner and seek support earlier, thus improving the QOL of their pets. QOL tools should be introduced early in a pet’s senior years or as soon as a terminal diagnosis is given, and arguably these concepts and tools would be valuable to present in routine wellness exams even earlier in life.</para>

      <para id="ch0032-c18-para-0039">There is much opportunity for research to support evidence‐based companion animal EOL care. Three main priorities for research have been identified: welfare and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> management in palliative care, defining characteristics of a “good death” for a given animal and caregiver, and effective approaches to caregiver support. This will require an interdisciplinary approach as there are medical, ethical, and social elements that must all be addressed<citation>ch0032-c18-bib-0002</citation>. Technicians can play a role in promoting and supporting research by creating connections with researchers in the field and encouraging their veterinary teams to take part in these valuable efforts.</para>
