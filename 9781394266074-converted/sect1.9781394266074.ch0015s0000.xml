      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0002">Quality of life (QOL) is an important concept in veterinary medicine, particularly in end‐of‐life (EOL) care. Quality of life is most often discussed in the context of EOL decisions, where veterinary technicians are asked “When is the right time to say goodbye?” Effective assessment of QOL supports informed decision‐making on the part of both caregivers and veterinary professionals. Caregivers are also interested in exploring a more holistic view of their pet’s wellbeing outside of EOL consultations<citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0001</citation>. They welcome QOL discussions early and often throughout their pet’s life. Technicians who facilitate these discussions improve the dynamic of the veterinary‐client‐patient relationship (VCPR) and create more opportunities for lifelong positive impacts on QOL.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0003">QOL is complex and goes far beyond physical health and an absence of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>. Its multifaceted nature is difficult to clearly and specifically define, and yet most would say that they have some sense of what it means<citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0002</citation>. While there is no standard definition that is universally accepted, there are common elements between most definitions. The International Association of Animal Hospice and Palliative Care (IAAHPC) bridges these common threads together to define QOL as “the total well‐being of an individual animal, taking into account the physical, social, and emotional components of the animal’s life” <citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0003</citation>. The World Health Organization defines QOL for people “as an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns” <citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0004</citation>. This raises the discussion that QOL is a subjective experience. How can we evaluate our companion animals’ subjective experience when they cannot communicate directly? We must rely on observations and physical assessments, which is a team effort involving family, caregivers, and veterinary professionals <citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0002</citation>. This chapter will explore the benefits and limitations of QOL assessments, the components that may be included, and examples of existing tools that may be utilized.</para>

      <title>5.2  Quality‐of‐Life Assessments</title>
      <anchor id="ch0015-head-2-52"/>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0004">The use of QOL assessments is more established in human medicine where they are found to facilitate communication and shared decision making, identify and prioritize problems, and monitor for changes or response to treatment<citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0005</citation>. The use of structured QOL assessments in veterinary medicine helps caregivers feel more involved in their pet’s care and improves communication with the veterinary team. This supports collaboration and shared decision making rather than a more paternalistic veterinary relationship. The use of QOL assessments in veterinary consultations leads to a perception of more individualized care and empowers caregivers to take a more active role in their pet’s care <citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0001</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0005">QOL assessments can be either disease‐specific or general/holistic. The majority of those published in peer reviewed literature are disease‐specific [<citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0002</citation>, <citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0006</citation>]. This specificity limits their use in animals with multiple disease processes and prevents their introduction into wellness care earlier in life. There is currently no <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14640">gold</ulink> standard against which veterinary QOL tools may be validated. Despite the availability of many assessments, there is much work yet to be done to develop and validate tools which can be relied upon in any situation <citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0002</citation>. Without <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14640">gold</ulink> standard, or validated tools that are broadly applicable, how can EOL care technicians approach QOL conversations? Firstly, a shift in perspective is helpful. Unvalidated tools can have significant value in supporting caregiver education and communication regarding QOL, including monitoring QOL at home. Some tools may be used as quantitative clinical measures, but caution should be used in interpreting the results. Caregivers should share and discuss the results of QOL assessments with a veterinary professional before making any decisions about medical care or euthanasia. EOL decisions should never be based entirely on a single QOL assessment or made without veterinary input.</para>

      <title>5.2.1 Effective Use of Quality‐of‐Life Assessments</title>
      <anchor id="ch0015-head-3-46"/>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0006">QOL assessments are a useful tool in EOL decision‐making, but a shift in perspective shows they can be used for much more than that. Implementing QOL assessments well before EOL decisions are made allows them to be powerful tools in helping companion animals to live life to the fullest each day. Regular assessments identify areas where QOL can be improved. They can guide proactive treatment decisions and aid in evaluating the impact of those changes.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0007">When QOL assessments are first performed in an EOL companion animal, this is most effectively accomplished alongside a clinical examination by a veterinarian and with education from the veterinary team. Having a veterinary professional guide the first assessment gives caregivers a better understanding of how to observe their pet and effectively use the tool(s) on their own moving forward. The results of the physical examination and the expert opinion of the veterinarian are paired with the observations of the family to give the most grounded baseline for decision‐making and monitoring. Starting from a well‐informed basis allows caregivers to more effectively monitor QOL at home. This is further supported by regular check‐ins (often telemedicine) from the EOL care team, and physical re‐examination when major changes occur. The best scenario would be for the first assessment to occur as part of an in‐home consultation, involving a physical examination by a veterinarian and a veterinarian or technician‐led environmental assessment (see<ulink url="ch0011">Chapter 1</ulink>). Performing the QOL assessment at home eliminates some confounding factors such as transport <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and fear in strange environments. A pet in their normal environment will be more at ease and the observations will be more reflective of their baseline. This is not to say that there is zero value in performing QOL assessments in a veterinary clinic setting. The additional stressors will <anchor id="ch0015-Page_77"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="77"/>just need to be considered when interpreting the results of the assessment. Telehealth can always play a role in QOL assessment and will be discussed in Section 5.5.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0008">Performing a thorough QOL assessment can be time‐consuming, especially when guiding caregivers through their first use of a given assessment tool. In fact, lack of time is the most common barrier to implementation of QOL assessments in veterinary medicine<citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0007</citation>. Mobilizing veterinary technicians to begin this assessment before the veterinary consultation is an effective way to expedite the process. Technicians trained in EOL care obtain a thorough history from the caregiver and begin initial education and consultation regarding QOL. This improves the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10423">efficiency</ulink> and quality of the subsequent veterinarian assessment and consultation. Technicians can also be excellent points of contact for follow‐up as the caregivers perform serial QOL assessments to monitor progression and evaluate response to treatment.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0009">
         <link linkend="ch0015-c5-tbl-0001">Table 5.1</link> summarizes recommendations for effective use of QOL assessments. Once a tool is identified and the family has been guided through its use, regular assessments will be completed to monitor any changes in QOL over time. This is especially important after any changes in treatment have occurred so their effect on QOL may be evaluated. It is valuable for multiple family members and caregivers to complete the assessment together or compare their results after doing so individually. Different family members observe different parts of a pet’s routine or have different interactions with them. For example, owners of different genders have been shown to perceive <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> in their dogs differently <citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0008</citation>. Differences in the assessments of QOL between caregivers or family members may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to productive discussion about QOL that would not have occurred otherwise.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0013">Thorough QOL assessment is time‐consuming not just for veterinary professionals, but also for caregivers trying to complete assessments independently. This may reduce caregiver compliance with QOL monitoring at home. A useful strategy to increase compliance is to offer a secondary assessment tool that is more simplified for regular use. The author recommends a thorough assessment to gather baseline information, which can then be repeated at regular intervals (weekly or monthly as appropriate). The more comprehensive assessment would also be used when any major changes are observed and to evaluate the impact of significant treatment changes. On the days or weeks between more detailed assessments, a simplified tool can be used to support a more approachable and sustainable form of QOL information collection.</para>

         <beginpage pagenum="78"/>A common simplified approach to QOL monitoring is a calendar where family members simply record emoticons to reflect a qualitative global assessment: a happy face for a good day, a neutral face for a day that wasn’t particularly good or bad, and a sad face for a bad day. Any significant events can be quickly noted to help track important information (e.g. good appetite, sore after the dog park, vomited after eating, etc.). The observations collected can prove valuable when re‐evaluating treatment plans and considering euthanasia decisions. Caregivers tend to find this simple approach easier to execute than more complex assessments, making it more likely that they will comply with monitoring QOL daily. This combined approach of simple daily assessments paired with structured use of the more thorough tools offers all members of the family and EOL care team more objective information on which to base treatment and EOL decisions.</para>

If technicians are guiding caregivers through a QOL discussion, the pyramid is a good place to start. You may consider beginning by asking caregivers: “What does a good day look like for your pet?.” This open‐ended question will reveal much to the technician, who can then proceed into more specific discussion of the components of QOL.</para>

      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0017">It is easy to see how the assessment of physical wellbeing can vary between individuals and their circumstances. In EOL care, technicians work with animals who are geriatric and animals with life‐limiting diseases. They are often affected by multiple comorbidities and effective management of disease specific symptoms will look quite different depending on the unique context of the pet and family. QOL can be heavily impacted by how much support is feasible and available. Consider an animal that has pelvic limb muscle <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=518">atrophy</ulink> from chronic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4463">osteoarthritis</ulink>. Their mobility may be impaired in a way that interferes with normal toileting postures. If they were without support, they would struggle to urinate or defecate without soiling themselves and this could <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to chronic hygiene issues such as urine scalding and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1444">dermatitis</ulink> or even <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4090">maggot infestation</ulink> and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4156">necrosis</ulink>. This would certainly be a QOL concern. If that same animal has mobility aids and caregiver support, they may be able to eliminate without soiling themselves or at least have the chance to be cleaned by their caregiver. Thus, two patients with similar physical challenges may be assessed as having an entirely different QOL based on their circumstances. If a QOL assessment raises concerns about physical wellbeing, then consideration must be given to whether that concern can be adequately addressed by the caregiver and EOL care team.</para>

      <title>5.3.2 Social Wellbeing and Mental Stimulation</title>
      <anchor id="ch0015-head-3-48"/>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0018">Once an animal’s physical needs are addressed, we may begin to consider their social and mental wellbeing. Increased social interaction or withdrawal from social interaction can both indicate a change in QOL for a pet. As discussed in<ulink url="ch0012">Chapter 2</ulink>, behavioral changes are the most common indicator of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>, but they may also indicate other types of discomfort or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. Pets that are normally quite solitary and are suddenly seeking increased attention should be evaluated, as well as pets that withdraw from their normal level of social interaction.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0019">Attending to a pet’s social needs includes supporting their interaction with people and other animals in ways that would be typical within their routine. This may be within the household and may also include individuals outside the home. Neighbors, extended family, and friends may be bonded with the pet and interaction with those people should be considered in evaluating and supporting QOL. Interactions with other animals can also be an important part of the social and mental wellbeing of a pet. Bonds with other animals should be considered and supported where possible.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0020">Social and mental stimulation can be highly impactful on QOL, especially for animals with limited mobility (and reduced autonomy) due to their health status.<ulink url="ch0013">Chapters 3</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0014">4</ulink> discussed strategies to adjust activities for pets with limited mobility to ensure they are staying mentally engaged. This could be going on car rides or wagon rides instead of walks, or going out in a backpack made for pets. New scents, sounds, textures, and tastes can be introduced to stimulate a pet’s mind. Interactive feeding toys may be used where the pet is able to manage the interaction required to receive the rewards. Small amounts of training can aid in engagement. Mental stimulation can sometimes be as simple as ensuring access to a window to watch wildlife, nature, people, and pets <anchor id="ch0015-Page_80"/>

      <para>When we consider what makes an animal’s life worth living, we must give thought to their autonomy. Their ability to express and act upon their needs and preferences should be considered as contributing to their dignity and will to live, even if they cannot express this directly. Stressors beyond those physically apparent may impact animals’ emotional wellbeing and should be identified and managed where possible.

They may be asked to report QOL on a scale out of 10, select from a range of descriptions (i.e. poor to excellent QOL), or place a mark on a visual scale (e.g. a horizontal line with poor QOL at one end and excellent QOL at the other). Some research shows correlations between global scores and overall outcomes of QOL assessments, but other studies failed to find these correlations. Thus, the reliability of global scores is in question [<citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0002</citation>, <citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0011</citation>, <citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0012</citation>].

      <title>5.5 Role of Telemedicine</title>
      <anchor id="ch0015-head-2-55"/>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0056">As discussed in<ulink url="ch0011">Chapter 1</ulink>, telehealth or telemedicine can play a valuable role in EOL care and supporting QOL consultations is certainly an example of this. Telemedicine QOL consultations can occur prior to, or as a follow‐up to an in person visit. Technicians with appropriate knowledge and training can engage in these consultations as part of an effective EOL care team, thereby increasing caregiver access to support and improving the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10423">efficiency</ulink> of the team. Within an existing VCPR, telemedicine QOL consults can be used to assess response to treatment and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8107">disease progression</ulink>, trigger treatment plan re‐evaluation by the veterinarian, and to discuss EOL planning. Telemedicine <anchor id="ch0015-Page_86"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="86"/>QOL consultations can also occur outside of a VCPR as long as no medical recommendations are made. Without a VCPR, the consultation is more focused on QOL education and guided caregiver reflection. Despite the limitations, caregivers find these consultations invaluable when they are unfamiliar with QOL assessment, or unsure of their options for EOL care.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0057">Technicians can support telemedicine QOL consultations by educating caregivers about the components of QOL and their assessment. They may be able to guide owners in deciding their next<anchor id="ch0015-Page_87"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="87"/>steps (e.g. booking euthanasia, hospice consultation, etc.). Telemedicine QOL consultations outside of a VCPR should still be accompanied by a medical record so that the details of the discussion are recorded for future reference or to provide to the regular veterinarian. When engaging in telemedicine QOL consultations, technicians can take multiple approaches. Caregivers that have already established a VCPR and have already used assessment tools might just need some discussion about their results. Caregivers consulting about QOL for the first time might prefer to have tools provided in advance to work through independently and then follow‐up with the technician later (it is recommended to set a plan for this follow‐up). Technicians should consider talking caregivers through a chosen assessment for the first time together while they are on the call. EOL care teams might develop a template of QOL related questions they can work through verbally and document the caregiver’s responses. Teams will benefit from the development of a protocol to support a consistent approach to QOL consultation.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0058">Formalizing a process to offer telemedicine QOL consultations is beneficial on a number of levels. Monetizing this service allows personnel to schedule time for it and invest more energy into these consultations, which is recognized by clients. Attaching revenue to this service allows it to become a sustainable and growing part of the practice. Clients wishing for devoted time and attention via telemedicine typically understand the need to pay for this service and are appreciative of the option being offered.</para>

      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0059">Many species may be considered companions by their caregivers. While our focus in this guide is on canine and feline companions, we would be remiss not to include some mention of large animals and exotic or alternative pets. When developing or selecting a QOL tool for use in another species, the QOL pyramid may be used to assess whether the included items effectively cover an appropriate breadth of QOL considerations.</para>
      <para id="ch0015-c5-para-0060">Another framework that may be considered for evaluating QOL is the Five Domains of Animal Welfare: nutrition, health, physical environment, behavioral interactions, and mental state<citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0020</citation>. This framework has been applied to many species including but not limited to horses, cattle, birds, rodents, rabbits, dogs, cats, reptiles, amphibians and fish. While the Five Domains has historically been used to assess animal welfare in research, testing and teaching, the focus on ensuring that animals <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> “a life worth living” aligns well with the goals of improving or maintain QOL in EOL care <citation>ch0015-c5-bib-0020</citation>. The personalized QOL questionnaire included in Section 5.4 can also be considered when working with a variety of species as it can be tailored to that individual’s preferences and routine within their species‐specific behaviors.
