      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0002">The end‐of‐life (EOL) period is a difficult and trying time for caregivers, their families, and the veterinary professionals supporting them. Veterinary technicians are involved throughout EOL care as they support owners through EOL decision‐making and planning and with grief before and after the death of their beloved companion. Veterinarians report that consulting on EOL decision‐making has more of an impact on their mental well‐being than euthanasia itself<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0001</citation> and it is reasonable to think technicians are similarly impacted. Skillful communication can mitigate the negative effect of EOL conversations and generate connected and meaningful dialogue for everyone involved. When there is skilled dialogue, there are positive emotions, and these arduous conversations can become inspirational and uplifting. This chapter will focus on the essential skills needed for success in EOL communication. The application of communication techniques within specific scenarios, such as conflict and grief, will be addressed further in <ulink url="ch0018">Chapters 7</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0027">14</ulink>–<ulink url="ch0029">16</ulink>.</para>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0003">Many communication models exist to guide communication. Their purpose is to create a framework that utilizes key skills required in specific interactions. In the veterinary community, the most researched model is the Calgary Cambridge Guide (CCG), which is modified from human medicine and adapted for interactions between veterinarians and caregivers [<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0002</citation>, <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0003</citation>]. The CCG provides a framework for learning evidence‐based communication skills that are applicable to all members of the veterinary team <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0003</citation>. Technicians looking for more indepth communication resources may refer to “Skills for Communicating in Veterinary Medicine” by Adams and Kurtz <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0003</citation> and “Developing Communication Skills for Veterinary Practice” by Shaw and Coe <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0004</citation>.</para>

The core communication skills covered in this section are nonverbal behaviors, asking questions, active listening, and showing empathy. These skills represent the first step in learning. Technicians may become “skills spotters” by watching others communicate and categorizing the skills they demonstrate. Begin putting the skills into practice by trying them in low‐stakes conversations before progressing to more challenging interactions. Maintain a growth mindset using self‐reflection and solicitation of feedback from others to keep improving.<link linkend="ch0017-c6-tbl-0001">Table 6.1</link> highlights a framework for building skills.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0017-head-3-53"/>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0006">Nonverbal communication is the way human beings transmit the “feel” behind their message. It speaks the truth, regardless of verbal messages. It reveals intent and either supports or discredits what is said. Nonverbal communication skills can be used to enhance messaging and to aid in interpreting messages from others. Veterinary technicians are no strangers to this type of communication, as our patients are nonverbal and require behavioral interpretation regularly<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0004</citation>. To enhance their nonverbal communication, technicians must tap into their skill sets of objective observation and interpretation of body language and then put effort into matching what is spoken to what is felt and thought.</para>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0007">Nonverbal communication includes facial expression, body position, tension, touch, tone, volume, speed of talking, and autonomic response<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0004</citation>. Technicians can control their faces, posture, position within a space, body tension, and many elements of their speaking including pace, volume, and tone (see <link linkend="ch0017-c6-fea-0001">Pro Tip 6.1</link>). There are some nonverbal elements that cannot be controlled, namely autonomic responses such as red face or blotchy skin, crying, blanching, and increased heart and respiration rates.</para>

         <para>EOL conversations often involve heightened emotional responses from caregivers. In these circumstances, it may feel appropriate to offer empathic or “healing” touch. In general, a comforting touch on the hands or forearms is considered appropriate in many cultures<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0007</citation>. Some caregivers may solicit or welcome hugs at this time as well. When in doubt, it is always best to ask for permission before touching anyone <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0004</citation>.</para>

      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0009">Technicians can work toward managing their nonverbal communication in a way that supports their verbal message. This allows the message to be clear and believable. The spoken words provide meaning or context and the nonverbal cues provide the “feeling” behind the message. Beginning with developing sensitivity to their own personal nonverbal cues, technicians may then start watching others in an objective, non‐biased way.</para>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0010">When observing the nonverbal activities of others, technicians will notice they present in one of two ways: either in congruence with and enhancing the verbal message, or with a disconnect which causes doubt because the nonverbals present a different meaning than the spoken words<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0006</citation>. Identifying the nonverbal message and reflecting it back to the caregiver verbally allows them to feel heard and understood (see <link linkend="ch0017-c6-fea-0002">Communication Corner 6.1</link>). This contributes to a very positive interaction, even if it is a difficult one. When nonverbals and spoken words match, technicians may accelerate understanding and create collaboration and improved rapport. <link linkend="ch0017-c6-fea-0003">Communication Corner 6.2</link> and <link linkend="ch0017-c6-fig-0001">Figure 6.1</link> demonstrate the role that touch can play in supporting these interactions.</para>

      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0015">There are many ways to ask a question. Skillful questions allow technicians to obtain information or learn more about their patients and their caregivers and family. Questioning can be divided into closed and open techniques<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0003</citation>. Closed questions are those that can be answered with yes/no or with single‐word responses. Open questions are those that invite a story and are an excellent tool for demonstrating sincere interest. Each type of question has a role in relationship building, gathering or exchanging information, making decisions, and in assessment or evaluation. Using both question types skillfully is a powerful way to support relationship‐centered care and demonstrate interest in caregivers and their perspectives.</para>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0016">Open questioning techniques are expressions of curiosity and serve a strong purpose in meaningful dialogue. Veterinary technicians are naturally inquisitive, making the skill of asking open questions realistic and achievable. These questions give us the path to obtain knowledge that another person has and needs to share. We can sometimes replace open‐ended questions with statements such as, “Tell me about Rufus. I’d love to hear <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> story.” While this is not a true question, it will elicit the same response when spoken with interest. Remember to pair your queries with matching nonverbal cues. See<link linkend="ch0017-c6-fea-0004">Communication Corner 6.3</link> for examples of open questioning techniques.</para>

         <anchor id="ch0017-head-2-65"/>
         <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0020">A common concern among veterinary professionals is not having time for in depth, compassionate communication. There is fear that open questioning invites clients to over‐share information and increase appointment length. In fact, a client who is not interrupted by a veterinary team member will only speak for an average of 90 seconds<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0008</citation>. Allowing the client to share all their concerns up front actually decreases appointment length by preventing last‐minute unaddressed issues being raised.</para>
      </sidebar>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0018">Open questions asked with sincere interest and matching nonverbals generally elicit what is top of mind for that person (i.e. what they are thinking about most). Inviting caregivers to openly share early in an EOL conversation ensures all their concerns are addressed, rather than following only the agenda of the veterinary team (see<link linkend="ch0017-c6-fea-0005">Pro Tip 6.2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0019">Closed questions also play an important role in information gathering. Closed questions elicit brief, specific answers which provide valuable details for the veterinary team. Consider questioning techniques as a funnel, starting with open questioning to gain perspective and then funneling to closed to get more data<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0004</citation>. For example: “What has been your experience with euthanasia?” (open) “When did that happen? Did you understand their condition? Which cremation option did you choose?” (closed).</para>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0021">Questions need not be an interrogation. When used with good timing, positive intent, and genuine curiosity, technicians gain both knowledge and perspective. A technician’s expressed interest, demonstrated through open‐ended questions, helps the caregiver feel like their perspective is important to the decisions being made for their pet and the relationship becomes a partnership.</para>

Reducing distractions and interruptions will also ensure focus is maintained on the caregiver as they share information. Active listening is the natural next step when open questioning techniques are used. Support active listening with nonverbal cues: nodding, soft eye contact, open body posture, leaning toward the other person, relaxed facial expression, even breathing, and relaxed shoulders <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0010</citation>. Effective listening requires focus on two levels: first, on the words being spoken, and second, on the feelings behind the words <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0009</citation>. The spoken words provide context and data, while listening for feelings allows technicians to respond with empathy. Note the nonverbal cues demonstrated by the speaker as they provide more depth to the message.

      <anchor id="ch0017-head-3-56"/>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0038">Technicians who work to understand a caregiver’s thoughts and feelings are demonstrating empathy [<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0004</citation>, <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0011</citation>]. Showing empathy is an essential communication skill that helps technicians connect with another person in a way that is meaningful for both parties (see <link linkend="ch0017-c6-fea-0007">Pro Tip 6.3</link>). For the giver of empathy, this is a way to check understanding of how another person feels. For the receiver of empathy, their emotions are acknowledged in a validating, non‐judgmental way which promotes a strong feeling of “being heard.” An important consideration for technicians practicing empathy is to protect their wellbeing while they seek to understand the feelings and perspectives of others. Technicians should strive to be present and show compassion without taking on the negative feelings of others and experiencing them personally <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0011</citation>. Continued exposure to distress among caregivers can contribute to empathic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5669">strain</ulink> and burnout among members of the veterinary team. More information about this workplace hazard can be found in <ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 17</ulink>.</para>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0041">Empathy as a verbal communication skill takes the form of an empathy statement. Empathy statements are crafted in response to the information obtained through active listening. They specifically acknowledge the feelings of the speaker. Typically, empathy statements begin by identifying an emotion the caregiver is feeling, followed by a specific statement regarding why they are feeling that way. A key component of an effective empathy statement is the<emphasis>pause</emphasis> which should immediately follow. When someone is given time to process an empathic response, they can choose to either to say more about their experience or just recognize and appreciate the compassion demonstrated by the statement <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0003</citation>. <link linkend="ch0017-c6-fea-0008">Communication Corner 6.4</link> provides examples of specific empathy statements.</para>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0047">When people are experiencing strong, overpowering emotions, they lose the capacity to think clearly. Their cognitive function can be obscured by the presence of emotion. The power of empathy in communication is that it can both acknowledge and diminish the strength of these powerful emotions thus allowing people to think more clearly. Empathy and open communication can help unburden individuals from carrying their heavy emotions. When the technician names the caregiver’s emotions in an empathy statement, the caregiver also has the opportunity to disagree or clarify their emotional state, leading to more clear communication moving forward (see<link linkend="ch0017-c6-fea-0009">Pro Tip 6.4</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0048">Some people may feel hesitant to use empathy statements because they feel these statements will indicate that they agree with the person who is speaking, even if they do not. In fact, a well‐crafted empathy statement does not reveal anything about the technician’s own personal feelings; it simply acknowledges the emotions of the caregiver. Empathy statements also do not involve trying to get the caregiver to change or suppress their emotions, although often acknowledging an emotional response will reduce its intensity.</para>

These four basic competencies are: self‐awareness, self‐management, social awareness, and relationship management<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0012</citation>. Of these, self‐awareness and self‐management are considered personal competencies, requiring honest self‐reflection and willingness to solicit feedback.

      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0052">The first step to increased self‐awareness is recognizing and naming emotions. While this may come naturally for some, people are often encouraged to suppress emotional responses to avoid conflict or discomfort. This may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to a basic inability to accurately identify which emotion is being felt. In addition, some emotions (i.e. anger, guilt, frustration, or sadness) may be seen as “bad” feelings, making people less willing to identify that they are experiencing them. Technicians can begin to overcome these issues by recognizing that emotions are neither good nor bad and that there is no right or wrong way to feel<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0014</citation>. Emotions are natural responses to external stimuli. When building self‐awareness, begin by acknowledging and naming emotions as they occur <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0015</citation>. Consider the thoughts and experiences that led up to the feeling and whether there is a pattern of events that generally causes that emotion. Sometimes journaling about these experiences can help with building connections and finding patterns in emotional responses. <link linkend="ch0017-c6-fea-0010">Case Study 6.2</link> describes an example of this process.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0017-head-3-59"/>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0063">Social awareness relates to a person’s interpersonal skills. A technician with high social awareness recognizes that they are impacted by the emotional states of others and that their emotional responses will impact others similarly. Social awareness is demonstrated through the use of listening and empathy skills identified earlier in the chapter. Understanding the perspective of others, finding common ground, and showing a willingness to help others are all hallmarks of well‐developed social awareness<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0018</citation>.</para>

Two key elements of relationship management include influencing others and conflict management<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0019</citation>. Technicians demonstrate influence when they skillfully manage the emotional responses of others, using listening and empathy to help others feel heard and regain emotional control. Exerting influence effectively requires a genuine desire to help and a strong willingness to put the needs of others ahead of any personal agenda <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0019</citation>. Conflict in relationships may arise for many reasons in veterinary medicine, especially during emotionally charged situations such as EOL decision‐making and euthanasia. A technician who can use strong relationship management skills to diffuse and resolve conflict effectively will be highly sought to <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> caregiver interactions (see <link linkend="ch0017-c6-fea-0012">Pro Tip 6.5</link>).

However, strong communication skills and high EI can promote well‐being and job satisfaction and should be prioritized. Technicians can highlight the benefits of improving communication skills while openly discussing the time commitment and workload associated with these activities.

      <anchor id="ch0017-head-3-62"/>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0069">Veterinary team members will need communication resources to help them grow their skills and a system to check in and assess progress as they build competence. Most veterinary hospitals utilize some form of clinical rounds procedure in which cases are summarized, and team members are briefed about patient status (or debriefed after cases are resolved). The same techniques can be implemented in “communication rounds” where caregiver interactions are discussed and reviewed in an open, non‐judgmental format<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0021</citation>. Communication rounds provide everyone on the team with an opportunity to share their thoughts and feelings about challenging caregiver interactions. They provide positive feedback on communication techniques that were used effectively while also discussing opportunities for improvement <citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0021</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0017-c6-para-0070">To promote feelings of safety in these potentially emotionally charged conversations, a designated facilitator should be present at all communication rounds. The facilitator may be a veterinary team member who possesses excellent communication skills and empathy already, or an outside professional may be brought in to help guide the conversation. Skilled facilitators use open questioning techniques to ensure everyone is heard and then summarize key points in the discussion without adding their own opinions<citation>ch0017-c6-bib-0021</citation>. Technicians can take on the role of facilitator when they have developed their own skills to a high level and feel equipped to help and guide others.</para>
