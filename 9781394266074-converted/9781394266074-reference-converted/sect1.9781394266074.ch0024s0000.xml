      <title>12.1 Introduction</title>
      <anchor id="ch0024-head-2-145"/>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0003">When a patient’s quality of life significantly declines and suffering is expected, the veterinary team has the option to perform euthanasia. Administering euthanasia solution has been described as the ultimate palliation to relieve <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>, breathing difficulty, anxiety, etc., with the side effect being death<citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0001</citation>. In other words, the only permanent way to release an animal from suffering before their natural death is euthanasia. This view of euthanasia as the ultimate form of palliation can change the way we perceive the drugs and methods we use.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0004">When the difficult decision to euthanize a beloved pet has been made, the veterinary team must then decide which euthanasia method is most suitable. Over many decades, veterinarians and animal welfare experts have developed safe and effective means of ending life. For companion animals, the most common method is the injection of <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13088">sodium</ulink>
<citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0002</citation>. As mentioned in <ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 11</ulink>, <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> is an anesthetic drug that elicits its effects on the brain through an <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6756">overdose</ulink>, which shuts down communication between the brain and the body. When properly dosed, pentobarbital is ultrafast acting and can be relied on to end an animal’s life with minimal side effects (see <link linkend="ch0024-c12-fig-0001">Figure 12.1</link>). The common injection sites include the veins (intravenous‐IV), the heart (intracardiac‐IC), the liver (intrahepatic‐IH), the kidney (intrarenal‐IR), and the abdomen (intraperitoneal‐IP).</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0005">The lack of side effects is what makes <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> attractive for use in companion animal euthanasia. Caregivers can become concerned when witnessing active signs of death in their pet, and believe their pet is struggling/suffering<citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0003</citation>. Veterinary teams must consider the optics of death along with other factors to determine the best euthanasia method.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0006">
         <link linkend="ch0024-c12-tbl-0001">Table 12.1</link> lists factors to consider when selecting an appropriate euthanasia technique for a patient. The veterinary professional (usually a veterinarian) selecting the euthanasia technique will need to consider all of these factors collectively, as they all have a bearing on the success of the procedure. For example, a large dog with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5379">osteosarcoma</ulink> (<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=685">bone cancer</ulink>) is not the ideal candidate for an IP injection of <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink>. Due to the dog’s size, it may take considerably longer for death to be achieved, and the veterinary team may not have enough solution to properly dose. A cat with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3580">liver disease</ulink> is not the best fit for an IH injection, conducted by a veterinarian who has never performed it before, in a room full of family members who have requested a postmortem necropsy. Infusing <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> into the liver <anchor id="ch0024-Page_184"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="184"/>has the potential to alter necropsy results, and the added <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> of properly performing the procedure for the first time with a room full of people may not be necessary. These examples illustrate the importance of weighing the pros and cons of each euthanasia technique before starting.</para>

      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0007">Veterinary technicians familiar with alternative euthanasia techniques may offer valuable advice to the team, especially when some team members are unfamiliar with modern euthanasia methodology. Knowledge of multiple technique options lays the foundation for a more controlled and constructive euthanasia appointment. Technicians can help determine the best technique given the situation and have backup technique supplies ready, including some of the alternatives that will be described later. In some instances, it may be possible and even preferable for animal welfare for the veterinarian to direct a technician to administer euthanasia. This would typically be a situation where the veterinarian determines that urgent euthanasia is required and the technician is able to provide it significantly sooner (i.e. the veterinarian is in surgery for a prolonged period, or at another urgent house call). This was also briefly discussed in<ulink url="ch0022">Chapters 10</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0023">11</ulink>. Technicians administering euthanasia without a veterinarian on‐site may not be possible in all regions due to issues regarding controlled substance handling and transport <citation>ch0024-c12-bib-1004</citation>. Where permissible and under the direction of a veterinarian, mobilizing technicians to administer urgent welfare‐related euthanasia can help to relieve suffering in EOL patients.</para>

Every injection route has its pros and cons (<link linkend="ch0024-c12-tbl-0002">Table 12.2</link>).

      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0046">Euthanasia solution may be given into any vein. Veins are located in every region of the body, both superficially near the skin and more internally. It does not matter which vein is used as long as it can be successfully injected, and the caregiver is allowed to remain close to their pet. In general, veterinarians and technicians prefer to distance themselves from the patient’s head and upper body area, choosing instead to work with veins around the back half of the body. This allows caregivers to be more intimately positioned near the front.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0047">The most common veins to use in dogs and cats are the cephalic and saphenous veins. The cephalic vein resides on the cranial side of the forelimb, while the saphenous veins are in the hindlimb. In dogs, the lateral saphenous vein runs from the tarsus up the lateral side of the lower leg to behind the knee. Distal to it is the dorsal pedal vein on the dorsal surface of the hind foot. In cats, the medial saphenous vein is found in the medial thigh region. Other veins include the ventral abdominal vein, the jugular vein, superficial ear vein, and the tongue vein, none of which are commonly used in dogs and cats but are nevertheless available.</para>

The necessary volume of the drug will be administered steadily into the vein. IV administration is fast and reliable, with visual cues of death often starting before the injection is complete (e.g. deep breaths, slight leg stretches, and tail raising). The time to death (<ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=TTD">TTD</ulink>) is expected in under two minutes, with most animals passing in under one minute. As long as the entirety of the pentobarbital dose is properly administered into the vein, euthanasia will be swift and permanent.</para>

It’s good to standardize the injection method the team prefers so that supplies are readily available. This author prefers to place an indwelling IV catheter for all IV injections, regardless of whether the patient is awake or sleeping. Once the catheter is placed, the caregivers may take as much time as they like to say goodbyes, and the vet team has less worry about falling BP. In other words, placing an IV catheter reduces the tendency to move quickly through the procedure.</para>

The heart can be used to deliver euthanasia solutions just as effectively as any vein in the body. The heart is closer to the brain than peripheral veins, therefore the solution has less distance to travel to render its effects. As mentioned in<ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 11</ulink>, <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> works directly on the brain to first induce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6231">unconsciousness</ulink>, then respiratory arrest, and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10244">cardiac arrest</ulink>. The dose of euthanasia solution for an IC injection is the same as IV, further demonstrating the similarity to venous injections.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0052">Intracardiac injections require the patient to be completely unconscious before attempting. Once in a surgical plane of anesthesia, they are typically laid in lateral recumbency on a comfortable surface such as the caregiver’s lap or on a soft mat. The heart is found within the thoracic cavity, through a few key locating points: by feeling the chest wall for beats, by placing the point of the elbow (olecranon) in a standing position against the chest, by looking for the 3–6 intercostal rib spaces, and by listening to the point of maximum intensity (PMI) of the heartbeat. The needle is usually inserted into the lateral thoracic wall, aimed internally to reach the heart (<link linkend="ch0024-c12-fea-0001">Pro Tip 12.1</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0054">Any chamber within the heart may be injected. The goal is to locate a substantial “flash” of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> in the syringe or extension set to indicate the heart has been found and the injection can begin. When this flash is seen, it means the tip of the needle is properly placed somewhere within the heart. A slow injection of euthanasia solution can begin, keeping a steady hand to protect the needle’s placement in the heart. If there is concern about proper placement, the syringe’s plunger can be pulled back slightly mid‐injection to check for another flash of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> in the syringe.

      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0055">A study in 2023 found that many veterinarians try to avoid IC injections in front of caregivers<citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0004</citation>. This is due to the likelihood that caregivers will see the flash of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> in the syringe, which may be upsetting to them. This visualization can be avoided by using a short extension set between the needle and syringe that allows the syringe to be lowered out of sight. Another option is to use the direct needle and syringe method but from the ventral approach rather than the lateral approach (see Figures 12.4–12.6). By reducing the sight of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> during IC injections, hopefully, veterinary teams will feel more comfortable using this technique and allow caregivers to remain present for the entirety of the procedure.</para>

The kidney has adequate <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> flow, even with diseases such as chronic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3296">kidney disease</ulink> and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2928">hydronephrosis</ulink>, to move the drug up to the brain to achieve death. IR injections reduce the need to locate veins in thin, frail, and dehydrated patients such as older cats and those commonly seen in end‐of‐life (EOL) care. Veterinary teams often worry about IV injections in patients with poor health and may find great relief knowing an alternative like the IR method is possible.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0058">The kidneys reside in the abdomen just ventral to the spine. The left kidney in cats sits outside of the retroperitoneal space making them easier to locate and hold in position. The right kidney sits slightly more cranial under the last rib. Either kidney may be injected. The key to a successful injection is the ability to hold the kidney in position and feel it swell as the solution is injected. This is achieved by first feeling for the kidney in the abdomen, then placing one’s fingertips slightly around it, and injecting slowly to feel for swelling (see<link linkend="ch0024-c12-fig-0007">Figure 12.7</link>).</para>

This is three times the IV or IC dose, meaning more solution needs to be given into the kidney to achieve rapid death. Any needle gauge will do (this author prefers a 1‐in., 18‐gauge needle), and an extension set connected to the syringe is unnecessary and can even make the injection harder to accomplish. A direct needle and syringe approach is preferred. Swelling occurs as the result of increased pressure against the renal capsule before the euthanasia solution has time to move into the renal veins. Kidney swelling is the number one indicator that the solution has been properly injected, and it can be felt just after the start of the injection <citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0005</citation>. In time, we may find that the IR dose of pentobarbital can be decreased, although the injection of more solution increases the odds of proper renal cortex placement and subsequent swelling.</para>

As with all <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> euthanasia methods, the cessation of breathing is the hallmark sign that death is approaching, and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10244">cardiac arrest</ulink> will soon follow if an adequate dose is given. When a second injection is warranted, it can be given in the same kidney, or the other one may be used. The administrator needs to decide which kidney can be held in position long enough to give a full dose of <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> and to feel the swelling. This said, it is possible to achieve death without feeling the kidney swell, but it is less common. A lack of swelling may indicate the kidney has been missed and the euthanasia solution is going into surrounding tissues with reduced <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> flow (e.g. the abdomen), or the needle is inserted into the renal pelvis which delivers urine, and in this case euthanasia solution, into the bladder. The renal pelvis is avoided by aiming the needle into the renal cortical tissue.</para>

The needle is inserted at a 45°, with the tip of the needle aimed cranially (see<link linkend="ch0024-c12-fig-0008">Figure 12.8</link>). It is helpful to picture the needle exiting the body near the base of the neck by the shoulder blades if it were long enough to extend that far (see <link linkend="ch0024-c12-fig-0009">Figure 12.9</link>).

      <anchor id="ch0024-head-3-119"/>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0068">The IP technique is unique among the others for two main reasons. The first reason is that it requires the use of a <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> euthanasia solution and none of the other alternative agents (e.g. <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13083">potassium</ulink> chloride, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13065">magnesium</ulink> sulfate, and <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=3065">lidocaine</ulink>). As of 2024, no other drugs/agents have been identified as reliable and irreversible when given into the abdomen of dogs and cats, especially when caregivers are present<citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0002</citation>. The second reason is that IP injections take longer to achieve death compared to IV or intra‐organ injections. On average, a patient will succumb to the effects of the drug between 10 and 20 minutes <citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0007</citation>. This author has had IP injections 45 minutes before death. The current IP dose of pentobarbital is 255 mg/kg.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0069">The common use of pre‐euthanasia sedatives/anesthetics in animal hospice reduces the likelihood of IP injections being used. Intra‐organ injections shorten the <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=TTD">TTD</ulink> and are generally preferred. However, there will be times when pre‐euthanasia sedatives/anesthetics are not used, and IP injections of <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> are given to awake EOL patients. This is most likely to be decided on a case‐by‐case basis by the attending veterinarian and team. It’s possible that the IP technique is the preferred method for technicians to perform due to the relative ease of administration.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0070">There are a few injection sites to safely place <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> euthanasia solution in the abdomen. The goal is to miss organs like the spleen, intestine, bladder, and abdominal fat stores which will slow absorption and potentially cause <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>. A needle may be inserted perpendicular to the body wall, near the ventral midline, just caudal to the umbilicus, and a little to the right side. Other injection locations include the flank region on the right or left side of the abdomen, below the spinal musculature, although the right side is more reliable<citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0007</citation>. Avoiding the stomach and spleen on the left side of the abdomen is preferred. Once the needle has penetrated through the body wall, <anchor id="ch0024-Page_194"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="194"/>the syringe plunger should be drawn back to check for negative pressure and absence of fluids like accidental stomach content and urine. If nothing is found, the injection may begin.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0071">Generally, IP injections in awake animals are believed to be non‐painful or at least tolerable to the patient when compared to intramuscular injections of low pH drugs such as ketamine [<citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0008</citation>, <citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0009</citation>].

In this author’s experience, reptiles and birds often close their eyelids during anesthesia and death. If a patient dies with their eyes open, it is acceptable to leave them open or the technician may gently attempt to close them using their fingers. At the caregiver’s request, permanent eye closing can be done using skin adhesive glue along the edge of the eyelids.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0088">When the veterinarian or technician confirms that death has arrived, they may pronounce death. It is important to verbally pronounce a patient deceased when other people are in the area. It can be hard for loved ones to hear, but nevertheless, a <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Formal">formal</ulink> declaration that permanent death has been achieved is part of the experience. This will be done by the veterinary professional performing the euthanasia. They may decide exactly how to pronounce death, but because euthanasia is a medical procedure it is advisable to use clear language without euphemisms that may confuse the listener. Taking a deep, relaxing breath before and after pronouncing the patient deceased can help to calm nervous tension in the room.</para>

      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0092">Working with exotic pets offers an opportunity to provide the same loving care and attention to gentle death. Caregivers can show as much affection for exotic pets as they do the more traditional dogs and cats<citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0016</citation>. Compassionate technicians will acknowledge the love that caregivers have for their exotic pets. The approach to euthanasia and respect for the bond will be the same regardless of species. We offer privacy before, during, and after euthanasia, we provide the same appointment length, and we give bereavement support.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0093">In this author’s experience, caregivers grieve similarly for exotic pets and the desire for euthanasia to go smoothly is the same as it is for dogs and cats. The difference tends to be in the level of understanding of how exotic pet euthanasia is carried out. Many caregivers will be familiar with what dog euthanasia looks like but have never experienced it with an exotic pet. This means technicians will need to set aside time to describe the procedure in greater detail, thus reducing fears of the unknown.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0094">Common exotic pet species that will require euthanasia services include birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and small mammals<citation>ch0024-c12-bib-0017</citation>. Caregivers may own other species where less is known about their anatomy and physiology, making them more challenging to euthanize. As with any animal, the veterinary team will want to ensure they know how to safely and permanently euthanize before attempting. This requires some basic knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the species in question, which will help to inform the choice of euthanasia technique.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0095">Veterinary practices located near a clinic that routinely sees exotic pets may refer to that practice, but not all communities have this resource available to them. Veterinary technicians that learn how to offer humane euthanasia to exotic species can support compassionate EOL care for caregivers of pets who may have nowhere else to turn. With that in mind, a summary of some basic guidance and tips for exotic pet euthanasia is included here as an introduction only. Veterinary teams wishing to offer exotic pet euthanasia routinely should seek out continuing education on this topic and have resources on hand in their practice for quick reference (<link linkend="ch0024-c12-fea-0004">Pro Tip 12.2</link>). This is particularly important when selecting drug doses and routes, the details of which go beyond the scope of this chapter.

      <anchor id="ch0024-head-3-124"/>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0102">Technicians should reflect on what is normal for the species and try to support and maintain this as much as possible through the euthanasia experience. Instinct refers to what’s natural to the exotic pet patient and evolved for the animal’s preservation. For example, if an animal wants to nest and avoid physical contact, the technician should follow its <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink>. They can shift their approach and euthanize in the environment the animal prefers. Burrowing animals can be wrapped in a thin blanket/wrap and a medicine injection is given through it. If you must remove the animal from its habitat to give the medications, place them right back in so they may die in safe surroundings.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0103">With nocturnal species, there may be an opportunity to work with them at the start of the workday, right before they would typically go to sleep after a busy night. Many species prefer quiet spaces with minimal talking. They like safe and recognizable structures nearby too. Technicians can advocate for keeping exotic pets in their home cages, nesting pouches, or other structures. Home euthanasia is also another important consideration, especially for species accustomed to remaining in their cages/habitats.</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0104">The general rule with exotic pet euthanasia is to go slow and take extra time. Caregivers should know that death may take longer than what they may be used to and that a fast death does not equal a good death, especially when unpleasant restraint is used (e.g. forcing an animal into an unnatural position during euthanasia). Patient comfort is of utmost importance (see<link linkend="ch0024-c12-fig-0011">Figure 12.11</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0024-c12-para-0105">Technicians should provide pre‐euthanasia sedation to all exotic pets just as is recommended in other companion animals. Administering pre‐euthanasia anesthesia is preferred in most exotic patients as this allows more flexibility in technique choices (e.g. IC injections and brain pithing) (<link linkend="ch0024-c12-tbl-0004">Table 12.4</link>). Oral drug administration for sedation can be effective in many exotic species and may be less stressful for pets and caregivers than injections</para>

               <emphasis role="strong">The heart keeps beating</emphasis>: If the heart keeps beating after the proper dose of euthanasia solution has been given, it likely means the brain has not been overdosed. The options are to give more time for the vasculature to move the drug to the brain, or to give more euthanasia solution. Depending on the injection method, it’s acceptable to wait up to five minutes after an IV, IC, or IR injection before redosing. IH and IP injections can take longer to elicit death, so waiting 10 minutes or more is acceptable (<link linkend="ch0024-c12-fea-0005">Communication Corner 12.3</link>).</para>

While the veterinary team understands and is familiar with these events, the caregiver may need to be reassured that everything is normal, and their pet is safe (<link linkend="ch0024-c12-fea-0006">Communication Corner 12.4</link>).
