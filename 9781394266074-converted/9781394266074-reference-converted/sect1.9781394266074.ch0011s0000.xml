      <title>1.1 Introduction</title>
      <anchor id="ch0011-head-2-1"/>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0003">The foundational philosophy of animal hospice and palliative care (AHPC) requires a perspective shift from traditional veterinary practice. It is more often about the approach to care than specific medicine and nursing techniques. Animal hospice embraces life in the face of death such that dying patients and their loved ones live life to the fullest until the moment of death. Animal hospice aims to improve and maintain quality of life (QOL) throughout the end‐of‐life (EOL) journey while also supporting the human–animal bond. This continues until the time of death and beyond, with a focus on quality of dying and a meaningful EOL transition for the animal and their loved ones.</para>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0004">EOL care has always been a part of veterinary medicine, but it is relatively recent that AHPC has emerged as a dedicated area of study and practice. The roots of human hospice date back centuries, and modern human hospice has its origins in the 1960s. By contrast, AHPC is a young discipline, beginning in the 1980s<citation>ch0011-c1-bib-0001</citation> with 2009 marking the founding of the International Association of Animal Hospice and Palliative Care (IAAHPC). The IAAHPC offers certification for both veterinarians and technicians and is making efforts toward establishing AHPC as a recognized veterinary specialty.</para>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0005">The effective provision of AHPC not only improves animal QOL and supports the human–animal bond, it also reduces caregiver decisional regret at EOL. Animal hospice or EOL care offers an opportunity to bridge the gap between care provided at a veterinary facility and the potential for inadequate treatment at home or premature euthanasia due to a lack of other options<citation>ch0011-c1-bib-0001</citation>. Hospice‐supported natural death can also be offered as an alternative to euthanasia with appropriate veterinary supervision (see <ulink url="ch0020">Chapter 9</ulink>). Caregivers may feel abandoned by their veterinary teams if there is a perceived lack of treatment alternatives discussed beyond aggressive treatment and/or euthanasia <citation>ch0011-c1-bib-0002</citation>. They are often unaware of the possibilities of animal hospice, home‐based care, and hospice‐supported natural death. Offering caregivers more options and more support during the EOL period allows families to feel more in control of an unpredictable situation and remain more connected with their pet during this meaningful time.</para>

      <title>1.2 Terminology and Definitions</title>
      <anchor id="ch0011-head-2-2"/>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0006">Hospice and palliative care are inseparable within the context of EOL care, but they are defined differently.<emphasis>Hospice</emphasis> is the care provided from the time of a terminal diagnosis through to the time of death, including support for the caregiver after death. <emphasis>Palliative care</emphasis> is simply the provision of non‐curative therapies that improve patient comfort. It can be offered to any patient experiencing any type of discomfort and is not restricted to EOL patients (<link linkend="ch0011-c1-fea-0001">Pro Tip 1.1</link>). Technicians should be mindful that misconceptions about the nature of palliative care will be common among caregivers (<link linkend="ch0011-c1-fea-0002">Communication Corner 1.1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-line-0008">
         <emphasis>You can offer palliative care without hospice,</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-line-0009">
         <emphasis>but you cannot offer hospice without palliative care</emphasis>.</para>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0014">The terms hospice and EOL care will be used interchangeably throughout this guide. It includes palliative care, hospice‐supported natural death or humane euthanasia, body care, memorialization, and grief support. In addition to prioritizing patient welfare and QOL, hospice also considers the caregiver’s needs and values. A peaceful and smooth euthanasia may be a goal for many caregivers, but it is not the ultimate measure of successful EOL care. It may be one of the goals for a particular patient, but the ultimate successful outcome is a caregiver who feels no regret in the wake of their beloved animal’s death.</para>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0015">There can be conflict at times between the caregiver’s perspectives and desires and the animal’s welfare, but hospice does not involve prolonging the life of the animal to help the caregiver avoid processing their grief. Hospice can involve veterinarian‐supervised, hospice‐supported natural death where euthanasia is always available if required for animal welfare<citation>ch0011-c1-bib-0001</citation>. However, it must be understood that hospice does not involve natural death without supervision or intervention.</para>

      <title>1.3 Psychosocial Considerations</title>
      <anchor id="ch0011-head-2-5"/>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0020">In hospice care, the patient unit includes not just the animal, but also its caregivers. While the needs and welfare of the animal patient are always the first priority, the needs and values of the caregivers are also thoroughly explored and prioritized. This consideration of the caregiver’s perspective is key to a shared decision‐making paradigm. The EOL care team and caregivers are partners who share information and determine the appropriate course of action together (seeSection 1.4). The ideal treatment plan is of no use if the caregivers are not able to implement and maintain the plan. <link linkend="ch0011-c1-tbl-0001">Table 1.1</link> will help guide technicians through the exploration of the caregiver’s perspective, which will help inform the veterinarian’s individualized care plan.</para>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0032">Caregivers experience a burden of care when supporting their EOL companion animals that can have a significant impact on their own QOL. This burden can be complicated by guilt when a caregiver’s psychosocial concerns impact their ability to care for their pet. Caregivers often experience guilt when they have to make treatment decisions based on their lifestyle and resources rather than purely based on the needs and welfare of their pet. Offering caregivers the opportunity to express their concerns and limitations may help address any guilt about how psychosocial factors must inform treatment choices. Factoring caregiver burden into EOL decision making will be discussed in<ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 8</ulink>.</para>

         <beginpage pagenum="7"/>An IDT is a group of professionals from multiple disciplines and other <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10321">stakeholders</ulink> invested in the patient’s and family’s needs, working together toward a common goal. A team with complementary skill sets and expertise can accomplish more and achieve better outcomes than any member of the team on their own <citation>ch0011-c1-bib-0004</citation>. While team‐based medicine is common in the veterinary field, the members of the team in EOL care change and multiply to include more disciplines. The veterinarian is generally the leader of the IDT as the medical director for the team. Technicians are core team members, often acting as the “eyes and ears” of the veterinarian by communicating with the client, monitoring the patient, and reporting back to the IDT. The team can include other veterinary professionals, veterinary support staff, other animal care workers, mental health professionals, burial and cremation partners, memorialization partners, volunteers, and more. <link linkend="ch0011-c1-tbl-0002">Table 1.2</link> lists some common members of IDTs in veterinary EOL care and technicians may be able to identify others that would be valuable on their team.</para>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0040">An IDT may be established to support a dedicated EOL care service, or it may form out of a veterinary team within an existing practice. It is not uncommon for team members to self‐identify as wishing to be part of an EOL care team.

With that said, it is certainly possible to offer AHPC in other business models and there are pros and cons with each. Hospice care can be offered through existing veterinary facilities and integrated into <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10343">primary care</ulink> or offered as an ancillary service in a general or specialty veterinary practice.

They rely on their veterinary teams to guide them, so it is important that AHPC alternatives and home care are discussed as options, even if it is not available through their regular veterinarian. Existing veterinary facilities may refer to other mobile services when requested for home visits, including euthanasia. This is a common way to provide flexibility and options to families beyond what the facility has the capacity to offer. As AHPC becomes more prominent as its own specialized field within veterinary medicine, more clients are seeking flexibility and options, and more veterinary professionals are interested in providing these options. An existing veterinary facility may establish its own mobile unit to expand the EOL care services it offers to include home care. This could be limited to home euthanasia or could be expanded to include home hospice consultations and care plans (seePro Tip 1.3 and 1.4).</para>

      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0063">Telemedicine services must be structured so that the time spent is somehow compensated. Each facility will identify its own approach, and often multiple approaches are advised to fit different situations (e.g. different fees for technician vs. veterinarian telemedicine support). Fee structures may include direct charges for telemedicine consultations, inclusion of telemedicine follow‐up in initial consultation fees, or even hospice care service packages with a defined amount of telemedicine support included for a pre‐paid fee. The author has found the service plans to be utilized most in advanced hospice situations where a high level of support is needed regularly (i.e. daily). Caregivers outside of advanced hospice are generally happy to pay a fee for telemedicine support as needed and see the value of this service (<link linkend="ch0011-c1-fea-0006">Pro Tip 1.5</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0011-c1-para-0064">Telemedicine is most readily used within existing VCPRs but can sometimes be used in other situations. Veterinary practices may consider offering telemedicine QOL consultation for non‐clients provided no treatment recommendations are made in this context. This will differ significantly from a consultation within a VCPR, and the client must be made explicitly aware of the limitations at the outset. This consultation is structured as a guided exploration of QOL concepts with probing questions to help the caregiver consider their animal’s individual context. At the consultation's end, the client would either be referred back to their regular veterinarian or asked to schedule an appointment to establish a VCPR before any treatments could be prescribed.</para>
