      <title>Companion Animal End‐of‐Life Care: From Quality of Life to Quality of Dying</title>
      <anchor id="ch0008-head-2-1214"/>
      <para id="ch0008-f3-para-0030">Most veterinary technicians working with companion animals engage in end‐of‐life (EOL) care. This may involve comfort care for the animal, support for the caregiver(s), facilitating humane euthanasia or supported natural death, body care and memorialization, and grief support. Stated so simply, this fails to capture the depth and complexity of compassionate veterinary EOL care and what it means to the families who experience it and the technicians that help provide it. Some technicians who experience the significant meaning and reward of EOL care may find themselves called to pursue further education and leadership in this area. Informed technicians can help motivate change in their places of work to improve the standard of EOL care. Whatever role EOL care plays in your veterinary career, this resource should help you provide ethical, informed, and effective EOL care to your veterinary patients and their families.</para>
      <para id="ch0008-f3-para-0031">Animal hospice and palliative care (AHPC) is another term that describes animal EOL care. Hospice refers to the care of a dying patient, whereas palliative care simply refers to comfort care and can be offered to patients who are not EOL. For example, a dog that has ruptured their cranial cruciate ligament may receive care to relieve <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> and physiotherapy to maintain strength and mobility. This care provides for the animal's comfort but is not addressing the ruptured ligament. Is it not curative, it is simply for comfort and would be considered palliative care. Palliative care is a crucial part of hospice/EOL care. EOL care cannot exist without palliative care, but palliative care does exist outside of EOL care. This resource is focused on EOL care and will not examine palliative care outside of this context in any depth. However, there can be much discussion about when “end‐of‐life” occurs. If an animal lives with a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">chronic illness</ulink> that will impact their lifespan, when do they transition into EOL care? Is it when life‐threatening complications appear? Or could this animal be considered EOL at the time of diagnosis with a life‐limiting ailment? Some life‐limiting <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1125">chronic illnesses</ulink> can be effectively managed for years with appropriate treatment. Beginning a relationship with an animal patient and caregiver earlier in the course of disease can allow an AHPC team to have more impact. This will be discussed further in Part I: Introduction to Animal Hospice and Palliative Care.</para>
      <para id="ch0008-f3-para-0032">The human–animal bond is at the center of companion animal veterinary medicine. This is never truer than at the end of life. As we explore the techniques and tools that technicians may employ in EOL care, we must keep in mind that this bond is at the heart of everything we do. Providing compassionate and effective EOL care supports the human–animal bond even beyond the moment of death. In helping to provide a peaceful and meaningful EOL experience, technicians can help animal caregivers and families avoid the burden of doubt regarding their choices or actions, known as<emphasis>decisional regret</emphasis>. The avoidance of this regret can be considered as one of the primary goals and successful outcomes of compassionate EOL care.</para>

         <beginpage/>The benefits of providing quality EOL care go beyond the animals and their families and extend to the veterinary professionals and businesses that employ them. Clients who have positive experiences with EOL care are more likely to return to that veterinary facility and refer others. Experienced veterinary technicians also know that positive EOL experiences tend to be one of the most common reasons that clients express gratitude to a clinic or hospital with thank‐you notes or gifts. A reputation for providing excellent EOL care is something that spreads in a community and benefits the business.</para>
      <para id="ch0008-f3-para-0034">Offering a high standard of EOL care improves job satisfaction and morale among veterinary staff, with positive benefits for the individual and the working environment. Some technicians may even find themselves so inspired by their experiences that they choose to devote their careers to the study and practice of veterinary EOL care. The presence of passionate leaders within a team and within a community serves to elevate the standard of EOL care for the benefit of all: the animal, the family, the veterinary team, and the business.</para>
      <para id="ch0008-f3-para-0035">As a technician, there are many ways in which you might participate in EOL care. In your medical role, you may intake clients and their pets, gather medical histories, perform physical assessments and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> assessments, provide medical treatments and nursing care, teach caregivers to administer care, and participate in humane euthanasia and body care. Technicians in EOL care are crucial points of contact in communication with caregivers in their medical role, but they can also be a significant source of emotional support for those caregivers. Technicians can advocate for the best interests of the pet when communicating with the client and with other members of the veterinary team. They can be utilized as the eyes and ears of the veterinarian to offer care more efficiently.</para>
      <para>This guide will discuss specific skills, tools, and techniques technicians may implement in EOL care. In doing so, we must also acknowledge the many soft skills that are invaluable in this work. There are many qualities that allow veterinary technicians to be successful in EOL care:</para>

      <para id="ch0008-f3-para-0043">This guide will focus primarily on canine and feline patients but acknowledges that many other species may be considered companions including equines, small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Most companion animal general practices will at least assist with euthanasia of exotic pets (i.e. small mammals, reptiles, birds) even if they do not have the knowledge or skills to offer more in‐depth hospice and palliative care. Part III will include some basic information regarding exotic pet euthanasia to support this, but a detailed discussion of hospice and palliative care in exotic pets is beyond the scope of this volume. Equine and other large animal companions will not be directly included in this guide, although many of the same principles and practices could be applied in large animal EOL care.</para>

         <beginpage/>There are excellent, comprehensive resources available for the additional detail and topics not covered in this guide, and you will see many referenced throughout. The most notable at the time of this publication are <emphasis>Hospice and Palliative Care for Companion Animals: Principles and Practice</emphasis> by Shanan, Pierce, and Shearer (2023); <emphasis>Veterinary Euthanasia Techniques: A Practical Guide</emphasis> by Cooney, Chappell, Callan, and Connally (2012); and the International Association of Animal Hospice and Palliative Care’s Certification Program.</para>
      <para id="ch0008-f3-para-0046">This resource is meant to equip you with practical information to apply routinely in your work as a veterinary technician. It will be the most useful to you when kept readily available during your daily workflow. To make the information more accessible, consider highlighting sections, adding your own notes, and inserting tabs for quick reference.</para>
      <para id="ch0008-f3-para-0047">Technician students and recent graduates often express that the communication portion of EOL care is the part of their role where they feel the least prepared and the most anxious. To that end, we have devoted a significant portion of this resource to practical communication techniques, case studies, and language examples. As you gain experience and begin to develop the language and approach that works best for you, we encourage you to share with your colleagues. We learn much from each other and debriefing about experiences, both positive and negative, helps everyone grow.</para>
      <para id="ch0008-f3-para-0048">Effective companion animal EOL care is provided by a team. We all lift each other up with our individual strengths. It follows that this guide was authored by a team. We are honored to be joined by expert colleagues as we move through sections on AHPC, EOL communication, euthanasia techniques, and grief and memorialization.</para>
