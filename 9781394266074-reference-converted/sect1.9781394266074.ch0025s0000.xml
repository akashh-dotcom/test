      <title>13.1 Introduction</title>
      <anchor id="ch0025-head-2-159"/>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0003">Assisting caregivers with the handling of their deceased pet is a special part of a veterinary technician’s job. It is an honor to care for the pet patient in life and carry that forward in death, even in small ways. Respectful deceased body care has evolved significantly in recent years. The standard for decades was the traditional practice of placing a body in a refuse bag and telling caregivers what their options are. Today we have matured into using designated, branded <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=809">cadaver</ulink> bags and putting caregivers in control of how they want to memorialize their pet. The hospice industry has been a big driver in this paradigm shift, in part because of the extra attention given to the human–animal bond and simply asking caregivers what’s important to them.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0004">In a 2021 study, caregivers were asked about the things that matter to them the most during the loss of a pet<citation>ch0025-c13-bib-0001</citation>. Not surprisingly, many shared how important it is to know their pet’s body is being treated carefully and with love. For those who find it hard to say goodbye to the body, the unknowns can be alarming. <link linkend="ch0025-c13-tbl-0001">Table 13.1</link> shows some of the more common concerns expressed by caregivers once their pet leaves their side. Some of the bigger issues center around how much time it would take for the pet to arrive at the aftercare facility and how people would be handling the body. Mislabeling the body and missing special memorialization requests were also worrisome for many. The least concerning detail was whether deceased pets would be in close proximity to other deceased pets, indicating that there is an acceptance of this normal protocol in veterinary medicine and perhaps even a benefit as the pet is not alone.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0005">
         <link linkend="ch0025-c13-tbl-0001">Table 13.1</link> from the 2021 pet aftercare study showing what’s important to caregivers and their concerns.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0007">To better align with what caregivers desire and expect after the death of their pet, pre‐death discussions about such matters should increase confidence and understanding. Technicians who talk through options and inform on what is normal in aftercare services give some semblance of control to caregivers during a time when they feel they have little. They did not want their beloved pet to die, wishing instead to continue being together. Whether through euthanasia or a natural passing, the death is forcing a new “normal” upon them, and having control over aftercare choices becomes an important next step in the grief journey.</para>

         <beginpage pagenum="204"/>Veterinary technicians in general practice, specialty centers, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> rooms, and mobile hospice services have a unique opportunity to shine during aftercare discussions and preparations. As partners to the family or individual caregivers, technicians are able to talk openly as friends to learn what’s important, and to follow through with requests to not only meet the expectations of owners but to exceed them. Technicians are commonly tasked with managing aftercare details which range from discussing locally available options, collecting payments, preparing the body, and contacting the aftercare company to relay requests. Generally speaking, technicians are comfortable working with both living and deceased animals, having gone through similar anatomy and procedural training as veterinarians. With adequate communication skills, technicians are equipped to have hard conversations around death and aftercare.</para>

      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0009">There are two ways in which aftercare arrangements may be made following the death of a pet. The first and more traditional way is to have the veterinary team be the liaison between the caregiver and aftercare service. The second and more modern approach is to invite the caregiver to take the <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> on aftercare decisions and arrangements directly with the aftercare company. Both approaches have pros and cons. In the coming years, the animal hospice industry will likely help shape the best ordering model that makes sense for the caregiver, the veterinary team, and aftercare personnel.</para>

Technicians are often tasked with informing caregivers of their choices, recording wishes for their deceased pet following death, collecting payment for aftercare requests, and ordering such services through the aftercare company. In this way, the veterinary company, rather than the caregiver, becomes the client of the aftercare company and is ultimately responsible for carrying out what the caregiver expects. This model lessens the pressure placed on grieving caregivers to understand the nuances of aftercare services. Instead, the seasoned veterinary team can act as funeral directors, making arrangements on the caregivers’ behalf, which is something they have likely done for countless clients. The downside is that caregivers are typically only informed about the options the veterinary team wants to relay. More aftercare options may exist that caregivers miss out on because they do not know about them. This model also requires a clear chain of custody by the veterinary team to safely ensure the deceased patient is handled correctly without mistake.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0025-head-3-126"/>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0011">A new aftercare ordering model has been emerging that invites caregivers to work directly with the aftercare company. This model places aftercare decisions in the hands of caregivers, allowing them increased choice and opportunity to learn what an aftercare company offers, without the pressure of making decisions just before or during euthanasia. Following the death of the pet, caregivers can take time to make their aftercare choices (e.g. private cremation, urn selection, paw print keepsake). This model places caregivers in the unique position to fully understand their options and mirrors human death care much more closely. Caregivers who opt for advanced care for their pet at the end of life may appreciate more aftercare control. The difficulty with this model occurs when caregivers would prefer to not make such decisions and would rather rely on the veterinary team to handle all arrangements for them. However, 45% of caregivers claim to already know what they want<citation>ch0025-c13-bib-0001</citation>.</para>

      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0012">Whether caring for deceased pets in specialized end‐of‐life (EOL) care or general practice, veterinary staff have an obligation to handle the body with respect. Caregivers want to know their beloved pet was treated with the same dignity and respect shown to humans, especially when they<anchor id="ch0025-Page_206"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="206"/>have received such care and attention during the EOL journey <citation>ch0025-c13-bib-0002</citation>. Technicians are well‐suited to ensure deceased patients are lovingly handled and will safely reach their destination. In conversations with technicians over the years, this author has heard many express the desire to see patients cared for as well as their own pets, and that doing so improves job satisfaction.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0013">When death is confirmed and caregivers have left the area, technicians may begin to prepare the body for aftercare. The body containment vessel (e.g. <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=809">cadaver</ulink> bag, casket, or basket) is brought into the room and the body is gently placed inside. This requires effort to support all parts of the body as it is lifted and moved into position. Depending on the type of containment, absorbent pads may be placed under the body to collect fluids. By doing this preparation in the room where the patient died, the body will already be concealed when moving it to the holding area in the hospital or out of the home. This reduces the visualization of death by other personnel/people and prevents the spread of disease.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0014">Trash bags, or plastic bags that resemble them, have been the standard containment style since the mid twentieth century (see<link linkend="ch0025-c13-fig-0001">Figure 13.1</link>). They are purchased from hardware or retail stores or from veterinary supply distributors to hold the bodies of both large and small companion pets. It can feel uncomfortable and disrespectful to place an animal in the same type of bag used for waste, as if to convey that once deceased the body no longer has meaning. While trash bags were the norm, veterinary teams rarely placed pets inside them in front of owners, perhaps out of embarrassment or disapproval of having nothing better. Trash bags easily puncture, especially with long toenails, and tend to tear and leak bodily fluids. While the cost of trash bags is minimal, a more respectful body container is important to caregivers and trash bags are no longer accep<citation>ch0025-c13-bib-0001</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0015">In recent years, body containment options have been evolving into something more akin to human aftercare. Designated, branded <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=809">cadaver</ulink> bags such as Euthabag© were designed to be specifically used for companion animals (<link linkend="ch0025-c13-fig-0002">Figure 13.2</link>). Created by Canadian veterinarian Dr. Celine Leheurteux, Euthabags are leakproof, puncture‐proof, and meant to be shown to clients. Deceased pets may be placed in them with loved ones watching if they desire, and the body is then taken home for burial or for transport by the caregiver to the crematory. It is acceptable to have the caregiver help place the pet inside the bag and the hospital holds it for crematory pickup. The goal is for caregivers to be as involved as they wish and for the veterinary team to feel proud of the <anchor id="ch0025-Page_207"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="207"/>container they are using. Bags such as Euthabag may be decorated with tribute messages and artwork of significance to the family, making them an attractive option for children who want to participate (<link linkend="ch0025-c13-fig-0003">Figure 13.3</link>).</para>

All soft tissue in the body is burned away and what remains is the bony skeleton, and perhaps metal implants if they were surgically placed during the course of the pet’s life. Many people do not realize that ash is bone without any other parts of the body. Technicians may explain this early in the decision‐making process.</para>

There is some discrepancy around the term “individual” among crematory companies. If this is not carefully clarified with the crematory, veterinary teams and caregivers may think a private cremation is being done, when in actuality an individual cremation is being performed. Caregivers who believe they are only receiving their pet’s ashes may be upset to find that their pet was in the cremation chamber with other animals. Comingling of ashes may occur, meaning a pet’s ashes could contain fragments of another’s. The best approach is to ensure caregivers understand what is taking place, so they make highly informed decisions (<link linkend="ch0025-c13-fea-0002">Communication Corner 13.1</link>).</para>

Depending on what the items are made of, such as plastic and <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14980">rubber</ulink>, the crematory may decide not to cremate them to reduce hazardous gas emissions. Technicians who know what can and cannot be cremated with the pet’s body can relay the information to the caregiver.

Rules around burial tend to include how close the burial proximity is to town/city boundaries, if it’s close to a flood plain or <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> source, and the size of the body.

Known formally as alkaline hydrolysis, aquamation (also called <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink>‐based cremation, flameless cremation, green cremation, biocremation, or Resomation®) is touted as an environmentally friendly alternative to cremation, using little to no natural gas and producing minimal carbon emissions. The process of eliminating the body’s soft tissue requires hot <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink>, alkali salts (e.g. <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13083">potassium</ulink> hydroxide and <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13088">sodium</ulink> hydroxide), movement of the solution over the body, and time. The deceased pet is placed in a stainless‐steel compartment, usually next to other pets in the machine at the same time, although separated by dividers to reduce the commingling of bone (see<link linkend="ch0025-c13-fig-0007">Figure 13.7</link>). When the aquamation unit holds an appropriate amount of predetermined <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=673">body weight</ulink>, the salts are added, and the machine begins its cycle. Soft tissue undergoes dissolution to become <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink>, and what’s left is clean, wet bone. The bone is dried and processed into ash.</para>

Effluent is void of chemicals such as euthanasia solutions, chemotherapy, and other drugs.

      <anchor id="ch0025-head-3-130"/>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0043">Caregivers may desire to preserve their pet’s body through taxidermy or freeze‐drying. Taxidermy is the less common of the two options because it requires the removal of the animal’s skin and external features, which are then placed over a mannequin in a lifelike pose. This has proven challenging due to shrinkage and discoloration. Freeze drying, also known as lyophilization or cryodesiccation, is a low‐<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10176">temperature</ulink> <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1400">dehydration</ulink> process that involves freezing the body and lowering pressure, thereby removing the ice<citation>ch0025-c13-bib-0006</citation>. In other words, the body’s moisture is completely removed, leaving behind a lifelike form in any position the caregiver chooses. The caregiver tells the freeze‐drying company what position they wish, and after many months of undergoing the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1401">dehydration</ulink> process, the deceased pet is returned to the owner for display.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0044">Body preservation is one of the more expensive options for caregivers, however, if it is important to keep their pet looking as they did in life, technicians may inform them of the option. Preparation will include contacting the few freeze‐drying companies that exist in North America (and the world), with consideration for what it may take to ship a frozen deceased pet across country lines. Caregivers will need to think about the position they want their pet and its overall appearance (e.g. sleeping with eyes closed, eyes open with an inquisitive look, playful).</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0045">Partial body preservation may also be an attractive option to caregivers. They can elect to keep a part of their pet’s body but not all, and remove it themselves, or ask the veterinary team or aftercare company to assist. In this author’s experience, it is the veterinary team that handles this part due to their anatomy training and access to medical equipment (e.g. sharp knives, extraction tools). Common body parts requested for memorialization include ears, tails, nails, teeth, and skulls. Without some manner of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1400">dehydration</ulink> or <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Formal">formal</ulink> preservation, any body part with moisture is likely to decompose. If the complete skull is requested, the head will be collected, and the soft tissue removed through chemical dissolution or insect cleaning. What’s left is a dry skull, usually bleached white with the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10249">mandible</ulink> permanently attached. Technicians may be asked to remove a part of a pet’s body. If they are uncomfortable with the task, they can delegate it to their attending veterinarian. Some manner of policy should be in place regarding body part collection so everyone on the hospice team knows what can and cannot be done (<link linkend="ch0025-c13-fea-0005">Pro Tip 13.2</link>).</para>

      <anchor id="ch0025-head-3-131"/>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0047">In some communities, there may be the option to donate a deceased pet’s body to a teaching institution. Veterinary colleges are the most common donation site due to the demand for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=809">cadavers</ulink> in veterinary classes. Cadavers are a particularly valuable teaching aid for anatomy, surgery, and procedural labs. In this author’s experience, companion animal cadavers are becoming harder for teaching institutions to locate due to decreased donations from animal shelters.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0048">In a 2023 study from the United Kingdom, researchers looked at the option of body donation among caregivers. Not surprisingly, they found that most caregivers did not know body donation was an option. Many respondents took the opportunity to express a lack of understanding of the process involved in pet <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=809">cadaver</ulink> donation and felt that more information and education should be provided to owners<citation>ch0025-c13-bib-0007</citation>. The largest motivator for caregivers to donate was understanding that they were helping veterinary professionals learn, and if offered, could have their pet’s ashes returned, however, pet ashes given back to the caregiver after donation is not common. If it helps drive donations in areas of the world that need it, technicians may be able to help facilitate such an arrangement. The study also showed that teaching using ethically sourced cadavers is important to caregivers.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0049">Technicians can open discussion around pet body donation at the same time other aftercare options are given (<link linkend="ch0025-c13-fea-0006">Communication Corner 13.4</link>). Body donation can be included in a handout or listed on a website, explaining what it is and why it’s beneficial. If caregivers elect to donate their pet’s body, technicians will need to prepare the body in accordance with the donation site’s needs. Examples include either freezing the body or keeping it cold but not frozen. The body is ideally stored in a leakproof bag or container, and in some instances, the body may be given <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=10185">heparin</ulink> to prevent <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> clotting. This would be done just before death, during a euthanasia appointment. Technicians can learn such details in advance and be ready to help ensure the body is put to the best use. If the caregiver is expecting the ashes to be returned afterward and the donation site can comply, technicians will be extra vigilant with proper labeling.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0025-head-2-170"/>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0050">Technicians have the opportunity to help caregivers make aftercare choices that align with their values and preferences. Through careful planning, caregivers should have confidence that they made good decisions about the handling of their pet’s body. One of the primary jobs of technicians is to make sure that caregiver wishes are adhered to by the veterinary team and aftercare company. They will double and triple check details, especially in high volume EOL care services where large numbers of pets are dying, either naturally or through euthanasia. Did the caregiver get the pawprint they asked for? Did the team save the clipping of fur as planned? Such questions and details will need to be checked in advance of the body’s disposition.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0051">There may be times when caregivers later question their aftercare choices. It is fairly common for those who have selected to have their pet’s ashes returned to decide they don’t want them after all. In this author’s experience, hospitals regularly report a buildup of unclaimed ashes and are unsure how to manage them. Some cremation and aquamation companies will accept them back to either store them for eventual caregiver pickup or spread them in their standard fashion. Once they are spread, they are unretrievable. Some caregivers give permission to have the ashes spread, but most never respond to calls or emails, which leaves the decision of how best to proceed in the hands of the staff. It’s advisable to include aftercare agreement language that indicates how long ashes will be held for pickup, and where they will be spread if they stay beyond the allowable time (<link linkend="ch0025-c13-fea-0007">Communication Corner 13.5</link>). Holding ashes for one to six months is common and provides time for grieving caregivers to be emotionally ready to claim them or declare they do not want them. Providing this time is respectful and signifies that the veterinary team understands the complexities of loss.</para>
      <para id="ch0025-c13-para-0053">In a time when meeting expectations is hoped for, caregivers appreciate when EOL care teams go the extra mile to exceed aftercare expectations. Examples of this include returning ashes to clients in private spaces, reviewing the spelling of names for accuracy on keepsakes, and providing kind words of support. Caregivers receiving ashes, memorial items, or preserved body parts are often flooded with emotion as the reality of the death washes over them again. Technicians may use their compassion skills to offer comfort and support. This will be discussed in more detail in<ulink url="ch0028">Chapter 15</ulink>.</para>

For short‐term holding, refrigeration is adequate. A body may be held in refrigeration for up to seven days in reasonable preservation. If the body is left out in the environment for more than a few hours, it is best to keep it shielded from the sun and hot spaces. Ice packs can be placed near the body to reduce the body <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10176">temperature</ulink>.</para>
