      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0002">Pain assessment is an important part of the veterinary technician's role in companion animal end‐of‐life (EOL) care. Before pain can be managed, it must be recognized and characterized. Technicians well versed in recognizing and assessing pain serve as advocates to improve their patient’s quality of life (QOL). They communicate with the veterinarian to inform treatment plans, administer care to the patient, and educate caregivers regarding the assessment and impact of pain in their pet.</para>
      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0003">Assessing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> in animals is challenging primarily due to their inability to directly communicate the type, severity, and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10481">duration</ulink> of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> to their caregivers and veterinary team. This is further complicated by the fact that animals have evolved to hide <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> and weakness as a safety mechanism against potential threats. These barriers can prevent caregivers from providing a full history of the onset and impact of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> and may obscure the technician’s assessment of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink>. Effective education and training allow technicians to overcome some of these challenges. This chapter will summarize current information on <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> assessment in companion animals, but technicians must also routinely engage in continuing education to ensure they are providing the most informed and up‐to‐date care possible.</para>

      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0025">Pain scales may be either simple or multidimensional in their construction and use. Pain is complex and simple scales may not provide sufficient information to effectively assess pain, particularly in EOL patients who may be experiencing multiple types of pain. Simple scales also tend to be more subjective in nature compared to multidimensional tools. Multidimensional pain scales are more comprehensive and tend to be more objective than simple scales. These tools combine physical and behavioral indicators of pain to examine multiple aspects of the clinical presentation of pain. Many pain scales are designed specifically to evaluate acute pain, and while they may be useful for acute‐on‐chronic pain, they are less appropriate for the assessment of animals experiencing chronic pain. Veterinary teams must identify which tools are most appropriate for their purposes and become familiar with them to improve reliability between assessments both within and between observers.</para>

      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0042">The initial assessment of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> must always occur in the context of a veterinary consultation and will include evaluation of both physical and behavioral indicators of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>. Technicians should document <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10172">respiration rate</ulink> and effort as well as a temperament assessment before any direct handling. Any items of the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> score that can be evaluated without direct handling should be completed before a physical assessment is begun. This is to prevent FAS and sympathetic activation from obscuring the results.</para>
      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0043">Pain should be re‐evaluated regularly and each pain score documented in the medical records. This allows the veterinary team and caregivers to monitor for response to treatment and trends over time. Some of the pain scales have an explicit threshold at which re‐evaluation of the treatment plan and intervention is recommended. The veterinary team and caregivers must establish a framework to determine when pain score changes will trigger re‐evaluation and possible intervention within an individualized treatment plan. Proactive monitoring by the technician and caregivers can help to identify changes such as breakthrough pain, which allows fast intervention to minimize pain crises and neuropathic pain, and support QOL.</para>
      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0044">In the EOL context, we often rely on caregivers to record observations such as <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> scores at home between veterinary visits. Consistent use of the same tool is important for caregivers to develop familiarity with the tool which improves accuracy and reliability for monitoring <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> trends. With that said, caregivers may require flexibility in the initial selection of a tool that is most accessible for them as an individual. A technician may provide the tool with the most scientific evidence behind it, but if the caregiver finds it too difficult or overwhelming to use then they will not use it effectively. It is advisable to introduce more than one <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> scale (no more than 2–3) and demonstrate their use. The caregivers can try them out and let the technician know which one they prefer. The best <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> scale in the world is no good if the client does not use it! Once a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> scoring system is selected that will meet the needs of the EOL care team, patient and family, then it is of utmost importance that its use is implemented and continued regularly. That leads to the question of how frequently should a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> scale be used to evaluate EOL patients?</para>
      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0045">Recommendations for the frequency of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> scoring must be determined on a case‐by‐case basis and may vary from monthly or bimonthly to multiples times in a single day. A patient in the early stages of hospice care may not be experiencing significant progression or change. This patient may be well managed with once or twice monthly <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> scoring until any noticeable changes trigger a re‐evaluation sooner. A patient receiving advanced hospice care with many changes occurring may need to be evaluated multiple times in a week or a day. The frequency of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> scoring will be decided in discussion between the caregiver and veterinary team. Any time a change in the animal’s physical state or behavior is noted, a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> assessment is recommended. Any time there is a change in the treatment plan, a follow‐up <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> assessment is recommended to evaluate the impact of the intervention. The technician plays an important role in communicating the plan and following up as caregivers monitor <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> at home (<link linkend="ch0012-c2-fea-0005">Pro Tip 2.4</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0046">The frequency of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> scoring will vary between cases and within cases depending on the patient’s status, veterinary recommendations, and caregiver limitations.

Follow up and provide support to improve compliance with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> scoring at home. Suggest a way for caregivers to keep track of the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> scores for their own reference (i.e. a journal or calendar) and make a plan for them to provide this information to the EOL care team.</para>

      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0047">An excellent strategy to improve caregiver compliance with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> scoring is to offer a more comprehensive <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> assessment tool paired with a more simplified approach to document impressions of QOL between more thorough <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> assessments. The comprehensive <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> scale can be used on a determined schedule (i.e. monthly or weekly) and when there are patient concerns or treatment changes.

      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0048">Skilled and knowledgeable veterinary technicians are excellent patient advocates, client educators, and communicators. Technicians can empower caregivers of EOL pets with information and skills that allow them to be more active partners in their pet’s care. Techniques for building effective communication skills will be discussed further in Part II.</para>
      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0049">Caregiver education should always be supported with resources that the caregiver can refer to when the veterinary team is no longer present. This may include physical or digital copies of information handouts, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> assessment tools, and items such as links to online instructional videos. A written copy of the pet’s treatment plan should also be provided to caregivers. It will ideally include descriptions of the most likely behavioral and physical indicators of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> for their individual pet, recommendations of how often to complete <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> and QOL assessments, and the method to communicate that information to the veterinary team. Comprehensive, multidimensional scales should be utilized for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> assessment wherever possible. This is easy to do when the evaluator is a veterinary professional but can be challenging when caregivers are asked to use the same tools. Caregivers may require significant education and support from the EOL care team to feel comfortable applying these tools to their pets at home. It is well worth the effort on the part of the EOL team to provide this support.</para>
      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0050">Avoid overwhelming caregivers with too many options for <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> assessment tools, while still offering flexibility in identifying tools that they are comfortable using. If there is more than one caregiver, each caregiver may feel comfortable using a different <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> scale. This can even be advantageous, as the assessments from multiple observers can be compared to offer multiple perspectives on the pet’s <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink>. Different caregivers may see different parts of an animal’s daily routine. So even if caregivers choose the same <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> score system, it can be helpful for each caregiver to complete it separately and then discuss where their assessments overlap and differ.</para>
      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0051">Interested caregivers may also be empowered to record certain elements of a physical assessment, such as respiratory rate. There are elements of a physical assessment performed by veterinarians and technicians that are not reasonable for most caregivers to perform (e.g. cardiac auscultation or abdominal palpation), but there are elements that caregivers can be taught to perform if they are willing and properly trained (e.g. taking heart rates by palpating the apex beat and recording respiratory rates by watching the rise and fall of the chest). Assigning simple physical assessment tasks to interested caregivers can improve the quality of in‐home monitoring, offer the veterinary team more information between visits, and give caregivers an increased sense of control and active involvement in their pet’s care. This can help to relieve some of the anxiety caregivers may feel during the EOL journey.</para>

For instance, a person who has never experienced an infected tooth or bone <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2225">fracture</ulink> may not be able to relate to the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> those conditions can cause. Conversely, if a person has experienced painful conditions but they fail to see the signs that they experienced in their pet, they may falsely believe that their pet is not in the same <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> they felt. Until they receive education about the signs of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> in animals, caregivers may miss the subtle indicators that show the impact of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> on their pet. For this reason, there should be a concerted effort to educate caregivers on the signs of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> proactively rather than reactively (seePro Tip 2.5).</para>
      <para id="ch0012-c2-para-0061">Technicians encountering challenges with caregivers’ comprehension and recognition of signs of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> may inquire about the caregiver’s perspectives and experiences with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> as it can help guide conversations about <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> in a more directed fashion. This can also be important when it comes to caregivers expressing concerns about administering treatments. Caregivers may be hesitant to administer prescribed treatments if they perceive there is a potential harm from adverse effects of pharmaceuticals, or if they fear that the administration will be stressful. Technicians cannot address these concerns if they do not know about them. Seeking the client’s perspective is key, both at the time of starting into an EOL care plan, but also as the implementation and impact of the plan on both patients and caregivers is evaluated. Helping caregivers recognize <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> and understand and agree that there is a need to intervene is the first step. This can be followed by thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of treatments and exploration of multimodal analgesic options, including nonpharmaceutical modalities which is the subject of<ulink url="ch0013">Chapter 3</ulink>.</para>
