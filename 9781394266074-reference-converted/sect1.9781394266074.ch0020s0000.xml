      <anchor id="ch0020-head-2-108"/>
      <para id="ch0020-c9-para-0002">Companion animal end‐of‐life (EOL) care often involves complex communication, which must be handled with skill and empathy by veterinary technicians. Multiple facets of the approach to EOL communication have been examined in previous chapters on quality of life (QOL) assessments, applied communication techniques, supporting difficult conversations, and ethical EOL decision‐making. This chapter will explore two further components of EOL communication: educating clients about the animal experience of dying and building technician awareness of hospice‐supported natural death as an alternative to euthanasia.</para>
      <para id="ch0020-c9-para-0003">Educating caregivers and families on what to expect through the process of dying and the moment of death can be challenging as death is unpredictable and the appearance can vary between individuals. Euthanasia gives some predictability to companion animal death but is still accompanied by visible signs of dying, which must be explained. Hospice‐supported natural death is becoming more common in veterinary medicine and requires significantly different communication compared to euthanasia. Veterinary technicians will build confidence in these conversations as they gain experience, but having a baseline of knowledge should allow technicians at any stage in their career to support caregivers. If further information and guidance are needed, technicians should not hesitate to engage more experienced veterinary professionals in these communications. This is particularly important when it comes to discussing hospice‐supported natural death, as many veterinary teams have little experience with those cases. If a certified hospice and palliative veterinarian (CHPV) or dedicated EOL care service is present in your area, it is advisable to refer pet caregivers interested in hospice‐supported natural death to those teams.</para>
      <para id="ch0020-c9-para-0004">Referral is a valuable tool, but do not underestimate the impact of an existing relationship and rapport with caregivers. When engaging in discussions about hospice‐supported natural death, caregivers will appreciate any information and support their regular veterinary practice can provide, even if they are ultimately referred or decide against hospice‐supported natural death. Technicians should develop a basic understanding of the approach to hospice‐supported natural<anchor id="ch0020-Page_138"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="138"/>death to support more effective communication with clients considering this path. Realistic discussions of what may be involved are a crucial part of the decision‐making process and will be introduced in this chapter.</para>
      <para id="ch0020-c9-para-0005">When communicating about EOL decision‐making in veterinary medicine, the published literature is largely focused on euthanasia. With the development of the Animal Hospice and Palliative Care (AHPC) movement and the founding of the International Association of Animal Hospice and Palliative Care (IAAHPC), the awareness of and requests for hospice‐supported natural death are increasing. Technicians should avoid trying to sway clients toward hospice‐supported natural death or euthanasia and instead seek to educate and support them in making their own informed decision. Whether the caregivers decide upon humane euthanasia or hospice‐supported natural death, they will want to understand what to expect in the dying process and at the time of death. This chapter will explore the observable signs of dying and death, considerations for choosing hospice‐supported natural death as an alternative to euthanasia, ethical dilemmas that may be encountered, and an introduction to practical nursing strategies for palliation during natural death.</para>

      <title>9.2 Animal Experience of Dying</title>
      <anchor id="ch0020-head-2-109"/>
      <para id="ch0020-c9-para-0006">Death is a process that varies between individuals. There are many changes that can signal the start of the process days or even weeks prior to the moment of death. As the body’s systems begin to fail, there is a transition from attempting to maintain homeostasis to progressive loss of function. The appearance of this will change depending on the underlying disease processes affecting the individual. For example, an animal undergoing <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2608">congestive heart failure</ulink> (CHF) will present with signs relating to poor circulation and insufficient tissue oxygenation, whereas an animal succumbing to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=7478">kidney failure</ulink> will present with signs associated with <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6234">uremia</ulink> and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1400">dehydration</ulink>. The dying process presents differently in each of these animals but in both cases will culminate in cardiovascular collapse and physical signs that indicate a catastrophic failure of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13108">oxygen</ulink> delivery to tissue.</para>

      <para id="ch0020-c9-para-0007">Literature on the process of dying is lacking in veterinary medicine. When it comes to a description of the expected physical and behavioral changes, many refer to Gail Pope’s “Soar, My Butterfly: The Animal Dying Experience.”<citation>ch0020-c9-bib-0001</citation> Pope is the founder of the BrightHaven Center for Animal Rescue, Hospice, and Holistic Education, which cared for over 600 animals from 1990 to 2018. While Pope is not a veterinary professional, their extensive amount of experience supporting animals through death has allowed them to observe and communicate what may be expected during an animal’s experience of dying.

This must include plans for supporting the animal’s care financially and logistically, and identifying any barriers or challenges in doing so. Death is unpredictable, and EOL care teams and caregivers must be prepared for the unpredictability of the timeframe and support needs. The interdisciplinary team will need to be well‐positioned to provide care throughout the process, which often requires 24‐hour care in the advanced stage of dying. If there is a question about the feasibility of providing this care, then a serious discussion must be had as to whether hospice‐supported natural death is an ethical decision for that animal and family. A realistic discussion of the requirements of hospice‐supported natural death often brings caregivers to the realization that this is not a feasible path for them to take (<link linkend="ch0020-c9-fea-0002">Case Study 9.1</link>).</para>

Supporting these discussions and obtaining informed consent should occur as early as possible in the hospice relationship so there is time to compassionately communicate without pressure. Offering caregivers options, information, and time to process allows them to feel a sense of control in a situation where it otherwise may feel lacking (see<link linkend="ch0020-c9-fea-0003">Pro Tip 9.2</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0020-c9-para-0049">Caregivers making EOL decisions for their pets need to be effectively informed, so that they have realistic expectations.

They may feel ashamed, embarrassed, or guilty about changing their mind and avoid reaching out. A compassionate technician can check in and simply ask if the caregiver has any questions or concerns at this time. With a good rapport, this may be enough to open the door to discuss a change in plan such as a change to humane euthanasia.</para>

      <para id="ch0020-c9-para-0048">Preferences for EOL may be indicated on a consent form with three options: (1) hospice‐supported natural death with euthanasia only acceptable if it is deemed necessary to prevent suffering, (2) hospice‐supported natural death preferred but euthanasia is just as acceptable if circumstances require, and (3) planned euthanasia is preferred. The consent form should include a stipulation that euthanasia may be required if unnecessary suffering cannot effectively be prevented for any reason. If caregivers are unwilling to agree to this stipulation, the veterinarian will need to be prepared to terminate the veterinarian–client–patient relationship (VCPR) on ethical grounds. It is the author’s experience that compassionate and effective communication with caregivers avoids this level of conflict in most instances. Technicians play a major role in preventing this situation by supporting thorough, patient EOL conversations with empathy.

When Lydia declined, an esophageal feeding tube was placed, but the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> veterinarian also filed a report with the local humane society out of concern for Buttons’ poor condition and referred Buttons to a hospice service.</para>
         <para id="ch0020-c9-para-0055">A technician collected a history over the phone and arranged an initial home hospice consultation with the CHPV. The consultation went well, and a treatment plan was agreed upon and implemented to manage <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>, secondary infection, nutrition, and care of the feeding tube. During the consultation, Lydia indicated her preference for a hospice‐supported natural death.

Lydia signed a consent form and a caregiver responsibilities document indicating her agreement.</para>
         <para id="ch0020-c9-para-0056">Buttons responded well to palliative care in the first few weeks. After one month of palliative care, Buttons started to experience some challenges. The area around her feeding tube was dirty and inflamed and the tube was clogged. Lydia spoke to a technician on the phone and revealed that she hadn’t been able to clean around the tube or flush it like the care plan said because Buttons was getting more fractious with handling. The technician had Lydia bring Buttons into the clinic so they could evaluate the feeding tube. The area around the feeding tube was significantly infected. The veterinarian tried to unclog the feeding tube but was unable to and recommended removing it. This left two options: (1) placing a new tube under anesthesia, or (2) leaving the tube out and respecting Buttons’ withdrawal from food and allowing her to progress through the dying process.</para>

After a significant investment of time and excellent use of empathic communication skills, Lydia was still upset and unwilling to proceed with any of the veterinarian's treatment plans, or humane euthanasia. At that point, the technician suggested to the veterinarian that they may need to discuss terminating the VCPR. The veterinarian followed up with Lydia and was unable to change the course of the communication. Unfortunately, the phone call concluded with termination of the VCPR and the veterinarian informed the humane society that Lydia is declining further care from their team. The humane society called the team a week later to let them know they contacted Lydia and Buttons had already died at home.</para>
