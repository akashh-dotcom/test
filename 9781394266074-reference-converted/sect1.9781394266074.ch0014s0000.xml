      <title>4.1 Introduction</title>
      <anchor id="ch0014-head-2-42"/>
      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0002">Palliative nursing is an important part of the individualized care plan for companion animals at the end‐of‐life (EOL). Nursing techniques that attend to general patient comfort and clinical sign relief can be highly impactful in improving quality of life (QOL). Many nursing strategies can also be taught to caregivers, which empowers them to be more active and engaged members of their pet’s EOL care team. This is often an important contribution to the human–animal bond (HAB) during the EOL period.</para>
      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0003">As discussed in<ulink url="ch0011">Chapter 1</ulink>, the personalized care plan will be prescribed by the veterinarian based on the needs of the patient, the goals of care, and any limitations established with the caregivers in a shared decision‐making paradigm. Technicians can play an active role in the development, implementation, and monitoring of the care plan. The roles of the technician in EOL care can be discussed in three categories: medical, educational, and advocatory <citation>ch0014-c4-bib-0001</citation>. In their medical role, technicians assess the patient, provide care, and access medical resources to support the patient and family. As educators, technicians interpret medical information for the family and teach them how to implement nursing strategies that are appropriate for the caregivers to perform. Maintaining this important linkage between the veterinary team, patient, and caregivers uniquely positions technicians as patient and caregiver advocates who contribute to the efficacy of an interdisciplinary care team.</para>
      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0004">Technicians will establish a regular schedule of communication between the caregivers and veterinary team to re‐evaluate the animal’s status and response to treatment, but also to monitor the caregivers' goals of care and the burden of care they are experiencing. The animal’s status, and the goals and burden of care may all shift over time and require the care plan to be revised. The caregivers must have an established line of communication and positive rapport with the EOL care team so that they feel comfortable expressing their point of view. Caregivers can experience guilt if they feel they are failing their pet, which may prevent them from admitting the burden of care is too high and asking for respite or a change in the treatment plan. The veterinarian may prescribe multiple drugs (<emphasis>polypharmacy</emphasis>) which can be highly effective in palliating EOL patients but can also increase the risk of adverse effects and increase caregiver burden. Technicians can use their <anchor id="ch0014-Page_56"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="56"/>position and knowledge to advocate for both patients and caregivers and discuss changes to the treatment plan with the veterinarian whenever needed. The schedule of communication will be determined on a case‐by‐case basis, but should be structured and documented. This may include monthly, weekly, daily, or even hourly check‐ins during advanced hospice care.</para>
      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0005">In this chapter, palliative nursing techniques will be discussed to support general comfort care and clinical sign management. The concept of comfort kits will also be described, which provide caregivers with medications to administer to EOL patients in situations of distress specific to their diagnoses.</para>

      <title>4.2 General Comfort Care</title>
      <anchor id="ch0014-head-2-43"/>
      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0006">In tending to general comfort care for EOL companion animals, technicians will focus on the daily activities of living (DAOL), supporting the animal’s daily routine, and minimizing any stressors. The DAOL include eating and drinking, toileting, grooming, and the mobility required to accomplish those tasks. Once those activities are sufficiently attended to, the daily routine can be evaluated to support activities such as interaction with housemates, play, mental stimulation, and exercise. Technicians improve pets’ QOL by identifying any obstacles or barriers to those activities and finding ways to remove or minimize them. Stressors which impact the DAOL or daily routine should also be identified so technicians can help find ways to reduce them. These may include clinical signs such as <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4151">nausea</ulink> as well as negative mental states such as increased anxiety, discomfort with treatments, or a lack of autonomy. The pet’s ability to engage in their life according to their own preferences can be an important part of QOL (assessing QOL is discussed in detail in<ulink url="ch0015">Chapter 5</ulink>).</para>
      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0007">This section will address multiple elements of general comfort care, offering practical considerations for EOL patient care and offering solutions that technicians and caregivers can enact. Note that <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> management was discussed in<ulink url="ch0013">Chapter 3</ulink> and as such will not be covered in detail here.</para>

      <title>4.2.1 Environmental Modifications</title>
      <anchor id="ch0014-head-3-31"/>
      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0008">An environmental assessment of the animal’s home is an important part of the hospice consultation, as discussed in<ulink url="ch0011">Chapter 1</ulink>. It is best performed in person so that the veterinary professional gains an accurate perspective of the animal’s environment to identify areas where modifications may be made to improve QOL. Where a home visit is not possible, thorough discussion can still be useful and may be accompanied by photo or video tours. Veterinarians may complete the environmental assessment themselves in the hospice consultation, or technicians may do so before or after the veterinary consultation.</para>

Inappetence may occur due to poor management of clinical signs in EOL patients and may be effectively palliated in many cases. This must be differentiated from lack of food intake that is occurring as part of the dying process. Technicians will collaborate with veterinarians and caregivers to identify causes of inappetence that can be palliated. In cases where inappetence is confirmed by the veterinarian to be part of the normal dying process, the EOL care team will respect patient autonomy regarding withdrawal from food prior to death<citation>ch0014-c4-bib-0001</citation>.

Technicians must maintain a positive rapport and an open line of communication with caregivers so these challenges can be addressed promptly and with creativity.

      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0032">Patient preferences may also influence how and if treatments are administered. A patient may take a chewable tablet with a more positive response than an oral liquid. Another patient may accept SC injections better when a high value food reward is offered for distraction. Partnering with a compounding pharmacy will help the veterinary team get creative with formulations and flavorings to administer oral medication. Various “vehicles” for medication may be kept on hand to aid in oral administration. If gastrointestinal comfort is maintained and non‐toxic items are used, then creativity and variety in medication “vehicles” can be encouraged. Suggestions include small amounts of cream cheese, cheese spread, <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Marshmallow">marshmallow</ulink> fluff, liverwurst, sardines, clam juice mixed with soft food, whipped cream, powdered milk, eggs, etc. Patient autonomy and maintenance of the HAB should be a focus when strategizing administration of medications and treatment.

      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0036">The mental and emotional wellbeing of companion animals at EOL should be considered in their daily care and assessed as part of their QOL. When clinical signs are well managed and general comfort care is being offered, mental and emotional wellbeing can be addressed more directly. This includes management of negative mental states such as anxiety, respecting patient preferences with treatments, supporting social interaction, and offering mental stimulation. Preserving an animal’s autonomy supports their mental and emotional wellbeing and has already been discussed in multiple aspects of general comfort care.</para>
      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0037">Anxiety may occur in EOL patients for a variety of reasons and QOL will improve with anxiety management interventions such as those listed in<link linkend="ch0014-c4-tbl-0002">Table 4.2</link>. Physical causes of anxiety such as respiratory distress require medical intervention for the underlying cause (see Section 4.3). Beyond simply managing anxiety, attention to mental and emotional wellbeing includes supporting social interaction with the household and increasing mental stimulation.</para>
      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0039">Mental engagement can be supported in many ways that are tailored to the individual. Technicians can help caregivers alter activities that the pet has previously enjoyed so they may be continued through EOL in a more accessible way (e.g. Rolling a ball to a dog along the floor can be an adjusted form of fetch; going for wagon rides, car rides, or backpack rides to replace walks). Caregivers can create access to comfortable areas to observe the outdoors through windows or offer their pet opportunity to rest outside while enjoying the stimulation of the environment. Even pets with poor mobility can engage in short training sessions to teach new behaviors tailored to the pet’s abilities, or simply to reinforce and reward existing behaviors. They may benefit from the introduction of new toys and food puzzles within their capabilities. Technicians can also suggest introducing new sensations, such as new scents and textures (e.g. walking over different footings such as foam or sand). Caregivers know their pets best and may come up with other creative ideas when prompted and encouraged by a supportive technician.</para>

Nutritional support is important for the comfort of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> patients and can be structured with the knowledge that well‐nourished neoplastic cells contribute to <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">tumor</ulink> growth and angiogenesis. The ideal diet will support the needs of the pet, while directing nutrients away from the neoplastic cells as much as possible. This is accomplished by reducing the carbohydrates in the diet to less than 30% and including moderate amounts of fat and protein, as neoplastic cells primarily use carbohydrates for energy <citation>ch0014-c4-bib-0010</citation>. If the pet is doing well on an existing well‐balanced diet, no diet change may be recommended as changes can be hard on an already stressed body. If diet has been a challenge for the pet historically (e.g. <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6559">inflammatory bowel disease</ulink>, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3007">allergies</ulink>), maintaining their usual diet is often recommended to avoid causing issues.

      <para id="ch0014-c4-para-0059">The concept of comfort kits was introduced in<ulink url="ch0013">Chapter 3</ulink> as a way for caregivers to help manage a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> crisis while awaiting further veterinary support. A comfort kit consists of pre‐filled syringes of medication generally given by SC injection or sometimes intranasally (IN). Many practices <anchor id="ch0014-Page_71"/>

This may include situations such as acute <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> crisis, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5444">seizures</ulink>, respiratory distress, or cardiovascular collapse.
