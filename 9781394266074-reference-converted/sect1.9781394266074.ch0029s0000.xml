      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0006">The tremendous role veterinary technicians play in end‐of‐life (EOL) care and euthanasia can be more challenging when families with children are impacted by the loss of a pet. Children suffer from grief, even if they express it differently from adults. The loss of a family pet can be particularly heartbreaking for children, who may be experiencing death for the first time. A child’s experience interacting with the veterinary team may be minimal, and thus it is especially important to ensure a positive experience for future veterinary visits. EOL events often trigger intense emotions and behaviors. Many parents will experience increased anxiety about EOL care, particularly euthanasia decisions and appointments, as they are uncertain how to communicate about this difficult subject and how their child will cope.</para>

         <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0008">In a 2001 analysis of 450 calls to a pet loss and education support line, nearly 25% of callers indicated that their primary reason for contacting the hotline was to request information on how to talk with children about the illness, death, or euthanasia of a family pet [<citation>ch0029-c16-bib-0001</citation>, p. 183].</para>
      </blockquote>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0009">Parents and caregivers will often look to the technician for support and guidance with pet loss and grief. It is important to remember that the technician is not acting as a trained therapist or a close friend. Their role is to show compassion, explain and answer questions about the pet’s condition and care, allow space and time for expression of emotions, and provide reputable, reliable resources for the entire family unit. Supporting the family unit through grief is not only good for the soul but also for the business of the practice. Even if a technician does not have a direct role in supporting the family, having knowledge of how to engage with children and families at EOL is valuable for guiding team members in these interactions. These extra steps in care and consideration reflect positively on veterinary practices, both for the experience of the clients and the well‐being of staff.</para>

Veterinary technicians often form close bonds with their patients. They can continue to honor this bond through EOL planning, euthanasia, and post‐euthanasia by supporting the children that those pets have loved so deeply.</para>

      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0013">It is important to recognize the special bond and the meaningful role a pet plays in a child’s life (<link linkend="ch0029-c16-fig-0001">Figure 16.1</link>). The death of a beloved companion animal of any species is a unique and significant loss and should be treated as such, sincerely offering compassion and support for the child’s grief (<link linkend="ch0029-c16-fea-0001">Pro Tip 16.1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0015">Many technicians will be born animal lovers and recall vividly the love and loss of their childhood pet. It may spark emotions and strong beliefs in how to handle or not handle this loss, depending on their own experience as a child. This bias needs to be recognized and perhaps revisited and supported if it is impacting the technician’s work.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0016">In the past, it was not an unusual practice to shield children from the reality of pet loss to protect or spare them from the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>. While this approach often comes from a place of good intentions, it can be harmful. It is recommended to communicate with children about pet loss openly and directly. Guidance for this is included in subsequent sections, including language tailored to different age groups. Most parents feel great anxiety anticipating their children’s reaction to the loss of a pet. Parents are dealing with their own sadness, and this is compounded by the uncertainty of how to explain the pet’s death to their children (<link linkend="ch0029-c16-fea-0002">Pro Tip 16.2</link>). Families may become overwhelmed and can project their feelings negatively onto veterinarians, technicians, and staff.</para>

      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0018">Clients may already be having open conversations about death with their children. Technicians can be present to provide reassurance, resources, and a sympathetic ear. Parents can readily access a plethora of information about grief with a quick internet search. The challenge that can arise with this accessibility is that it may be difficult for parents to discern reputable information from misguided advice. The knowledge, skill set, and personal insight that the veterinary team can provide will help parents navigate their child’s emotions and questions.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0019">The technician needs to communicate effectively to inquire if the parent would like help or support for the entire family unit. Parents may not realize that the veterinary team can provide pet loss support and resources, so it is important that they are always offered. The EOL care team can facilitate discussions to identify the family’s questions and concerns and encourage parents to consider how involved they’d like their children to be early in the process of planning. Involving children in EOL planning and the EOL transition helps acknowledge the importance of their bond with their pets. Technicians can help parents consider age‐appropriate ways for children to be involved as much as the children and parents would like them to be. Veterinary practices may consider having front desk staff inquire about who makes up the family unit, but they can also ask more generally if there are any children important in this animal’s life during client registration. This allows for child‐inclusive care and support to be offered throughout the practice's relationship with clients.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0029-head-2-219"/>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0081">Veterinary technicians should only engage in discussions of death and pet loss with children after they receive permission from their parents. The technician can directly acknowledge the children during appointments and ensure they feel safe asking questions. When discussing death with a child, the technician will need to be aware of modifying language and details based on the age and interest of the child. It is best to let the child’s questions guide the conversation as often children will require honest, simple, and short answers. Give a small amount of simple information and they will ask for more detail if they desire. Remember that children are often different from adults when it comes to the subject of death. They are more curious and open‐minded. This is positive, in that young children are often interested and grateful for the answers to their questions. It gives veterinary teams the opportunity to provide truthful and helpful answers about EOL and death.</para>

      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0082">Veterinary technicians should use honest, simple terminology and speak slowly. Try to answer what the child is asking specifically; most times younger children are not interested in too much detail<citation>ch0029-c16-bib-0002</citation>. Often young children worry about their beloved pet being hungry or lonely, so they need to hear that this is not the case. For very young children, it may be helpful to liken pet death to something they may have experienced such as a plant or flower dying.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0083">When communicating with children, technicians may feel concerned that they do not have all the right answers or feel they need to be perfect in their explanations. Rest assured that most children will respond positively if their questions are addressed in a way that shows care, validation, and support. Technicians do not need to fill silence with words, sitting in silence can demonstrate comfort with the emotions surrounding grief. Let those feelings exist! Body language and vocal tone are also important in communicating with children (<link linkend="ch0029-c16-fea-0003">Communication Corner 16.1</link>).</para>

When ignored, children may suffer more from feeling isolated than from the actual death itself and may feel alone in their grief<citation>ch0029-c16-bib-0002</citation>. Validating their feelings and being present with them in the moment is important. The technician can advise staff and parents to let children know it is okay to be sad, angry, or even numb. There will also be times when a child may not react as expected, and that is acceptable as well. They should not feel pressure to display feelings that are not present. In general, open and honest communication with children is the best way (<link linkend="ch0029-c16-fea-0004">Pro Tip 16.3</link>).</para>

         <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0088">Young children may not know the words to describe what they feel. The technician can assist and model by recognizing that emotion, naming that emotion, and validating that emotion. For example, “You may be feeling angry, it doesn’t seem fair. I would be angry too.” Linking the emotion to a physical state often helps. For example, “My tummy hurts also when I feel sad or scared” or “It can feel like your heart hurts when you are so sad.”</para>

         <beginpage pagenum="273"/>Adults often feel death is a difficult subject to approach with children. For many people, the first instinct is to protect children from feeling sad or try to cheer them up. Realistically, when children experience the loss or impending loss of a pet, they need the time and space to allow them to feel sad and encourage expression of emotion. Telling or relaying to a child <emphasis>“don't feel bad or sad or mad”</emphasis> sends a confusing message, not a comforting one. By doing so, children are being told not to feel what they are truly feeling. This can close the door to further healthy dialogue because a child may feel they have to pretend or hide their feelings as that is what is expected of them. When children (especially those over the age of five) are left out of discussions, they feel unworthy of trust and this can be distressing. A child may feel they have to find answers on their own, which can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to misinformation from unreliable sources (friends/internet) and may cause more distress.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0087">It is important to make sure children know they are not responsible for the pet’s illness or death. Children will often blame themselves even if there is no real basis for this. A child may need to be assured by parents that nothing they said or thought would cause this to happen to the pet. A complex situation can arise when the death/accident is caused by the child. For example, the child left the backyard gate open, and the dog ran out and got hit by a car. This again would be a situation<anchor id="ch0029-Page_274"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="274"/>best handled by the parent and professional mental health provider. This is a teachable moment, not one to be hidden. It would be the parents’ responsibility to help the child work through the guilt and regret. If the technician is asked for advice on the matter, it is important in this case to focus on the fact it was an accident and mistakes do happen. The technician can assist by empowering the child and the family unit with knowledge and understanding to prevent this from happening again and offering grief resources.</para>

      <title>16.4.3 Be Patient and Nonjudgmental</title>
      <anchor id="ch0029-head-3-155"/>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0089">Veterinary technicians will need to exercise patience as younger children may ask the same question over and over. With children, it is best to listen, answer the question directly, and then pause to listen to their cues of what they need next. A child’s behavior may seem inappropriate to the situation. There are many reasons for this so the veterinary team must try to be nonjudgmental during this emotionally driven time.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0090">The content in this chapter offers guidance; however, technicians will need to follow their best judgment and learn from experience and consultation with colleagues. Every child will grieve in a unique way as feelings of grief are different for everyone. For instance, teens might feel embarrassed or ashamed of their grief. The technician can create a safe space and normalize these expressions.<link linkend="ch0029-c16-fea-0005">Case Study 16.1</link> offers an example of the complexities of grief and family dynamics.</para>

         <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0091">Mrs. Kim enters her regular veterinary practice to euthanize her cat of 20 years, Jingles. The veterinary technician Sarah asks if Mrs. Kim would like other family members involved. Mrs. Kim shares that her husband does not want to be present, and her four‐year‐old daughter Lane has never liked or interacted with Jingles. In fact, Lane often acts jealous of Mrs. Kim’s attention to Jingles. Sarah learns that Mrs. Kim and her husband have both agreed not to discuss euthanasia with Lane, as they feel she won’t be impacted by the loss.</para>
         <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0092">Sarah uses this opportunity to share with Mrs. Kim why it might be helpful to share their decision with Lane and offers child‐specific resources for review, but Mrs. Kim declines. Sarah accepts this response and tells Mrs. Kim that if she changes her mind about the resources, she is welcome to reach out.</para>
         <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0093">A few weeks later, Sarah receives a phone call from Mrs. Kim who shares that Lane began acting out at home shortly after Jingles’ euthanasia and she wonders if it has something to do with the loss. Specifically, she is worried that her own sadness is impacting Lane. Sarah acknowledges her concerns. Listening empathically, she reminds Mrs. Kim that the practice has child‐based grief and loss resources, including a chart that offers age‐specific guidance for children’s grief. With Mrs. Kim’s permission, Sarah has a member of the reception team email the resources to her.</para>
         <para>During a follow‐up call with Mrs. Kim, Sarah learns that Lane had been confused and upset, witnessing her mother’s sadness. Lane thought it was her fault because she sometimes wished Jingles was gone. In learning this, Mrs. Kim was able to provide reassurance that nothing Lane thought or said caused Jingles’s death and that she was not mad at Lane. The family began reading children’s books from the resource list and created a book of pictures about Jingles as a memorial activity.</para>

A euphemism refers to using words and phrases that discuss sensitive or unpleasant subjects in a more tactful manner.

      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0097">Encourage parents not to fabricate stories such as<emphasis>“Fluffy went to live on a farm”</emphasis> or <emphasis>“Fluffy ran away.”</emphasis> The notion of a pet running away will be distressing to the child. They will wonder why the pet ran away, where it is, and when it may come back. This notion may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to unmerited guilt with a child believing the pet went away due to something they did, thought, or said. It is also questionable whether children truly believe these fibs even at a young age. A child will often have negative feelings and anxiety if they sense adults, who they are supposed to trust, are lying to them. Children will feel a lack of trust as they grow up once they realize that this was not true and contemplate “what else their parents and veterinarian lied about” (see <link linkend="ch0029-c16-fea-0006">Case Study 16.2</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0098">Unfortunately, parents may sometimes try to enlist the help of the veterinary team in authenticating a lie about what has really happened to the pet. It is important that technicians avoid becoming part of the lie, and do not feel pressure to say or do something they feel is unethical. The technician may provide a gentle reminder that although honest communication might seem more painful for the child in the present, it is best in the long term. Lying to the child, even with good intentions, can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to mistrust and anger with parents and the veterinary profession later in life.

Mrs. Jose anticipates Christine will struggle with the news, as Shaggy has been a part of their family for most of Christine’s life and they share a deep bond. Mrs. Jose decides not to disclose the diagnosis to Christine at this time. Instead, she plans to take Shaggy for weekly chemotherapy treatments in secret, intending to inform Christine only if Shaggy’s health significantly deteriorates. Upon learning this, the technician, Kelly, feels conflicted and recognizes this secrecy could <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to greater challenges. After considering the situation and discussing it with the vet team, Kelly decides to have a thoughtful conversation with Mrs. Jose at their next appointment.</para>
         <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0116">Mrs. Jose arrives for the next appointment, and after review of the care plan Kelly revisits their prior conversation, “I wanted to revisit what you shared about your daughter at our previous appointment. You mentioned you decided not to tell her about Shaggy’s <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink>.” Kelly pauses a few moments to let Mrs. Jose process this statement and respond. Mrs. Jose confirms that she still does not want to tell Christine, as she is worried about her potential response and how it will impact her mental well‐being. Kelly shows empathy. “It is so hard to share a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> diagnosis with children. I remember you mentioned that your daughter is very bonded with Shaggy.” Mrs. Jose agrees and further explains how helpful and responsible Christine is when caring for Shaggy.</para>
         <para>Kelly listens and validates this before sharing, “I wanted to take a moment and discuss this.

You said Christine is so responsible and helpful when she cares for Shaggy. She might appreciate having an active role in helping to manage Shaggy’s <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4181">cancer</ulink> care.” Mrs. Jose agrees that Christine would appreciate being a part of this process and will plan to tell her about the diagnosis. Kelly shares, “We are here to support you and can answer questions or concerns Christine may have about Shaggy’s condition.

      <anchor id="ch0029-head-2-228"/>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0118">In many households, even young children share a significant role in caring for a family pet. For example, one study found that “75% of 8‐ to 10‐year‐olds had sole or shared responsibility for pet care, and 92% felt that caring for their pets was an ‘important’ or ‘very important’ part of their relationship with the animal”<citation>ch0029-c16-bib-0001</citation>. The child should continue the responsibility of care through EOL, euthanasia, and aftercare and it is important for the veterinary team to recognize this sense of responsibility. Children should feel they are part of the care team. Their bond with the pet needs to continue to be fostered throughout EOL. Although it is imperative for a child to feel part of the discussions and decision‐making, it is also necessary that they do not feel the full burden and responsibility for the final decision. The technician can assist parents in providing information and options on how children can be involved before, during, and after euthanasia.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0029-head-3-161"/>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0119">Prior knowledge of what to expect at the time of euthanasia may help ease anxiety in both the parents and children. Preparation is also helpful to reduce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> for the patient and the veterinary team. Discussions of euthanasia should be held privately with the parents first, which will allow them the opportunity to voice concerns about their children and provide information about their ages and the level of involvement the parents feel would be appropriate. The veterinary team should review the entire process of euthanasia with the parents in detail, including possible physiological changes that may be observed (see<ulink url="ch0023">Chapter 11</ulink>). If parents are not educated about what could happen, they may become upset with what their children are witnessing. Once the parents are aware of what will or could happen at each stage, they can decide about which part, if any, they feel is suitable for their child to observe (see <link linkend="ch0029-c16-fea-0010">Pro Tip 16.5</link>). It is also important to make it clear that anyone can change their mind at any time. If they initially want their child to be present throughout and decide to change their minds midway, then they are welcome to do so.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0120">It is also helpful to send written information or provide access to digital resources in advance that explain the euthanasia procedure, what to expect, and how to prepare. Parents may be emotional, distracted, or still in a state of disbelief during discussions, so it is best for them to have access to information they can revisit at a quiet moment. Whenever possible, aftercare and keepsake options should be provided ahead of the scheduled euthanasia. This will enable time for all family members to make thoughtful choices beforehand as they may not be thinking clearly or be unable to decide<anchor id="ch0029-Page_280"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="280"/>what they want on the day of the euthanasia. Often families express regret later for not getting a keepsake such as a clay paw print or change their mind about the return of cremated remains. With parental consent, children can be included in aftercare decisions suitable for their age and developmental stage. Parents can be encouraged to review the information from aftercare providers in advance. This may be helpful when they explain the process to their children.</para>

         <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0125">If a child is too young or chooses not to be present, they can still be involved. For example, a young child could oversee preparing a “comfort” or “goodbye bag” to accompany the pet to the euthanasia appointment and decide on the contents, such as a favorite toy, special blanket, picture, or card created by the child.</para>
      </sidebar>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0121">It is recommended that all family members are given up‐to‐date information about when euthanasia is going to occur. Parents may try to spare a child’s feelings and euthanize the pet while the child is at school or lie and say the pet died in their sleep. The veterinary team can suggest to parents that the child may eventually find out the truth and these deceptions can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to mistrust of both parents and health professionals.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0122">Many people don’t realize that there are several steps during a euthanasia appointment that family members can be involved in, even if they choose not to be present during the actual euthanasia procedure. The veterinary team can discuss some ways children can be involved without being present during the procedure such as having time to say goodbye at home before parents take the pet to be euthanized, coming to the hospital and staying in a separate room with a caregiver during the procedure, staying until the pet is sedated and saying goodbye before the moment of euthanasia, or coming in for visitation after the pet is euthanized.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0123">The veterinary practice should have information available about home euthanasia and whether this is offered by the practice itself or a mobile service. This option can be advantageous when children are involved. It may allow for the pet and child to feel the comfort of their home space and offer more opportunities for members of the family to be in multiple spaces if needed throughout the process. As with any resource, the family can decide what feels right for them.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0124">The technician should explain that children (and family members) can change their minds and leave at any point during the procedure. A trusted caregiver should come to the procedure in case the child wants to leave. Also, coloring sheets/books and other child‐safe activities in the room are helpful to give a child something to occupy their attention during that time.</para>

As a first step to approaching this conversation, technicians should gauge the family’s understanding and experience with euthanasia. Technicians can ask parents about what has already been discussed with the child and the language they have been using to communicate with them. This allows an opportunity for technicians to share that language should be truthful but modified according to age, developmental, and emotional level. Technicians might find it helpful to break down this explanation of euthanasia by answering “why, what, and how” questions.</para>

      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0134">Veterinary teams will often encounter parents seeking advice on whether it is appropriate or advisable for children to be present for euthanasia procedures. There is no simple right or wrong, yes or no response. Ultimately, it is up to the parents to decide, especially for young children, since they know their child and their family dynamics best. Technicians may still offer insight and resources to parents as they make this decision (<link linkend="ch0029-c16-tbl-0003">Table 16.3</link>). EOL care teams should be familiar with clinic policy and the comfort level of the veterinarian doing the procedure before making any suggestions to the family <citation>ch0029-c16-bib-0005</citation>. If there is a lack of comfort or clinic policies preventing the involvement of children, this should be addressed on an organizational level. The existence of these barriers will hinder the provision of the best possible compassionate EOL care to the clinic’s clients. Technicians with the desire to elevate their practice’s standard of EOL care can be sources of information, inspiration, and change within their workplaces as they seek training and share their support.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0136">The decision for children to be present and their level of involvement can encompass many elements, such as past experience with loss, behavior of the child, family dynamics, level of understanding and awareness, and chronological and emotional age<citation>ch0029-c16-bib-0005</citation>. Also, the parent's own feelings about witnessing the euthanasia and having the child present during the procedure play a crucial part in the decision‐making process. Children will sense how their parents feel so if the parents or other adults are not comfortable with the child being present, the child may not get the support they need <citation>ch0029-c16-bib-0005</citation>.</para>

         <beginpage pagenum="282"/>The parents may also feel that having their children included may prevent them from being as present and connected with their pet, so they are less able to honor their own bond at this important time. Very young children may require a lot of attention to keep them safe (from needles, bites, scratches, etc.) and to reduce noise, stimulation, and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> for the pet being euthanized. This can sometimes interfere with the creation of a calm and supportive environment for the pet and others attending the euthanasia. Parents should be encouraged to bring a second caregiver in case a child changes their mind at the last minute, needs to leave the procedure, or is disruptive to the parent, veterinary team, or pet.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0138">It is important to remember that parents can set the most beneficial example regarding healthy grieving. Negative feelings projected from adults, a child’s questions that remain unanswered or ignored, and other less‐than‐ideal situations during euthanasia may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to a very difficult grief process for the family unit.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0139">The presence of children during euthanasia is a deeply personal decision that varies by age and individual family dynamics. Each age group presents unique challenges and benefits, requiring thoughtful consideration and tailored approaches from the technician. In the authors’ opinion, consideration of children present in euthanasia can be loosely examined within the following chronological age ranges:</para>

They may be very candid and straightforward in their communication. If the child is old enough to answer whether they wish to be present, they should be asked. Often, they have had their pet as long as they can remember, and this may be their first experience with death. Children of this age range may benefit from the opportunity to have their grief validated, observe their parents mourn, and have space to ask questions and express concerns surrounding death. Safe and age‐appropriate ways to participate in a pet’s EOL journey can be encouraged, such as deciding on what toy or blanket to bring for them, drawing or coloring pictures, or reading a poem or story to the pet.</para>

It is important to take the time and patience to explain the medical information to them and answer their questions. They need to feel they are being seen and heard and are important members of the decision‐making process. This age group may feel they share the responsibility of the pet’s care, so it offers them a chance to participate in this caring decision and say goodbye. It is also a good opportunity for them to hear from the veterinarian and technician about why this is an acceptable ethical decision.</para>
         <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0143">University‐age young adults also warrant special consideration. Although technically not children anymore, this age group often has a very strong bond with their pets; they have shared many life stages with this beloved childhood companion.

      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0144">Veterinary technicians can initiate and encourage meaningful dialogue with other team members to set protocols for children‐present euthanasia. It needs to be determined if the veterinarians are willing and comfortable when explaining, answering questions, and discussing EOL care with children. If this is an issue, it is the editors’ opinion that it is the responsibility of the veterinary team to seek training to become comfortable so that best practice compassionate euthanasia may be offered to include children. If a veterinarian requests assistance in this area, a technician with training may assume the role of communicator during EOL discussions and euthanasia. This should be discussed and arranged in advance to ensure everyone is in agreement on the protocol and how best to prepare. It is valuable to identify and leverage different team members’ strengths, such as those with more interest, aptitude, and training in EOL care and communication.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0146">Technicians can set the tone by sharing with the family that this is a safe space for sharing and expressing feelings, reminding them that everyone grieves in their own way (see<link linkend="ch0029-c16-fea-0012">Pro Tip 16.6</link>). There are some scenarios where a child’s behavior cannot be managed, and they become a disruption to the procedure. In these cases, the safety of the patient, family, and staff takes priority, and a parent will need to accompany the child out of the exam room or practice. The technician can also consider the physical space available for families. Many practices will not have the space for a designated comfort room. An exam room can be transformed into a safer and more comfortable space by adding thoughtful and creative adjustments (<link linkend="ch0029-c16-tbl-0004">Table 16.4</link>).</para>

      <anchor id="ch0029-head-2-234"/>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0157">An important part of supporting a child’s healthy grieving process includes engaging in support activities, reading books on pet loss, and participating in memorials for the pet. The veterinary practice can offer pet loss support resources for children in a variety of ways: gifting them to the family, displaying them in the practice for purchase, or having a dedicated page on the practice website. Parents who may be struggling through their own grief will often be very grateful that they don't have to source appropriate resources themselves.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0158">Reading children’s stories about pet loss can help children understand death, encourage expression of feelings, and provide comfort through grief (see<link linkend="ch0029-c16-tbl-0002">Table 16.2</link> for resource suggestions). Families can engage in support activities together, such as working through activity books designed for children coping with pet loss. Art therapy is very helpful for people of all ages, especially for young children who can use this method to express feelings that they can’t verbalize or don’t fully understand. These family activities can also give parents insight into a child's thoughts. Older children and teens can benefit from activities such as scrapbooking, journaling, and creating memorials. Parents can model healthy coping strategies by participating in these projects as well.

      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0159">After euthanasia, personalized keepsakes for the family are often very valued and supportive during grief. End‐of‐life (EOL) care teams can consider a variety of keepsakes to offer children such as a small clipping of fur in a special bag, nose or paw print impression on cardstock, and memorial picture frames. Ideally, each child who wishes for a keepsake should receive one if possible. Veterinary teams should always obtain permission from the family before creating a keepsake such as a paw print impression or fur clipping. Another way to involve children in creating keepsakes is to allow them to brush the pet’s fur and add it to the keepsake bag themselves (see<link linkend="ch0029-c16-fig-0006">Figure 16.6</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0162">Providing pet loss support resources and memorial items is helpful for families as it demonstrates the validity of the child’s grief. Additionally, this tangibly reflects the value placed on the human–animal bond, showing the level of compassion the veterinary team feels for every pet patient and their family. It is important for the veterinary team to provide these afterlife gestures of compassion. Technicians who feel passionate about this may take the <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> in establishing these practices. Clients feel reassured when they are properly supported through EOL.

      <title>16.9 Considerations for Getting a New Pet</title>
      <anchor id="ch0029-head-2-236"/>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0163">Another common question parents will ask the technician is when to consider adopting a new pet. Although there is no exact right or wrong timing, this decision should not be made hastily as it is ideal to wait until everyone in the family feels ready. Many parents struggle deeply watching their children experience sadness and grief. Although this is difficult, grief is something that the child needs to experience. Children need to take the time to feel sad and parents should not try to resolve feelings of loss by rushing in to adopt a new pet<citation>ch0029-c16-bib-0006</citation>. Adopting a new pet too quickly may not give the child enough opportunity to grieve, especially for children over the age of five. This may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to unresolved emotions and challenges with future experiences of loss. It also signals to the child that their feelings of grief are not important, valid, or acceptable.</para>
      <para id="ch0029-c16-para-0164">Children can vary greatly when considering the possibility of adopting a new pet. Some will say they want a new pet right away, while other children may say they don't want to have another pet in the home. Children need to be reassured that it is ok to develop a bond with another pet and it is also ok to want to wait before even thinking about adopting again. Veterinary technicians can encourage respect for all family members' decisions about potential future pets and make sure everyone is aware of not succumbing to the pressure of adoption too soon. Technicians can recommend that parents ensure a child understands that a new pet may be very different and is not meant to replace an old pet. If they do not understand this, they may feel anyone who dies can be replaced, even them. Introducing a new pet before everyone is ready may cause feelings of anger, resentment, or guilt and a feeling of being disloyal to their pet that has died. When the entire family unit is ready, involving the child as much as possible in the selection process and preparations for a new pet would be advisable.</para>
