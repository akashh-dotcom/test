      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0003">Veterinary technicians involved in end‐of‐life (EOL) care work closely with grieving clients and families, so it is important that technicians have an understanding of grief. In doing so, technicians will enhance their professional skills and personal resilience, providing a compassionate EOL experience for clients, patients, and the veterinary team.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0004">Grief is a process that happens as a response to meaningful loss. It is an inevitable human experience, yet despite its commonality, grief is easily misunderstood. In a North American context, there tends to be discomfort with grief, as it is often accompanied by deep <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>, loss, and longing. It is an experience that people seek to avoid or quickly resolve<citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0001</citation>. Unfortunately, this view and approach to death encourages minimizing grief, treating it as a problem that needs to be fixed rather than a normal, emotional process.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0005">This chapter will take a closer look at what it means to grieve the loss of a companion animal by examining the fundamentals of grief, the unique context of loss in the human–animal bond (HAB), different grief responses, and factors that influence these responses. Technicians will gain a better understanding of the impact of pet loss not only for the clients they work with but also for themselves and their teams.</para>

         <para>Two partners, Diane and Christian, are at their regular veterinary practice for a euthanasia appointment. They are saying goodbye to Speckle, their cat of eight years, whom they adopted shortly after they began dating. During and after the euthanasia procedure, Diane is openly distressed, she is crying and verbally expressing her sadness. She shares memories of how special Speckle was with the technician and veterinarian in the room. Meanwhile, her partner Christian remains reserved. He shares that he is sad and sheds some silent tears for a moment, but then remains quiet and lets Diane do the talking. The technician who attended the euthanasia focuses on comforting and reassuring Diane, offers sympathy for both of their losses, and provides resources for the couple to take home.</para>

      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0010">The first step to understanding grief is to be familiar with its terminology. There are certain words that come up often in this subject, and they are sometimes used interchangeably. These words hold different meanings that can help technicians put a name to and describe what is happening when someone suffers a loss.<link linkend="ch0027-c14-tbl-0001">Table 14.1</link> below identifies and clarifies common terms and their definitions which technicians can practice applying with <link linkend="ch0027-c14-fea-0001">Case Study 14.1</link>.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0012">Technicians should be mindful of how grief, mourning, and bereavement are influenced by factors such as an individual’s personality, age, spirituality, cultural norms, and interpersonal relationships. Technicians are not expected to be grief experts, but they can use this knowledge to better support clients and navigate their personal grief experiences.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0013">Now that the terminology has been explained, what does the grief process look like for someone experiencing a significant loss like a companion animal? A well‐recognized theory applied to answering this question is called Stage Theory. Stage theory is widely recognized in North America and has shaped societal perceptions around what it means and looks like to grieve. This theory is responsible for explaining the process of grief through the popular five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance<citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0002</citation>. The five stages explain that grief is an experience that happens in a typical sequence of emotions and behaviors, or stages. Stage theory was developed by Dr. Elisabeth Kubler‐Ross in her publication <emphasis>On Death and Dying</emphasis>
         <citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0002</citation>. Dr. Kubler‐Ross’s research documented observations of human patients who were actively dying and in palliative care. Even though the original intention of her work focused on the experience of those who were dying, Stage Theory became applied to the experience of those who were grieving.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0014">The assumption that grief follows a predictable, linear, and timely path is misleading. Grief is highly individualized. Although the emotions and reactions described in the five stages may be<anchor id="ch0027-Page_227"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="227"/>part of someone’s experience, they do not necessarily occur in a specific order, or at all. Each person navigates grief uniquely (see <link linkend="ch0027-c14-fig-0001">Figure 14.1</link>).</para>

      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0016">Anyone who has loved and cared for a pet can recognize the special bond between humans and animals (see<link linkend="ch0027-c14-fig-0002">Figure 14.2</link>). The HAB has been around for an exceptionally long time and has continued to evolve throughout history. Scientific literature formally recognizes the HAB, and researchers investigate to better understand it. For example, a survey conducted by the Human Animal Bond Research Institute found that 95% of pet parents worldwide consider their companion animals to be part of their family’s structure and dynamic <citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0003</citation>. The HAB is also one of the only relationships described as unconditional and unspoken. Companion animals may not speak the same language as their caretakers, yet they still find a way to connect and communicate with them on a deep and meaningful level.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0017">The benefits and unique elements of the HAB are far‐reaching and beyond the scope of this chapter. What technicians should be aware of is the impact and importance of the HAB in fulfilling social roles for human beings. For example, the way that people spend time with their companion<anchor id="ch0027-Page_228"/>

         <beginpage pagenum="229"/>animals is often quite different from how they spend time with other people. Companion animals can foster connections among people who share interests in animal‐related activities or causes, reducing isolation and offering social connections within the larger community. The unconditional love and caregiving responsibilities of companion animals can benefit human beings both physically and emotionally. Pets can be a reason to get up and stay active during the day or even act as a calming presence during periods of anxiety and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>. Pets provide a sense of purpose for those who care for them, all while being sources of entertainment, giving nonjudgmental support, and demonstrating affection to those they love and trust.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0027-head-3-133"/>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0023">Guilt and regret often come up in the context of pet loss, but not necessarily because an individual has something to genuinely feel guilty about or regret. One of the unique aspects of the HAB is how deeply this relationship integrates into people’s lives. Many take on a perceived parental or guardian role for their companions. Pet caregivers proudly take on the responsibility of loving and providing for their pets when they are healthy, sick, or at the EOL.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0024">EOL decision‐making for animals is often cited as guilt‐inducing for pet parents [<citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0004</citation>, <citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0005</citation>]. Euthanasia is a common and well‐accepted practice in North American veterinary care. Often, this is a person’s first experience with EOL decision‐making, which can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to intense feelings of guilt and regret. Even when a person logically recognizes that euthanasia is an appropriate and compassionate choice for their pet, grief may cause them to second‐guess their decisions. Caregivers might feel they had no right to make such a decision for their animal or worry they made it too hastily or too late, blaming themselves for the outcome.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0025">Euthanasia is not the only source of these feelings. Generally, people hold themselves to high standards of care when looking after their pets. After a pet dies, it is common for them to second‐guess their decisions about nutrition, basic care, and treatment, feeling guilty for not noticing signs of a condition or disease earlier. People might even identify that they feel guilty for the sense of relief they experience after the loss, especially if the pet has intense caregiving needs. Sometimes caregivers worry that this relief implies they are glad the pet is gone.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0026">Feelings of guilt and regret are experienced as reality when caregivers grieve. They may feel they failed their pet or were not as loving and caring as they could have been. In truth, those who love their pets deeply never intend for their animals to suffer. Over time, most caregivers gain perspective and recognize that they made the best decisions they could during those times. However, in some cases, guilt and regret can become consuming.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0027">Technicians will hear expressions of guilt and regret from caregivers and can remind them that their decisions were made with love and care, often with the support of the veterinary team. They can help caregivers focus on all the good things they did for their animals, both when they were healthy and when they were ill, to help balance their perspective. There may be times when a technician feels that a client did not provide the best care for their pet and might hesitate to validate the<anchor id="ch0027-Page_230"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="230"/>client’s decisions. In such cases, it's helpful to focus on the client’s intent rather than their choices.

One day Kasey notices that Pepper is panting heavily and appearing uncomfortable, so they arrange an urgent appointment with the cardiology team.</para>
         <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0029">During the visit, the veterinary team learns that Kasey has made significant adjustments to Pepper’s heart medication on their own without consultation. Kasey explains that they felt guilty about giving Pepper so much medication, and since Pepper appeared to be improving, lowering the dose couldn’t hurt. The cardiologist firmly explains the risks of altering the medication without guidance. They reiterate the importance of following the prescribed treatment plan, detailing the purpose of the dosage and medication. Once Pepper is stabilized at the hospital, she is discharged with a detailed medication schedule and written instructions to ensure clarity.</para>

      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0034">The HAB can be deeply rooted and characterized by intense emotional attachment, making the loss of a pet a uniquely challenging and significant experience. Therefore, anger can be another natural response to this loss. This anger may be rooted in feelings of helplessness, guilt, unmet expectations, or the uncertainty surrounding the loss. For instance, the circumstances of the loss can contribute to anger in grief, particularly in cases of sudden or unexpected death caused by accidents or acute illness [<citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0004</citation>, <citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0005</citation>]. Unexpected deaths or the difficult decision to euthanize a pet can leave individuals grappling to process the events leading to death and the unresolved questions that remain [<citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0004</citation>, <citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0005</citation>]. Clients might direct their anger inward, blaming themselves for the pet’s death or feeling guilt over perceived shortcomings in their care. For some, anger serves as a temporary distraction, allowing them to focus outwardly on blame or frustration instead of confronting the deeply painful feelings of loss.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0035">Veterinary technicians will encounter clients who are angry after the death of their companion. This anger may be due to miscommunication or errors on the part of the veterinary team, but it may also stem from a client’s perception of the veterinary team as the last line of defense against the pet’s illness or death. Regardless of the cause, the client’s anger can be intimidating and difficult to address. Discomfort in handling these situations may <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> some veterinary professionals to avoid or ignore angry clients, but this approach is unlikely to improve the situation.

Individuals experiencing acute grief responses will often feel it disrupts their cognitive function and daily life routines. This can be especially true in pet loss, as pets are often deeply integrated into the structure of their caregiver’s daily routine. For instance, in the first few weeks after a loss, the bereaved may find it hard to focus on daily tasks. Their appetite and sleep patterns may change, and they may even have intrusive imagery around death or loss. The acute nature of this grief is often marked by an eventual decrease in frequency and intensity of feelings of loss <citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0006</citation>.</para>

The difference between prolonged grief and uncomplicated grief has to do with the integration of this grief into an individual’s life. PGD can be characterized by intense longing for the deceased pet, persistent and unrelenting thoughts about the loss, difficulty accepting the reality of the death, as well as social withdrawal and somatic symptoms such as sleep disturbances or appetite changes <citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0010</citation>.

      <anchor id="ch0027-head-3-139"/>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0051">Technicians will be familiar with the procedure of euthanasia as it is well integrated with veterinary EOL care. Many recognize euthanasia as a humane and compassionate choice to end an animal’s suffering and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> and provide a peaceful transition to death. The ability to choose euthanasia can be an empowering one for caregivers, but it can also be a significant source of anxiety, guilt, and other distressing emotions.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0052">A euthanasia decision is best made in conjunction with veterinary medical professionals. This allows caregivers to receive expert guidance and support to make this difficult decision in a collaborative way (see<ulink url="ch0019">Chapter 8</ulink> for further information on EOL decision‐making). When the situation offers the ability to plan a beloved pet’s EOL well in advance, this can allow caregivers some control in a situation where there is otherwise very little. Euthanasia is truly a final act of caring. A compassionate euthanasia experience has been shown to have a positive impact on the grief responses of pet parents (<link linkend="ch0027-c14-fea-0004">Case Study 14.4</link>) <citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0011</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0055">Considering the option to euthanize can cause distress for pet caregivers, and technicians may notice they have conflicting emotions and perspectives. For instance, caregivers may experience feelings of guilt and self‐doubt about choosing this option, or they might have hesitation about the morality of this act and how it will impact their bond with their pet. Furthermore, there are times when a planned euthanasia does not go as expected. As discussed in<ulink url="ch0022">Chapter 10</ulink>, dysthanasia refers to a euthanasia procedure with complications or one that is performed in a way that causes unnecessary suffering and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> to an animal <citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0012</citation>. When dysthanasia occurs, it can exacerbate the caregiver’s feelings of regret, guilt, and sadness, potentially leaving them with anger and distrust towards themselves or the veterinary practice <citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0012</citation>. These scenarios can potentially intensify an individual’s grief response. Technicians can play a key role in navigating conversations around euthanasia with sensitivity and compassion. Technicians can ensure that caregivers’ and families’ feelings are heard and validated through the process of saying goodbye to their beloved companion animals and beyond.</para>

      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0056">A sudden loss refers to a loss that has happened very unexpectedly. This loss may have been the result of a tragic accident or death from illness without warning. In a study released by the American Psychological Association, researchers identified that losing a human in an unexpected or sudden event increased the risk of the bereaved experiencing PGD. They were also noted to have more severe and persistent psychological reactions like post‐traumatic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> disorder<citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0013</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0057">Losing a pet in any context can be heartbreaking. However, the sudden loss of a pet may add a layer of devastation to the grief.

These clients often struggle with unknowns and unanswered questions surrounding their pet’s death. Caregivers may find themselves in a never‐ending loop of “what‐ifs” or feeling distrust in themselves or their veterinary teams. There are also times when a caregiver’s or family member’s actions inadvertently <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to their companion’s death, and as a result, they may experience intense guilt, anger, or deep shame in themselves (<link linkend="ch0027-c14-fea-0005">Case Study 14.5</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0060">In these scenarios, technicians will need to demonstrate empathy and understanding for their clients. It is especially important that the EOL care team is mindful of having a nonjudgmental attitude toward clients. They should prepare for the possibility of having intense emotions directed at the team. Technicians should keep a calm and nonreactive demeanor, and recognize that this is likely a projection of the client’s grief. It is helpful to express empathy and offer resources for grief support. Of course, this does not mean staff should tolerate abusive behavior (see<ulink url="ch0018">Chapter 7</ulink> for more information on supporting difficult conversations).</para>

Cultural practices, like rituals and ceremonies, create spaces where individuals can mourn their loss openly without fear or judgment.

Don has no children or spouse, and he and Princess spend their days together enjoying the sunshine on the deck and watching TV. He never feels lonely with her around.</para>
         <para>Recently, Princess developed serious kidney issues and has been in and out of the hospital. She began to lose her appetite and became so unwell that Don made the difficult decision to euthanize her. The loss has been gut‐wrenching. With few people to talk to and <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=His">his</ulink> own health issues making it hard to leave the house and stay busy, Don dearly misses Princess. He starts looking at pictures of Calicos for adoption, although he isn’t quite ready to adopt yet. He has always had a cat in his home. The more Don thinks about adopting, the more concerns arise. He often wonders if he would outlive a new cat or if he could care for them properly should his own health decline. He struggles with age being a consideration for having a new cat.</para>

      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0081">Caregivers and families who are grieving their deceased companion may also notice behavioral changes in other household pets and express these concerns to the veterinary team. It is not possible to say with certainty why these changes are happening. Maybe it is because the other companion animal is grieving, or it may be that they are reacting to their caregiver’s grief. In any case, a deceased pet is a loss that impacts routines and daily functions, which can indeed cause the rest of the household pets to act differently<citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0021</citation>. Loss of human family members can also result in similar signs of grief in pets.</para>
      <para>Technicians may notice that caregivers are worried and struggling to find ways to support their other pets’ emotional well‐being while also navigating their own immense grief. They may even try to suppress their emotions so they do not upset their other pets. Technicians can provide reassurance and help guide the caregiver in supporting the other animals in multiple ways:<citation>ch0027-c14-bib-0021</citation>

      <para id="ch0027-c14-para-0083">Most pets who are impacted by grief can fully resolve these changes with support from the caregiver. Technicians can also prepare clients to consider the benefit of including their other animals in the EOL process. This can include bringing other companion animals from the household to an in‐clinic euthanasia or allowing them to be present for a home euthanasia. It can also simply be allowing the other animal(s) to see the body after death. It is important to consider how the presence of the other animal may impact the environment and experience for the caregivers before making these decisions. If another animal is going to be included at EOL, the client should be counseled away from having any expectations of their behavior at that moment. Other pets may show a variety of responses ranging from direct interaction and even affection with the body through to total avoidance. Just as responses to death are individual in people, we must also accept each animal’s response without assigning anything further to it, such as a lack of caring for the deceased pet.</para>
