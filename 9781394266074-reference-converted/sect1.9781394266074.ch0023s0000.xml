      <anchor id="ch0023-head-2-134"/>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0002">The title “Anatomy of a humane euthanasia” represents the complexities that go into performing this very important medical procedure. There are many moving parts, all layered upon each other to create a transformative experience, not only for the patient but also for the caregiver and veterinary team. Each element supports the next, ultimately culminating in the death of the patient. This is why the veterinary team was hired: to relieve suffering and to do so in the safest, smoothest, and gentlest way possible.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0003">Euthanasia may be described as humanely terminating life and this phrasing is often included in euthanasia consent forms. With attention to each element of euthanasia, the patient is given a humane death that meets a goal many people want for themselves: to die peacefully in their sleep [<citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0001</citation>, <citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0002</citation>]. The word “humane” has become somewhat of a catchall term meaning to show kindness, care, and empathy, especially to those who are suffering. All veterinary technicians have the opportunity to implement the 14 Essential Components of Companion Animal Euthanasia listed in <ulink url="ch0022">Chapter 10</ulink>. Embracing these components while also holding a deeper understanding of how euthanasia methods work is the purpose of this chapter. A technician’s approach to euthanasia says a lot about their commitment to patient care and the preservation of animals’ dignity through the last breath of life.</para>

      <title>11.2 Technicians as Euthanasia Attendants</title>
      <anchor id="ch0023-head-2-135"/>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0004">There are many moving parts to a successful euthanasia appointment in the veterinary hospital, and technicians can manage most if not all of them. As euthanasia is such an emotional experience for caregivers, it is helpful to have one technician designated to be with them for the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10481">duration</ulink> of the appointment. This technician is known as the euthanasia attendant for that caregiver and patient. They greet the caregiver and patient when they arrive and direct them into the hospital and to the euthanasia room. They review the paperwork, finalize aftercare choices, and describe the procedure. Caregivers may need <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink>, facial tissue, bathroom breaks, and other comforts, which can all be provided by their designated technician. Throughout the appointment,<anchor id="ch0023-Page_168"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="168"/>many staff members may come and go from the room, but the euthanasia attendant is always there addressing the needs of the family until euthanasia is complete. They may walk grieving caregivers out to their vehicles and ensure a safe departure, follow up with a phone call the next day, and send a sympathy card.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0006">In many cases, the technician already knows the family, having worked with them in wellness appointments, or during palliative care treatments and hospice support. These relationships increase the bond during euthanasia and should <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to more trust and safety felt by all parties. In the case of home euthanasia, it is likely the veterinarian and technician are there for the entirety of the appointment, and therefore both will act as attendants.</para>

      <title>11.3 Euthanasia Methods and the Physiology of Death</title>
      <anchor id="ch0023-head-2-136"/>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0007">Veterinary technicians are substantially more prepared for end‐of‐life (EOL) work when they understand the cascade of events that leads to the death of their patient, whether it’s natural death or through euthanasia. With greater understanding, technicians are able to not only predict what’s coming next in the dying trajectory but also better explain to caregivers what is happening and why. Death is a significant life event. Knowledge reduces fear and hopefully increases a comfortable familiarity with what is occurring.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0008">Before euthanasia, dying animal patients have already begun a series of cellular and organ changes leading to death. This is because as the body ages, the heart weakens and reduces its ability to adequately oxygenate tissues. Euthanasia is an abridged version of this where the method eventually or directly stops the heart from beating, and <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> ceases to circulate throughout the body. Without <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> flow, there is no <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13108">oxygen</ulink> delivery to the brain and death becomes permanent. The heart, however, is not necessarily the primary facilitator of death. The brain holds the neurologic center for consciousness and life; therefore, many euthanasia methods specifically focus on brain cessation/death.</para>

      <title>11.3.1 Methods of Euthanasia</title>
      <anchor id="ch0023-head-3-109"/>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0009">Euthanasia is achieved via three main methods, all with the goal of making death irreversible and permanent. The first is the direct depression of neurons necessary for life function. This occurs when pharmaceutical agents are given to the patient, by mouth, injection, or inhalation of anesthetic gases. In companion animal euthanasia, this first method is the most common and will likely remain so for many years to come. Simply administering a drug/agent to quietly end life is desirable. Examples of this include the administration of a lethal dose of <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink>, T61®, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13065">magnesium</ulink> sulfate, or <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=3065">lidocaine</ulink>. These agents work on the brain to cease all life functions, and the body shuts down concurrently. Pentobarbital, a very common euthanasia agent, is known to first cause <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=720">brain death</ulink>, then stop respiration (<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=408">apnea</ulink>), and lastly stop the heart (<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2599">asystole</ulink>). This cascade of events guarantees the patient is unconscious when <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10244">cardiac arrest</ulink> occurs.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0010">The second method to achieve death is through <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=358">hypoxia</ulink>. This means the body’s tissues, in particular the heart and brain, are quickly deprived of life‐sustaining <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13108">oxygen</ulink>. The method targets the cessation of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink> flow throughout the body. Example methods include the administration of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13083">potassium</ulink> chloride to directly stop the heart, or exsanguination to drain the body of <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink>. Neither is common in companion animal euthanasia, but nevertheless can be done if the veterinarian feels the technique is appropriate to the situation.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0011">
         <anchor id="ch0023-Page_169"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="169"/>The third method is to physically damage the brain, especially the brain stem. Examples of this include gunshots, captive bolts, and pithing, which uses a rod inserted into the brain to destroy brain tissue. These methods may sound harsher than the others; however, they play an important role when the first two methods are not appropriate or possible. Physical methods such as pithing are often secondary euthanasia methods in reptiles to ensure death is irreversible <citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0003</citation>.</para>

The five perimortem changes that get the most attention are vocalization, agonal breathing, opisthotonos stretching, myoclonic muscle twitches, and bodily fluid release. These five signs are readily visible to the caregiver and can cause concern that perhaps their pet is struggling with death in some way, however, they are normal and expected. All visible body changes can happen regardless of the manner of death, whether through euthanasia or a natural passing. <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4934">Postmortem changes</ulink> will be explained in more detail in<ulink url="ch0025">Chapter 13</ulink>.</para>

It is the start of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=408">apnea</ulink> (no breathing). They are triggered by low <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=13108">oxygen</ulink> flow and acidemia in the brainstem. To the observer, they mimic gasping for air and attempting to breathe. Instead, agonal breaths are evidence that the brain is dying and there is no conscious perception by the patient that these gasping movements are occurring. Agonal breaths can last a few seconds or a few hours <citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0005</citation>; however, in this author’s experience, companion animals typically take one to ten agonal breaths in total. Once they begin, this natural reflex will continue until done. Patient pre‐euthanasia anesthesia/<ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6231">unconsciousness</ulink> may reduce the likelihood of agonal breathing <citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0006</citation>.</para>

They are further examples to the veterinary team and caregiver that the body is no longer alive. Eye changes can be particularly difficult for caregivers because they become dry and “lifeless” very quickly. The eyelids often remain open meaning the eye changes are highly visible. This is usually a stark contrast to the way they were in life. Another physical change, albeit rare, is an increase in external parasite activity. Observers may find fleas and mites rise to the surface seeking to find another warm body. This author once witnessed nasal mites exiting the nostrils of a dog during euthanasia with <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink>. As the dog exhaled fumes from the circulating <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=Pentobarbital">pentobarbital</ulink> in the <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">blood</ulink>, the mites quickly escaped.</para>

Sedatives and anesthetics can be given to patients to induce light or deep sleep before the euthanasia method is carried out. Ideally, the sleeping patient has a death free of movements such as the ones listed above, although in this author’s experience, it becomes an opportunity to demonstrate that death is occurring at the exact moment these perimortem events happen. It removes uncertainties that the pet may still be living, and that euthanasia was unsuccessful.</para>

      <title>11.4 Pre‐euthanasia Sedation and Anesthesia Protocols</title>
      <anchor id="ch0023-head-2-137"/>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0018">Modern‐day euthanasia of companion animals includes patient sleep during death. Patients are provided with pre‐euthanasia sedatives and/or anesthetics to reduce <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> and anxiety during the procedure and ideally facilitate deep sleep, so the patient is unaware of the process. In 2013, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals stated that the use of pre‐euthanasia sedation or anesthesia should be provided whenever practical, especially with companion animals<citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0009</citation>. This was a significant change from other versions of the guidelines and was evidence that sleep before death was gaining momentum. Other groups such as the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) and Fear Free® Program soon followed with a similar message. Today, especially in animal hospice euthanasia, this approach is expected by both the veterinary team and caregivers.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0019">Inducing a sleep‐like state should be considered when euthanizing companion animals in the presence of loved ones. Every veterinary team will have preferred drug protocols, which should always be adjusted to meet the individual needs of the patient yet standardized so that each one receives something before euthanasia. This means the patient is sleeping before the actual euthanasia method begins and helps to reduce the need for restraint for such things as intravenous (IV) catheter placement. If the patient already has an indwelling IV catheter placed, it may be used to give drugs. Caregivers want their pets to be sleeping during euthanasia and believe this will help make for a more peaceful passing<citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0004</citation>. The more veterinary teams use pre‐euthanasia drugs, the more familiar they will become with their effects and the better they will become at describing expected changes to caregivers. Caregivers may remain with their pets while they succumb to sleep, creating a calm environment ideally free of distractions and overstimulation.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0020">Administering drugs to physically compromised patients has pros and cons, and both should be weighed before proceeding with administration. The best approach is to pay close attention to the patient’s signalment and the planned euthanasia technique.</para>

      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0026">During the early stages of relaxation, patients can have a stuporous appearance, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=503">ataxia</ulink>, and lick their lips. Their eyes often remain open. There is typically a change to the respiratory rate which varies from patient to patient. Caregivers expressing concern can be assured that breathing change is expected. Urination and defecation commonly occur after death, but if the pet is very deep in sleep, the body can release fluids before death. This makes it necessary for technicians to be proactive rather than reactive and protect the patient’s hind end with absorbent materials. <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12285">Blood</ulink> pressure changes are expected and acceptable but add to the complexity. It means venous access is more challenging and time to death may be slowed. Muscle <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2093">fasciculations</ulink> and/or twitching are acceptable but can alarm those in the room. Veterinarians will want to avoid drugs and protocols that elicit <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4151">nausea</ulink> and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=6377">vomiting</ulink>, especially in already critical patients; although even with the most careful planning, all these physical changes may still present. The technician’s role is to explain and manage any and all complexities brought on by the use of sedatives and anesthetics (<link linkend="ch0023-c11-fea-0001">Pro Tip 11.1</link>). The goal is to standardize protocols for patients with pre‐existing conditions that will minimize these effects and also <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to a smooth, comfortable sleep.</para>

      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0027">It is possible for sedatives and anesthetics to cause death before the actual euthanasia method is carried out. This happens when the compromised body becomes so depressed by the drugs that the drugs themselves act as euthanasia agents. In this author’s experience, death via pre‐euthanasia sedatives and anesthetics is rare but it does happen. Technicians and veterinarians who are concerned about this possibility should discuss it with caregivers, so everyone is prepared if death comes sooner rather than later. They should also select drug doses that are suited to compromised patients. There is nothing inherently wrong with a patient being euthanized by pre‐euthanasia drugs, however, if it’s not planned, it can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to rushed “goodbyes” before the caregiver is ready. Examples of euthanasia drug protocols can be found in<link linkend="ch0023-c11-tbl-0002">Table 11.2</link>.</para>

      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0083">Injections under the skin or into the muscle can cause painful reactions. Technicians may ask caregivers if their pet is painful anywhere in the body that should be avoided. If an injection cannot be given without <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>, oral or TM administration should be considered. Another option is to use what is referred to as a two‐step anesthesia protocol. This approach starts with the SC injection of<anchor id="ch0023-Page_175"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="175"/>neutral pH drugs such as butorphanol, acepromazine, and dexmedetomidine, which tend to elicit less reaction (see <link linkend="ch0023-c11-fig-0004">Figure 11.4</link>). After 5–10 minutes of allowing these drugs to relax the patient, a second injection of lower pH drugs such as ketamine, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=12198">midazolam</ulink>, or tiletamine/zolazepam is given to induce complete anesthesia. This two‐step protocol is useful for all patients or those believed to be more sensitive to injections.</para>

      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0084">Many EOL patients can benefit from oral sedatives and anesthetics given in advance of the euthanasia appointment. Oral drugs may be fed or squirted into the mouth up to two hours before the appointment. The Chill Protocol, developed by Dr. Karas at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, recommends some drugs be given the night before and the morning of the euthanasia appointment<citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0011</citation>. In this author’s experience, increasing oral sedative and anesthetic drug doses well above the normal limits is acceptable and even favorable during euthanasia, especially for aggressive patients.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0085">It is important for caregivers to understand that oral sedatives and anesthetics will alter their pet’s mentation and behaviors right up until euthanasia. Technicians will want to be sensitive to this and encourage caregivers to create quiet, calm space around their pet, and to begin saying goodbye when the drugs are given. Once the pet is sleeping caregivers may feel a bit disconnected, therefore it is important that they are mentally prepared for these final moments. Sometimes the oral drugs do not make a significant impact and the patient remains awake. It is hard to predict which patients will fully succumb to the drugs and which ones won’t.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0086">Regardless of how pre‐euthanasia drugs are administered, patient sleep and comfort will need to be assessed before proceeding with the euthanasia method.

      <title>11.5.2 Euthanasia in the Home Setting</title>
      <anchor id="ch0023-head-3-114"/>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0097">Pet euthanasia in the home is considered by many to be the best location possible. This is in large part because it is believed that if the patient had a choice, home is where they themselves would want to be. A home provides so many of the comforts that veterinary hospitals try to emulate, and it is where animal hospice care is typically provided. Caregivers may have already made the choice to stop bringing their pets into hospitals for care, opting instead for all remaining medical support to be conducted at home. This includes the final medical procedure of euthanasia when it is necessary.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0098">While the home has many features out of the control of technicians, they can still attend to multiple details to improve the euthanasia procedure. Technicians will often travel with veterinarians to the home and assist in all aspects of the appointment. One of the most important responsibilities is to make sure all supplies and equipment are ready. This includes enough needles, syringes, drugs, and preparatory supplies to ensure euthanasia can be done. Another important task is to check details such as the address, proper arrival time, where to park, and any special requests about how to enter the home (<link linkend="ch0023-c11-fea-0003">Pro Tip 11.2</link>). Once there, technicians will establish rapport with caregivers and <anchor id="ch0023-Page_180"/>
         <beginpage pagenum="180"/>family pets, obtain consent to proceed with euthanasia, and prepare supplies for the procedure. Technicians may work with caregivers to determine the best location in the home (or outside) to gather, set the stage with adequate yet soft lighting, lay down blankets/towels for comfort, and quiet noisy distractions. Following euthanasia, technicians can collect all supplies and return them to the vehicle for safe return back to the hospital, including controlled substances. All of these features of a home appointment become even more important if the technician is the one performing euthanasia without a veterinarian onsite. While euthanasia is typically performed by a veterinarian, there are situations where animal suffering can be relieved more quickly by a technician performing euthanasia at the direction of the veterinarian. EOL care teams will take care to work within their region’s regulatory framework regarding scope of practice and controlled substance handling <citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0012</citation>. Where possible, mobilizing technicians to perform veterinarian‐directed euthanasia can significantly impact animal welfare and quality of dying. For example, a technician may be able to reach a hospice patient in distress and perform a preplanned, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1751">emergency</ulink> home euthanasia much more quickly than the veterinarian already engaged in another urgent case.</para>

      <title>11.6 Balancing EOL Work and Well‐Being</title>
      <anchor id="ch0023-head-2-142"/>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0099">Euthanasia, when conducted the right way, can be one of the most meaningful procedures in veterinary medicine. As common as euthanasia is, especially in animal hospice work, technicians will want to approach it with the mindset of helping, not hurting. Euthanasia that is chosen to relieve patient suffering can give technicians the feeling of doing good rather than doing harm. It is important that technicians believe that euthanasia is being done for the right reasons, and in the best way possible to create a lasting memory of love for caregivers. If technicians are in conflict with their morals, empathic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5669">strain</ulink> and moral distress can set in. It is up to the entire veterinary team to ensure technicians find balance in EOL work. More information on empathic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5669">strain</ulink> can be found in<ulink url="ch0031">Chapter 17</ulink>.</para>
      <para id="ch0023-c11-para-0100">Technicians can further care for their well‐being during euthanasia by calming their body before, during, and after euthanasia. Self‐regulation is a relaxation technique that lowers the body’s tension and quiets nervous energy. When technicians are more in control of their mind and body, they are less likely to experience secondary traumatic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink>, also known as vicarious traumatization<citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0013</citation>. Secondary traumatic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> is one of the two main components of compassion <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2103">fatigue</ulink> <citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0014</citation>. The other is burnout, which results from too many demands on the job and not enough resources <citation>ch0023-c11-bib-0015</citation>. Euthanasia can be heavy with emotional <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9723">trauma</ulink> coming from caregivers, and often from the physical <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9723">trauma</ulink> of patients (e.g. hit by a car, uncontrollable <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5444">seizures</ulink>, or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5379">osteosarcoma</ulink> <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2225">fractures</ulink>). Technicians who witness <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=9723">trauma</ulink> in a relaxed state are less likely to internalize it. In other words, it is okay for a technician to accompany someone who is suffering, as long as the suffering does not become their own.</para>

Technicians can also use personal connections with caregivers and patients to help them relax. Witnessing the beauty of the human–animal bond during EOL care is a strong reminder of why veterinary professionals do what they do. Even though euthanasia can be emotionally challenging, focusing on the principles of the work should increase job fulfillment and compassion satisfaction.</para>
