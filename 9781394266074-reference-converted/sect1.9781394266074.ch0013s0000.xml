End‐of‐life patients may experience <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> from multiple underlying conditions, and that <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> may change as the conditions progress or new conditions are diagnosed. Veterinary technicians play critical roles in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> management as providers of medical care, patient advocates, and client educators.

      <para id="ch0013-c3-para-0014">Technicians can be highly effective in maintaining lines of communication between the veterinary team and caregivers to optimize <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> management. They can facilitate rapid detection of changes in patient status or response to treatment and communicate them to the veterinarian. Technicians offering telemedicine or in‐person support between veterinarian exams may help expedite treatment plan revisions by the veterinarian in response to patient needs or caregiver burden. Caregivers with an open line of communication with the EOL care team will also be more likely to communicate challenges with caregiver burden, concerns about the care plan, or future decision‐making. Engaged and knowledge EOL technicians have significant potential to improve the patient's QOL and maintain a positive rapport with the caregivers.</para>
      <para>EOL patients are often impacted by chronic, neuropathic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> and multiple comorbidities. The treatment plan must effectively account for these comorbidities and seek to address the neuropathic nature of chronic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> where it is present. When implementing a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> management plan, it is important to interrupt the cycle of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> particularly where neuropathic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> is present or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10304">at risk</ulink> of developing. This might involve the short‐term use of drugs, doses, or frequencies that may not form part of the ongoing treatment plan. For example, pharmaceuticals like opioids (e.g. <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=2758">fentanyl</ulink> or methadone) may be used to control severe <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> initially but then be discontinued in favor of other strategies for long‐term <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> management. When a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> management plan is implemented, technicians will be vigilant in monitoring patients for their response. Ongoing and regular monitoring allows technicians to continue supporting and educating clients, as well as staying informed about any changes in their patient's status that may require veterinary re‐evaluation. Technicians can advocate for treatment changes for a variety of reasons:</para>

      <para id="ch0013-c3-para-0017">NSAIDs are a mainstay of analgesia in veterinary medicine due to their effect on <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> pathways both peripherally and centrally and their direct anti‐inflammatory action. They are an appropriate choice for the treatment of both acute and chronic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink> and are a common component of multimodal <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4524">pain</ulink> management in EOL patients.

      <para id="ch0013-c3-para-0018">The primary effect of <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=NSAIDs">NSAIDs</ulink> is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), which is an important enzyme in the process of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3144">inflammation</ulink>. Inhibiting COX inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins. This reduces <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3144">inflammation</ulink> and related inflammatory <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> at the site of injury or disease. <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=NSAIDs">NSAIDs</ulink> may target both forms of COX (COX‐1 and COX‐2) or they may be more selective for COX‐2, which is more involved in <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> and <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=3144">inflammation</ulink>. COX‐2 selective <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10028">NSAIDs</ulink> have a reduced risk of adverse effects that can be associated with COX‐1 inhibition (e.g. gastrointestinal irritation, renal or liver damage). In addition to anti‐inflammatory and analgesic effects at the site of tissue disease or damage, <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10028">NSAIDs</ulink> have also been found to act at the level of the spinal cord. <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10028">NSAIDs</ulink> can increase descending inhibitory signals to counteract some of the neurophysiological changes associated with neuropathic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink>

      <para id="ch0013-c3-para-0019">There are a variety of veterinary licensed <ulink type="drugsynonym" url="/search/search_results_index.aspx?searchterm=NSAIDs">NSAIDs</ulink> available in different formulations. Each veterinary team will have products they are more familiar with and use more frequently. However, each patient and caregiver is unique, and the best NSAID is going to be the one that works for them. If a particular NSAID is difficult to administer or the patient experiences adverse effects, it is reasonable for veterinarians to try again with another type of NSAID before excluding them from the treatment plan. Patients prescribed <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10028">NSAIDs</ulink> will need to be monitored routinely for changes in their health status, which may trigger revision of the treatment plan. This may include small adjustments such as dosing changes due to level of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> and bodyweight. The use of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10028">NSAIDs</ulink> may need to be re‐evaluated based on the occurrence of adverse effects or changes in organ function (such as diagnosis of liver or kidney dysfunction or the occurrence of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=2325">gastrointestinal disease</ulink>). Patients receiving long‐term use of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10028">NSAIDs</ulink> would ideally be monitored with serum biochemistry to monitor liver and kidney function.

      <para id="ch0013-c3-para-0024">Opioids are a key component of analgesia and the cornerstone of acute <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> management, but they are not the first line of therapy for chronic <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink>. Opioids bind to receptors (mu, kappa, and delta) in the central nervous system. When opioids bind to their target receptors they act to inhibit nociceptive pathways, with opioids that bind primarily to mu receptors having the strongest analgesic effect (<link linkend="ch0013-c3-tbl-0002">Table 3.2</link>). Injectable opioids are fast acting and bioavailable when administered intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM), or subcutaneously (SC). They are also used in locoregional anesthesia techniques such as <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=10081">epidural</ulink> administration. Administration of opioids by other routes (transdermal/TD, oral transmucosal/OTM, oral/PO or rectal/PR) will have more variable absorption into systemic circulation, which is why injectable routes are preferred. For example, <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=2758">fentanyl</ulink> patches have been widely used in the past, but there are challenges with skin adherence as well as wide variability in absorption and concerns with ingestion <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=1576">toxicity</ulink> and human abuse.

      <para id="ch0013-c3-para-0071">The controlled status of opioids makes their use in EOL home care plans challenging from a regulatory standpoint. Before EOL veterinarians prescribe these drugs, it is recommended that caregivers sign additional informed consent forms tailored to the prescription, handling, storage, and responsible use of controlled substances. Developing an approach to the prescription of controlled substances within EOL home care can be valuable in providing effective <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> palliation at home. This may be useful when the EOL care team is supporting death at home, either through hospice supported natural death or humane euthanasia. Prescribing opioids for use at home during a <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4522">pain</ulink> crisis is also becoming more common in companion animal EOL care, often through the use of “comfort kits.” The opioid in this instance is generally dispensed in a syringe also containing the tranquilizer acepromazine to provide analgesia and mild sedation for patient comfort during a sudden change of patient status that may be associated with an acute exacerbation of <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=4523">pain</ulink>. The use of a comfort kit may allow the patient to die more peacefully if they are in the active process, or it may provide comfort while awaiting an urgent house call from a veterinarian or arranging transport to a veterinary facility.
