CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

1. INCOMPLETE ARCHIVE
   The ZIP only contains 1 out of 36 chapter XML files
   Book.XML only declares one chapter entity: &ch0001;
   Missing chapter entities: ch0002 through ch0036

2. CONTENT COVERAGE
   Only 39.2% of the book's text content is in the ZIP
   Missing 61% of the complete book (~264,000 words)

3. IMAGE FILES
   ZIP has 318 images but PDF contains 595 images
   Missing approximately 277 images from later chapters

4. STRUCTURAL COMPLETENESS
   ZIP appears to be a partial export, sample, or Chapter 1 demo
   Not suitable for complete book reconstruction

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

FOR READING:
  → Use the PDF (9780989163286.pdf) - contains complete content

FOR EDITING/PRODUCTION:
  → Current ZIP is incomplete - request full source archive
  → Complete archive should contain 36 XML chapter files
  → Verify Book.XML contains all chapter entity declarations

FOR ARCHIVAL:
  → PDF is complete and suitable for archival (1,019 pages)
  → ZIP is incomplete - not suitable for content preservation

FOR OBTAINING COMPLETE SOURCE:
  → Request all chapter XML files (ch0001.xml through ch0036.xml)
  → Ensure all 595+ images are included
  → Verify Book.XML has all chapter references

================================================================================
