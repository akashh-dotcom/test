        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <para>During the last three decades, interventional and intraoperative uses of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have evolved into important applications for image-guided therapy and surgical procedures (1, 2). These two unique uses of MRI technology will be referred to as interventional MRI or "iMRI" in this chapter. Because iMRI involves toolsets unlike those used in diagnostic MRI, it presents multiple challenges in designing a safe work environment (3). The complex and unique workflow of therapeutic and surgical procedures performed in the iMRI suite may involve anesthesia and new approaches for perioperative and intraoperative care. These departures from standard uses of MRI requires the safe translation of clinical applications from the interventional suite and the operating room (OR) into the iMRI setting. For example, percutaneous needle-based procedures and thermal ablations (4-6), catheter-based intravascular interventions (7, 8), endoscopies (9, 10), and "open" surgeries (11-14) have special instrumentation and access requirements. The therapy-related armamentarium for each type of procedure can introduce challenges for effective integration into the iMRI environment (15, 16), but also for safe operation. In this active and potentially chaotic setting, assuring safety for patients and staff members is paramount. This chapter presents the most important aspects of safety in the iMRI environment which is based on more than twenty years of experience with multiple types of iMR systems spanning a large number of clinical applications at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH).</para>
        <para>The design of interventional suites and operating rooms requires consideration of various workflow paradigms related to the procedures. If image-guidance is involved, the imaging systems should be closely integrated with the procedural workflow (17). However, since many imaging systems can potentially injure or harm the patient and staff, careful consideration of the unique safety issues are central to the design of safe and effective paradigms. This concern is particularly true in the iMRI environment. Several unique factors must be considered when an iMRI suite is designed and built. Furthermore, when an MR system is located in an OR environment, the requirements are even more complex, since MRI safety must be combined with other patient safety measures (18). If an MR system is co-located with an X-ray system (XMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) system, or computed tomography (CT) system, then MRI safety issues are compounded with concerns regarding system interactions and the use of ionizing radiation (19).</para>
        <para>The Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) Suite at the BWH consists of three procedure rooms: (1) the central OR housing the operating table, a ceiling-mounted single-plane X-ray system, a surgical navigation system, surgical microscope, and an ultrasound system, flanked by (2) a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) room on one side, and (3) an MR system room on the other side with integrated cryotherapy, ablative laser, and targeting systems. The 3-T Siemens Verio MR scanner was modified by IMRIS (Minnetonka, MN) to move into the OR via ceiling rails. Sliding "barn" doors separate the PET/CT and MR system rooms from the central OR (20). Each procedure room has a separate entrance to the control corridor and support spaces (Figure 1). The complexity of this space results in the inclusion of nearly every safety challenge experienced by other iMRI facilities.</para>

        <para>Minimally invasive procedures performed entirely in the MR system room are conducted iteratively, with the patient scanned at isocenter in the scanner, then withdrawn partially from the bore of the MR system in order to undergo the intervention with an "in-and-out" approach. All devices and instruments used in this setting must be MR Safe or MR Conditional.</para>
        <para>In contradistinction, a combination of conventional MR Unsafe, ferromagnetic surgical instruments and devices are used in the central OR. Prior to translation of the mobile 3-Tesla iMR system into the central OR for the imaging portion of the procedure, these tools and devices are moved outside of the 5-gauss line or removed from the room, entirely.</para>
        <para>To acquire a PET/CT scan during an OR procedure, the patient is shuttled along a removable bridge that connects the OR table with the PET/CT table, through the sliding doors that adjoin the rooms, and into the adjacent stationary PET/CT scanner. Although the MRI risks are absent, the hazards associated with moving an intubated patient with intravenous access are present.</para>
        <para>The AMIGO Suite will be used in this chapter as an example to illustrate the safety issues for iMR systems and to propose solutions. The valuable perspectives of other groups related to this topic have been previously published (21-27), and various competing para-</para>
        <para>digms have emerged for suite design and procedural workflow (28). Notably, the scope of iMRI procedures are expanding (29). The facilities built to support iMRI are often unique, reflecting design elements required by the specific purpose of the space. Although safety issues related to iMRI can be challenging, they can be minimized and managed through effective policies, procedures, staff training, access controls, and facility design to promote best practices and the correction of safety lapses.</para>

      <title>DESIGNING FOR SAFETY</title>
      <para>Architectural design is one useful means of facilitating desired behaviors for MRI safety. Selecting a space remote from the main OR enables the staff to enter the mindset that they are not in their usual working environment and, thus, they must adapt their habits to the iMRI setting. A remote location further limits the flow of staff members, not involved with the procedure, into this particular space. In emergency situations such as codes, the location has both positive and negative attributes. The advantage is that it affords the opportunity to post an MRI Safety Screener at the entrance to ensure that members of the responding team do not enter into the space unless they have undergone screening and determined that they can safely enter the area. The disadvantage of a remote location is the potential delay in the</para>

      <para>arrival time of the first responders. This can be overcome by local policies such as in the AMIGO Suite, which is located near a cardiology recovery room, where anesthesia staff members from that space, rather than from the more remote hospital OR, are assigned as first responders.</para>
      <para>The AMIGO Suite was laid out in accordance with recommendations from the American College of Radiology (ACR) document (30) pertaining to the MRI environment by which the first layer of swipe-card access enables staff members to enter from Zone I (public space) into Zone II (a restricted staff members, gowning area) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>). A second swipe-card access point (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3A</emphasis>) is located at the entrance to Zone III (the control room corridor). Access points into Zone II and III are monitored by security cameras connected to the Flow Coordinator's desk and to the hospital's security department.</para>
      <para>The MR system room is classified as Zone IV, mandating that MR Unsafe equipment is not allowed to enter the area. Depending on the current location of the MR scanner, the central OR shifts between Zone III (MRI sequestered), where ferromagnetic objects are permitted, and Zone IV (MR system deployed). Before the MR scanner is moved into the central OR, the sliding door that separates the OR from the MR system room is opened to create a single, large radiofrequency (RF) shielded space. Conjoining the spaces enables the MR scanner to move along the ceiling-mounted rails from the MR system room into the central OR. Upon opening the sliding doors, the door between the control corridor and the MR system room automatically locks to prevent staff members from entering the scanner</para>

        <para>room, resulting in a single entry pathway from the control corridor into the conjoined OR/MR system room.</para>
        <para>Additional oversight of this space due to this design results from patients transiting into the appropriate procedure room via the control corridor. This practice is different from typical interventional spaces, such as angiography labs, in which a second doorway into the procedure spaces allows the control rooms to be free of patient traffic. A second entry point in an iMRI suite represents a potential vulnerability, especially if proper line-of-site from the control corridor to the door is obscured and, thus, the desired restriction of staff members' access would be compromised. The complexity of controlling access into the MR system room (Zone IV) is increased at sites (i.e., unlike the AMIGO Suite), where a single scanner services more than one OR.</para>
        <para>The doors into the procedure rooms have two operating modes: (1) activation by a push plate, or (2) activation by a keypad code entry. The keypad code is held by only a few core staff members. Controlling or eliminating pathways for the flow of staff members helps to ensure that no MR Unsafe devices or instruments are brought into the room with the MR system, particularly during off hours.</para>
        <para>With regard to the AMIGO Suite, a dual-stage ferromagnetic detection (FMD) system was added to the the Zone III control corridor (Figure 3B). Although not standard at the time of initial design and construction, the use of such systems has become a standard Facilities Guideline Institute requirement for all future iMRI installations. A screening FMD system is located near the flow coordinator's desk that is used for first-stage screening. The second stage screening is accomplished via FMD gates placed near the doors to the procedure spaces.</para>

        <para>MRI danger signs are posted on doors, along with conspicuous mats that read "Stop! Magnet Always On" are embedded in the flooring. Indicator lights above the doors inform staff members regarding which room the MR system is "parked" in, and when the X-ray machine or the laser is in use<emphasis role="bold">(Figure 3B)</emphasis>. Retractable yellow caution belts bar the door when the respective room is not being utilized. While signage is necessary, in reality, it is seldom effective. Physical barriers such as locked doors and limiting entrances are crucial to mitigate risk in the iMRI environment.</para>

      <title>SAFETY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</title>
      <para>Policies and procedures, which can be difficult to standardize, are tailored for site appropriateness. An issue all facilities have in common is the daunting risk inherent to combining medical procedures and iMRI. It has now been many years since the patient fatality (31, 32) that galvanized the MRI community to deal with safety issues centered on diagnostic MRI. Despite policy recommendations and raised awareness since that event (33), there has been an increase in the number of reported accidents related to the MRI environment (34). Recent accidents highlight the continued risk. For example, an experienced staff member was injured at one site (35) and a visitor was fatally wounded at another (36). Risks tend to be greater in the iMRI environment, where ferromagnetic materials such as interventional devices and surgical support equipment are purposely introduced into the environment to facilitate mission critical tasks. In addition to projectile risks, the improper use of necessary equipment can increase the risk of patient burns in association with MRI.</para>

      <para>Whereas suite design can help facilitate safety by limiting or directing the flow within the suite, design alone is incapable of eliminating all hazards. Thus, safety policies and ongoing safety training are required to establish a desired set of acceptable behaviors. As with all policy-based approaches, they are subject to the fallibility of the individual. A clear and effective safety policy is a valuable tool to reduce risk. Establishing a dedicated multidisciplinary core team assigned daily to the iMRI environment is an important factor to formalize, promulgate, and enforce policies and procedures that help to ensure safety within the suite. Primary issues that should be addressed by all iMRI sites include training, access, and safety checklists. Policy governing site-specific issues such as the shared use of space for clinical and research purposes as well as the management of tour groups and vendors should be considered. Other centers have site-specific issues such as the shared use of the installation for interventional and/or intraoperative use and diagnostic imaging (26).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Training and Accreditation</emphasis>All staff members who work in or have duties that require them to have access to the AMIGO Suite must complete highly specific safety training prior to receiving access to the area. Training and testing ensure that all staff members and vendors working in the suite have a clear understanding of policy and procedures and fully comprehend the potential risks associated with MRI, as well as ionizing radiation hazards in the AMIGO Suite environment. Training modules include a general suite orientation, MRI safety, and general radiation safety. Staff members must pass a written exam on MRI safety and have no contraindications to working in the MRI environment, as documented on an MRI safety</para>

        <para>An accredited staff member will have badge access to gain entry to Zone II. In this area, cell phones, pagers, and other ferromagnetic objects are placed in a day locker. A non-ferromagnetic key to the locker remains with the staff member. Badge access is then used to gain entry into Zone III, at which point it is required to sign in at the Flow Coordinator desk and use the FMD system for screening. After substantiating that no ferromagnetic objects are in their possession, the staff members are provided with orange bouffant hats to wear over their existing OR hat, to indicate that they have been screened and may enter Zone IV (Figure 3C). This hat is discarded upon leaving the suite.</para>

          <emphasis role="bold">Tailored Checklists and Tailored Roles</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>In a typical diagnostic MRI environment, the MRI technologists are the primary staff members tasked with ensuring safety. In the iMRI setting, safety challenges require the inclusion and expertise of a larger, more diverse group. In addition to our core team members who have specific roles for each procedure, it has been necessary to create two new roles whose focus is entirely on safety and compliance within the suite during a procedure.</para>
        <para>The first new role is a Safety Screener, stationed at the entrance to the suite between Zone II and Zone III. This team member's job is to ensure that entering staff have complied with requirements to place ferromagnetic items in the day locker. The Flow Coordinator sits at a central location in the suite, and has camera views of the Zone I to Zone II transition, as well as the Zone II to Zone III transition. The Flow Coordinator is responsible for maintaining a sign-in list of all staff members present for a procedure and verifies that individuals entering the AMIGO Suite have undergone all necessary training (by cross-reference to a training database), are properly attired, have removed ferromagnetic items from their person, and have undergone screening using the ferromagnetic detection system. This team member also screens vendors and visitors for contraindications to be in the MRI environment. Another core staff member is stationed facing the entrance into Zone IV to ensure the approved workflow is not broken and no non-approved items are brought into the OR or MR system rooms. The Safety Nurse is responsible for knowing the roles and background of all staff members in the procedure and adjoining space. The Safety Nurse is charged with tracking when and why each device and instrument kit is introduced into the procedure, and ensuring that unneeded equipment is not admitted into the area. He or she administrates the safety checklists in conjunction with the MRI Technologist.</para>
        <para>In addition to the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Pause performed at intervals in all surgeries (37), an MRI Safety Pause has been instituted to mitigate risks prior to bringing the patient into the MR system room or the adjoining OR, as well as prior to transferring the MR scanner into the OR. Figure 4 shows the respective checklists. Each procedure has a checklist tailored to the attending equipment and instruments and is modified to adapt to changes in the procedure as it evolves. The MRI status of each device is noted and</para>

        <para>due to the conductive foil backing. The checklist mandates an accurate instrument count, since consequences of an inaccurate count are increased in the iMRI environment. A ferromagnetic tool left in the surgical field can become a projectile when the patient enters the bore of the scanner. If a metallic tool is touching the patient, an image artifact or even a burn can occur.

Another role of the MRI technologist is to collect MRI data, sometimes in conjunction with an MRI physicist, and to gather vendor claims about a new device for review by an internal committee before it is used in proximity to the MR system.</para>

        <para>Staff members including anesthesiologists, nurses, surgeons, interventionalists, radiologists, and MRI technologists should be trained to respond to cardiopulmonary emergencies that may occur either in the MR scanner room or in the OR when the MR system is present. Mock emergency code drills (e.g., code blue) are important for refining the processes and to gain comfort levels surrounding the different situations. Policy and education should exist to prevent responders from other areas from bringing ferromagnetic materials and equipment into any space in which the MR scanner is deployed. Conversely, first responders should not be delayed from assisting the medical team if the MR system is safely sequestered.</para>
        <para>In the AMIGO Suite, the emergency code button has a different meaning from the code button in other areas of the hospital. A special MRI-trained team with swipe-card access responds to the emergency. Although there are devices in development for resuscitation in the MR system room, none are yet commercially available (40, 41). Therefore, the patient undergoing an intervention in the MR system room (Zone IV) is immediately removed from the room and brought to a designated resuscitation area within the suite in Zone III. Some scanners have break-away tables that can serve as a transport table. Scanners with fixed tables require that the patient is transferred to an MR Safe or MR Conditional stretcher. A designated team member should be responsible for shutting and locking the door to the MR system room and maintaining access restrictions, while other staff members expeditiously move the patient to the resuscitation area. The area should have adequate space, monitoring equipment, oxygen, suction, and electrical outlets to facilitate resuscitation and management of the patient.</para>

Staff members who work in the iMRI suite should be subjected to the same screening procedure. However, since the staff members will not be imaged, some contraindications (e.g., body piercing jewelry, joint replacement, etc.) do not need to be considered. Screening forms designed for patients and other individuals (i.e., staff members, visitors, etc.) may be obtained from the website, www.MRIsafety.com.

      <title>Labeling</title>
      <para>The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International has designated definitions (i.e., terminology) for labeling devices, as follows MR Safe, MR Conditional, and MR Unsafe (44). At our institution, candidate instruments for a procedure are tested with a powerful handheld magnet by the nurse, MRI technologist, or MRI physicist before being added to the instrument kit. Instruments used in the OR can be ferromagnetic since they can be safely positioned before the MR scanner is transferred into the OR. In the AMIGO Suite, instruments used in the MR system room must pass ASTM International standard F2052 testing (45), which determines if a handheld instrument or device has the potential to become a projectile in the presence of the magnetic field and involves testing for translational attraction (Figure 5). While the worst-case location is specific to the model of the MR system, even for scanners operating at the same field strength (e.g., Siemens 3-Tesla Skyra versus Siemens 3-Tesla Prisma), this position tends to be in the proximity of the opening of the bore of the MR system.</para>

Although these standards are useful for implants, specific standards and procedures are needed for the task of evaluating items used in iMRI (e.g., robotic actuators, head fixation systems, infusion pumps, AC/DC power adaptors, biopsy trajectory devices, patient positioning devices, etc.) but, at the present time, they do not exist. The MR system manufacturers have their own tests for device evaluation. Accordingly, the end-user is largely reliant on the vendor for providing information for a given device. This information may be distributed by various means including the device user manual, vendor-issued bulletins, and labels on the device, itself. As always, the term MR Conditional has specific meaning on a per device basis, requiring the user to be sophisticated enough to understand the meanings.</para>
      <para>In the AMIGO Suite, a dedicated anesthesia technologist manages and appropriately positions MR Conditional and MR Unsafe anesthesia equipment and devices. As an example of the complexity, a device console may have a different maximum permissible field strength where it can be safely used, which is different from the limit for the AC/DC adaptor that powers it. It is the nature of some surgeries that the anesthesia set-up may be at the patient's left or right based on the surgical approach. As such, equipment is regularly moved. Human vigilance is essential for preventing error. If this process were managed by a larger non-dedicated group of staff members, the likelihood of error would increase.</para>

Practices at the AMIGO Suite reflect an amplification of this recommendation but verify even written vendor claims, because some claims are inaccurate or do not apply to a given MRI setting. If in-house expertise exists, a set of tests can be performed to confirm vendor claims or establish the level of safety of an instrument or device (52).</para>

        <title>Static Magnetic Field-Related Issues</title>
        <para>Although the adverse events associated with diagnostic MRI that are most frequently reported in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and in the United Kingdom (53) are due to burns, the greatest safety concern in environments where MRI-guided open surgeries (e.g., breast, brain, and spine) are performed is the static magnetic field. Such procedures may require the use of MR Unsafe items such as surgical microscopes, electrosurgical units, and light sources. The effect of the static magnetic field drastically increases with proximity to the bore of the MR system. This sudden change in translational attraction gives little warning to a staff member holding a ferromagnetic object as he or she approaches the scanner. Lines indicating the fringe field levels associated with the MR system can be marked on the floor around the scanner to serve as a visual reminder to staff members. In the AMIGO Suite, the 5-gauss fringe field is marked on the floor. The 400-gauss field line is also shown to indicate the limit for the particular anesthesia machine utilized in this setting. The MR system used in the AMIGO Suite can be offset and rotated 180-degrees to enable additional procedural workflows in the scanner room. Therefore, the fringe field markings on the floor are a worst-case superposition of the lines for the two different imaging locations. A second set of lines is present in the OR to depict the fringe field when the scanner is at its third imaging location (Figure 5A). The relationship between the isogauss lines and the force exerted on an object has been carefully studied at our institution (54).</para>
        <para>Translational attraction and torque constitute the greatest risks in the MRI setting. An object may become a projectile as it accelerates in the direction of the spatial gradient of the static magnetic field. Large objects can generate incredible force as they are rapidly drawn into the magnet. As previously stated, our practice is to test all devices, even with MR Safe labels, using a powerful handheld magnet. Additionally, we cautiously introduce larger items into the MR system room with a tether, if necessary, and follow other appropriate procedures to conduct a proper evaluation of magnetic field interactions.</para>

Titanium alloy and ceramic materials are not subjected to magnetic field interactions and cause relatively small artifacts that are the direct result of their negligible magnetic susceptibilities. Various vendors at points in time have produced instruments for the iMRI market (15). Understandably, costs and lead times for these instruments are higher than for conventional instruments. Fortunately, some conventional off-the-shelf instruments are constructed from titanium due to the material's inherent advantage of being lower in weight compared to steel.</para>

          <emphasis role="bold">Image Artifacts Caused by a Device</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) emanating from an active device can manifest in the MR image as a zipper artifact or increased noise across the entire image, depending on the bandwidth of the noise and of the MR system's receiver bandwidth. Vendors may erroneously assume that because their device passes EMI tests at a higher field strength/frequency, their test results can be extended to lower field strengths/frequencies. However, EMI harmonics may be present in the imaging bandwidth at one field strength, but not another. The user may learn this when a patient is undergoing MRI and a zipper artifact obscures the critical anatomy of interest.</para>
        <para>EMI testing may be performed by running the MR system manufacturer's quality assurance scans for noise with and without the device present. The device can be activated, in a stand-by mode, or "off" but plugged in, depending on its state in the clinical setting during imaging. The frequency of the zipper can be identified and can be useful in tracing the source in the electronics. A zipper drifting in frequency usually indicates the source of EMI is the electronics associated with a digital clock in the device. The EMI revealed by such scans may have low enough energy as to not be clinically relevant, so scans from a clinical protocol should also be tested. At our institution, variations in shielding of MR Conditional devices has yielded one instance of a device that did not emit EMI and another that was problematic. A complicated issue, however, is the interactivity of multiple devices. EMI from one device can be carried or amplified by another device resulting in image artifacts when the devices used individually are not problematic. Moreover, EMI from a device may be a function of position within the room. The device may pick up and amplify EMI from a leaky penetration panel, window, or other vulnerable point in the RF shielding. A device placed in the line-of-site of the receive RF coil may induce a zipper artifact, whereas the same device placed on the side of the scanner may not be problematic. A spectrum analyzer with a sniffer loop is a valuable tool in identifying EMI sources. These analyzers are not MR Safe, so long cables are required.</para>
        <para>Image artifacts can be assessed in phantoms by imaging with and without the device under test present. Distortion or signal void due to susceptibility mismatch between the object and the surrounding medium can be evaluated (55). An artifact observed on an MR image is a function of field strength/frequency, pulse sequence parameters (mainly receiver bandwidth and echo time), and the orientation of the object to the static magnetic field of the MR system. Artifacts can change the apparent location of the device, which for example can give rise to inaccurate or unsafe needle targeting associated with a biopsy procedure (56). In open surgery, the susceptibility mismatch between air and tissue can appear as a region of hyperintensity that can mimic contrast-enhanced tissue (57).</para>

Such RF-related artifacts can compromise visualization of the lumen in the presence of a vascular stent (58).</para>
      <para>Artifacts can lead to image misinterpretation due to distortion of geometry, or regionally obscuring or obliterating signal from tissue. The degree of acceptable artifact is subject to the judgment of the physician performing the procedure and the radiologist interpreting the images. If contrast administration during brain tumor resection is repeated, images may be difficult to interpret due to the continued spread of contrast throughout the edematous brain. This problem is not experienced in a comparatively brief diagnostic MRI session. To avoid this problem, some centers reserve the administration of an intravenous contrast agent until the tumor has been resected and then use imaging to assess the completeness of the surgery (59).</para>

Long-term exposure to the static magnetic field impacted the motor's performance and resulted in the feature being unusable.</para>
        <para>The imaging gradients can create a field switching at about 100-Hz to several kilohertz. For the time-varying, gradient magnetic fields, the worst-case scenario location for testing is not at isocenter of the MR system. The fields due to the imaging gradients increase proportional to the distance from isocenter and then fall off outside of the field of view. The peak field is about 30-cm from isocenter and varies across different scanners depending on the features of the gradient coils. The time-varying, gradient magnetic fields can induce eddy currents in the patient and in conducting materials, but is generally not a concern for substantial heating. However, the induced currents in devices can interact with the static magnetic field, creating forces and torques on the device. If the device vibrates and is in contact with the patient, image artifacts can occur. If the device is a part of a positioning stage for needle targeting and the gradients cause vibrations in a component of the device, inaccuracies may occur.</para>

Current safety guidelines for patients that do not consider the presence of devices limit temperature increases in the torso to 2°C or a peak specific absorption rate (SAR) of 8°C to 10-W/kg. The whole-body-averaged SAR is limited to 4-W/kg in the body, and 3.2-W/kg in the head over a 15-minute period (60, 61). RF energy associated with MRI is a concern for heating due to ohmic heating.

Any conductor in or near the transmit RF coil, including the patient, has the potential to be involved in RF-induced heating.</para>

As a preventive measure, a cold compress or ice pack can be applied to areas potentially affected by heating.

Precautions to prevent excessive heating are of particular importance for patients under sedation or general anesthesia who are unable to notice or report pain. Heating may be minimized with the use of a local transmit RF coil (e.g., quadrature head coil) instead of the body RF coil and judicious selection of pulse sequences and parameters to limit the SAR (65).</para>
        <para>A fiber-optic temperature measurement device with multiple probes is necessary to accurately test for heating. When evaluating MRI-related heated for an implant or device, probes should be placed on or near corners and tips, as well as other discontinuities where the electric field tends to be the highest (66). The design that is used for the phantom to simulate the patient for a proper heating assessment is critical. Importantly, a device in free space will behave differently than a device that is in contact with the patient. For example, our team assessed a carbon-fiber, Jackson table used for positioning patients undergoing spine surgery. No heating was measured with the square piece of material in isolation. When a tissue equivalent load was placed at the corner, a notable temperature elevation was observed.</para>
        <para>Temperature elevations that occur in long conducting wires of a certain length can be sudden and extreme, especially at the tip of the wire.

        <para>that the procedure room is a more familiar setting to the surgeon or interventionalist. In the absence of the static magnetic field, conventional MR Unsafe equipment like a surgical microscope, ultrasound system, and steel instruments can be used. Great care must be taken to manage all devices and instruments before performing MR imaging. As in the AMIGO Suite, before the mobile MR system is translated on ceiling rails into the procedure room, MR Unsafe ceiling-mounted booms, lights, and monitors are pivoted to the walls and other MR Unsafe items are either brought out of the room or moved outside the 5-gauss line (Figure 6).</para>
        <para>Alternatively, with other approaches, the patient can be moved from the OR into the MR system room. The same time out and procedure-specific checklists must be completed prior to moving the patient from the OR into the MR scanner room. In addition to the risk of unaccounted for items becoming projectiles when the patient is moved, there is a risk of extubation or extravasation due to tension on the breathing circuit or intravenous lines, respectively. The anesthesia machine and physiological monitor are tethered by interfaces to the patient and, therefore, these devices must move as a unit with the patient table. A solution to mount the cable connection point for the physiological monitor to the patient table is available. Efforts have also been made to couple a defeatured anesthesia machine to the table to avoid cable tension during transfer (73).</para>
        <para>A commonality across original equipment manufacturers is that the patient stays on a rigid transfer board for the entire procedure. The transfer board is MR Safe and is integrated with both the MR system platform and the surgical table platform. Multiple vendors have variants on the transfer approach. In one case, a manually moved transfer table end-docks with the surgical table, collects the transfer board/patient, then moves into the MR system</para>
        <para>room where it docks with the scanner for imaging (Figure 7). In another variant, the surgical table moves along a floor track to dock with the MRI table before transferring the patient from one table to the other with the transfer board (26) (Figure 8). Single room approaches use a similar transfer concept or have a table that pivots out of the scanner into an area with a relatively low fringe field, where surgery is performed (46, 74) (Figure 9).</para>
        <para>The advantage of the single room solution is the rapid turn around between imaging and intervention. This also comes at the expense of using MR Safe or MR Conditional equipment and regaining needed functionality through ingenuity, or omitting the functionality, potentially compromising the procedure. Alternatively, MR Unsafe devices can be used while managing risk. To minimize patient movement, neurosurgical procedures can be performed with the in-and-out paradigm, in which the patient's head extends from the back of the bore of the scanner to permit the surgical procedure and then back into the MR system for imaging. MR imaging can be achieved by moving the patient approximately one-meter to isocenter (75) (Figure 10). Similarly, abdominal interventions can be performed with this same in-and-out paradigm.</para>

        <title>MR Conditional Equipment</title>
        <para>Although MR Conditional anesthesia machines, ventilators, drug infusion pumps, and physiological monitors are available, the development of MR Conditional anesthesia support equipment is not keeping pace with the development of new procedure enabling devices. While simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring during functional MRI (fMRI) is now common (83), there is no commercially available MR Conditional bi-spectral index device nor peripheral nerve stimulator for assessing the depth of anesthesia. If MR Unsafe devices are used, they must be removed before the MR system is transported into the OR. Furthermore, at the present time, there is no commercially-available, external defibrillator that is MR Conditional. If either cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac instability is noted during an iMRI procedure, the patient must be removed from the MR system room (i.e., Zone IV) before using an external defibrillator. In situations where there is the likelihood of cardiac instability or arrhythmia in non-iMRI environments, external defibrillator/pacing pads may be placed on the patient before the induction of anesthesia. This precaution cannot be done in the MR system room because the metallic foil backing on the pads increases the potential for skin burns, where the pads contact the patient. In this case, the risk of instability or arrhythmia may outweigh the potential benefit of proceeding with the procedure. Although MR Conditional, core body temperature measurement devices are now available, there are no MR Conditional temperature control devices for patients. For example, at BWH, the air blower is removed prior to the MR scanner entering the OR. In the MR system room, a blower is positioned in an RF shielded closet built into the room. An MR Safe extension hose is used to replace the MR Unsafe hose packaged with the device. Although there is some loss due to heat transfer through the hose, it is still possible to warm or cool the patient.</para>
        <para>Intubation near the MR scanner is enabled by laryngoscope designs with MR Conditional batteries. To our knowledge, to date, no video laryngoscopes are marketed for use in the MRI setting. However, we have tested devices that show promise for use outside the bore of the scanner. MR Conditional steerable endoscopes have been constructed by several research groups (84, 85) The inadvertent placement of a certain type of endotracheal tube (Fastrach ETT, LMA/Teleflex) at our institution during a diagnostic MRI examination of a patient with a difficult airway resulted in images with substantial signal losses (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>). No injury occurred to the patient. The packaging for this particular ETT had no indication of its level of MRI-related issues. This endotracheal tube has a reinforcing metallic coil running the length of the device, which is magnetic. This incident led to an appraisal of this and other items in the conventional armamentarium for anesthesia delivery, some of which are listed in the <emphasis role="italics">Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices</emphasis> and posted online at www.MRIsafety.com.</para>

Additionally, the static magnetic field can induce apparent ST-segment abnormalities, as well as other alterations in the waveform (87). The benefit of image-guidance, therefore, should be weighed against the risk of anesthetizing a patient at risk of further cardiac injury during ischemic stress.</para>
          <para>There are efforts to improve ECG monitoring. Adaptive filters have been shown to be successful in removing noise induced by the imaging gradients, which are present only during scanning (89). ECG monitoring in the static magnetic field, however, is problematic even when images are not being acquired. A dominant QRS complex and undistorted S-T segment are important for both cardiac-gated MRI examinations and to permit physiological monitoring for cardiac ischemia, especially during cardiac interventions (90). The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect arises when blood, which is conductive, flows in the presence of a static magnetic field. The MHD effect generates a voltage that distorts the "real" electrocardiogram, especially with respect to the S-T segment when blood flow occurs from the left ventricle into the aorta (91). It is possible to remove the MHD artifact by processing ECG signals using a baseline ECG collected outside the bore of the MR system in conjunction with an adaptive filter (92).</para>
          <para>There are multiple efforts underway to develop an iMRI treatment for arrhythmias using RF ablation (93, 94) and cryoablation catheters (95). This procedure, and others, will benefit from enabling developments to overcome current limitations in cardiac monitoring.

      <title>Safety Issues for Interventional MR Systems</title>
      <para>Historically, CIEDs (e.g., cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillator, ICD) have been considered contraindications for MRI (96, 97). For more than 15 years, a variety of reports have supported the safety of scanning patients with "standard" cardiac pacemakers and ICDs. With appropriate screening and device programming, many investigations have demonstrated patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs can be scanned without significant clinical risks (98-113). Based upon the guidelines published in the peer-reviewed literature, institutions have developed programs for performing MR imaging in patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs. These programs are typically administered under combined leadership of both cardiology and radiology departments with participation from the vendors.</para>
      <para>Fortunately, five major vendors (LivaNova/Sorin, Boston Scientific, Abbott/St.Jude Medical, Medtronic, and Biotronic) now offer FDA or CE mark approved, MR Conditional CIEDs that include cardiac pacemakers, ICDs, and recorder devices. Patients implanted with these devices can safely undergo MRI at 1.5 Tesla and, with certain MR Conditional CIEDs, 3 Tesla scanning is also allowed (112).</para>

        <title>Remote Monitoring</title>
        <para>Acoustic noise from the gradient magnetic fields, especially at 3-Tesla, can prohibit the anesthesiologist from hearing the physiological monitor's alarms and ECG tones when more than a few feet from the equipment. Although developing technologies with active noise cancellation will allow transmission of monitoring equipment alarms and tones into the anesthesiologist's headphones, this technology is not widely available. As an alternative, remote monitoring is routinely performed at our institution.</para>
        <para>Primarily because of the acoustic noise associated with MRI, the anesthesiologist in the AMIGO Suite remotely monitors the patient after the onset of anesthesia and the patient is stable. Remote monitoring is accomplished with another physiological monitor placed in the control corridor that displays information for the patient's vital signs and end tidal gases; a view of the anesthesia machine's ventilator and its settings by either direct line-of-site or remote camera; and a camera view of the patient in the bore of the MR system. Line-of-site to the patient is limited when the patient is inside the scanner's bore, even when the anesthesiologist is at the bedside. If an intervention by the anesthesiologist is needed during imaging, the scan is halted until the issue is resolved. MR Conditional volume infusion pumps are available with remote consoles outside the room. Alternatively, conventional infusion pumps can be stationed outside the MR system room with an extension set of IV tubing penetrating the room via the waveguide. The disadvantage of this setup is that pump alarms are not audible when the care provider is at the bedside. Recently, a commercially available MR Conditional caddy has been developed to house ferrous pumps in the MR system room. This device has an alarm to indicate when the gauss limit is exceeded. The caddy's alarm indicator is more readily visible than the alarms on each pump, permitting visualization by MRI users outside the scanner room.</para>

      <title>SAFE USE OF MRI PULSE SEQUENCES FOR MRI</title>
      <para>The type of pulse sequence that is used during iMRI is generally more constrained than it is for diagnostic imaging. Real-time, interactive imaging can be employed, which demands high acquisition rates, while sacrificing some contrast and resolution. Special fast-imaging pulse sequences used in iMRI are more likely to make use of fast gradient switching and/or may employ RF pulsing rates that are substantially greater than those used in routine clinical MR imaging and, thus, are more likely to push the limits of safe use. Safety concerns related to pulse sequence choice are also heightened in iMRI because of the possibility of interaction with implants or interventional devices that are in place during the MRI procedure, resulting in a greater potential for dangerous levels of heating from RF fields or induction of currents from gradient magnetic field switching.</para>
      <para>The primary biological effects in MRI are tissue heating due to RF exposure, nerve stimulation due to currents induced by gradient switching and sensations such as vertigo caused by rapid movement in the static magnetic field (43, 113). Pulse sequences that tend to cause the greatest heating due to RF exposure are those with a high temporal density of RF pulsing, such as fast (or turbo) spin echo sequences, which employ multiple high-flip-angle refocusing pulses as well as steady-state sequences such as FIESTA (or True FISP), which have very short repetition times (114). These pulse sequence types are commonly used in iMRI and may be referred to as "high-SAR" pulse sequences. Pulse sequences that involve rapid gradient switching, such as echo planar imaging sequences, may induce currents that can cause peripheral nerve stimulation or interfere with implantable device operation, may be referred to as "high-dB/dt" sequences. Safety concerns in iMRI, as with standard MR imaging, involve the use of high-SAR and/or high-dB/dt pulse sequences. Artifacts such as signal loss and distortion caused by imaging in the presence of metallic objects such as biopsy needles can also be considered a safety issue because they diminish or confuse MR-guidance capabilities during interventional procedures. Gradient echo pulse sequences, especially multi-echo sequences such as echo planar imaging, are especially subject to exhibit artifacts caused by the susceptibility effects due to the presence of metallic objects in tissues (115, 116). High bandwidth spin echo sequences and special sequence adaptations may be employed to minimize such artifacts (114, 115).</para>
      <para>Regulatory bodies such as the FDA have placed limits on the allowable exposures for patients to RF energy and gradient magnetic fields. MR system manufacturers include monitoring software and hardware to ensure that these exposures are not exceeded when their MR scanners are running in routine operating modes. In the absence of metallic implants, devices, or foreign objects present during the scanning, MR systems that are set in routine operating modes (i.e., the Normal Operating Mode or First Level Controlled Operating Mode) should not be of concern for safety. Even when high-SAR or high-dB/dt sequences are used, limitations by the MR system on the setting of parameters such as the number of slices or the repetition time will ensure that exposures remain within the defined limits. It may be possible to supercede the limits as set by regulatory bodies, although Institutional Review Board approval and informed patient consent is required in such cases. As long as system SAR and dB/dt monitoring remains in place, the degree of exposure can be assessed and a decision whether or not to proceed based on risk versus benefit assessment can be</para>
      <para>made for the patient. Involving an MRI physicist to assess these risks is advisable in such cases.</para>
      <para>Of greater concern when using high-SAR or high-dB/dt sequences is when implants catheters, needles or other foreign objects are present during scanning because heating can be enhanced by the presence of the device, and it is much more difficult to predict the degree of the effects. Ideally, information is available from the manufacturer of the device in terms of specifying conditions of use. For example, perhaps a given device is limited with respect to the strength of the static magnetic field and the Normal Operating Mode must be used.</para>
      <para>Workflows can be developed that are designed to enable safe guidance. For example, non-metallic stylets are first placed with MRI-guidance prior to deploying a deep brain stimulating electrodes, which are at risk of MRI-induced heating. Post-operative CT can be performed instead of MRI to evaluate for complications such as hematoma.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>The need to use strong magnets, high spatial gradients, RF energy and cryogens for performing diagnostic MRI results in an inherent level of risk, and the possibility of accidents should not be underestimated. In the iMRI environment, the potential risk is exacerbated by the introduction of additional tools and devices required to perform the intervention. Moreover, the presence of individuals less experienced with the MRI environment could lead to additional risk. However, through the appropriate facility design, education and safety policies, risk can be managed such that it is outweighed by the benefit of performing the procedure in the MRI environment. Furthermore, a culture of teamwork and safety can be engrained in staff members by ongoing training, and policy enforcement and iterative improvement. Together, these approaches act in concert to ensure safety.</para>
      <para>Since the early 1990s when iMRI was first introduced, it has rapidly developed and the number of users and procedures have increased. iMRI expanded through the introduction of new surgical approaches and/or techniques in open surgery, vascular and cardiac applications, and minimally-invasive endoscopies. Efforts now focus on the development of new, more advanced imaging methods, navigational techniques, surgical instruments and devices, the more efficient use of computing technologies, and the integration of diagnostic and therapy devices with navigational tools to expand iMRI applications.</para>
      <para>Safety measures must keep pace with this increasingly complex environment as the number of installations also increases. Patient and staff member safety is the concern of a large multimodality and multidisciplinary infrastructure like that which exists in the BWH AMIGO Suite, where iMRI is complimented with newly developed, multiple molecular probes (e.g., nuclear, optical, mass spectrometer, etc.) that also must be used safely. A primary concern for the operation of the suite is how to provide a safe environment for clinical and research activity in iMRI that incorporates multimodal imaging. The workflows in the suite should be designed to suit the way that multidisciplinary teams work while understanding and mitigating safety risks.</para>
      <para>Most of the centers involved in iMRI report no serious adverse incidents. In our more than 25 years of experience with a 0.5-Tesla iMRI (23) and, more recently, with 3-Tesla, we</para>
      <para>also have a major incident-free operation. The occurrence of near misses and the ensuing safety reviews have demonstrated that ongoing review of safety policies and continuous training should be a hallmark of any safety program, similar to any other place within the medical environment. With appropriate control, a strong safety record can be maintained. The main reason for this successful and safe operation is continuous vigilance, policy enforcement, and a serious attitude towards safety.</para>
