      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>One of the most critical factors involved in protecting patients from magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI)-related injuries involves an understanding of the risks associated with the  presence of metallic implants and devices that may cause problems that include serious in- juries and fatalities (1-21). The standard of care for managing a patient referred for an MRI  examination with an implant or device is to positively identify the particular item and then  determine the relative safety of scanning the patient. This is best accomplished by referring  to the MRI-specific labeling for the implant or device, which is typically presented in the  <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis> (IFU). In instances when no labeling exists, the supervising physician  (which is typically a radiologist) is responsible for making a decision on whether to scan  the patient based on a careful consideration of the risks associated with the metallic object  and the benefit of the diagnostic information provided by the MRI examination (1, 4, 5,  12).</para>
      <para>This chapter discusses the various MRI-related issues that exist for implants and devices  (1-21). Notably, a comprehensive understanding of this essential information is particularly  vital when managing patients with unlabeled medical products (1, 4, 5, 12). This chapter  will also review information for commonly encountered implants, as well as medical devices  that may present challenges with respect to MRI-related labeling.</para>

      <title>MRI-RELATED ISSUES FOR IMPLANTS AND DEVICES</title>
      <para>It is well known that MRI may be a contraindication for a patient with a metallic implant  because of various factors that can result in serious injury or death (1-16). These include  movement or dislodgment of a ferromagnetic implant or device, excessive MRI-related  heating associated with the time-varying, gradient magnetic fields (i.e., for certain implants)  and/or the RF field, induction of currents resulting in unintentional stimulation or other is- sues, changes in the operational aspects of the device, damage to the function of the device,  the difficulty in interpreting MR images due to signal loss and/or distortion, and the misin- terpretation of an imaging artifact as an abnormality (1-19).</para>
      <para>Implants and devices are typically categorized into two types: passive and active. A  passive implant, such as a vascular clip or heart valve prosthesis, is one that serves its func- tion without any source of power other than that generated by the gravity or the human  body, while an active implant (often referred to as an active implantable medical device or  AIMD), such as a cardiac pacemaker or neuromodulation system, is a medical device that  relies on its function from a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than  that directly generated by gravity or the human body (1, 9, 21, 22). Because of their com- plexity, AIMDs inherently pose a greater number MRI-related issues for patients compared  to passive implants. The possible MRI-related risks for passive and active implants are sum- marized in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Magnetic Field Interactions </emphasis></para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Translational Attraction and Torque</emphasis>. With regard to magnetic field interactions and  MRI, translational attraction and/or torque may cause movement or dislodgment of a fer- romagnetic implant, resulting in an uncomfortable sensation for the patient, an injury, or  even a fatality (1-4, 20, 21, 23-58). Therefore, both translational attraction and torque are  important to evaluate for implants and devices before patients with metallic objects are al- lowed to undergo MRI (1, 20-58).</para>
      <para>The effect of translational attraction acting on an implanted ferromagnetic object is pre- dominantly responsible for a hazard that may occur in the immediate area of the MR system  (1, 3, 8, 10, 12). That is, as one moves closer to the scanner or as the patient is moved into  the bore for the MRI examination. The predominant effect of torque (or rotational alignment  to the magnetic field) as it acts on a ferromagnetic object occurs in the center of the MR  system, where the magnetic field is most homogenous (1, 3, 8, 10, 12). Notably, torque,  which is proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field, will greatly influence im- plants and devices that have an elongated shape. Obviously, both translational attraction  and torque combine to impact a ferromagnetic implant or device as the patient with the ob- ject moves towards the MR system and then into the center of the bore of the scanner (1, 3,  8, 10, 12).</para>
      <para>Various factors influence the risk of performing MRI in a patient with a ferromagnetic  object including the strength of the static magnetic field, the level of the spatial gradient  magnetic field (discussed below), the magnetic susceptibility of the object, the mass of the  object, the geometry of the object, the location and orientation of the object <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>, the pres- ence of retentive or anchoring mechanisms (i.e., fibrotic tissue, sutures, etc.), and the length  of time the object has been implanted. These factors should be carefully considered before  subjecting a patient with a metallic implant or other object to an MRI examination. This is  particularly important if the object is located in a potentially dangerous area of the body  such as a vital neural, vascular, of soft tissue structure where movement or dislodgment  could injure the patient.</para>
      <para>With respect to the potential risks associated with a ferromagnetic implant, in addition  to the findings for translational attraction and torque, the “intended i<emphasis role="italics">n vivo</emphasis> use” of the im- plant or device must be considered as well as the mechanisms that may provide retention  of the object once it is implanted, as discussed above (e.g., implants or devices held in place  by sutures, granulation or ingrowth of tissue, fixation devices, or by other means). Accord- ingly, sufficient counterforces may exist to retain even a ferromagnetic implant in place, <emphasis role="italics">in </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">situ</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>Numerous studies have assessed magnetic field interactions for implants and other items  by measuring translational attraction and torque associated with static magnetic fields of  MR systems operating as high as 8-Tesla (1, 23-58). These investigations generally demon- strated that MRI can be performed safely in patients with metallic objects that are nonfer- romagnetic or “weakly” ferromagnetic (i.e., only minimally attracted by the magnetic field),  such that the magnetic field interactions are insufficient to move or dislodge them, <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">464</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">MRI-Related Issues for Implants and Devices</emphasis></para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 435-748_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:30 PM  Page 464</para>
      <para>Additionally, patients with certain implants or devices that have relatively strong fer- romagnetic qualities may be safely scanned using MRI because the objects are held in place  by retentive forces that prevent them from being moved or dislodged with reference to the  “intended <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> use” of the object. For example, there is an interference screw (i.e., the  Perfix Interference Screw) used for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament that is  highly ferromagnetic. However, once this implant is placed in the patient (i.e., screwed into  the patient’s bone), this prevents it from being moved, even if the patient is exposed to a  high-field MR system. Other medical implants that exhibit substantial ferromagnetic qual- ities may likewise be safe for patients undergoing MRI as a result of the presence of coun- terforces that prevent displacement of these objects. Of note is that there are medical  implants that actually incorporate magnets as their functional components, such as pro- grammable cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) shunt valves, cochlear implants, and certain ortho- pedic implants (e.g., the MAGEC System, Nuvasive, www.nuvasive.com). These particular  implants are safe for patients undergoing MRI as long as highly specific safety guidelines  are followed.</para>
      <para>In general, medical implants should undergo testing using <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> techniques to assess  translational attraction and torque before allowing a patient with the object to undergo an  MRI exam (1, 20-22). By following this guideline, the magnetic-aspects of an object may  be determined so that a competent decision can be made concerning possible risks associated  with subjecting the patient to MRI. Because movement or dislodgment of an implanted  metallic object is one of the main mechanisms responsible for an injury, this part of implant  testing is considered to be of utmost importance and should involve the use of an MR system  operating at an appropriate static magnetic field strength. That is, if the intent is to scan the  patient with the implant at 3-Tesla, the implant must be tested for magnetic field interactions  at that field strength.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Lenz Effect-Related Forces</emphasis>. Forces related to the Lenz Effect are of potential concern  in the MRI environment. In 1835, Heinrich Lenz stated the law that an electric current in- duced by a changing magnetic field will flow such that it will create its own magnetic field  that opposes the magnetic field that created it. These opposing fields, which occupy the  same space at the same time, result in a pair of forces. The more current that is generated,  the greater the force that opposes it. The so-called “Lenz Effect” occurs with electrically  conductive materials (i.e. not just ferromagnetic materials) that develop eddy currents in  the presence of high-field-strength static magnetic fields, such as those associated with MR  systems.</para>
      <para>Force associated with the Lenz Effect may restrict movement of large metallic objects  (e.g., an aluminum oxygen tank) or potentially compromise the function of certain implants  in the MRI setting, such as those with moving metallic parts. Interestingly, this force has  been suggested to be of concern for prosthetic heart valves that have leaflets or discs, espe- cially if the cardiac implant is used for mitral valve replacement, where the range of pres- sures are relatively low (higher pressures are more likely to overcome a substantial Lenz  Effect).</para>
      <para>Condon and Hadley (59) first reported the theoretical possibility of Lenz Effect-related  actions for heart valve prostheses that contain metallic disks or leaflets. In theory, “resistive</para>

      <para>pressure” may develop with the potential to inhibit both the opening and closing mechanism  of a mechanical heart valve prosthesis that has leaflets or disks. In 2012, Golestanirad, et  al. (60) conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Lenz Effect due to motion of artificial  heart valves during MRI. They concluded that mechanical heart valves with strengthening  rings may be considered safe even under ultra-high-field MRI conditions with field inten- sities as high as 10 Tesla. Edwards, et al. (61) performed an <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> study of the occurrence  of Lenz Effect-related forces on various heart valve prostheses at 1.5-Tesla and assessed  the risk of the impedance of valve function. The findings provided evidence of the Lenz  Effect on certain cardiac valve prostheses exposed to the static magnetic field, which re- sulted in functional valve impedance and a potentially increased risk of valve regurgitation.  While further evaluation of this phenomenon may be warranted, to date, the Lenz Effect  has not been observed in association with clinical MRI examinations nor has it posed addi- tional risks for patients with certain heart valve prostheses (i.e. those with metallic leaflets  or disks) or any other implant for that matter.</para>
      <para>One important scenario of Lenz Effect-related forces involves patients with relatively  large metallic implants, like implantable infusion pumps or external fixation systems. De- spite the lack of movement or displacement hazards for these implants, rapid motion of the  patient (e.g., as the patient enters the scanner’s bore) with a large metallic implant that is  oriented perpendicular to direction of the static magnetic field of the scanner can result in  forces on the implant opposing the motion that may be detected by the patient. In the event  that the patient complains of experiencing forces, such as tugging or pulling on the implant,  this might lead to the patient or MRI personnel erroneously concluding that the device has  ferromagnetic components, and possibly cancelling the MRI examination (1, 4). Slowly  moving a patient with a large metallic implant into and out of the bore of the MR system is  essential to mitigate Lenz Effect-related forces that might be induced, decreasing the like- lihood of a misunderstanding or unnecessary exam cancellation (1, 4).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Magnetic Field Interactions and Operational Disturbances</emphasis>. In certain cases, there is a  possibility of changing the operation or function of a medical implant or device as a result  of exposure to the powerful static magnetic field of the MR system. For an implant that has  a component that is magnetic (e.g., cochlear implants, programmable CSF shunt valves,  magnetic reflux management device, etc.), it is possible to disrupt the function of the device  or to demagnetize the magnet, rendering it unacceptable for its intended use (1, 2). There- fore, this important aspect must be evaluated using comprehensive <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> testing techniques  to verify that specific MRI conditions will not alter the device’s function (20-22)</para>
      <para>MR systems with very low (0.064-Tesla or less) or very high (10.5-Tesla) static mag- netic fields are currently used for clinical and research applications. Considering that most  metallic objects evaluated for magnetic field interactions were assessed at 1.5- or 3-Tesla,  an appropriate variance or modification of the information provided regarding the safety of  performing an MRI procedure in a patient with a metallic object may exist when a scanner  with a lower or higher static magnetic field strength was used for testing and labeling. There- fore, it is deemed acceptable to adjust safety recommendations depending on the static mag- netic field strength and other considerations of a given scanner. Obviously, performing an  MRI procedure using a 0.064-Tesla MR system has different risk implications for a patient  with a ferromagnetic implant compared with using a 10.5-Tesla scanner.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI-Related Heating </emphasis></para>
      <para>Temperature increases produced in association with MRI have been studied using <emphasis role="italics">ex </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">vivo</emphasis> techniques to evaluate various metallic implants, devices, and objects that have a variety  of sizes, shapes, and metallic compositions or that are made from other conducting materials  (1, 2, 38-82). In general, reports have indicated that only minor temperature changes occur  in association with MRI and relatively short or compact metallic objects that are passive  implants, including items such as aneurysm clips, hemostatic clips, prosthetic heart valves,  vascular access ports, and similar devices. Therefore, heat generated during MRI involving  a patient with a relatively small, passive implant does not appear to be a substantial hazard.  Notably, to date, there has been no report of a patient being seriously injured as a result of  excessive heating of a small passive implant or device.</para>
      <para>However, MRI-related heating is potentially problematic for implants that have an elon- gated shape or those that form a conducting loop of a particular diameter (1, 2, 4, 6-12, 15,  20-22, 62-75). For example, substantial heating resulting in injuries to patients can occur  under certain MRI conditions for elongated implants (e.g., leads, wires, etc.) that form res- onant antennas or that form resonant conducting loops (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Radiofrequency Field-Related Heating</emphasis>. Radiofrequency (RF) fields associated with  MRI can induce electric current in conductors that causes tissue heating primarily due to  resistive losses (1, 2, 4, 6, 8-12). Metallic implants and devices have high conductivity and  low resistance to electric currents, which results in a minimal amount of implant heating.  However, tissues surrounding a metallic implant can heat due to its relatively high electrical  resistance (1, 2, 4, 6, 8-12). The evaluation of an implant or device for heating is particularly  challenging because of the many factors that effect temperature increases in these items.</para>

      <para>Variables that impact RF field-related heating include: the specific type of implant or device;  the electrical characteristics of the materials used for the implant or device; the transmitted  RF wavelength of the MR system (e.g., at 1.5-Tesla, 64-MHz; at 3-Tesla, 128-MHz); the  type of transmit RF coil that is used (i.e., transmit body RF coil, transmit head RF coil,  etc.); the amount of RF energy delivered (i.e., based on the specific absorption rate, SAR  or other RF energy-related metric); the technique used to calculate or estimate the SAR that  is utilized by the MR system; the landmark position or body part undergoing MRI relative  to the transmit RF coil; and the orientation or configuration of the implant or device relative  to the source of RF energy (i.e., the transmit RF coil) (1, 2, 4, 6-12, 15, 20-22, 62-75).</para>
      <para>One consideration of RF field-related heating of an implant that may not be intuitive is  that for a given item, heating can be substantially different depending on the frequency of  RF that is applied. For example, evidence from an <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> study conducted by Shellock, et  al. (83) reported that significantly <emphasis role="italics">less</emphasis> MRI-related heating occurred at 3-Tesla/128-MHz  (whole-body-averaged SAR, 3-W/kg) versus 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz (whole-body-averaged  SAR, 1.4-W/kg) for a pacemaker lead that was not connected to a pulse generator (same  lead length, positioning in the phantom, etc.). This phenomenon whereby less heating was  observed at 128-MHz versus 64-MHz has also been observed for external fixation devices,  Foley catheters with temperature sensors, neuromodulation systems, relatively long periph- eral vascular stents, and other implants. Therefore, it is vital to perform <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> testing to  properly characterize MRI-related heating to identify potentially hazardous medical im- plants.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Gradient Magnetic Field-Induced Heating</emphasis>. Exposure to gradient magnetic fields uti- lized during MRI can induce eddy currents on the conductive surface of a metallic implant  that is located inside the bore of the MR system (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78). Thus, this is a po- tential safety concern for patients that have certain metallic implants. The impact of the gra- dient magnetic fields is primarily determined by the surface area and thickness of the  conductor (i.e., with specific respect to the dimensional aspects of the implant), the electrical  conductivity of the metal, the rate of change of the gradient magnetic fields, and the relative  orientation of implant to the gradient magnetic fields (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78).</para>
      <para>Because of the typical small planar surface area that exists for most passive implants,  gradient magnetic field-induced heating is generally not expected to pose a hazard with re- spect to tissue damage for passive medical devices (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78).  This is also  the case for active implants that may have a relatively small surface area (e.g., leads asso- ciated with cardiac pacemakers and neuromodulation systems). However, gradient magnetic  field-induced heating can be substantial for patients with certain sizable passive implants  such as large cranial plates, acetabular cups used with total hip replacement prostheses, and  implantable infusion pumps (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78). Accordingly, these situations pose a  possible safety issue. Importantly, to date (i.e., 35+ years), there has been no report of an  injury to a patient that has been attributed to gradient magnetic field-induced heating of a  medical implant.</para>

      <para>modulation systems, and other similar items has been previously reported (1, 2, 79-82). No- tably, the performance of <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> testing of implants and devices to assess induced currents  is predominantly focused on AIMDs since induced currents have not been described for  passive implants (1, 2, 9, 20-22). In general, AIMDs developed to be safe for patients un- dergoing MRI incorporate special design features to suppress or prevent induced currents  from presenting problems (9).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Artifacts </emphasis></para>
      <para>The type and extent of artifacts caused by the presence of metallic implants and devices  have been described and tend to be easily recognized on MR images (1, 2, 4, 17-19). Signal  loss and/or image distortion associated with metallic objects are predominantly caused by  a disruption of the local magnetic field that perturbs the relationship between position and  frequency. In some cases, there may be areas of high signal intensity seen along the edge  of a signal void or when there is an abrupt change in the shape of the item (e.g., the tip of  a biopsy needle). Additionally, artifacts seen on MR images may be caused by gradient  switching due to the generation of eddy currents.</para>
      <para>The extent of the artifact on an MR image is dependent on the implant’s magnetic sus- ceptibility, size, shape, position in the patient’s body, the technique used for imaging (i.e.,  the specific pulse sequence parameters), and the image processing method. Careful selection  of pulse sequence parameters decreases the size of artifacts and this is done routinely, es- pecially for patients that undergo MRI with implants that are particularly large, such as total  hip or total knee prostheses. Additionally, software-based techniques, such as the metal ar- tifact reduction sequence (MARS), have been described that substantially reduce artifacts  associated with metallic objects. <emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis> presents techniques that may be used to reduce  artifacts associated with metallic implants.</para>

      <para>With the growing use of MRI in the 1990s, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  recognized the need for standardized tests to address MRI safety issues for implants and  other medical devices. Thus, over the years, test methods have been developed by various</para>

      <para>organizations including the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Interna- tional, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with an ongoing com- mitment to ensure patient safety in the MRI environment (20-22, 84-88).</para>
      <para>The FDA is responsible for reviewing the test information submitted to them by the  implant or device manufacturer, the MRI terminology, and the labeling assigned to the prod- uct. This terminology has evolved to keep pace with advances in MRI technology. Unfor- tunately, members of the MRI community frequently may not understand the terms that are  used and are often confused by the conditions that are specified in “MR Conditional” la- beling. This lack of understanding may result in patients with implants being exposed to  potentially hazardous MRI conditions or in inappropriately preventing them from under- going needed examinations. Importantly, the current labeling terminology that exists is as- sociated with expanded labeling information that relates to the conditions that are deemed  acceptable to ensure patient safety (21).</para>
      <para>Prior to implementing the current terminology, the terms “MR Safe” and “MR Com- patible” were used for labeling purposes (89, 90). In time, it became apparent that these  terms were somewhat confusing and often used interchangeably or incorrectly. In particular,  these terms were frequently used without including the conditions for which the device had  been demonstrated to be safe. Therefore, in an effort to develop more appropriate terminol- ogy and, more importantly, because the misuse of the terms could result in serious risks for  patients and others in the MRI environment, a new set of MRI labeling terms was developed  and released in 2005 (91). Thus, this terminology, which is currently recognized by the FDA  (as well as notified or regulatory bodies outside the United States) and applied to implants  and devices is, as follows (21): (a) <emphasis role="italics">MR Safe</emphasis> - a medical device that poses no known hazards  resulting from exposure to any MR environment. MR Safe medical devices are composed  of materials that are electrically nonconductive, nonmetallic, and nonmagnetic. Using this  terminology, MR Safe items are non-conducting, non-metallic, and non-magnetic items  such as a catheter made from silicone. (b) <emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional </emphasis>- a medical device with demon- strated safety in the MR environment within defined conditions including conditions for  the static magnetic field, the time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and the radiofrequency  fields. Conditions that define the MRI environment may include the strength of the static  magnetic field value, the spatial gradient magnetic field value, the time-varying magnetic  field value, the RF field value, and the specific absorption rate (SAR) level. Additional con- ditions, including the specific configuration for the item (e.g., the routing of leads used for  a neurostimulation system) may be required. Other possible safety issues that may be part  of the MR Conditional labeling include but are not limited to thermal injury, induced cur- rents, electromagnetic interference, unintended stimulation, and unwanted interactions  among other devices. (c) <emphasis role="italics">MR Unsafe</emphasis> – a medical device which poses unacceptable risks to  the patient, medical staff, or other persons within the MR environment.

Therefore, this important point must be un- derstood to avoid undue confusion regarding the matter of the labeling that has been applied  to previously tested implants (i.e., those labeled as MR Safe or MR Compatible) versus  those that have recently undergone MRI testing and now labeled MR Safe, MR Conditional,  or MR Unsafe (89-91). Notably, the specific content of the MRI labeling for an implant or  device may take various forms (especially for AIMDs) because the format continues to be  refined by the FDA in an ongoing effort to properly communicate this information to MRI  healthcare professionals (21).</para>

Thus, indicated as dB/dx or, in this case, as 720-gauss/cm.

      <title>MRI INFORMATION FOR IMPLANTS AND DEVICES</title>
      <para>New implants and devices are developed on an ongoing basis, which necessitates con- tinuous endeavors to obtain current documentation for these medical products prior to sub- jecting patients to MRI examinations. In certain instances, the MRI labeling may change  for an implant as a result of new testing that was conducted or a due to a change in materials.  Importantly, the labeling that ensures the safe use of MRI is highly specific to the conditions  that were utilized to assess the implant or device and any deviation from the defined pro- cedures can lead to deleterious events, severe patient injuries, or fatalities, especially when  AIMDs are present (1, 2, 4, 6-10, 79-82).

      <para>The surgical management of intracranial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations  (AVMs) by the application of an aneurysm clip is a well-established procedure. The presence  of an aneurysm clip in a patient referred for an MRI exam represents a situation that requires  the utmost consideration because of the associated risks (1, 2, 4, 6, 27-33)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>).

By comparison, aneurysm clips classified as “nonferromagnetic” or “weakly ferromagnetic”  are acceptable for patients undergoing MRI. (For the sake of discussion, the term “weakly  ferromagnetic” refers to metal that demonstrates extremely low ferromagnetic qualities  using highly sensitive instrumentation such as vibrating sample magnetometer or supercon- ducting quantum interference and, thus, may not be technically referred to as being “non- ferromagnetic.” All metals possess some degree of magnetism, such that no metal is entirely  nonferromagnetic.)</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Breast Tissue Expanders </emphasis></para>
      <para>Adjustable breast tissue expanders are utilized for breast reconstruction following mas- tectomy, for the correction of breast and chest-wall deformities as well as underdevelopment,  for tissue defect procedures, and for cosmetic augmentation. These devices are typically  equipped with either an integrated injection port that is utilized to accept a needle for place- ment of saline for expansion of the prosthesis intra-operatively and/or postoperatively (47,  55, 58, 92-97).</para>
      <para>Breast tissue expanders commonly incorporate magnetic ports to allow for accurate de- tection of the injection site. These implants are substantially attracted to the static magnetic  fields of MR systems and, therefore, may be uncomfortable, injurious, or contraindicated  for patients undergoing MRI (47, 55, 58, 92-97). In general, because the magnetic infusion  ports incorporated into most breast tissue expanders presumably interact adversely with the  electromagnetic fields used for MRI, all such implants are labeled MR Unsafe. Therefore,  the consensus practice is to use other imaging techniques when diagnostic exams, such as  ultrasound or computed tomography, are needed for patient management (92-95). Another  issue over and above safety is that breast tissue expanders with magnetic ports produce ex- tremely large artifacts on MR images and, therefore, assessment of the breast using MRI is  problematic (92-95). Of additional importance is that here may be a situation during which  a patient is referred for MRI for the determination of breast cancer or an implant rupture,  such that the presence of the excessive metallic artifact could obscure the precise location  or nature of the abnormality.</para>
      <para>Over the years, there has been considerable controversy regarding the safety scanning  patients with breast tissue expanders with magnetic ports (47, 55, 58, 92-97). During a pe- riod of more than three decades, only two cases reported problems associated with tissue  expanders for patients that underwent MRI (96, 97), while a study conducted in a large  series of patients where special precautions were taken to mitigate risks revealed no sub- stantial issues (95).</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italics">Performing MRI in Patients with Tissue Expanders with Magnetic Ports</emphasis>. For certain  indications that include neurological, musculoskeletal, or cardiovascular diagnoses, MRI  is the superior diagnostic imaging modality. Considering the preponderance of evidence  that exists for tissue expanders with magnetic ports, Dibbs, et al. (55) recommended that it  was time to reconsider whether these implants should truly be considered “MR Unsafe”  and, thus, a strict contraindication for an admittedly vital diagnostic imaging procedure.</para>
      <para>As part of the practice of medicine, MRI-trained radiologists may elect to override the  labeling for implants, even if they are labeled MR Unsafe, by conducting a careful risk ver- sus benefit analysis for individual cases. Therefore, in the event that a patient with a breast  tissue expander with a magnetic port needs to undergo MRI for proper clinical management,  the following procedural guidelines were proposed taking into consideration the clinical  experience reported by Thimmappa, et al. (95) as well as additional, suitable precautions to  prevent possible risks (55, 92, 93):</para>
      <para>(1) The supervising physician (i.e., usually the MRI-trained radiologist) must perform an as- sessment of the risks associated with the implant versus the benefit of the MRI exam. The  theoretical risks or other possible problems include movement of the magnetic port com- ponent of the implant, potential MRI-related heating, possible polarity reversal of the  magnet, and artifacts in the immediate area of the port (55). Notably, there is considerable  evidence that MRI-related heating is a non-issue for breast implants with magnetic ports  (55, 92, 93, 98), including a comprehensive study conducted by scientists from the FDA  (94). Polarity reversal of the magnet rarely occurs and artifacts may be decreased by care- ful selection of pulse sequence parameters.</para>
      <para>(2) A physician must provide written and verbal informed consent to the patient, explaining  the aforementioned possible problems.</para>
      <para>(3) The MRI exam should be performed using a scanner that does not exceed a static mag- netic field strength of 1.5-Tesla.</para>
      <para>(4) The tissue expander with magnetic port should be stabilized by securely wrapping the  area with an elastic compression wrap or by other suitable means (e.g., 6” Ace Bandage,  elastic chest/rib belt, etc.).</para>
      <para>(5) If practical, the patient should be placed in a prone position to minimize or prevent move- ment of the magnetic port of the tissue expander.</para>
      <para>(6) The patient should be continuously monitored visually and verbally throughout MRI. If  the patient reports any unusual sensation, immediately discontinue the MRI exam.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Breast Tissue Expander with an RFID Port</emphasis>. A new breast tissue expander was recently  developed with a port that incorporates a radiofrequency identification device (RFID) that  is used for needle localization for implant expansion. Bayasgalan, et al. (58) described the  MRI testing conducted on this implant that resulted in it being designated MR Conditional  at 1.5- and 3-Tesla. The relatively small artifact size associated with this tissue expander,  which predominantly comes from the RFID, offers potential advantages for patients under- going MRI compared to tissue expanders that have magnetic ports that create substantial  signal losses and distortions on MR images (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>).</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Coronary Artery Stents </emphasis></para>
      <para>MRI testing has been performed on the majority of the commercially available bare  metal and drug eluting coronary artery stents. These tests included assessments of magnetic  field interactions, heating, and the characterization of artifacts. The findings resulted in MRI  labeling that indicates that patients may undergo MRI exams at 1.5- or 3-Tesla immediately  after implantation of the coronary artery stents.</para>
      <para>The standard policy that MRI labeling information is required to be reviewed before  allowing scans in patients with coronary artery stents limits access to this essential diag- nostic modality when labeling is unavailable. It should be noted that there has never been  an adverse event reported in association with performing MRI in a patient with a coronary  artery stent. Therefore, in consideration of the relevant peer-reviewed literature and other  related documents (1, 2, 98-105), guidelines were developed indicating that it is acceptable  to perform MRI exams in patients with all commercially available coronary artery stents,  including patients with multiple coronary stents, by following specific guidelines. These  guidelines were created by taking into consideration possible safety concerns, that is, mag- netic field interactions and MRI-related heating for these implants. By following these ad- mittedly conservative MRI conditions, every patient with a coronary artery stent can benefit  from the diagnostic imaging information afforded by MRI (<emphasis role="bold">Table 4</emphasis>). Notably, the previous  belief that it may be necessary to wait six weeks or longer after implantation of certain coro- nary artery stents to allow for endothelialization or other mechanism to prevent migration  has been refuted because there are no coronary artery stents made from ferromagnetic ma- terials (82, 98-105).</para>

      <para>The following guidelines apply to using MRI in patients with coronary artery stents (including patients with  two or more stents or two or more overlapping stents):   (1) Patients with all commercially available coronary artery stents (including drug-eluting and non-drug eluting  or bare metal versions) can be scanned at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz or 3-T/128-MHz, regardless of the value of  the spatial gradient magnetic field.  (2) Patients with all commercially available coronary artery stents can undergo MRI immediately after place- ment of these implants.   (3) The MRI examination must be performed using the following parameters:  • 1.5-Tesla or 3-Tesla, only  • Whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 2-W/kg (i.e., operating in the Normal Op- erating Mode for the MR system)  • Maximum imaging time, 15 minutes per pulse sequence (multiple pulse sequences per patient are  allowed)  Important Notes:   •  This information does not apply to other stents such as peripheral vascular stents, abdominal aortic  aneurysm (AAA) stent grafts, biliary stents, ureteral stents, or stents used for other applications (e.g., tra- cheobronchial stents, esophageal stents, etc.).  •  Any deviation from the above MRI conditions requires prior approval by the Radiologist or supervising  physician.  •  These guidelines must be reviewed on an annual basis to confirm that no new coronary artery stent has be- come available that substantially deviates from the above MRI conditions or that is labeled, MR Unsafe.  •  These guidelines should only be implemented for use after careful review by the supervising radiologist  or other physician responsible for the MRI facility and with the adoption of the information as a written  policy.</para>

      <para>A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is used to monitor blood glucose on a continual  basis in individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes. A CGM uses a small needle-based sen- sor that is inserted subcutaneously and attached via an adhesive disc to the arm or abdomen  (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). The CGM’s sensor measures the individual’s blood glucose level and can wire- lessly transmit the information to a smart phone or other hand-held device. Because CGMs  permit individuals to avoid needle sticks to determine their blood glucose level, these de- vices are extremely popular among diabetics.</para>
      <para>The most popular CGMs include the Dexcom G4 and Dexcom G6 (Dexcom, www.dex- com.com), the FreeStyle Libre products (Abbott, www.abbott.com), and the Guardian Con- nect (Medtronic, Inc., www.medtronic.com). Each of these CGMs is labeled MR Unsafe,  requiring removal from the patient prior to permitting the individual to undergo an MRI  exam.</para>

This CGM  has an implanted sensor and an external transmitter, which makes its design entirely different  from the other CGMs. The MR Conditional labeling states that the external transmitter must  be removed from the patient prior to MRI. MRI may be performed in patients at 1.5- or 3- Tesla, using a maximum spatial field gradient magnetic field of 2,000 gauss/cm, and a max- imum MR system reported, whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 4-W/kg  (First Level Controlled Operating Mode) for 15 minutes of scanning per pulse sequence.</para>

      <para>In the clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) setting, it is often necessary to man- age patients with heart valve prostheses [including transcatheter aortic valve replacements  (TAVR), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) devices, percutaneous aortic valve  replacement (PAVR) implants, transcatheter heart valves (THV), as well as other similar  heart valve implants used in association with minimally invasive procedures] and annulo- plasty rings (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>). A large variety of heart valve prostheses and annuloplasty rings  have been evaluated for MRI-related issues, especially with regard to the presence of mag- netic field interactions and heating associated with exposure to clinical MR systems oper- ating at field strengths of as high as 7-Tesla. Of these, certain ones exhibited measurable  yet relatively minor magnetic field interactions. Because the actual attractive forces exerted  on heart valve prostheses and annuloplasty rings are minimal compared to the force exerted  by the beating heart (i.e., approximately 7.2-N), MRI will not pose a risk to patients with  these implants.  Furthermore, MRI-related heating has been reported to be relatively minor  for all heart valve prostheses and annuloplasty rings that have undergone testing (1, 2, 82,  90, 103, 106-116).</para>

      <para>IUDs made from stainless steel may pose a hazard to a patient undergoing MRI de- pending on the type stainless steel that was used. Stainless steels used for implants, including  IUDs, may be either austenitic, which is a nonferromagnetic form, or martensitic which is  a ferromagnetic type of stainless steel. At least four different IUDs commonly used in Asia,  especially China, are made from stainless steel. Of these, the only one tested to date which  displayed high magnetic field interactions was the Chinese Ring (123). The other stainless  steel IUDs (the Chinese Double Ring, the Ota Ring, and the Chongqing Uterine-Shaped  IUD) have not undergone testing for magnetic field interactions or heating and, thus, should  be considered unsafe for patients until information can be obtained to demonstrate that they  are MR Conditional.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Magnetically-Activated Orthopedic Implants </emphasis></para>
      <para>Within the domain of orthopedic implants, certain products have magnetically-activated  components that permit noninvasive adjustments of their lengths. For example, the Precice  and Precice Stryde Systems (Nuvasive, www.nuvasive.com) are adjustable intramedullary  rods that can be used for limb lengthening procedures involving the tibia or femur. These  devices are lengthened using an external programmer, which eliminates the need for an ex- ternal fixation system. The Precice System and Precice Stryde System are labeled MR Un- safe.</para>
      <para>Another example of a magnetically-activated orthopedic implant is the MAGEC System  (Nuvasive, www.nuvasive.com) which utilizes innovative magnetic technology that is in- corporated within adjustable growing rods that are modulated by an external controller (<emphasis role="bold">Fig-</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">ure 7</emphasis>). The MAGEC system is designed to avoid multiple distraction surgeries for the  treatment of early-onset scoliosis. As a result, the MAGEC System helps reduce associated  complication risks from repetitive surgeries and simplifies the management of patients with  early onset scoliosis.</para>

      <para>• In non-clinical testing, the image artifact caused by the MAGEC system extends beyond  the imaging field of view when imaged with a gradient-echo pulse sequence in a 1.5-T  MR system.

      <para>Notably, the MAGEC System represents an example of an implant with low SAR re- quirements insofar as the whole-body averaged SAR is limited to 0.5-W/kg. Adjusting pulse  sequence parameters to achieve decreased SAR levels requires essential knowledge regard- ing which parameters may be suitably adjusted, while maintaining acceptable image quality.  For example, increasing the repetition time, decreasing the echo train length, or reducing  the phase encoding to lower the SAR can substantially impact image quality, as shown in  <emphasis role="bold">Table 6</emphasis>.

      <para>Various penile implants have been evaluated for MRI-related issues (1, 2, 125, 126)  (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>). Of these, two (i.e., the Duraphase and Omniphase models) demonstrated sub- stantial ferromagnetic qualities when exposed to a 1.5- and 3-Tesla MR systems (1, 2, 125,  126). Fortunately, it is unlikely for a penile implant to cause an injury in a patient undergoing  MRI because of magnetic field interactions. This is because of the manner in which such a  device is utilized. With regard to scanning a patient with a penile implant made from ferro- magnetic material, to avoid discomfort it is advisable to stabilized the implant by a suitable  means such as an elastic bandage and to consider scanning the patient in a prone position.  Findings for other penile implants reported that they either exhibited no translational at- traction and torque, or relatively minor magnetic field interactions. To date, MRI-related  heating has not been demonstrated to be substantial for any penile implant that has under- gone testing.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Vascular Access Ports </emphasis></para>
      <para>Vascular access ports are implants commonly used to provide long-term vascular ad- ministration of chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, analgesics, and other medications. A  vascular access port is usually implanted in a subcutaneous pocket under the upper chest  wall (i.e., subclavicular area) with the catheters inserted in the jugular, subclavian, or  cephalic vein (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). These implants have a variety of similar features that include a  reservoir, central septum, and catheters and may be constructed from different materials in- cluding stainless steel, titanium, silicone, and plastic. Because of the widespread use of vas- cular access ports and the high probability that patients with these devices may require MRI  examinations, it has been important to characterize the MRI-related issues for these implants  (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129),</para>

      <para>Thus, over the years, MRI testing has been performed on the many commercially avail- able vascular access ports (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129). These tests included evaluations of mag- netic field interactions, heating, and the characterization of artifacts. The findings resulted  in MRI labeling that indicates that patients may undergo MRI exams at 1.5- or 3-Tesla im- mediately after implantation of the vascular access ports (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129).</para>
      <para>Similar to the information presented for coronary artery stents, heart valve prostheses,  and annuloplasty rings, the standard policy that MRI labeling information is required to be  reviewed before allowing scans in patients with vascular access ports limits access to this  essential diagnostic modality when labeling is unavailable. It should be noted that there has  never been an adverse event reported in association with performing MRI in a patient with  a vascular access port. Therefore, in consideration of the relevant peer-reviewed literature  and other related documents (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129), guidelines were developed indicating  that it is acceptable to perform MRI exams in patients with all commercially available vas- cular access ports. These guidelines were created by taking into consideration possible safety  concerns, that is, magnetic field interactions and MRI-related heating for these implants.  By following these admittedly conservative MRI conditions, every patient with a vascular  access port can benefit from the diagnostic imaging information afforded by MRI (<emphasis role="bold">Table </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">7</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>With respect to MRI and artifacts, vascular access ports that will produce the least  amount of artifact are made entirely from nonmetallic materials such as plastic, silicon,  Delrin polyethylene, or polyether ether ketone (commonly known as PEEK). The ones that  produce the largest artifacts are composed of metals or have metallic components in an un- usual shape (e.g., the OmegaPort Access Port). Even vascular access ports made entirely  from nonmetallic materials are, in fact, seen on MR images because they contain silicone  (i.e., the septum portion of the port). Using MRI, the Larmor precessional frequency of fat  is close to that of silicone (i.e., 100-Hz at 1.5-Tesla). Therefore, silicone used in the con- struction of a vascular access port may be observed on MR images with varying degrees of  signal intensity depending on the pulse sequence that is used.</para>

      <para>The highest field strength MR system approved for clinical use is the 7-Tesla scanner.  The unique research and clinical applications afforded by 7-Tesla MRI are predominantly  due to the associated increase in the signal-to-noise ratio that can be exploited to achieve  higher resolution images (4, 130-132). In addition, imaging at this ultra-high-field (UHF)  enables the improved detection of functional and metabolic (i.e., using MR spectroscopy)  abnormalities compared with lower-field-strength MR scanners (4, 130-132). Importantly,  the UHF MR system presents unique safety issues, especially with respect to scanning pa- tients with implants and devices (4, 130-132)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>). If 7-Tesla MRI is to reach its full  potential as an imaging modality, scanning must become available to research subjects and  patients with metallic implants.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Magnetic Field Interactions </emphasis></para>
      <para>As previously described in this chapter, attractive translational and rotational forces  acting on metallic objects, including medical implants and devices, depend on a myriad of  factors including the composition of the material and its shape (1, 2, 4, 130-132). Transla- tional forces are highly dependent on the field strength and the spatial gradient magnetic  field, while rotational forces are directly proportional to the strength of the static magnetic  field (1, 2, 4, 130-132). Of note is that, in comparison to a 3-Tesla MR system, a scanner  operating at 7-Tesla has a fringe field that changes faster as a function of distance from the  static magnetic field. That is, the fringe field has a “steeper” spatial gradient magnetic field.  Because both the static magnetic and spatial gradient magnetic fields are greater at 7-Tesla  than those at lower fields, translational attraction forces affect implants to a greater extent,  which may pose higher risks for certain devices (4, 130-132).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI-Related Heating </emphasis></para>
      <para>The hydrogen proton resonance frequency at 7-Tesla is approximately 298-MHz and,  therefore, the corresponding RF wavelength in tissue is substantially less than what exists  at 64-MHz (i.e., for 1.5-Tesla) or 128-MHz (i.e., for 3-Tesla). This results in the potential  to heat shorter metallic implants and cause thermal injuries at 7-Tesla compared to what  might occur at 1.5- or 3-Tesla (4, 130-132).  Importantly, MRI-related heating at 7-Tesla  may be of considerable concern when utilizing “stronger” RF pulses (e.g., fast spin echo  pulse sequences) because temperature has been demonstrated to increase with the square  of the transmitted pulse power (133).</para>

      <para>1.5- and/or 3-Tesla (1, 2, 134-144). Only a small number of medical products have under- gone proper testing and labeled with MRI-specific information (i.e., labeled MR Safe or  MR Conditional). Test methods developed to assess translational attraction, torque, and RF  field-induced heating at 1.5- and 3-Tesla have been adapted to test medical products at 7- Tesla. With regard to the heating test, this procedure was designed for a transmit body RF  coil, however, at the present time, only transmit/receive head and knee RF coils exist for  the 7-Tesla scanners approved for clinical use. Accordingly, the test procedure applied to  implants had to be modified in consideration of the available RF coils. Once a transmit  body RF coil becomes available for 7-T MR systems, re-testing will be necessary.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Untested Passive Implants</emphasis>. In 2019, Barisano, et al. (144) described a case involving  7-Tesla MRI of the brain in a subject with untested and unlabeled, total knee replacement  implants. Because these orthopedic implants were made of materials that were nonmetallic  or had low magnetic susceptibilities and were implanted in an anatomic area far removed  from the transmitted RF energy (i.e., a transmit/receive head RF coil was used for imaging),  there were no deleterious effects anticipated for the scan. The subject had an uneventful  outcome. The investigators proposed that, by following a similar strategy that takes into  consideration the materials for a given implant and the anatomic area receiving the trans- mitted RF energy, 7-Tesla MRI may be used safely in situations where there is an untested  implant (144). Note that this information applies to passive implants, only.</para>
      <para>Guidelines presented by Barisano, et al. (144) to manage patients or research subjects  with untested implants were, as follows:</para>
      <para>(1) The supervising physician (e.g., the MRI-trained radiologist) must perform an assessment  of the risks associated with the implant versus the benefits of the MRI exam.</para>
      <para>(2) Because of the lack of MRI-related testing for the implant, a physician must provide writ- ten and verbal informed consent to the individual and include a discussion of the potential  benefits, risks, and alternative imaging procedure that may be appropriate.</para>
      <para>(3) The material used to make the implant must be identified in order to establish if there  may be issues with respect to magnetic field interactions and heating. Typically, material  information can be obtained by contacting the manufacturer. Some common low mag- netic susceptibility, metallic materials that are used for implants include cobalt- chromium-molybdenum alloy, nitinol, austenitic stainless steel (e.g., 316L, 316LVM,  etc.), platinum, platinum-iridium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloy, tantalum, commer- cially pure titanium, and titanium alloy.</para>
      <para>(4) Since all metals are conductors, the position of the implant relative to the transmitted RF  energy must be considered with respect to the potential for excessive heating. Thus, to  ensure minimal risk, the entire implant must be located outside of the RF coil and a suit- able distance from the area of the transmitted RF energy. (Note, in consideration of the  possibility of “traveling-wave” effects, a minimum distance of 30-cm is deemed accept- able. See section below.) As previously indicated, the 7-Tesla MR systems approved for  clinical use currently have transmit/receive head and knee RF coils, only. As such, a rela- tively straightforward decision may be made with respect to possible hazards related to  excessive implant heating for this scanner configuration. Once a transmit body or other  transmit body part-specific RF coils becomes available, the prediction of implant heating  will become a greater challenge.</para>

      <para>Kraff and Quick (131) summarized additional information regarding scanning patients  at 7-Tesla with untested passive implants, recognizing that because of the lack of tested and  labeled implants, both research and clinical uses of 7-Tesla MRI may be limited because of  the exclusion of individuals with metallic implants. They proposed that by using a well- considered, risk versus benefit analysis, the already known advantages of 7-Tesla MRI in  neurological and musculoskeletal diagnostic imaging should not be denied to patients de- spite the presence of passive implants, particularly for those implants labeled MR Condi- tional at 3-Tesla (131).</para>
      <para>In 2016, the national network German Ultrahigh Field Imaging (GUFI) published a  consensus recommendation on the inclusion of study subjects imaged at 7-Tesla (145). The  recommendation stated that the use of local transmit/receive RF coils (i.e., head and knee)  has the advantage that the transmit RF exposure volume is considerably lower compared to  the large exposure volume of transmit body RF coils that are on 1.5- and 3-Tesla scanners.  As a result, the RF power density that exists outside of local transmit RF coils decreases  rapidly. Therefore, for individuals with passive implants that are labeled MR Conditional  at 3-Tesla, that do not contain magnetizable components, and that are located at a certain  distance from the transmit RF coil, an overly conservative exclusion of individuals with  implants would no longer be warranted, as previously required by many ethics committees.</para>
      <para>Of note is that the minimum distance between the implant and the local transmit RF  coil depends on both components and, thus, must always be considered on a case-by-case  basis. At 7-Tesla, the phenomenon of the “traveling wave” effect (146) (Note, the traveling  wave effect suggests that there is a possibility that the bore of the scanner can act as a hollow  circular waveguide for traveling waves that could interact with an implant outside of the  area of the transmitted RF) needs to be taken into account, primarily for implants that have  a complex geometry or that form a conducting loop of a certain diameter, and/or with di- mensions of integral multiples of half a wavelength, or in cases for partially implanted  metallic objects (131, 145). Accordingly, to ensure patient safety, the minimum allowable  distance between the edge of the transmit RF coil and the implant should be 30 cm. While  this value has not been determined by numerical simulations of various exposure scenarios,  it does represent a conservative guideline for passive implants in association with scanning  at 7-Tesla. (131).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Untested Active Implants</emphasis>. As previously discussed, an active implant contains electrical  circuits and/or a power supply. Presently, no active implant has been tested and labeled MR  Conditional at 7-Tesla. The potential safety risks are considered to be extremely high and  related to excessive magnetic field interactions, RF field-induced heating, induced currents,  device malfunction, and other MRI-related issues.</para>

      <para>ported that, if the metallic object is a “passive implant” and it is made from nonferromag- netic material, the patient may undergo an MRI exam <emphasis role="italics">immediately</emphasis> after implantation using  an MR system operating at 3-Tesla or less (1, 2). In fact, there are reports that describe  placement of vascular stents, coils, filters, and other metallic implants using MR-guided  procedures that include the use of high-field-strength (1.5- and 3-Tesla) scanners (1, 147,  148). Additionally, a patient or individual with a nonferromagnetic, passive implant is al- lowed to enter the MRI environment associated with a scanner operating at 3-Tesla or less  immediately after the implantation of the device.</para>
      <para>Importantly, for a passive implant that does not state a “wait” period in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">for Use</emphasis> (IFU) or MRI-related labeling, there is no need to delay the MRI examination for  the patient. For patients with implants that are “weakly magnetic” but rigidly fixed or oth- erwise anchored in the body (e.g., orthopedic implants or other similar devices), these in- dividuals may undergo MRI immediately after implantation of the device.</para>
      <para>For an implant or device that exhibits ferromagnetic qualities, it may be necessary to  wait a period of six weeks after implantation before performing MRI. For example, certain  intravascular and intracavitary coils, stents, and filters designated as “magnetic” become  firmly incorporated into tissue a minimum of six weeks following placement. In these cases,  retentive or counter-forces provided by tissue ingrowth, scarring, granulation, or other mech- anisms serve to prevent these objects from presenting risks or hazards to patients or indi- viduals with respect to movement or dislodgement associated with magnetic field  interactions (i.e., force and torque).</para>
      <para>Of course, the information above pertains to magnetic field interactions (i.e., force and  torque) and further consideration must be given to MRI-related heating for the implant or  device.</para>
      <para>If there is any concern regarding the integrity of the tissue with respect to its ability to  retain the implant or object in place or the implant cannot be properly identified, the patient  or individual should not be exposed to the MRI environment unless a radiologist gives care- ful consideration to the risk versus benefit aspects of the specific implant and the intended  MRI conditions.</para>

These factors include magnetic field  interactions (i.e, force and torque), MRI-related heating, and if the implant has a functional  component, such as a programmable cerebral spinal fluid shunt valve, the impact of MRI  on the operational aspects of the device must also be considered.

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>This chapter provided an overview of MRI-related issues for implants and devices and  presented MRI-related information for several passive medical products. Comprehensive  information for active implants is presented elsewhere in this textbook. With the continued  advances in MRI technology and the development of more sophisticated implants and de- vices, there is an increased potential for hazardous situations to occur in the MRI environ- ment. To ensure safety for individual and patients, MRI healthcare professionals should  follow the guideline whereby an MRI examination should only be performed in a patient  with a medical product that has been previously tested and demonstrated to be safe. For im- plants and devices with MR Conditional labeling, the specific information must be carefully  followed to prevent patient injuries.</para>
