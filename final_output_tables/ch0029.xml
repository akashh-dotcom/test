    <para>In all aspects of life, children are provided with a different set of rules and regulations than adults to help keep them safe, and this is no different in the medical field, particularly in radiology. In fact, a major initiative in radiology is to reduce exposure to ionizing radiation in the pediatric population. In 2008, the <emphasis role="italics">Image Gently</emphasis> campaign was created by the Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging to help the medical community change their practice by increasing awareness of the opportunities to promote radiation protection in the diagnostic imaging of children. While there is presently no similar group leading the effort with regard to the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the pediatric population, it is this author's hope that we will continue to share best practices within the MRI community which will help ensure safety in pediatric patients relative to the utilization of MRI technology.</para>
    <para>The objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of information pertaining to best practices as well as to present policies and procedures related to MRI safety for pediatric patients. Notably, in the MRI environment, children can present many challenges in imaging and safety (1-4). Trying to establish safety policies and guidelines in the use of equipment (e.g., radiofrequency coils, monitoring systems, anesthesia equipment, etc.) and the development of MRI techniques can be extremely challenging. To help guide us through these issues, it is essential for the facility to establish an MRI Safety Committee and safety enhancement program.</para>

    <para>It can be challenging to impose the concept of MRI safety upon those not directly involved with it on a daily or otherwise routine basis. Without an MRI Safety Committee, the</para>

        <title>MRI Policies and Procedures for a Children's Hospital Setting</title>
    <para>involvement from ancillary teams (e.g., nursing, anesthesia, transportation, etc.) can be difficult to establish. As such, a collaborative approach allows for the development of rules and regulations that impact the workflow of all individuals involved in the care of patients who undergo MRI exams. By seeking the advice or input from the other healthcare professionals, the implementation of new policies and procedures becomes a synergistic effort. Developing an MRI Safety Committee composed of vital representatives from ancillary departments such as the anesthesia department, the intensive care unit (ICU), respiratory care, and nursing staff members is beneficial because it provides a path by which the members of the committee become the liaison between radiology/MRI and the individual disciplines and departments.</para>

          <title>FUNCTION OF THE MRI SAFETY COMMITTEE</title>
    <para>Before developing an MRI Safety Committee, careful thought should be given as to how the committee will function, as well as to the development of the roles and responsibilities of the various committee members (5-8). There are several avenues the group can take when forming an MRI Safety Committee. The committee can be one of three basic types: (1) Advisory, (2) Policy Making, or (3) a combination of the two.</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>The Advisory Committee investigates MRI safety issues within the department and hospital, offering guidelines, as needed. This committee does not make policies, but rather, offers opinions to those individuals responsible for developing rules that impact the MRI facility.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The Policy Making Committee is entrusted with the power to make or change policies and procedures based on their safety findings or in response to a need to address an accident or incident. Similar to the Advisory Committee, the Policy Making Committee may have to investigate or research topics and issues, but this committee is also granted the further discretion to formulate new policies and procedures.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The Combination Committee takes into account recommendations from both the Advisory Committee and the Policy Making Committee. This committee should be given specific guidelines on its authority. In some instances, its authority may be advisory, while other issues may require the latitude to develop and implement new policies and procedures</para>

        <title>MRI SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM</title>
    <para>MRI safety should be continuously enhanced because every year, new biomedical equipment and medical implants are deployed that can create possible unsafe situations in the MRI setting and for patients. Additionally, every year new personnel join medical centers, many of which may need to visit the MRI facility. These new employees require specialized training and need to be kept informed regarding new developments that impact MRI safety. An enhancement program may include the following:</para>

        <title>MRI EDUCATION</title>
    <para>Education of the team members increases their knowledge about critical aspects of the MRI environment, the special challenges with MRI safety, and the how's and why's of new policies and procedures. There should be the opportunity for initial learning, annual refresher courses, Just In Time (JIT) education and other related educational endeavors. At a minimum, educational courses should include the following content:</para>

      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Just in Time (JIT) education is typically used to teach and re-teach known medical techniques and is a great resource for staff members that may have a limited rotation to the MRI facility (10). This particular type of education should be kept simple and relatively brief, while touching on key items. Figure 1 presents an example of a flyer that can be used as a tool for JIT. Note that it covers the key points directed towards the hospital's nursing staff that they must review before entry to the MRI area. JIT may also be used as screen savers on computers at the nursing stations to remind staff members of key items related to MRI safety.</para>

    <para>MRI safety is usually misunderstood by individuals that do not work in the MRI setting. Using techniques such as formalized educational programs provide an opportunity to remind all hospital personnel of the dangers inherent in the MRI area, making sure that ancillary staff members obtain the necessary knowledge to keep pediatric patients safe. Importantly, the pursuit of MRI safety should be an integral part of an overall institutional safety program.</para>

        <title>SIMULATION AND ITS ROLE IN MRI SAFETY</title>
    <para>Hospitals and medical centers now offer variations of simulation-based training whereby medical and other personnel have the opportunity to develop skill sets on mannequins and to use other tools in specific settings before actually performing the skills involving patients, such as venipuncture and responses to various types of emergencies. Similarly, an MRI simulation center can be a useful tool to improve the culture of safety relative to the MRI environment. Additionally, an MRI simulation center can help facilitate the review of policies and procedures by simulating real life situations. The objectives of these simulations should be to ensure that the policies and procedures are clear and that all involved can effectively perform the critical tasks, as needed.</para>

    <para>A "policy" is a non-negotiable requirement of a regulatory agency or a self-imposed governing rule to ensure safety, quality, compliance, or cost-effectiveness (14-17). In general, policies should be written clearly and concisely. Language in the policy statement should mirror the language of the regulation itself. Policies should be fewer in number in the "Focus and Simplify" format. A key point is that, if procedures and job aids are well-written, a policy may only need to be accessed infrequently because the associated documents would help one to adhere to the policy (14-17).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Screening Policies</emphasis></para>
    <para>Most pediatric patients are usually unable to speak for themselves and, thus, rely on parents and guardians to provide and convey information for them and to ensure their safety. If you are a parent, you know that when you take your child to the hospital for an examination or procedure, you are focused on the child getting diagnosed or treated and may not always remember the answers to all the questions being asked. Parental anxiety plays a major role in how screening questions for MRI are answered and, therefore, having multiple tools and/or interviewing sessions provide parents with the opportunity to remember something they may have forgotten.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">MRI Screening Process for In-Patients.</emphasis> Pediatric in-patients rely heavily on ancillary personnel to support them during MRI exams. Monitoring the ancillary staff, allowing a family member into the MR system room, performing the scan, answering telephones, and other tasks can be overwhelming for the MRI technologist due to the variety and vast number of support staff members that may be involved and the duties that are required. As such, to help monitor the large number of staff members in the MRI environment, there is a great dependence on screening policies and procedures.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The MRI Screening Form.</emphasis> MRI facilities should have screening forms readily available for every individual that needs to enter the MR system room (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 2 to 4</emphasis>). When screening pediatric patients, a family member or responsible guardian should fill out the screening form. In the event that there is not a parent or guardian available before the MRI exam, then a knowledgeable nurse or physician can fill out the form. Notably, the MRI screening form should include the parent or guardian's cell phone number in the event that it is necessary to ask questions so that these individuals can be reached directly and not delay their child's MRI exam. Once the screening form has been completed, the MRI technologist must review the content for the following information:</para>

Ideally, information for an implant or device should be entered in the departmental or Hospital Information System. The patient should then be approved to be scheduled for the MRI examination. Upon arrival to the MRI department, the patient should be screened again by an MRI technologist - once in the department and then again at the final "Time Out and Visual Check" procedure, described below.

    <para><emphasis role="italics">MRI Screening Process for Out-Patients.</emphasis> The MRI screening process is different for the out-patient population. At the time of scheduling, the parent (or patient, as appropriate) should be questioned in regards to potential MRI safety issues. If there is a concern, the MRI safety group member (i.e., a designated MRI technologist whose responsibility it is to investigate implants, devices, or safety issues before the patient arrives to the MRI facility) should be contacted via phone or email. All details of the investigation should be documented as part of the scheduled visit.</para>
    <para>A preliminary MRI screening procedure is ideally performed before the patient arrives for the appointment, but if this does not occur during this time, then it can be conducted on the day the patient arrives and before the next screening step is performed. In order to facilitate this process, the MRI technologist may evaluate the following:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Review the most recent X-rays and report for implants or devices.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Review medical documentation in the institution's Information System for the presence of implants or devices.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>On the day the appointment is scheduled, the patient should be prescreened and, upon arrival, a more in-depth documented screening process should be conducted to ensure that</para>
    <para>the patient is safe to have the MRI exam. Once the patient is ready for the MRI procedure, an official "Time Out and Visual Check" procedure should be performed prior to entry into the MR system room.</para>

        <title>PROTECTION FROM ACOUSTIC NOISE</title>
    <para>Acoustic noise can pose a threat to a child's psychological and physical health. Therefore, the use of proper hearing protection in pediatric patients is an important part of ensuring safety. Modern-day MR systems can generate acoustic noise from 78- to 130-decibels or higher depending on the pulse sequence and other factors. While certain scanners may have reduced the maximal acoustic noise levels to 90-decibels, it is still recommended that all patients utilize hearing protection. In addition, healthcare workers who remain in the MR system room during the MRI exam should likewise wear hearing protection.</para>
    <para>Hearing protection is utilized to minimize the risk of hearing impairment in association with MRI. Special noise attenuation devices may be used (e.g., MiniMuffs (Natus Medical, Seattle, WA) for neonates and young infants (Figure 5). These devices may be used in conjunction with soft ear putty (silicone-based and/or beeswax). Additional protection such as using positioning sponges (i.e., the ones provided with the MR system's head RF coil) will help prevent acoustic noise-related problems for pediatric patients. The combination of MiniMuffs and ear putty is advantageous over other types of earplugs because they provide the best type of noise reduction and help to avoid the difficulty of inserting earplugs into relatively small ear canals. This strategy also prevents the possibility of small children swallowing or choking on tiny earplugs.</para>

        <title>MRI SAFETY ISSUES RELATED TO THERMOREGULATION IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS</title>
    <para>Thermoregulation is the ability to maintain body temperature independent of the outside environment. Infants rely on their mothers to regulate their temperatures <emphasis role="italics">in utero</emphasis>. Once born, the infant has a somewhat limited ability to regulate body temperature in response to exposure to cold environments primarily due to the inability to shiver. While an infant can sweat, only the glands in the head, neck, hands and feet are active (i.e., approximately 25 to 30% of their total body size) (18-25). To keep warm, a baby may try to curl up into the fetal position, move, or cry. However, a baby's main source of heat production is the special type body fat, known as brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT starts developing at 26 to 30 weeks of gestation and makes up about 2 to 7% of the baby's total body weight at birth. BAT is similar to the fat tissue found in hibernating animals.</para>
    <para>BAT plays an important role in providing body heat for the infant. Unfortunately, a disadvantage of using BAT to stay warm is that the metabolism associated with utilizing this type of fat to produce heat requires extra oxygen and glucose. This can result in the newborn becoming physically stressed, as the infant attempts to maintain a proper body temperature. If allowed to become too cold (the baby's temperature should never be lower than 36°C), the infant may be reluctant to feed in an effort to conserve energy, thus, compounding the problem (21-25).</para>
    <para>Importantly, procedures should be in place to ensure that a newborn's temperature is maintained at an acceptable level throughout the MRI examination. Once a patient from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is ready to travel to the MRI facility, a checklist composed of three sections should be used for: (1) Pre-Study, (2) Arrival at the MRI facility, and (3) Post-Scan Instructions.</para>

    <para>While it is important to maintain the infant's temperature during MRI, it is equally important to review the relevant MRI procedure when utilizing an MR Conditional incubator for that purpose of ensuring that there will be no issues (Figure 6). Fortunately, several types of MR Conditional incubators from various manufacturers are available for use in the MRI setting. These incubators offer thermal regulation with air warming, which allows the infant's skin temperature to be monitored at all times during transport to and from the MRI facility and throughout the MRI examination (26-28).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis>The physiology of children and adults differ and these differences can greatly impact MRI safety issues.
