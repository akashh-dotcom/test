          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a rare, systemic fibrosing disorder reminiscent, but distinct from scleroderma or scleromyxedema. Its most prominent and visible effects are observed in the skin, which led to the disease originally being named "nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy", or NFD (1). The first cases of NSF were identified in 1997 and the first published report of 14 cases appeared in 2000 (2). "Nephrogenic" does not mean that the disease is caused by factors originating in the kidney, but that NSF has been observed only in patients with acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>), end-stage renal disease, or with acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to hepatorenal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period. "Systemic Fibrosis" emphasizes the systemic nature of this fibrosing disorder. Along with thickening and hardening of the skin, it may involve nerves and skeletal muscles, and it has also been linked with myocardial, pericardial, and pleural fibrosis (2, 3, 4, 5).</para>
    <para>In some patients, NSF may be fatal; however, the disease by itself is not a cause of death. Rather, NSF may contribute to death by restricting effective ventilation, or by restricting mobility to the point of causing an accidental fall that may lead to fractures and clotting complications (4).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Epidemiology</emphasis></para>
    <para>Two extensive, systematic literature reviews provided information on the epidemiology of NSF. The first systematic review was conducted in 2013 and focused on 815 distinct</para>
    <para>cases of NSF with clinical and/or histological confirmation of the condition reported in 200 articles in peer-reviewed literature from 2000 until December 2012 (6). These 200 papers were obtained by performing a literature search of the PubMed database using the following key words: "nephrogenic systemic fibrosis", "nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy", "scleromyxedema-like", and "scleroderma and gadolinium". The second and more recent literature review was based on a search of the same database (PubMed) using the terms "nephrogenic systemic fibrosis," "nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy," and "NSF" from January 2000 until February 2019 and was able to detect 639 distinct cases of NSF in 173 peer-reviewed articles (7). Differently from the previous systematic review, cases without histological confirmation were discarded. Cases from abstracts, letters-to-the-editor, or other correspondence were not included in either of the two systematic reviews if they lacked sufficient information, and duplicates were removed. In several cases, authors were contacted in order to obtain additional information or confirm information reported in the article.</para>
    <para>Results of both systematic reviews showed that NSF affected males and females in approximately equal numbers and was identified in patients from a large variety of ethnic backgrounds and from North America, Europe, and Asia. The disease tends to affect middle-aged adults most commonly (6, 7). No cases of NSF were reported in neonates or toddlers; however, NSF has been confirmed in pediatric patients and elderly adults, with 6 years as the youngest age reported (6), and 87 years the oldest (6, 7).</para>
    <para>In both reviews, almost all the cases of NSF were observed in patients with severe acute or chronic renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>), with acute renal insufficiency due to hepatorenal syndrome, or in the perioperative liver transplantation period (6, 7). The vast majority of patients with NSF (&gt;75%) were on dialysis (6, 7). The few reports of patients developing NSF with eGFR values greater than 29 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript> were actually cases of acute renal failure resulting in eGFR overestimation or errors in the proper estimation of GFR (6).</para>
    <para>In summary, systematic reviews of published reports of NSF indicate that NSF is a rare disease that may occur in patients of either gender and any age or race with severe chronic or acute renal insufficiency or, mostly, end-stage renal disease.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Etiology</emphasis>Despite considerable effort, no case of NSF could be identified before 1997 (8). This truly new disease entity should therefore have resulted from exposure of patients with advanced renal failure to one or more new exogenous agents—that is, a new medication, toxin, or infectious agent—or to new ways of using previously existing medications (9). The first suspect was high-dose erythropoietin (8-10) in the presence of co-factors such as hypercoagulable states, various forms of vascular injury, vascular surgical procedures, and liver failure (in particular, hepatorenal syndrome and liver transplantation) (11). Erythropoietin is the principal therapy for anemia in both dialysis and pre-dialysis patients. Its use and doses dramatically increased after the publication of the Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines for anemia management in 1997, i.e., in the same year that the first case of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy was reported.</para>

            <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     353</title>
    <para>In 2006 Grobner, et al. (12) reported 5 cases of NSF in patients previously exposed to high doses of a GBCA (Omniscan™, active ingredient: gadodiamide) and suggested a possible association between exposure to GBCAs and the development of the condition in patients with severe impairment of renal function. Since that report, GBCAs have been the prime suspect, even though GBCAs had already been widely available for clinical use since the late 1980's, i.e., at least 10 years before the first cases of NSF were identified.</para>
    <para>NSF cases have been observed weeks, months or even years after the administration of certain GBCAs (13). It has been suggested that cumulative lifetime GBCA exposure increases the risk of NSF (4). However, GBCA exposure and renal insufficiency cannot be the sole effectors of NSF. The vast majority of patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic dialysis do not acquire the disease, even following multiple exposures to the GBCAs that have been associated with the highest number of NSF cases. Also, cases of NSF have been reported in patients with no history of GBCA exposure (7, 14-16).</para>
    <para>As for the pathogenesis of NSF, the working hypothesis is that Gd complexes may stay for weeks, months or even years within the skin and other tissues. In the skin of susceptible patients with advanced renal failure, the retained Gd complexes may potentially attract and/or activate circulating fibrocytes, bone marrow-derived cells that participate in normal wound healing and fibrosis. These activated fibroblasts are believed to underlie the aberrant fibrosis seen in NSF (4, 17). These cells are distinct from other fibrocytes in that they have a specific immunophenotype, i.e., the CD34<superscript>-</superscript>/ procollagen I dual positive profile (4, 18). Histology of the skin of patients with NSF reveals increased cellularity, with CD34- and procollagen I-expressing spindle cells, occasional histiocytes, and factor XIIIa+ dendritic cells. Higher levels of retained Gd have been observed in areas of increased cellularity (4, 17). As of today, however, the pathogenesis of NSF is largely unknown, as well as the role that GBCAs might play. (5, 18)</para>
    <para>NSF cases occurring after the sole administration of one GBCA are defined as "single-agent" or "unconfounded." If a case of NSF follows the administration of two or more GBCAs, it is impossible to determine which agent is associated with the development of the disorder, and the case is reported as "multiple-agent" or "confounded" (4).</para>
    <para>Almost all unconfounded NSF cases occurred after single or repeated exposure to three GBCAs: gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist® and generic equivalents), gadoversatamide (OptiMark®), and gadodiamide (Omniscan™) (18). No or very few unconfounded cases were reported following exposure to any of the other GBCAs, i.e., gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance®), gadobutrol (Gadovist®/Gadavist®), gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem and generic equivalents), gadoteridol (ProHance), gadoxetate disodium (Primovist/Eovist) (18).</para>
    <para>Regulatory Authority intervention, culminating in 2009-2010 with the contraindication of these three GBCAs for use in patients with an eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript> due to chronic kidney disease or an acute deterioration of the renal function, dramatically reduced the risk of NSF. The estimated rate of NSF per million exposures up to 2008 (2.07; 95% confidence interval: 1.90, 2.26) fell significantly (p&lt;0.001) to only 0.028 (95% confidence interval: 0.012, 0.060) after 2008. (5, 18)</para>
    <para>Of note, monitoring of NSF based on spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions and literature case reports may lead to underreporting of NSF cases. Missing or inconclusive information in spontaneously reported cases is also a limitation of NSF monitoring (19), as for some reports it may not be possible to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of NSF using the clinicopathological criteria developed by Girardi et al (20). On the other hand, clinical data from large-scale studies of individual GBCAs in high-risk patients, with prolonged and extensive follow-up and systematic collection of all the clinical and pathology information needed for a reliable, accurate diagnosis of NSF, may provide better, more precise information on NSF risk deriving from exposure to individual GBCAs, assuming the patient population is large enough to draw meaningful conclusions.</para>
    <para>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Woolen et al (21) looked at 16 unique studies published between May 2008 and April 2019 that involved 4931 patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD (eGFR, &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m<superscript>2</superscript>) and/or receiving dialysis who underwent MRI with one of four low-risk GBCAs (gadobenate dimeglumine, gadoterate meglumine, gadobutrol, gadoteridol). The outcome measure required for inclusion was assessment of unconfounded incidence of NSF. The pooled incidence of NSF across these 4931 patients was 0 (0%; upper boundary of 95% CI, 0.07%). The upper bounds of the 95% CIs varied on a study-specific basis owing to differences in study-specific eligible sample sizes. Nevertheless, the greatest safety margin (i.e., largest sample size) was for gadobenate dimeglumine (upper bound 95% CI, 0.12% [0 of 3167]), followed by gadoterate meglumine (0.31% [0 of 1204]) gadobutrol (1.11% [0 of 330]), and gadoteridol (1.59% [0 of 230]). Consistent with these findings, recent updates to the guidelines released by the American College of Radiology, ACR (3), the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (22), and the Canadian Association of Radiologists (23) support use of indicated low-risk GBCAs in patients with eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m<superscript>2</superscript>. These conclusions have been echoed in a consensus statement from the ACR and National Kidney Foundation (24). The findings reported by Woolen, et al. (21) have since been substantiated in a recent systematic review by Lunyera, et al (25). Recent results from a retrospective study also showed no cases of NSF following administration of gadoxetic acid (Primovist/Eovist) to 153 patients with severely impaired renal function (26).</para>
    <para>Although the risk of NSF from administration of low-risk GBCAs in patients with severely impaired renal function is very low, likely less than 0.07%, it is important to note that there have been rare reports of clinically and histologically confirmed cases of NSF following exposure to these safer agents. Therefore, guidelines aimed at minimizing risk should nevertheless still be followed.</para>

          <title>DIAGNOSIS</title>
    <para>NSF is different from adverse events usually encountered by radiologists because it does not occur at the time of the imaging study. Instead, NSF typically occurs days to months later. Individually, the clinical and pathological features of NSF are not unique to that disease, so that no single test or other finding can be relied on to be 100% sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of NSF (20, 27). A confident diagnosis may be reached only through the combination of clinical history, a physical examination, and compelling histologic features of a biopsy specimen of involved skin (20, 27). A clinicopathological defini-</para>

    <para>tion of NSF developed by a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced clinicians and dermatopathologists is the universally accepted reference to diagnose NSF (20). This definition relies upon a combination of clinical and pathological findings derived from the study of numerous patients, the relevant medical literature, and histological slides and data contained within the Yale NSF Registry to create a reproducible diagnostic and workup scheme for putative cases of NSF. As mentioned previously, to date, NSF has been observed only in patients either with acute or chronic renal insufficiency or, mostly end-stage renal disease. Therefore, the main elements that should guide physicians in the diagnostic process are clinical presentation and confirmatory cutaneous histopathologic findings in the setting of decreased or absent glomerular filtration, either acutely or chronically (4, 20, 27).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Physical Examination</emphasis></para>
    <para>The skin changes caused by NSF can mimic progressive systemic sclerosis with a predilection for extremity involvement that can extend to the torso (4, 14, 20, 21). Unlike scleroderma, NSF usually spares the face (4, 20, 27). Skin lesions typically begin with swelling, progressing to erythematous papules and coalescing violaceous to hyperpigmented, brawny plaques with follicular dimpling (peau d'orange) changes (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>) (4, 20, 27, 28). Peripheral irregular fingerlike or ameboid projections may be present along with islands of sparing (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>) (20, 28, 29). The involved skin and subcutis can become markedly thickened and hardened, unpinchable, with a wooden consistency to palpation (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>) (4, 20, 26, 27). The indurations characteristically involve the distal extremities first, gradually proceeding to involve the proximal extremities to the level of the mid-thigh and mid-upper arms where they may show a pattern of bumpiness ("cobblestoning") (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>) (4, 20, 26, 27).

    <para>sufficient findings to make a more confident diagnosis in cases of superficial lesions. However, it is always better to obtain deeper biopsy specimens because the disease characteristically extends along fibrous septa into subcutaneous fat and fascia and sometimes into underlying skeletal muscle (20). For lesions of differing morphologies and/or locations, multiple cutaneous biopsy specimens are recommended (20). Histologically, NSF is characterized by dermal fibrosis and may be indistinguishable from scleromyxedema (20, 27, 28). Preserved elastic tissue is a finding that allows dermatopathologists to distinguish NSF from morphea and scleroderma (20). In NSF, there is always an increased number of fibroblasts that are CD34-positive and procollagen I–positive when stained immunohistochemically (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). This dual positivity is characteristic of so-called "circulating fibroblasts," mesenchymal stem cells of bone marrow origin that participate in wound repair (29). Other features that, if present, help make a more confident diagnosis of NSF are: increased numbers of spindled and/or epithelioid cells (i.e., activated macrophages resembling epithelial cells) with few other inflammatory cells in the dermis; thin, especially in early lesions, and thick collagen bundles that generally maintain clefts of separation between their neighbors; involvement of subcutaneous septa which are markedly widened and collagenized as described above; osseous metaplasia, with foci of osteoid deposition, or calcified bone spicules around elastic fibers, which are considered a highly specific feature of NSF (20, 27, 28, 30).</para>

    <para>The risk of NSF from administration of the safer GBCAs gadobenate dimeglumine, gadoteridol, gadobutrol, and gadoterate meglumine in patients with severely impaired renal function is very low, likely less than 0.07%. Therefore, the identification of patients at risk using a questionnaire or laboratory testing prior to exposure to these agents can be considered optional (3). On the contrary, it is highly recommended before intravenous administration of any other GBCA.</para>
    <para>Clinical laboratories now routinely report eGFR based on filtration markers. The most common filtration marker used is creatinine, for which laboratory assays have been standardized since 2003 (33). The preferred estimating equation in the United States and much of the world is the CKD-EPI 2009 creatinine equation, which is more accurate than the earlier MDRD equation, particularly for eGFR values greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript> (33). Anyway, neither equation is suitable if renal function is in an unstable condition, that is, in patients with acute renal failure or on dialysis. Results may also deviate from true values in patients with exceptional dietary intake (e.g., vegetarian diet, high protein diet, creatine supplements), extreme body composition (e.g., very lean, obese, paraplegia), or severe liver disease. In view of this latter limitation, patients with hepatorenal syndrome and those with reduced renal function who have had or are awaiting liver transplantation should be considered at risk of NSF if they have any level of GFR below 60-mL/min/1.73 m<superscript>2</superscript>.</para>

    <para>In situations requiring additional accuracy and precision, cystatin C can be used with creatinine in the CKD-EPI 2012 creatinine-cystatin C equation (34). Adding cystatin C may be particularly useful for individuals with altered creatinine production and/or metabolism, e.g., extremely high or low body size or muscle mass, limb amputation, high-protein diet, use of creatinine supplements, or use of drugs affecting tubular secretion of creatinine) (35).</para>
    <para>There is no evidence to guide the time interval within which eGFR should be obtained prior to GBCA injection on patients identified by screening to have one or more risk factor for compromised renal function. However, it is recommended to measure renal function within two to seven days before the date of the contrast-enhanced procedure.</para>
    <para>A single normal eGFR measurement usually does not rule out acute renal insufficiency since there is a delay between a change in renal function and the corresponding change in serum creatinine (4). The patient's clinical condition should, therefore, also be assessed close to the time of the procedure and, if factors that could cause acute renal failure are detected, the renal function should be measured again before the GBCA is given (4). In practice all patients with suspected acute renal failure should be considered at risk of developing NSF, regardless of measured serum creatinine or calculated GFR values (4).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 2. Assess Risk–Benefit of Contrast-Enhanced MRI in Patients at Risk</emphasis></para>
    <para>A patient at risk of NSF should receive a GBCA only when no suitable diagnostic alternatives are available and a thorough risk–benefit assessment for that patient indicates that the benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk of NSF (3, 4, 22, 23). The risk–benefit evaluation should be made by the radiologist in conjunction with the referring physician and should be properly and prospectively documented. History of previous exposures to GBCAs, especially if recent, or if other factors that are thought to act as possible co-triggers of the disease, such as metabolic acidosis, vascular surgery, thrombotic events, and so on, should be taken into account during the risk–benefit assessment of each individual at-risk patient. Patients or parents or guardians (in the case of minors) should be properly informed of the benefits, risks, and diagnostic alternatives based on all the information available at that time and should provide their consent in writing (3, 4, 22, 23).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 3. Perform Any Unenhanced MRI Sequence That May Be Helpful Before Injecting the MRI Contrast Agent</emphasis></para>
    <para>Even after the decision is made to perform a contrast-enhanced MR examination, and the patient has consented to receive a GBCA, the prescribing information for individual GBCAs all indicate that the use of GBCAs should be avoided unless the diagnostic information from the use of contrast is essential and not available with unenhanced MRI. Therefore, all unenhanced MRI pulse sequences that may help to make a diagnosis should be performed and the MR images should be evaluated by an experienced radiologist to ensure that the administration of a GBCA is still deemed necessary.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 4. Choice of the GBCA and Dose</emphasis></para>
    <para>To minimize risk of NSF development, no GBCA containing gadodiamide, gadoversetamide, or gadopentetate dimeglumine should ever be used in patients with severely impaired renal function. Any of the low-risk GBCAs (gadobenate dimeglumine, gadoxetate</para>
    <para>disodium, gadoteridol, gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine) can be used instead when clinically indicated (3, 22, 23).</para>
    <para>The recommendations for use in at-risk patients are to use the lowest dose of a low-risk GBCA required to obtain the needed clinical information and to not exceed the recommended single dose. Moreover, a sufficient period of time is required to allow elimination of the drug from the body prior to re-administration. Note that the lowest diagnostic dose has not been thoroughly investigated for many indications or all the low-risk GBCAs and therefore, caution should be exercised so as not to administer a dose that is too low to provide the diagnostic information sought from the examination.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 5. What to Do After the MRI Examination</emphasis></para>
    <para>The GBCA and dose used should be accurately recorded. Patients at risk of NSF should be followed up for at least twelve months following the contrast-enhanced MRI examination in order to detect any sign or symptom suggestive of the disease. It is recommended to notify the local regulatory authorities immediately of any putative case of NSF and to keep them informed until the diagnosis of NSF is confirmed or ruled out.</para>
    <para>The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown. However, it is recommended that elective GBCA-enhanced MRI examinations be performed as closely before hemodialysis as is possible, as prompt postprocedural hemodialysis, although unproven to date, may reduce the likelihood that NSF will develop (3). Because it may be difficult for a dialysis center to alter dialysis schedules at the request of imaging departments, it may be more feasible for elective imaging studies to be timed to precede a scheduled dialysis session. Some experts recommend multiple dialysis sessions following GBCA administration, with use of prolonged dialysis times and increased flow rates and volumes to facilitate GBCA clearance, but the incremental benefits remain speculative (3). It has been estimated that three consecutive hemodialysis treatments over a six-day period would be needed to remove 97% of the administered extracellular GBCA (36). Peritoneal dialysis probably provides less potential NSF risk reduction compared to hemodialysis and should not be considered protective (4).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis></para>
    <para>NSF is a rare, serious, systemic, fibrosing disorder observed almost only in patients with acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (GFR &lt;30-mL/min/1.73-m<superscript>2</superscript>), or with acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to hepatorenal syndrome, or in the perioperative liver transplantation period. Most patients with NSF had a GFR &lt;15- mL/min/1.73-m<superscript>2</superscript> and were undergoing (or had undergone) either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or both.</para>
    <para>It is unclear if GBCAs can trigger NSF. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to assume that a potential association might exist for all GBCAs. Use of the preventive measures discussed in this chapter may minimize the risk of developing NSF.</para>
    <para>Notably, altered patterns of use of GBCAs in susceptible populations in response to restrictive measures taken by regulatory authorities for some GBCAs and guidelines released</para>
    <para>by professional societies to minimize risk have resulted in the incidence of NSF dropping close to zero (5, 18, 24).</para>
