          <title>INTRODUCTION: MAIN SOURCES OF RISK IN MRI</title>
          <para>The Standard Model of physics requires 61 fundamental particles to describe the world we live in: 24 for matter and for antimatter, and 13 for interactions between them. Thankfully this chapter is mostly about just one, the electron. Some of the fundamental particles truly have superhero powers: Neutrinos can fly through the Earth as if it were not even there; about 65 billion solar neutrinos do so every second for every square centimeter of Earth's surface facing the Sun. The Higgs boson can give mass and inertia to objects. Quarks and anti-quarks can mix and match into hundreds of wildly different composite particles, some as mundane as neutrons and protons and others as exotic as pentaquarks or Upsilon mesons. Fortunately, this chapter is only about electrons.</para>
          <para>A magnetic resonance MR system or scanner in operation can be thought of as a dance of electrons. A torrent of them goes around and around in the coils of the main magnet, while jets of them streak back and forth in the wires that form the gradient and radiofrequency (RF) coils. Each electron generates a field around itself, to inform the Universe about how everything with electrical charge should get attracted or repelled by it. When an electron moves, it sends a new field, an updated version of the old one. These updates travel outward at the speed of light, broadcasting an electromagnetic wave. As electrons dance, they coax nuclear spins into a dance of their own and the MRI signal is created. This chapter is about this dance of electrons and how individuals may be injured when it goes wrong.</para>

            <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     35</title>
            <para>As the term "magnetic" in the name announces, an MR system is very much about magnetism, and fields generated by electrons flowing in three main types of coils are involved in creating images. First, there is the so-called "main magnet", which produces the large static magnetic field. This is most often a superconducting electromagnet but it could also be a permanent magnet. Added to this are coils to generate the radiofrequency electromagnetic field, referred to as "RF coils". Lastly, the "gradient coils" are responsible for creating linearly-varying magnetic fields, for spatial encoding purposes. While these coils and the manner in which the fields they generate interact with matter can lead to useful images, they can also cause serious threats to human subjects (1-11).</para>
            <para>The main risks associated with MRI have been extensively reported and studied. For example, everyday objects may turn into projectiles, RF energy deposition can cause burns, time-varying gradient magnetic fields can induce nerve stimulation and loud noises can lead to auditory loss. These various risks are associated with the three types of coils discussed above: main magnet, RF coils, and gradient coils, and will be discussed in turn, below. A number of reviews and exposés on related topics can be recommended as supplemental reading (12-23). For those who wish to go even deeper into the physics, excellent basic textbooks exist on electromagnetism (24, 25) and the magnetic properties of materials (26). Good intuition on the interactions between electromagnetic fields and materials can be obtained through numerical simulation of Maxwell's equations (27), the fundamental equations that govern these interactions. For this we recommend an excellent textbook by Elsherbeni and Demir (28) that comes complete with well-documented Matlab code.</para>
            <para>The present chapter is focused toward providing intuition about the physical mechanisms that give rise to MRI-related risks. In the process, several equations will be presented, including the Lorentz force equation and two of Maxwell's equations that provide the mathematical basis for the physical interactions considered. All others, along with their application in several detailed sample calculations, are meant to assist the reader gain intuition about these interactions, in particular, with respect to size and degree. How strong is the magnetic force? How much will the RF field heat the tissues? How much current will be induced in a conductor? In this chapter, we intend to provide an understanding of the degree to which a particular interaction might represent a hazard, and in this sense, we hope that this information will be useful to the reader.</para>

          <title>RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAIN MAGNET</title>
          <para>The main magnet of a commercial MRI system is the most distinguishing feature of the device, and also the greatest source of risk. The field it generates, approximately 1.5 to 3.0 Tesla (T) for the most widely used high field strength scanners, is much stronger than magnetic fields casually encountered in everyday life. For example, it is roughly 30,000 to 60,000 times stronger than the earth's magnetic field at the surface and is roughly 300 to 600 times greater than the field of a common refrigerator magnet. While the universe can certainly create much stronger magnets (e.g., the field generated by some neutron stars may reach 100 billion Tesla), the magnets used for MRI are among the strongest that exist on Earth. Because MRI involves field strengths much higher than the typical everyday experience, regular objects may behave in a non-intuitive manner near scanners. How objects behave in such conditions greatly depends on what they are made of, and for this reason we will</para>
