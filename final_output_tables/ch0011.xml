    <para>INTRODUCTION</para>
    <para>Medical imaging remains a common requirement in pregnant patients. Because of the increased scrutiny for possible radiation effects associated with pregnancy (1-4), it is not surprising that the question of whether a patient should undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination during pregnancy frequently arises. While a 1988 survey by Kanal, et al. (5) showed that 36% of sites did not perform MRI procedures in pregnant patients, a subsequent publication by De Wilde, et al. (6) indicated that 91% of 352 MRI facilities in the United Kingdom performed MRI examinations in second and third trimester patients, and 8% had protocols for selective fetal imaging (6). Of further note is that Kwan, et al. (7) reported that "magnetic resonance imaging rates increased steadily from 1.0/1,000 pregnancies in 1996 to 11.9/1,000 pregnancies in 2016 in the United States and from 0.5/1,000 pregnancies in 1996 to 9.8/1,000 pregnancies in 2016 in Ontario, surpassing CT rates in 2013 in the United States and in 2007 in Ontario."</para>
    <para>Although advice from regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is limited, the International Society for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (ISMRM), the American College of Radiology (ACR), and other organizations have provided useful clarifications, as follows (8-13):</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>1989, FDA: "The safety of MRI when used to image fetuses and infants has not been established" (8).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>1991, Safety Committee for the Society of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (SMRI): "MR imaging may be used in pregnant women if other non-ionizing forms of diagnostic imaging are inadequate or if the examination provides important information that would otherwise require exposure to ionizing radiation" (9).</para>

    </itemizedlist>
    <para>tant information that would otherwise require exposure to ionizing radiation...", and there is "... no indication that the use of clinical MR imaging during pregnancy has produced deleterious effects" (9). This policy adopted by the American College of Radiology was considered a "standard of care" with reference to pregnant patients (10).</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>2002, the American College of Radiology (ACR) White Paper on MR Safety: "Pregnant patients can ... undergo MR scans at any stage of pregnancy if, in the determination of a Level Two MR Personnel–designated attending radiologist, the risk–benefit ratio to the patient warrants that the study be performed" (11).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>2007, the ACR Guidance Document for Safe MR Practices: "Present data have not conclusively documented any deleterious effects of MR imaging exposure on the developing fetus", and; "... no special consideration is recommended for the first, versus any other, trimester in pregnancy" (12). It is, therefore, "prudent" to document pregnancy and consult with the patient and her physician regarding the clinical urgency for immediate MRI versus waiting for MRI until after delivery.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>2013, the ACR updated the information for the use of MRI in pregnancy, as follows: "Present data have not conclusively documented any deleterious effects of MR imaging exposure on the developing fetus. Therefore, no special consideration is recommended for the first, versus any other, trimester in pregnancy. Nevertheless, as with all interventions during pregnancy, it is prudent to screen females of reproductive age for pregnancy before permitting them access to MR imaging environments. If pregnancy is established consideration should be given to reassessing the potential risks versus benefits of the pending study in determining whether the requested MR examination could safely wait to the end of the pregnancy before being performed.</para></listitem>

    <para>MRI exposes the patient and fetus to a powerful static magnetic field, rapidly changing, gradient magnetic fields, acoustic noise, and radiofrequency (RF) radiation. The effects of these electromagnetic fields on the human fetus are not easily determined. Consider the following:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>The strength of the static magnetic field is well known (e.g., 1.5-Tesla, 3-Tesla, etc.).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The gradient amplitude (e.g., 20-mT/m) and slew rate, dB/dt (i.e., 3-T/s) can be determined at the location of the fetus for a given pulse sequence.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>RF energy power deposition or the specific absorption rate (SAR) level (e.g., whole body averaged SAR, 2.0-W/kg with the MR system operating in the Normal Operating Mode) will vary considerably with the type of transmit RF coil that is used and system configuration, as well as the pulse sequences that are selected for the procedure. Popular sequences for fast fetal imaging, such as fast spin echo, employ multiple rapid RF pulses, and would be expected to deposit more RF energy compared to gradient echo techniques.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Using computer modeling, Murbach, et al. (15) described the potential risks associated with the use of two-port radiofrequency (RF) shimming when examining a pregnant woman at 3-T. They stated: "Although RF shimmed configurations may lower the local RF exposure for the mother, they can increase the thermal load on the fetus. In worst-case configurations, whole-body exposure and local peak temperatures-up to 40.8°C-are equal in fetus and mother". Of course, this finding has not been verified in human subjects undergoing MRI and there are well-known issues when using modeling to predict temperature elevations in patients in association with MRI.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>RF power deposition varies considerably with the body part undergoing MRI. While Schaefer (16) concluded that approximately 87% of the RF energy would likely be deposited in the outer 1/3 of the body (16), Hand, et al. (17) predicted that the fetus would be exposed to a peak of approximately 40 to 60% of the maternal peak value at 64-MHz (1.5-Tesla), increasing to approximately 50 to 70% at 128-MHz (3-Tesla). Thus, in most instances, the embryo or fetus would receive relatively small RF exposures (18-20).</para>

      <listitem><para>Heating is the only well-established mechanism for bioeffects related to RF energy (21). Interestingly, the fetus may be heat energy tolerant due to a large fetal surface area-to-volume ratio. In addition, amniotic fluid, with its relatively high heat capacity, would be expected to sufficiently absorb heat transferred by convection. Kikuchi, et al.
