        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is itself one of the best examples that electromagnetic fields interact with biological tissue, providing a wide variety of soft-tissue contrasts that can be generated by the subtle interplay between radiofrequency (RF) pulse amplitudes and timing. Unfortunately, RF energy not only subtly disturbs the Boltzmann equilibrium of the nuclear spins, it also produces heat as it drives rapid molecular reorientation in cells and induces currents in the human body. Strain and friction might not functionally impair cellular and enzymatic processes, but will definitely lead to dissipation and local, non-uniform tissue heating. Such thermal effects are used therapeutically to kill tumors (i.e., RF field-induced hyperthermia) and applied in the food processing industry to sterilize at relatively low temperatures (50 to 60°C).</para>
    <para>The aim of this chapter is to present an overview of experimental data and modeling studies for core and local tissue temperature rises in clinical MRI, which mostly operates at 1.5 T (64 MHz) or 3 T (128 MHz). Safe temperatures must be maintained at all times during the MRI examination. Health effects related to mild hyperthermia will be used to explain necessary restrictions for temperature increase and thermal dose, expressed as temperature exposure of tissue at cumulative equivalent minutes at 43°C (CEM43) (1), and the derived exposure limits for whole-body averaged and head RF power deposition, expressed as specific absorption rate (SAR in W/kg) in the MRI product safety standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 60601-2-33 (2). A simplified version of the applicable limits is shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Basic restrictions for temperature and thermal dose apply equally at ultra-high field MRI (7 T and higher), but SAR management requirements may be different due to the more localized exposure to RF energy from parallel-transmit arrays (3). Considerations related to partial-body and localized exposures using such arrays, and analyses of RF field-related implant heating are beyond the scope of this chapter.</para>

        <title>POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS FROM RF EXPOSURE</title>
    <para>Potential risks associated with exposure to RF fields are actively monitored by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) (4) and the International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety (ICES, part of IEEE) (5). After decades of research related to RF exposures in wireless communication, the general consensus of these scientific expert groups is that prevention of adverse health effects from exposure to RF fields can be based on avoidance of acute thermal effects (during or within minutes after exposure). It should be noted, however, that a few recent, well-designed studies comparing RF and non-RF field-induced hyperthermia in food safety (6) and humans (7) indicate that induced cross-membrane electric fields enhance thermal damage at moderately elevated temperatures.</para>
    <para>While the energy of RF photons is too low to dissociate chemical bonds, for example in DNA, coupling to vibrational modes in proteins may alter reaction kinetics. Reported proliferation effects in cell lines, in vitro and in animals, caused the International Agency of Research of Cancer (8) to classify RF radiation in 2011 as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2B). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed evidence for tumorigenesis and concluded that "a lack of clear dose response relationship, a lack of consistent findings or specificity, and a lack of biological mechanistic plausibility" (9).

        <title>Thermal Effects Associated with RF Exposures During Clinical MRI</title>
    <para>ditional studies published in 2018 by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) and from Italy (10) indicated that the risk may increase in laboratory animals as a result of prolonged exposure at high SAR levels. Potential biochemical mechanisms relate to thermal vulnerability of routine DNA repair pathways: exposure to heat (stress) leads to accumulation of DNA double-strand break (DSB) recognition proteins such as γH2AX and micronucleation (11) and references cited therein (12, 13). The latter paper shows that heat stress affects the DNA integrity in a cell cycle phase-dependent manner (i.e., DSBs in G1/G2 phase) and stalling DNA replication forks in synthesis (S) phase (14). Additionally, Takahashi A. et al. (15) reported that γH2AX foci formation is rapid and shows similar Arrhenius kinetics as cell killing by temperature.</para>
    <para>Notably, no epidemiological indications exist from over 35 years of the use of MRI, with more than 150 million examinations being performed annually, to suggest an increased cancer incidence. Alleged excess DNA damage caused by MRI was excluded in a well-designed study (16). Similarly, no oncological concerns are known for the (local) thermal burden in diagnostic ultrasound (17-20), taking into account that clinical practice guidelines nevertheless strongly recommend "as low as reasonably possible" thermal exposure levels. Exposure to RF fields during MRI examinations can also lead to substantial thermal load, and only slightly-higher power levels are used in RF field-induced hyperthermia or focused ultrasound to ablate tumors (1, 21).</para>

          <title>Thermal Thresholds and Basic Restrictions</title>
    <para>The recent update of RF exposure guidelines by ICNIRP (4) defines the concepts for establishing exposure restrictions to prevent harmful effects to human health. This committee has performed an extensive literature review (see Appendix B of their guidelines) to identify substantiated effects with adequate scientific evidence. This includes independent reproduction of reported effects and adequate study design and dosimetry, but allows for inclusion of known biological mechanisms from which adverse effects can reasonably be hypothesized. A relevant discussion topic, which has not been closed to satisfaction, is whether excessive sweating and strong recruitment of thermoregulation would constitute adverse health effects, at least in some groups of human subjects. For now, it is assumed that this is not the case.</para>
    <para>Thresholds for health effects were determined from the RF field exposure literature or from other sources (e.g., burns, hyperthermia, etc.). The latter are called "operational thresholds". The ICNIRP applies reduction factors to derive the restriction values. These reduction factors are chosen to account for biological variation, variation of the baseline physiological and environmental conditions, and dosimetric uncertainty. The threshold value combined with the reduction factor results in the "basic restrictions". Relative to earlier publications, three notable changes were introduced in the 2020 Guidelines:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>The averaging time for whole-body averaged SAR (4 W/kg) has been increased from 6 minutes to 30 minutes, which is the assumed time to reach steady-state temperature in the adult. For reference, metabolic rates are approximately 1 W/kg at rest (22), 2 W/kg standing, and 12 W/kg when running (23, 24). Note that the local SAR averaging time is retained at 6 minutes, based on numerical simulations in the GHz range (25). The basic restrictions also remain unchanged at 10 W/kg and 20 W/kg for 10 gram averaged local</para>

The newly introduced formula leads to (not explicitly disclosed) allowance for short-term high local SAR. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> provides an overview of the time dependence of this restriction, where the exposure of groups of pulses must satisfy the restrictions at all time scales.</para>
    <para>The ICNIRP's methodological approach provides a concise overview of the available evidence for health effects to identify adverse health effects and their thresholds. A similarly structured review concerning thermal effects associated with RF exposures in diagnostic MRI is available in (27). In clinical settings, a benefit to risk assessment may justify application of higher exposure levels than those applicable in daily life. IEC 60601-2-33 therefore adopted local SAR restrictions of 20 W/kg and 40 W/kg for 10 gram (10g) averaged local SAR in head/torso and limb, respectively. Extensive simulations have since been performed</para>

    <para>(28-32) to evaluate if higher allowed exposures can be justified based on CEM43 analyses and their allowable safe values (20, 33).</para>
    <para>No thermal risk is assumed to result if the Basic Safety Restriction for thermal dose is set to the lowest CEM43 level, at which no apoptotic (i.e., the process of programmed cell death) effects have been reported. The diagnostic ultrasound community has evaluated the usefulness of CEM43 to provide user feedback on potential thermal risks (17, 18) and has established that 1 CEM43 is a conservative safety threshold for fetal, neonatal and adult exposure (19, 20). Higher thresholds have been proposed for MRI (33), taking into consideration the type of tissue and patient's health status, with 2 CEM43 proposed as a conservative safety threshold for MRI examinations under all conditions. In addition to this proposal, higher allowable local SAR values have been proposed based on a limited set of RF field-induced hyperthermia exposures and reported complaints (34).</para>
    <para>Derivation of temperature-based local SAR limits needs to account for whole-body averaged RF deposition, equilibration of core temperature towards the legs, thermoregulatory responses and capabilities, and patient variability. Temperature effects from MRI exposures were established in the late 1980s using animal and human volunteer experiments (35), and thermophysiological modeling. The allowed maximum temperature increases postulated by the ICNIRP include such global and systemic effects, but (reversely) cannot be directly related to the temperature increase from the local SAR, alone: especially in whole-body averaged MRI, effects of the whole-body averaged specific absorption must be included when controlling RF power deposition.</para>
    <para>This chapter will first addresses the available systemic temperature data from MRI exposures, both experimental and simulated. It then presents an analysis of health effects to determine thermal thresholds, corroborating those presented by the ICNIRP. The potential role of CEM43 as a control measure will also be discussed in relation to local SAR simulations and their accuracy, reproducibility and representativeness.</para>

          <title>TEMPERATURE DATA FROM MRI EXPOSURES: SYSTEMIC BURDEN</title>
    <para>MR systems intentionally expose patients to high RF power, generally for a single episode (examination) of short duration, typically less than one hour. RF deposition is expressed as SAR in W/kg and accumulated as specific absorption in J/kg. First generation MR scanners operated at relatively low SARs and initially exposed the head with local transmit RF coils. Such exposures are nowadays common for 7 T MR systems (localized, small coverage transmit RF coils) and deposit relatively little energy in the body of adult patients. With the advent of whole-body averaged transmit (quadrature birdcage) RF coils for 1.5 T systems, increases in SAR levels to 2 to 4 W/kg were deemed necessary to ensure adequate image quality and scan efficiency for spine and body imaging, with total exposure durations of 20 to 40 minutes. In current clinical practice, even longer examinations with continuous high-SAR scanning are not uncommon.</para>
    <para>The generally-accepted upper limit to the whole-body averaged SAR is 4 W/kg (36), established from observed behavioral changes in animal studies. Such exposures are reported to induce strong heat sensations in healthy human subjects. A reduced whole-body</para>
    <para>averaged SAR of 2 W/kg already falls within the normal temperature variation due to metabolic activity and exercise: the average metabolic rate, as a conversion of chemical into mechanical and thermal energy in the human body, is estimated to be 80 W at rest and 270 W for moderate physical activity (24). Thus, 2 W/kg for a 100 kg person represents a situation of homeostasis without undue stress, and is chosen as an acceptable exposure for the Normal Operating Mode for MR systems, which all individuals, regardless of health status, should be able to tolerate.</para>
    <para>Several investigations have evaluated the physiological implications of such exposures on healthy volunteers and patients, studying heart rate, blood pressure, sweating and skin or core temperature. Profound sweating and mild cardiovascular challenge at a higher SA have not been considered a potential reason for concern. <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> provides an overview of identified reports of temperature increase related to MRI exposures, including an example</para>

        <title>Thermal Effects Associated with RF Exposures During Clinical MRI</title>
    <para>of a large whole-body averaged study on RF field-induced hyperthermia. Unfortunately, most identified studies lack appropriate dosimetric information to confirm SAR and SA values. This may explain the anomaly of the reported mean temperature increase in (37), although measurement approach and volunteer characteristics may explain a low core temperature increase. Notably, however, a recent investigation of 15 volunteers in an MRI setup without RF exposure showed (repeatable) increasing and decreasing temperatures (ranging from +0.5 °C to −0.5 °C; Nicolas Boulant, Caroline Le Ster and Alexandre Vignaud, <emphasis role="italics">private communication</emphasis>). This casts additional doubt on the quality of the data used as reference for the core temperature predictions as discussed in the next section. The high temperature increase reported by Wust, et al. (38) indicates that patients may experience a higher core temperature elevation than normal volunteers. A confounding factor may be that thermal insulation is applied in the hyperthermia setup and, thus, thermoregulation may be compromised while high SAR levels are applied. In previous assessments, reported mean core temperature increases were used to argue that effects are marginal. A more appropriate parameter to consider when establishing exposure limit values is the maximum reported core temperature increase, for which esophageal measurements are the most accurate, but tympanic membrane temperatures can also provide representative data (39-44).</para>
    <para>Total energy absorbed, or SA, provides an easy estimate for systemic thermal burden. Actual temperatures reached depend on many factors such as initial temperature distribution in the body, thermoregulatory capability, and dissipation options (clothing and blankets), see (44) and the section in this chapter discussing core temperature predictions from simulation models. An additional confounding factor not accounted for in these studies is the psychological response to the MRI exposure: are people feeling at rest or stressed? A careful analysis of sham exposure has also not been performed but recent data suggests significant inter-subject variability. Irrespectively, the data suggests that an SA of approximately 4 kJ/kg is sufficient to raise core temperature by 1 °C, which corresponds to a continuous high whole-body averaged SAR (&gt; 3 W/kg) applied for 15 to 20 minutes.</para>
    <para>Predicted SA values in the tens of millions of MRI examinations performed annually can be assessed from scanner utilization data. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> shows a representative distribution obtained from 367,000 examinations at 1.5 T systems. Resulting core temperature values of examinations with (predicted) SA values &gt; 7 kJ/kg are not known, and will depend on the length of the examination (long term RF duty cycle) and the thermoregulatory and heat loss capabilities of the patient. In general, high SA levels can be expected, and have been reported as being uncomfortable, and MRI scanner manufacturers recommend not to exceed the value of 7 kJ/kg unless a clinical benefit-risk assessment is made and patient surveillance is in place. On the other hand, no evidence exists that the 0.01% of examinations with SA &gt; 10 kJ/kg correlate significantly with adverse events. The lack of large-scale data for core temperature increase in patients associated with MRI examinations warrants additional and well-controlled measurements in routine clinical settings. Such data should include tympanic membrane (pre and post) temperature, patient weight, gender, age, body part examined, ambient temperature, and appropriate dosimetry for SA and SAR values. Beyond core temperature, several studies report rapidly-developing profound sweating, whereas heart rate and blood pressure effects were generally negligible (45, 46). Significant but highly variable skin temperature increases have also been reported (37, 46-50) (<emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>), but that data is not considered to constitute an indicator of potential health concerns.</para>

        <title>Core Temperature Predictions</title>
    <para>Thermophysiological models can be used to estimate RF-induced core temperature increase as function of SAR and exposure duration. Heat accumulation in the human body mostly depends on ambient temperature and insulation (clothing), as well as thermoregulatory capabilities. In their pioneering work, Adair and Berglund (48, 49, 51) used a two-node model (70 kg man) based on the Stolwijk approach to evaluate core temperature increase as a function of whole-body averaged SAR, skin blood flow impairment, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and insulation. Predicted core temperature increases correlate well with experimental data, and a sensitivity analysis provided strong indications that the ambient temperature should not exceed 21°C, air humidity should be kept around 50%, and only light clothing can be tolerated (i.e., avoid the use of blankets). Under these circumstances, and limiting SA to 10 kJ/kg, moderate cardiovascular impairment effects will not seriously enhance core temperature elevations to levels &gt; 1°C. Adair and Berglund also recommended keeping the SAR to &lt; 3 W/kg, and to limit examination time to 20 min. Their modeling showed that cool down and recovery time is at least 30 minutes under optimal patient health conditions.</para>

          <title>262    Thermal Effects Associated with RF Exposures During Clinical MRI</title>
    <para>The Stolwijk approach used by Adair and Berglund has been superseded by advanced multi-node human models in the context of heat exposure in buildings, cars, and under (occupational) activity (52, 53). Application of such advanced models to the context of MRI (i.e., the supine patient in an enclosed space) may be of future interest, once more experimental data is available for core temperature and dosimetry over a large number of patients, including analysis of sham exposures.</para>
    <para>In the current situation, the rationale for exposure limits and guidance relies on the Adair and Berglund model. This can be done with confidence, since more recent and more detailed RF exposure modeling studies have confirmed their thermal predictions (54-59). These studies indicated that the effect of aging requires additional conservativeness when establishing exposure limits, but pediatric exposure is of lesser concern. Children have a greater surface-to-volume ratio than adults, and can tolerate approximately 30% higher whole-body averaged SAR than adults for the same core temperature increase (60).</para>
    <para>A simplified parametric approach is suggested by Adair, et al. (48) to enable a sensitivity analysis of core temperature increase as a function of SAR, skin blood flow impairment, clothing/insulation, ambient temperature and air humidity. Temperature rise correlates with total deposited energy (SAR) and restriction of the allowable SAR value was suggested by Barber, et al. (61). Some scenarios of this linearized parametric approach are provided in Figure 3 to illustrate the relative importance of the model parameters. For further detailed analyses, refer to the work by Adair, et al. (48-49). Notably, the effect of room humidity is not a major</para>
  <para><emphasis role="bold">Figures 3a (left) and 3b (right).</emphasis> Estimated core temperature increase for a 70kg human using the simplified assessment proposed by Adair, et al. (49) to demonstrate sensitivity on several model parameters. The grey and black lines in (a) show the significant dependence on room temperature (solid lines), clothing (dotted versus solid lines), and the thermoregulatory health of the patient. These predictions are at relatively high room temperature but with the MR system operating in the Normal Operating Mode. The light-grey and mid-grey lines in (b) were derived at the upper limit of the First Level Controlled Operating Mode (continuous 4 W/kg) but at lower ambient temperatures than those used in (a). No data is shown for thermoregulatory impaired patients, which should never be exposed to high SAR values. Light clothing is a determining factor for managing core temperature. Room humidity is a less important parameter to control, even at high RF power deposition (4 W/kg).</para>
    <para>factor in addressing systemic heat load concerns whereas room temperature must be kept low, especially when the MR scanner operates in the First Level Controlled Operating Mode (whole-body averaged SARs between 2 and 4 W/kg). Covering blankets should be avoided, but patients may come into the MR system room feeling cold. A good recommendation may be to take away any blankets after 10 to 15 minutes of scanning or when the SA level reaches 2 to 3 kJ/kg.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis> analyzes thermal effects for several scan room conditions, clothing, and selected SAR level. Thermal insulation that is comfortable for an individual at rest, where the relative humidity is &lt; 50% and the air movement is 6 m/min, is equal to one clo unit (1.0 clo). Colloquially, this equates to a man wearing a three-piece suit with light underclothes (62). Several representative exposure scenarios are provided for unimpaired (a) and severely impaired (b) skin blood flow. Three SA levels are evaluated to estimate core temperature rise (100 W.min/kg = 6 kJ/kg and 200 W.min/kg = 12 kJ/kg). Individual lines represent:</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 4a.</emphasis> Estimated core temperature increase for a 70kg human with normal thermoregulation from Adair, et al. (49), at different environmental conditions, and for three levels of Specific Absorption (SA) (100 and 200 W.min/kg), up to an SAR level of 4 W/kg. Each graph represents an iso-SA line, and the corresponding SA value (e.g., 200 W.min/kg for the lowest dashed blue line) divided by the scan or examination duration provides the whole-body average SAR. For example, a duration of 50 min and SA = 100 W.min/kg correspond to an average SAR of 2 W/kg and a predicted core temperature rise of approx. 0.3°C. Similarly, a duration of 25 min on the same line corresponds to an average SAR of 4 W/kg and a predicted temperature increase of 0.7°C. Notably, the predictions for SA of 100 W.min/kg correspond reasonably well with the data in <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> (estimated 1 clo, room temperature not specified but likely close to 23°C).</para>
