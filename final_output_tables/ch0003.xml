      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most flexible tools in diagnostic im- aging as well as a highly active field of medical and methodological research (1). In 2015,  approximately 37.8 million MRI examinations were performed in the United States (U.S.)  alone, with an annual growth rate of around 4% since 2011 (2). However, despite many ad- vances in technology in recent decades, the low sensitivity of MRI remains a limiting factor.  Noise in the MRI measurement is not only determined by the underlying hardware, but pre- dominantly by the body to be examined. Consequently, a stronger spin polarization of the  body is pursued by using stronger static magnetic fields (B0). While early work demon- strated that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases linearly with B0, at ultra-high fields  (UHF) above 3 T the complete Maxwell equations must be considered, which leads to a  more than linear increase in SNR with field strength. Pohmann, et al. (3) experimentally  described a supralinear increase (SNR ~ B0 1.65) between 3 and 9.4 T. In a numerical simu- lation study, Guerin, et al. (4) found a field-strength dependence that varies with the position  within the sample. For voxels near the surface of the sample, the SNR increases roughly  linearly, while for deeper-lying voxels, the increase can even be quadratic. Since the rela- tionship between SNR and B0 applies not only to the hydrogen nuclei, but also to all “MR-</para>

These so-called X-nuclei are used in UHF MRI to gain new  insights into pathophysiological processes (5). Furthermore, the SNR increase is also de- pendent on the parallel imaging acceleration factor. The advantage of higher field strengths  is larger at higher acceleration factors compared to non-accelerated imaging (4).</para>
      <para>With the introduction of the first 3 T MR systems at the end of the 1990s, this magnetic  field strength was regarded as high field, whereby at the turn of the millennium 7 T started  to claim the UHF regime. In the meantime, there are research devices with even higher  magnetic field strengths. In addition to 9.4 T devices in Tübingen, Germany and Maastricht,  the Netherlands, there is already a 10.5 T whole-body MR system in operation at the Uni- versity of Minnesota. A 130-ton 11.7 T whole-body magnet was delivered to the NeuroSpin  Research Center in Paris-Saclay, France in May 2017. Another 11.7 T magnet, in this case  a smaller diameter head-only system, is currently being installed at the National Institutes  of Health in the U.S.. Furthermore, there are efforts to increase the limit of the magnetic  field strength for human use to 14 T or even 20 T in the U.S., Korea, and Europe (6, 7).  However, to date, most of the approximately 80 UHF MR systems worldwide operate at  7 T. Of these systems, the majority are first- and second-generation 7 T scanners for inves- tigational use only. Since 2017, the latest (third) generation of 7 T MR systems have been  approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as medical devices for diagnostic  imaging of the head, legs, and arms (8). The reason for these anatomical restrictions is due  to the unsolved physical challenges at UHF, which have been expertly summarized in sev- eral review articles (1, 5). The following sections will provide a brief overview of the dif- ferences between 3 T and 7 T scanners, as well as on the technical demands and safety  aspects at UHF.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Challenges </emphasis></para>
      <para>A prerequisite for a diagnostically useful MR image is good image quality, which re- quires homogeneous contrast throughout the imaging volume. At 1.5 or 3 T, a transmit ra- diofrequency (RF) body coil integrated in the scanner is typically used to provide  homogeneous excitation of the spins within the sample volume. A homogeneous RF trans- mission field, B1 +, guarantees that the contrast in the image is only determined by the tissue  properties and does not depend on the B1 + field distribution of the RF transmission coil.  When moving from 1.5 to 3 T, the Larmor resonance frequency increases from 64 MHz to  128 MHz. At the same time, the wavelength of the transmit RF field in tissue decreases  from approximately 52 cm at 1.5 T to about 11 cm at 7 T. Constructive and destructive in- terference of the RF waves can occur as soon as the dimensions of the imaging sample are  no longer negligible relative to the wavelength. While such B1 + inhomogeneities occur in  the abdomen at 3 T, a central brightening and associated inhomogeneities are already ob- served in the head at 7 T (9). In addition to the field strength dependence of the Larmor fre- quency, the distribution of different tissue types (fat, muscle, fluids) and their  frequency-dependent dielectric properties (conductivity, permittivity) determine how strong  the artifacts due to RF inhomogeneities are pronounced.</para>

      <para>When exposed to RF fields, energy is absorbed in the lossy human body tissue, which  can lead to tissue heating. The amount of energy deposition is expressed by the specific ab- sorption rate (SAR) in units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). Especially at UHF, it is much  more likely that foci of RF heating will occur due to the shorter wavelength, representing  a significant restriction for many pulse sequences, particularly those relying on large flip  angles. In addition, RF coil design and transmit RF strategies in general trying to homoge- nize the B1 + field must also be optimized for a low SAR load.</para>
      <para>The third key challenge of UHF MRI refers to the topic of implant safety, which will  be discussed in other chapters in this textbook. Both for a clinically indicated MRI scan  and for a research study, the user is often confronted with the issue of implant safety since  few biomedical implants have been evaluated for exposure to 7 T MRI.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Differences Between 3 T and 7 T </emphasis></para>
      <para>Similar to 1.5 or 3 T, a UHF MR system comprises three main components. A super- conducting magnet generates a homogeneous static magnetic field for spin polarization.  During imaging, radio waves are switched for spin excitation via a transmit RF coil. For  spatial encoding, a set of gradient coils generates magnetic gradient fields, which are  switched in the kHz range. The amendment of the International Electrotechnical Commis- sion (IEC) standard 60601-2-33 from 2015 increased the First Level Operating Mode limit  for the static magnetic field of the MR system from 4 T to 8 T (10). This is in line with the  FDA declaration from 2003 that MRI up to 8 T constitutes a non-significant risk for adults,  children, and infants of 1 month and older (11). Similarly, a report from the International  Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) from 2009 (12) as well as  other peer-reviewed scientific literature indicated no serious health effects resulting from  acute exposure to static magnetic fields up to 8 T (13-15). Safety aspects at UHF have been  expertly summarized in several review articles (1, 16, 17) and will be discussed in detail in  a dedicated section of this chapter.</para>

      <para>There are currently five different 7 T magnets for human MRI applications. The first  magnet generation consisted of whole-body systems with passive shielding by installing  approximately 400 tons of steel in the MR system room. In the second generation, after the  year 2010, actively shielded magnets were introduced, both as whole-body and as head- only systems. All three magnet types were built by Magnex Scientific (now Agilent Tech- nologies LDA, UK), but are no longer manufactured or offered. Since 2017, Siemens  Healthcare has been offering a new, actively-shielded 7 T whole-body magnet from its own  production, which is also part of the medical device MAGNETOM Terra (Siemens Health- care GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) (18). In addition, the British magnet manufacturer Tesla  Engineering Ltd. has announced to provide a 7 T whole-body MR system together with GE  Healthcare in the future (19).</para>
      <para>From a safety consideration, the attractive force on magnetizable objects is the number  one risk factor in the MRI environment. The force on a paramagnetic or (non-saturated)  ferromagnetic device is a product of magnetic field (B0) and spatial gradient magnetic field  (dB0 / dx). The type of magnet shielding has an influence on the spatial magnetic field gra-</para>

      <para>dients, which are much steeper with active shielding than with passive shielding of the mag- net. Similarly, a more compact design of the magnet affects the magnetic fringe field. <emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">1</emphasis> shows a schematic comparison of different magnet types. It can be seen that the distribu- tion of the spatial gradient magnetic field of an actively-shielded 3 T magnet is very similar  to that of a passively-shielded 7 T magnet. With actively-shielded 7 T magnets, slightly  higher spatial magnetic field gradients occur with 5 to 10 T/m compared to passively- shielded 7 T or actively-shielded 3 T magnets (3 to 7 T/m). Overall, the attractive force at  7 T can be up to 2.3 times stronger than at 3 T. Since for “MR Safe” and “3 T MR Condi- tional” certified implants the maximum allowable forces tends to be less than the gravita- tional force, at least slightly paramagnetic objects made of titanium or aluminum will,  therefore, not experience significant translational deflections or force even at 7 T. However,  the true problem lies in the description of the implant information in accordance with the  applicable ASTM International standard F2503 (20). As already described by Kanal, et al.  (21) the implant labeling information does not specify the measured deflection angle. Con- sequently, one does not know if at 3 T a deflection angle just below the maximum allowed  angle of 45° (say, 44˚) was measured, or a much lower (i.e., 2˚), which even with appropriate  scaling to the exposure at 7 T would still be below 45°.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Gradient Coils </emphasis></para>
      <para>The gradient coils used in 7 T and UHF systems are not different from those of current  1.5 T or 3 T MR scanners. For example, the gradient strength amounts to about 80 mT/m  with a slew rate of 200 T/m/s. The risk of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in the patient  or subject due to gradient switching, thus, remains the same across static magnetic field  strengths. In large metallic implants, especially those that form closed loops, the rapidly  switched gradient fields can induce electric fields and, thus, eddy currents. In various stud-</para>

      <para>ies, gradient-induced heating of the implant and, hence, of the surrounding tissue, has been  reported as an often disregarded safety concern with larger implants, such as total hip pros- theses (22). However, as in the case of PNS, the risk would not increase with increasing  static magnetic field strengths. It rather depends on the pulse sequence and the performance  and design of the gradient coil, only. On the other hand, it should be noted that Lorentz  forces might act on the implant via the induced currents in the static magnetic field, which  can then put the implant into rapid vibration, which may be an unpleasant or disconcerting  sensation for the patient. The Lorentz forces and magnitude of the vibration would be larger  at 7 T due to the higher static magnetic field compared to 3 T. Similarly, currents in the gra- dient coils impose Lorentz forces, which lead to physical vibrations of the magnet structure  of the MR system and, thus, cause acoustic noise. In theory, one would expect higher  acoustic noise levels for higher static magnetic fields. However, with improved insulation  against sound and vibration, sound pressure levels in practice are only slightly higher at 7 T  compared to 3 T.</para>

      <para>While 1.5 or 3 T MR systems nearly exclusively use an transmit RF birdcage (BC) coil  integrated in the scanner for spin excitation and additional sets of local RF receive coils for  reception, UHF systems use local RF coils only, which therefore must have both transmit  RF and receive capabilities. The reason is that the B1 + inhomogeneities at 7 T due to reduced  RF excitation wavelength are so severe in the body (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>), that a standard volume body  coil with only one transmit RF channel does not make sense at 7 T and, therefore, it is not  integrated in current UHF MR systems. Compared to 1.5 T and 3 T where RF coils only  need to provide RF receive capabilites, the availability of commercially available  transmit/receive RF coils at 7 T is rather small. The major manufacturers offer local transmit  RF/receive coils for the head and extremities. Smaller spin-offs from universities provide  7 T RF arrays for body applications, but most 7 T transmit/receive RF coils remain custom- built prototypes developed at different institutions. A detailed overview of this topic can be  found in our 2019 publication (23). However, it must be noted that for clinical scanning at</para>

The most widely used 7 T RF coil is a 1-channel BC transmit / 32-channel receive head  coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA) (24), which is also approved for clinical use  on the new 7 T MR systems. Also approved for scans in the clinical mode of operation are  a dual-tuned 1-channel <superscript>1</superscript>H / <superscript>23</superscript>Na transmit / 32-channel <superscript>23</superscript>Na receive head coil (Rapid Bio- medical GmbH, Würzburg, Germany) and the transmit RF knee coil with integrated 28 re- ceive coils (Quality Electrodynamics, Mayfield Village, OH, USA) (25) shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">3</emphasis>. No other RF coil or multichannel excitation scenario can be used in the clinical setting.  Investigational RF coils are only permitted for use when scanning in the research mode on  the new 7 T MR systems.</para>
      <para>The research mode allows use of multi-channel transmit RF coil arrays that emit the  RF waves from several independent coil elements in parallel, similar to radar technology.  If one adjusts the amplitude and phase of the RF pulse at the individual spatially distributed  coil elements (or even varies the RF pulse itself), B1 + inhomogeneities can be successfully  reduced or shifted out of the field of view. Here, the number of coil elements (to be consid- ered as a number of setscrews) is crucial, so that most RF coils for UHF MRI provide at  least eight independent transmitting elements.

      <para>the pulses is referred to as RF shimming (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>) (26), and is analogous to shimming the  static magnetic field B0.</para>
      <para>A successful further development of RF shimming at 7 T is the so-called Time-Inter- leaved Acquisition of Modes or TIAMO technique (27, 28), in which two (or more) inher- ently inhomogeneous but orthogonal excitations are combined, so that in sum, a  homogeneous image is formed (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>). Due to the doubling of the measurement time  by playing two excitation modes, parallel imaging techniques should be used on the receive  side to keep the measurement time short. The advantage here is that the individual excitation  modes form virtual elements, which benefit parallel imaging accelerations.</para>
      <para>In addition to the aforementioned static RF shimming, where only the relative ampli- tudes and phases are varied, different RF pulse shapes can also be played out with each coil  element. This approach is called “parallel transmit” or transmit SENSE (“SENSitivity En- coding”) (29) and offers the possibility of realizing multidimensional RF pulses either for  homogenization of the excitation or for spatially selective excitation. However, these sys- tems are much more complex, not only due to the necessary synchronization of the RF, but  also in the RF monitoring to rule out excessive tissue heating. This method also heavily de- pends on the acquisition of B1 + maps of the entire 3D region with sufficient coverage, which  can be time-consuming (30). A recent study has investigated the use of “universal pulses”  for brain imaging that were designed based on the B1 + maps of a few subjects (31). Subse- quently, the universal pulses were successfully applied in more subjects without acquiring</para>

In RF shimming, a single RF pulse is modulated in amplitude and phase (A)  separately for each individual transmit RF coil channel (C). The pulse form, however, re- mains identical to all channels. In most cases, phase-only RF shimming is applied since  amplitude modulation, (i.e., attenuation) also results in a loss in transmit efficiency. For  full parallel transmit capability, multiple individual exciters are used (B). This allows the  use of different RF pulse forms for each transmit channel (C), which provides maximum  control of the resulting transmit field, but also increases the complexity of the system ar- chitecture.</para>

This approach has the high potential for clinical brain UHF im- aging because it substantially reduces the time for calibration, does not require online RF  pulse design, and allows a pre-calculation of the expected SAR load. However, for appli- cations in other, more challenging body parts, a successful demonstration of the technique  is pending.</para>
      <para>A simple and much cheaper way of B1 + field homogenization is dielectric shimming  (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>) (32, 33). With the help of pads containing a material of very high permittivity  (e.g., calcium or barium titanate) and deuterium oxide (D2O, with properties such as water,  but not visible in the MR image), the RF field distribution of a RF coil can be influenced  so that locally in the vicinity of the pads a higher B1 + field is present. Successful applications  have been found especially in studies of the cerebellum (33) and inner ear (34), as well as  for knee imaging at 7 T (35). On the other hand, proper placement of pads is important, and  different pad sizes (and fillings) are often needed to obtain an improvement in B1 +, making  the technique unsuitable for some applications (36). In addition, with regards to MRI safety,  it should be noted that dielectric pads influence the transmit RF field and, thus, may not be  allowed for scans in the clinical mode (37, 38).</para>

      <para>The relaxation times, T1 and T2, are a function of the strength of the static magnetic  field. As a general rule, when the field strength increases from 3 to 7 T, only a slight short- ening of the T2 relaxation times occurs, whereas the T1 relaxation time increases depending  on the tissue type. For example, the T1 of the gray matter increases from T1 = 1,197 ± 134  ms at 1.5 T, to 1,605 ± 112 ms at 3 T, and finally to 1,939 ± 149 ms at 7 T (39). Hence, to  obtain the same T1-weighted contrast at 1.5 T, the measurement time would have to be in-</para>

Note that the  areas of signal losses appear at different locations depending on the applied excitation  mode. Hence, by combining two orthogonal modes with the TIAMO technique (sum of  squares algorithm), a nearly homogeneous image can be obtained (C). Due to the differ- ent excitation modes, the receive profiles of each RF coil element will change, so that for  the combined TIAMO reconstruction, twice the number of physical receive RF coil ele- ments will be available as virtual elements. Thus, the two‐fold accelerated, parallel imag- ing encoding minimizes the scan time penalty and delivers only moderately less SNR  than a conventional acquisition with a single excitation mode and full encoding.</para>

In addition, standard multi-slice, turbo spin echo imaging (TSE), considered  the “workhorse” pulse sequence in 1.5 and 3 T clinical imaging protocols, is heavily im- paired by B1 + inhomogeneities and RF power deposition at 7 T. One way to address these  challenges is to replace standard TSE sequences by magnetization-prepared, rapid gradient  echo (MPRAGE) sequences that produce an excellent T1-weighted contrast and come with  a low SAR profile (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>). Optimized versions have been proposed with adiabatic pulses  for magnetization preparation to counteract caudal image contrast inversion and signal in- homogeneity (40), typically observed in head RF coils with limited efficiency in the z-di- rection. On the other hand, the extension of the T1 time of the stationary tissue leads to a  marked improvement in image quality, (e.g., in time-of-flight (TOF) angiographies), as the  background tissue is better suppressed during the entire measurement because of the lower  T1 relaxation at short repetition times (41).</para>

      <para>The relaxivity of contrast agents is field strength dependent. It is known that, at higher  field strengths, the relaxivity of gadolinium chelates increases. This leads to a relative signal  increase in T1-weighted sequences, which should at least theoretically lead to an improved  contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). However, these processes are not proportional to each other.  Basically, it can be assumed that the CNR between lesion and surrounding tissue improves  with appropriately optimized T1-weighted sequences. At the present time, however, there  is insufficient experience to generally recommend a reduction in contrast agent dose in UHF</para>

Typically, three thin  pads are used. Two pads are placed at either side of the subject’s head, while the third pad  is placed underneath the head in the RF coil. Notably, even a single pad placed under- neath the head can improve imaging of the cerebellum. In some subjects with large head  sizes, the relatively narrow RF head coil does not allow room to place additional pads.</para>

      <para>studies, which of course from a commercial point of view, as well as regarding current dis- cussions on gadolinium deposition in the brain and the risk factors for the development of  nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, are highly desirable (42). For this reason, the standard con- trast agent dose used at 1.5 T is still predominantly used at 7 T. However, studies have al- ready discussed the possibility of reducing the contrast agent dose down to the complete  omission of a contrast-enhanced MRA at 7 T (43). In the case of intracranial MR angiog- raphy, the inherently hyperintense arterial vascular signal in gradient echo pulse sequences  and excellent time-of-flight (TOF) MRA capabilities allow for a wider range of non-contrast  enhanced angiographic sequences at 7 T than at 1.5 T or 3 T (44, 45).</para>

      <para>With increasing field strength, MR imaging becomes much more prone to susceptibility  effects, which can cause substantial problems for example in the visualization of tissue near  air-filled areas such as the sinuses (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>) or intestines at UHF. A given susceptibility  difference causes larger magnetic field differences at 7 T than at 3 T or 1.5 T. The resulting  faster spin dephasing can be described as shortened T2* time. This is an advantage in the  visualization of venous architecture or microbleeds with SWI (susceptibility weighted im- aging) (46, 47), as well as for functional imaging (BOLD contrast) (48).</para>
      <para>The frequency difference between protons in water and in fat molecules is about 3.4  ppm of the resonance frequency. In absolute units, this is about 217 Hz at 1.5 T, and almost  five-fold at 7 T with it being1.01 kHz. For a fixed bandwidth of the pulse sequence, the  shift of the fat versus the water protons, and accordingly the chemical-shift artifact, is almost  five times as large. Such large water-fat shifts can significantly affect image quality. In ad- dition to increasing the bandwidth, which, however, causes a loss of SNR, the application</para>

Frequency-selective fat saturation techniques are of considerable importance in high-field  imaging but require good B0 field homogenization by powerful shimming techniques. They  have the disadvantage of increasing the RF heat input into the tissue through the additionally  required high-frequency pulses. In addition, these RF pulses prolong the overall acquisition  time.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Physiological Effects </emphasis></para>
      <para>Exposure to UHF MR systems obviously raises the concern of increased physiologic  effects since the interaction between biologic tissue (and fluids) and a strong magnetic field  will lead to Lorentz forces and induced currents in a human body. Although these effects  will be transient and are considered to be harmless, they can be perceived as unpleasant by  the subject. The Lorentz force on the ionic fluid inside the semicircular ducts, for example,  can lead to nystagmus and the mild perception of rotation, which may persist for a short  period even after the motion through the magnetic field has stopped (49). Vestibular acti- vation has been shown to last for at least 2:30 min after a half-an-hour exposure to 7 T (50).  A recent 10.5 T study showed significantly increased nystagmus at isocenter of the MR sys- tem (15).</para>
      <para>Similarly, the blood pressure might be elevated since the Lorentz force will lead to ad- ditional efforts to transport the electrically conductive blood through the static magnetic  field. However, a measured increase of only 3.6 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure at 8 T  (51), as well as findings of a recent animal study at 10.5 T, showing an average increase of  only 4.5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (52), are far below elevations produced by  changing postural position and, therefore, are not of clinical concern.</para>
      <para>Currents are induced in tissue when the human body moves through an inhomogeneous  magnetic field. These induced currents have been linked to the occurrence of magnetic  phosphenes and to unpleasant sensations of vertigo and nausea. This is the case for both, a  subject being brought into the scanner on the patient table, and for the MR system operator  who occasionally bends into the bore opening for cleaning purposes, to plug in RF coils, or  to set up auxiliary equipment like back-projection screens for visual stimulation in functional  MRI (fMRI) studies. Although physiologic effects are higher at UHF compared to lower  static magnetic fields, a multi-center study reported that only 0.9%, (i.e., 31/3,404)  participants said that they would not undergo a subsequent UHF MRI study for any reason  (14). In other words, 99% of all participants undergoing an UHF MRI study would be will- ing to undergo another UHF MRI study for research or clinical purposes. In more detail,  complained causes of discomfort in these studies were examination duration, followed by  acoustic noise and lying still, which are all not directly related to the exposure to a strong  static magnetic field. Regarding occupational exposure, in the European Union (EU), min- imum standards have been set for electromagnetic (em) exposure of workers across all eco- nomic sectors (53). Standards apply for time-varying RF fields over a large frequency range  applied during MR imaging, but also for the static magnetic field. Latter is not only the  most significant change at UHF, it is also the electromagnetic fields that all workers from  different divisions will be exposed to at the MR system, that is MRI technologists or radi- ographers, nurses supporting a patient, physicians, custodial personnel, service engineers,  and others. While 8 T is the limit for localized exposure of the extremities, exposure of the  head above 2 T should be avoided in workers. In the case of MRI-related work procedures,  the EU em field directive states a derogation rule that permits exceeding the limits, if par- ticular prerequisites are fulfilled. Hence, for the aforementioned tasks that require bending  into the bore opening of a UHF MR system, the limit of 2 T for normal working conditions</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Safety Aspects in Relation to the RF Field </emphasis></para>
      <para>In addition to the projectile effect, the interaction between the emitted transmit RF fields  and the human body poses the greatest security risk during an MRI exam. Since there is no  integrated standard transmit RF body coil incorporated into UHF MR systems, the variety  of local multi-channel transmit RF coils increases the complexity of this safety aspect sig- nificantly. During the RF exposure, energy is absorbed in lossy human body tissue causing  a heat deposition in the tissue. The degree of heat deposition is described by the associated  SAR in units of W/kg. The standard IEC 60601-2-33 sets different limits for a time-averaged  SAR in different body parts (10). The SAR limits are the same for all static magnetic field  strengths. With increasing excitation frequency, however, the SAR limits are more restricting  to pulse sequences and protocols, which require workarounds such as prolonging the repe- tition time, increasing the RF pulses in time, or reducing the flip angle. In contradiction to  the traditionally cited quadratic dependency of SAR with B0, studies have shown a flattening  of the SAR distribution, which adheres closely to a linear increase with magnetic field  strengths above 3 T (54, 55). In particular, this was shown in combination with parallel RF  transmission techniques (56). Furthermore, while global SAR values, (i.e., whole-body or  partial-body-averaged SAR), are mostly limiting for 1.5 T (64 MHz) and 3 T (128 MHz)  MR exams, the local SAR averaged over 10-grams of tissue mass is the most critical aspect  at higher excitation frequencies (7 T, 298 MHz). Hence, the safety supervision during 7 T  MRI examinations becomes more complex, especially for multichannel RF arrays. For par- allel RF transmission operation, SAR becomes a function of the complex RF voltages (am- plitude and phase) applied to each individual transmit element of the multichannel RF  arrays. However, it has been shown that even volume transmit RF coils at 3 T do not expose  uniformly, as assumed, but local limits are also exceeded (57). When going to higher static  magnetic fields or higher excitation frequencies, it should be noted that the general charac- teristic of the RF field profoundly changes. Up to approximately 80 MHz, the quasi-static  regime applies, whereas at higher frequencies the electromagnetic regime applies. The latter  allows waves to separate from the source and travel in space. At 7 T/298 MHz, the wave- length of the emitted RF is small enough compared to the bore diameter of the conductive  magnetic cryostat, so that the lower limit frequency of the lowest waveguide mode is just  exceeded and so-called “traveling waves” can propagate within the MR system’s bore (58).  Consequently, the RF energy may be absorbed by the body further away from the transmit  RF source or interact with distant metallic objects. This crucial aspect must be taken into  account in the safety-related discussion of implants and the application of local transmit  RF coils. Furthermore, the RF field characteristic changes with increasing frequency to the  extent that the coupling in the human body changes due to the frequency-dependent tissue  properties. At 7 T, the current density distributions are significantly more complex compared  to lower field strengths. Besides polarization effects, local SAR elevations now appear much  deeper in the tissue. As shown in several studies, the orientation of the implant to the electric  field component of the incidental RF wave determines how much surface currents are in- duced on the implant (59, 60). The surface currents, in turn, cause electrical field elevations  at the ends or edges of the implant, which eventually lead to SAR elevations. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis> ex- emplifies the differences between an intracranial aneurysm clip (18.8 mm in length) with</para>

      <para>parallel alignment to the incident electric field component, which causes a 30% increase in  SAR at the ends of the clip, and an orthogonal orientation, which has virtually no influence  on the SAR distribution (60). Of note is that, in contrast to temperature, there is no direct  correlation between SAR and possible tissue damage. Furthermore, in the vicinity of metal- lic parts with small dimensions, safety tests based on SAR can yield unreliable results (61).  An averaging mass of 10 or even 1-gram is a large volume of tissue with respect to rapidly  changing fields from the implant, which may conceal high SAR values and potentially high  temperature increases. Therefore, it is important to pay particular attention not to SAR, but  to temperature increases in implant safety assessments.</para>

      <para>So far, relatively few implants have undergone testing that resulted in being labeled  MR Conditional at 7 T by the implant manufacturers.

Slightly larger are upper eyelid implants made of  platinum-iridium with a length of up to 20 mm (65) and titanium tracheal support implants  with a length of 35 mm that have undergone testing (66).

      <para>the Normal Operating Mode according to the respective implant manufacturer. The critical  implant length for resonance effects and the presence of standing waves typically occurs at  half of the wavelength (or integer multiples thereof) of the excitation frequency (67). How- ever, this serves only as a rough guide, since studies have shown that resonance effects can  occur even at a quarter of the wavelength (68).</para>
      <para>While the critical lengths at 1.5 T correspond to approximately 26 cm and approximately  13 cm at 3 T, several studies have shown temperature increases at an implant length of ap- proximately 5 cm at 7 T. For example, Wezel, et al. (69) studied dental retainer wires of  different lengths in intensive numerical simulations and direct temperature measurements.  A temperature increase of 1.6°C was measured for a 5 cm long retainer (69). In another  work, Oriso, et al. (70) investigated various dental implants, such as crowns, supports and  implants of different lengths, which are implanted in the mandible or maxilla. Here, again,  the 5 cm long implant showed an experimentally measured temperature increase of 1.6°C.  At the 7 T MR system facility in Essen, Germany, more than 100 subjects with retainer  wires and almost 300 with general dental implants haven been safely imaged, to date (71,  72). It may be concluded that normal dental implants at 7 T are not an exclusion criterion.  However, caution or possible exclusion applies, of course, even at 3 T in the case of large- scale braces or magnetic dental attachments (70). The latter could be demagnetized solely  by the exposure to the static magnetic field and would not be able to hold the prosthesis af- terwards. Likewise, programmable cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) shunt valves that contain  small permanent magnets have been tested for their functionality after exposure to a 7 T  magnetic field (73). After insertion into the isocenter of a 7 T MR system, the two program- mable shunt valves tested, proGAV 2.0 (Miethke GmbH, Germany) and Codman CERTAS  Plus (Codman &amp; Shurtleff, Inc., MA, USA), both lost their functionality of reprogramming  and exhibited reverse polarized permanent magnets. While the proGAV 2.0 Shunt Valve  maintained its pressure setting, the pressure setting of the Codman CERTAS Plus Shunt  Valve changed. The latter also exhibited a deflection angle of 43° on the passively shielded  7 T whole body magnet using the ASTM International deflection angle test (74).</para>
      <para>Implants utilized for the fixation of the cranial bone after craniotomy, such as osteosyn- thesis plates and titanium clips have been tested regarding RF-induced heating in scientific  publications (59, 75, 76). Subsequently, Chen, et al. (75) showed in a pre- and postoperative  comparison that the image quality is hardly affected by titanium implants at 7 T and that  the artifacts are comparable to 3 T (75).</para>
      <para>Intracranial aneurysm clips represent a group of implants that may pose a contraindi- cation for patients undergoing MRI examinations, even at 1.5 and 3 T. Some aneurysm clips  made from titanium or other non-ferromagnetic materials have been tested and labeled “MR  Conditional” for use at 1.5 and/or 3 T. One manufacturer of intracranial aneurysm clips has  already identified a product as MR Conditional at 7 T (Sugita Titanium 2 Clip, Mizuho  America Inc., CA) (77). In addition, extensive numerical simulations of possible RF induced  tissue heating have been published in scientific articles (60, 78). Noureddine, et al. (60) in- vestigated in a first study the previously mentioned dependence on the orientation of the  clips relative to the incident electric field. In addition, different implant lengths were studied,  with the result that maximum temperature rise occured at a clip length of about 4 to 5 cm.

      <para>amination remains unknown, as well as maybe even the clip length, the authors have cal- culated a conservative power of 4.6 W for an 8-channel transmit/receive RF head coil. Al- though this is a reduction of the maximum allowable input power by almost a factor of eight  for the specific transmit RF coil, it would still allow application of pulse sequences such as  T1-weighted, three-dimensional gradient echo (MPRAGE: magnetization-prepared rapid  gradient echo) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) at 7 T (79). In the case of a known  clip length of 18.8 mm or shorter, which is usually the case in practice, the conservative  power increases to about 17 W, which is not at all a limitation for common neurological  imaging protocols at 7 T. In a second work, Noureddine, et al. (78) studied the effect of  multiple aneurysm clips, and in this case using the commercially available 1-channel trans- mit / 32-channel receive head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA), which is also  approved for clinical use on the new 7 T MR systems. For a minimum distance of 35 mm  from one aneurysm clip to another, multiple clips can be considered as independent and not  coupled to each other. The conservative input power for the RF coil was calculated to be  3.3 W (possibly limitations in the MPRAGE, no restrictions for SWI), or in the case of a  known clip length of 18.8 mm or shorter, a value of 13 W. The authors also showed the in- fluence of different thermoregulation models in the temperature simulations on the maxi- mum permissible power in each exposure case. It should be noted that, not only the choice  of the respective model, but the input parameters and other factors, plus the lack of an ex- isting test standard, impacts the results of the various studies.</para>
      <para>Further individual safety considerations of implants at 7 T may be found in the peer-re- viewed literature. Coronary artery stents were examined for their interaction with the RF  field at 7 T. Santoro, et al. (80) reported using numerical simulations and experimental tem- perature measurements obtained in a phantom within the MR system that a coronary artery  stent with a length of 4 cm had no significant increase in temperature when the current IEC  limits for local and global SAR were used for the experiment. However, the results corre- spond to an experimental transmit RF head coil with a diameter of 20 cm, which would  never be used in this form for patient imaging. In a follow-up study, Winter, et al. (81) pro- vided an analytical approach that allows the determination of the implant-induced increase  in a one gram averaged local SAR for stents of any length and arbitrary RF coil configura- tion and, thus, estimates a conservative power-limiting factor.</para>
      <para>A study on subcutaneously implanted port catheters, which are not located within the  transmit RF head coil but still close to its housing and, thus, within the RF exposure volume,  showed no relevant temperature increases, either in numerical simulations, nor in experi- mental measurements. <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> gives an overview of safety assessments of passive implants  at 7 T (82).</para>
      <para>The aforementioned examples of scientific studies on the safety of biomedical implants  revealed that the evaluations were only conducted with regard to specific aspects (e.g., only  RF-induced heating) and partly using custom-built RF coils, which renders a generalization  or extrapolation to other exposure scenarios problematic. In addition, the necessary safety  considerations are the subject of current discussions, since even for 3 T MR systems, the  commonly used ASTM International test standard, F2182 (83) used for the determination  of RF-induced heating of passive implants has recently undergone substantial revisions.

Likewise, the transferability of the published re- sults to the respective patient case with regard to the variety of local RF coils and transmis- sion strategies at 7 T must always be critically questioned.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Passive Implants Without Safety Evaluation at 7 T </emphasis></para>
      <para>The majority of implants will certainly not receive a dedicated safety evaluation for 7 T  from the implant manufacturers. Likewise, many of these implants will not be in the direct  exposure volume of the local transmit RF coil. Thus, using a well-considered,  risk versus  benefit analysis, the already known advantages of 7 T MRI in neurological and muscu- loskeletal diagnostic imaging should not be denied to the patient despite the presence of a  passive implant, which is labeled MR Conditional at 3 T. However, even in scientific studies,  where there is no diagnostic benefit for the subject, the investigator is often confronted with  the implant problem. Studies that tend to be the most impacted by the presence on an implant  in the patient are those that include many or even exclusively older study subjects. Practi- cally speaking, these investigations cannot be performed with a conservative exclusion rule  of “all subjects with implants”, regardless of implant size, type and site of implantation.</para>
      <para>In January 2016, the national network German Ultrahigh Field Imaging (GUFI) pub- lished a consensus recommendation on the inclusion of study subjects at 7 T and UHF MRI,  which was signed by all 13 participating sites (84). The recommendation states that the use  of local transmit/receive RF coils has the advantage that the transmit RF exposure volume  is substantially lower compared to the large exposure volume of built-in transmit RF coils  that are used by 1.5 and 3 T MR systems. Consequently, the power density outside of local  transmit RF coils decreases rapidly. For study subjects with passive implants that are labeled  MR Conditional at 3 T, that do not contain magnetizable components, and that are located  at a certain distance from the transmit RF coil, an overly conservative exclusion would no  longer be warranted, as previously required by many ethics committees (84). A flowchart  of the decision tree as suggested by the GUFI network is given in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>. However, the  minimum distance between the implant and the local transmit RF coil depends on both com- ponents and must always be discussed individually, on a case-by-case basis. In particular,  the aforementioned “traveling wave” effects (58) are to be taken into account, primarily  with implants of complex geometry or forming conducting loops, with a dimension of in- tegral multiples of half a wavelength, or partially implanted metallic objects.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis> shows schematically the inclusion criterion from the UHF site in Essen, Ger- many (72). The minimum allowable distance between the housing of the transmit RF coil  and the implant is 30 cm. Of note is that this value has not been precisely determined by  numerical simulations of various exposure scenarios, but rather represents a conservative  guideline value for the implants to be discussed in each case. However, the minimum dis- tance seems quite plausible if compared to the SAR distribution in the male human body  model Duke (i.e., a member of the Virtual Population, which is a high-resolution, accurate,  whole-body anatomical virtual human model of an adult man) using a local 8-channel head  coil (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10 B</emphasis>). The 10-gram-averaged local SAR is reduced in the chest by -20 dB to  the reference value in the head (0 dB), which corresponds to an attenuation by a factor of  100. Less attenuation (-10 dB corresponding to a factor of 10) is observed in the arms</para>

On the right (C), the inclu- sion criterion for subjects with passive implants is exemplarily presented for the 7 T site  in Essen, Germany. From a minimum distance of 30 cm to the local transmit RF coil,  subjects with 3 T MR Conditional passive implants may be examined at 7 T. However,  please note that especially for the female model (A) at the same distance from the RF coil  less attenuation can be observed in the arms (-10 dB) compared to the chest region  (-20 dB).

      <para>(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10 A</emphasis>), which should be treated more carefully. By way of example, in a retrospec- tive study on the 7 T MR system in Essen, nearly 400 subjects were imaged with implants  until April 2018 (71, 72). Large implants such as hip and knee prostheses were also cleared  for examinations when using a head coil for RF transmission (71, 85). In over 260 cases in  Essen, the implant was in the direct exposure volume of the transmit RF coil (71, 72). Sim- ilar to the case of intracranial aneurysm clips, for which conservative RF input powers have  been calculated, it is often possible to provide access to MRI exams performed at 7 T by  implementing a conservative power limitation without severely restricting the imaging pro- tocol, especially when using predominantly low SAR, gradient echo pulse sequences.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Active Implants </emphasis></para>
      <para>An active implant, according to the definition, contains electrical circuits and/or a power  supply. Examples for frequent active implants are cardiac pacemakers, implantable car- dioverter defibrillators (ICD), loop recorders, cochlear implants (CI), neuromodulation sys- tems, and implantable drug infusion pumps. Most active implants in the past were labeled  “MR Unsafe” and were contraindicated for MRI regardless of the strength of the static mag- netic field. Over the last 15 years, however, new active implants (e.g., cardiac pacemakers,  ICD, CI, neuromodulation systems, etc.) have been specially designed and tested in the  MRI setting, resulting in them being designated as “MR Conditional”, with labeling indi- cating the acceptable strength of the static magnetic field and specific absorption rate to en- sure patient safety. Over the years, countless studies have been conducted at 1.5 and 3 T  and guidelines and workflow recommendations have been published regarding the man- agement of patients with active implants. This development from strict contraindication to  the availability of MR Conditional, active implants has enabled numerous patients to un- dergo diagnostic MRI examinations at 1.5 and 3 T.</para>
      <para>At the level of 7 T and other UHF MRI, active implants, without exception, have to be  considered “MR Unsafe”. Notably, to date, no active implant has been tested and labeled  MR Conditional at 7 T. The potential safety risks are high and manifold (magnetic field in- teractions, RF heating, induced currents, device malfunction, etc.) and there is no diagnostic  justification to conduct an MRI exam at 7 T. In other words, if an MRI procedure for a pa- tient with an active implant is potentially indicated, it would have to be conducted at 1.5 or  3 T according to the current labels and conditions specified by the implant manufacturer.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <para>Ultra-high field MRI has come a long way since the first installation of a 7 T MR system  at the turn of the millennium. Today, the latest generation of the 7 T MR system has been  FDA approved as medical device for diagnostic imaging of the head and the extremities.  Besides hazards due to the magnetic force that can be up to 2.3 times stronger at 7 T com- pared to 3 T, increased risks of RF-induced tissue heating are the most critical aspects. The  resonant length of an implant at 7 T is approximately 5 cm. Other than at 3 T, MR systems  operating at 7 T are less standardized. Especially with regard to the transmit RF coil and  transmission methods used. At 7T, considering the inherent technology, substantial differ- ences need to be expected. Hence, it is important to critically question published safety as- sessments of implants and to have a thorough discussion about how this relates to the</para>

For nonmagnetic implants without a  dedicated 7 T safety evaluation, but which are labeled MR Conditional at 3 T and have a  certain minimum distance to the transmit RF coil, a consensus recommendation for man- aging human subjects from the national network German Ultrahigh Field Imaging (GUFI)  may be helpful. However, each patient case should be discussed individually and the value  of minimum distance should be understood as an approximate guide rather than a fixed  landmark, after which everything will be safe. This would certainly be a false interpretation  or assumption. It is the responsibility of the institution and MR system operator to ensure  the safety of volunteers and patients during the entire exposure to the UHF MRI environ- ment.</para>
