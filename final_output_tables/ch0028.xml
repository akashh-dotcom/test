        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>A well-designed safety program to protect medical personnel and patients is mandatory for all centers performing clinical medical imaging. However, due to unique inherent risks, specific requirements must be stipulated for the outpatient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facility (1, 2). <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> lists safety concerns relevant to all medical imaging procedures. All outpatient imaging departments must have a written safety program, properly implemented and maintained by management, technologists, and radiologists.</para>
    <para>This chapter provides the requirements for a safety program to help ensure protection of employees, patients, and others while complying with regulatory obligations. Thus, this chapter should assist new and existing facilities in developing and/or revising safety, health, environment, and loss control programs while establishing consistency in operations and medical delivery with particular attention focused on proper policies and procedures.</para>

          <title>PERSONNEL: RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES</title>
    <para>Staffing of the outpatient MRI facility should be carefully considered and maintained. Appropriate experience and training of the management team (e.g., the MR medical director, imaging center manager, MR modality specialist, MR team leader, and MR safety officer) is crucial to operating an efficient and safe imaging department. The key personnel in outpatient imaging safety include the management team, members of the MRI Safety Committee, the MR medical director (MRMD), MR Safety Officer, and other involved employees, because employees are one of the key elements that help ensure a safe outpatient MRI center.</para>
    <para>The management team should establish an MRI Safety Committee. The Safety Committee should then designate an MR Safety Officer if one has not already been established.</para>

    <para>Determination of the appropriateness of the requested examination should be performed before the patient is exposed to the MRI environment, preferably at the time of scheduling.</para>
    <para>Appropriateness Criteria from the American College of Radiology can assist in this process (please see http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Appropriateness-Criteria).</para>
    <para>If the patient is determined to be pregnant and the referring physician is not aware at the time of the imaging request, then the referring physician must be notified and approval obtained before allowing the patient into the magnetic resonance (MR) system room. The radiologist must also approve MRI examinations on pregnant patients. The risk versus benefits of MRI must be considered and explained to the patient by a trained healthcare professional before proceeding with the study and documented in the patient's medical record.</para>
    <para>The MRI technologist should carefully review the examination order and confer with the radiologist if the order is incomplete, unclear or needs amending. The MRI technologist cannot change the requested order without approval by the radiologist or authorization from the requesting physician. Any change in the original order requires documentation of an amended order including:</para>

    <para>Importantly, Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities (IDTFs) are required to obtain all referring physician orders and modifications in writing.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Implants</emphasis>Screening patients for the presence of implants and devices that may pose hazards in the MRI environment must begin with the scheduling process. Notably, the Safety Committee should provide scheduling personnel with guidelines so that implants and devices inappropriate for MRI are detected and exams not scheduled. Patients should be asked at the time of scheduling to bring their implant device card or information in writing from their physician. The physician or surgical center can be contacted when the patient cannot provide the necessary information. The presence, nature and MRI information for implants and devices (i.e., the labeling for MRI which is usually found in the Instructions for Use, IFU, for the item) should be re-verified by the MRI technologist when reviewing the patient's history just prior to the patient entering the MR system room.</para>
    <para>All employees should be familiar with current MRI labeling terminology, as follows: MR Safe, MR Conditional, or MR Unsafe (3, 4). The MRI-specific restriction information for each MR Conditional-designated implant should be carefully evaluated before the patient is allowed into the scanner to ensure compliance (e.g., strength of the static magnetic field, level of the spatial gradient magnetic field, type of transmit radiofrequency coil, specific absorption rate limitations, etc.) (3-7). Scheduling personnel must have access to an MRI technologist and/or a radiologist in case questions concerning safety of specific devices cannot be resolved. A detailed list of this information can be found on the website, www.MRIsafety.com, in an annually updated textbook (4), or from the implant manufacturer. In addition to the above, policies and procedures must be in place to ensure that pa-</para>
    <para>tients are properly identified and the correct patient information is entered into the MR system and medical record.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Access Zones</emphasis></para>
    <para>Because of the potential risk inherent in the MRI environment, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends segmenting the area into four different zones (5, 7). In new construction, these zones should be physically separated by barriers or other appropriate means. In certain outpatient MRI centers, physical separation may not be practicable and, in general, has been found to be unnecessary.</para>
    <para>Areas that are restricted, that is, the immediate areas outside the MR system room (Zone III) and the scanner room (Zone IV) where the static magnetic field exceeds 5-Gauss should be clearly marked and designated as being potentially hazardous. Danger signs should be prominently displayed at the entry of hallways and rooms that are adjacent to the MR system room and should also be prominently displayed on the door of the scanner room (5, 7).</para>
    <para>Where locking mechanisms are available, the MR system room should be physically restricted from general access by key locks whenever MRI personnel are not in the immediate vicinity and cannot control access (e.g., lunch break and evening closing). Only MRI personnel should be provided with the access keys to the scanner room. The ACR recommends that physical barriers be maintained across doorways when the MR system room must remain open for cleaning or maintenance (5-7).</para>
    <para>Patients are screened for risk factors before being escorted into the Restricted Zones III (hallways or rooms adjacent to the scanner room) and IV (the MR system room). This topic is covered in great detail elsewhere in this textbook. Patients (or their family, guardian, or designate) must complete a written screening form. Special diligence is required for incommunicative and critical patients. The facility can create its own screening form approved by the Safety Committee or a form can be obtained from other sources, such as the ACR (5, 7) or downloaded from www.MRIsafety.com. A completed and signed screening form should be obtained each time a patient presents for an MRI examination. Screening of unconscious or incommunicative patients who are unable to provide a history for surgery, trauma, metal exposure, or prior MRI contrast reactions should be performed by the MRI technologist in conjunction with the patient's spouse, closest relative, guardian, or personal physician. This individual should complete and sign the screening form designated for this purpose.</para>
    <para>The MRI technologist performing the examination must review the completed screening form and verbally review the answers with the patient or other individual before witnessing (i.e., signing) the form. The screening form is placed in the patient's medical record. Any implants, devices, or metallic foreign bodies raising concerns relative to MRI safety should be checked with published sources or by other means (1-6), before allowing entry into the MR system room. Consultation with the supervising radiologist or MR Safety Officer is recommended if any safety concerns cannot be resolved. The MRI technologist should perform a final visual and verbal safety check prior to entering the MR system room with the patient.</para>
    <para>Sedated, anesthetized, incommunicative or high-risk patients should undergo appropriate physiologic monitoring throughout the MRI examination. This may include checking the patient's vital signs, such as respiratory rate, heart rate, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation as clinically indicated and as deemed appropriate by the MRI facility and supervising physician (5).</para>
    <para>A critical component of the outpatient MRI facility's safety program is planning for attending to patients who may have medical emergencies in the MR system room. Appropriately trained personnel and supervisory physician shall be available at all times to provide emergency medical treatment to patients with cardiac and respiratory arrest. Mock emergency or "code blue" drills are recommended to ensure that the emergency team can efficiently manage medical emergencies. In the setting of a serious emergency such as a cardiopulmonary arrest, the patient should be rapidly and safely removed from the scanning room and immediate basic or advanced life support or other appropriate treatment should be initiated. Emergency medical equipment and medications should be readily available and accessible to emergency personnel.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Pregnant Patients</emphasis></para>
    <para>Pregnant patients warrant special consideration. MRI may be performed at any stage of pregnancy if the patient's physician and radiologist determine that the risk versus benefit warrants performing the exam. This topic is covered in detail in another chapter in this textbook.</para>
    <para>The indications and other information for scanning during pregnancy must be documented in the patient's medical record and should include that the MRI study cannot be acquired via other non-ionizing means such as ultrasound, the diagnostic information is medically necessary to diagnose the mother or fetus during pregnancy, the referring physician does not believe it is prudent to wait until a later stage of pregnancy or after pregnancy, and the patient agrees to have the examination during pregnancy. Importantly, the prior requirement for written and verbal informed consent is no longer a requirement from the American College of Radiology (7). Table 7 outlines the indications for performing MRI in pregnant patients.</para>

    <para>MRI contrast agents should only be administered to pregnant patients after risk versus benefit consideration and approval by an MRI-trained radiologist (7-9). Notably, the fetus</para>
    <para>has a higher exposure to gadolinium in the first few weeks of pregnancy when the mother may not know she is pregnant (8). Ray, et al. (9) reported that gadolinium exposure at any time during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of inflammatory conditions, stillbirth, and neonatal death.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Fetal MRI</emphasis>Fetal MRI is indicated for use if diagnostic ultrasound is inadequate or the examination provides important information about the fetus that would otherwise require exposure to ionizing radiation (4, 5, 7-9). Fetal MRI is conducted only on the recommendation of a radiologist after consultation with the referring physician (4, 7-9). The radiologist should document in the radiology report the fact that: (1) the diagnostic study could not be acquired via other non-ionizing diagnostic imaging means, (2) the information was needed to potentially affect the care of the fetus during the pregnancy, and (3) the referring physician did not feel that it was prudent to wait until the fetus was born to obtain the information. Of note is that recent investigation reported that MRI exposure to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy was not associated with increased risks (9).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Specific MR System-Related Patient Risks</emphasis>The time-varying magnetic fields applied during image acquisition induce currents in conductors in the field's influence and, when applied in the presence of a high static magnetic field, create torque on the gradient coils, producing acoustic noise. Because of the intensity of the noise induced by gradient switching in high field strength MR systems, patients should wear hearing protection when undergoing MRI (4, 7, 10-12). Typical hearing protection devices include earplugs, headphones, or headphones with noise reduction technology. Certain MR scanners provide active noise control (noise cancellation) systems that attenuate acoustic noise and/or have an option of using quiet pulse sequences (11). Despite these features being available, patients should still utilize passive noise control (earplugs or headphones) during all MRI exams performed on high field strength scanners.</para>
    <para>The radiofrequency (RF) fields used during MRI can generate heat in conductors (4, 7, 12-16) resulting in temperature increases. Therefore, all unnecessary electrically conductive materials should be removed from the patient and the bore of the MR system before initiating scanning to prevent patients from experiencing excessive heating or burns (4, 7). All electrical connections, such as on surface RF coils, electrocardiogram leads, and other similar items should be checked by the MRI technologist prior to each use to ensure integrity, and that the thermal and electrical insulation is intact. Damaged cables and exposed wires should be immediately reported to the service engineer and the equipment taken out of service until it is repaired.</para>
    <para>For electrically conductive materials, such as wires, that are required to remain in the bore of the MR system during MRI, the wires must be oriented so that no loops are formed (4, 7). Adequate thermal insulation (i.e., using air, padding, etc.) should separate the patient's skin from all conducting materials, as well as the transmit RF coil (e.g., the body RF coil) during MRI. Procedures to prevent excessive heating and burns in patients during MRI have been previously presented and should be closely followed as part of preparing patients for MRI examinations (4, 5, 7).</para>

        <title>MRI Safety Policies and Procedures for an Outpatient Facility</title>
    <para>Before undergoing an MRI examination, patients should be asked if they have ever had a permanent coloring technique (i.e., tattoos or permanent cosmetics) applied to the body. This includes cosmetic applications such as eyeliner, lip liner, lip coloring, as well as decorative designs. Screening is necessary because of associated imaging artifacts and, more importantly, because a small number of patients have experienced transient skin irritation, cutaneous swelling, or heating sensations at the site of the permanent coloring in association with MRI (4). These issues do not represent a contraindication to MRI but precautionary measures should be in place, such as application of a dry, cold compress (ice pack wrapped in a towel) to the tattoo site during the exam. Patients should be advised to immediately notify the MRI technologist regarding any unusual sensation felt at the site of the tattoo during scanning (4, 5, 7).</para>
    <para>Patients with metallic body piercing jewelry must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and cleared in the same manner as other implanted devices that have no labeling information. Accordingly, the supervising physician must make a careful assessment of risk associated with the MRI versus the benefit of the diagnostic information.</para>
    <para>Some drug delivery or medication patches may contain metallic foil or other similar conducting material. Subjecting the area of the medication patch to RF energy may result in thermal injury to the patient (4). Since removal or repositioning can result in altering the medication dose, consultation with the patient's prescribing physician is recommended. If the medication patch is removed, a nursing staff member should be given the responsibility for ensuring that it is replaced or repositioned (4)</para>
        <sect2 id="ch0028s0000s0005s0001">
          <title>Sedation</title>
    <para>Certain outpatients may require sedation in order to complete a successful MRI examination (17-19). The Safety Committee must have written policies and procedures detailing how adult and pediatric patients should be medicated in the MRI setting. For pediatric patients, these policies and procedures should be based on national standards, facility-specific policies defined by the referring pediatrician and the pediatric radiologist, the age of the patient, the mental capacity of the patient, the time duration of the MRI examination, and the depth of sedation needed. Written guidelines for adult sedation are also needed. Facility-specific policies developed in conjunction with anesthesiologists should determine the type of sedation that is utilized. Sedation should always be administered in accordance with national guidelines and state and local laws (4, 7, 17-19). Separate sedation consent forms must be approved by the Safety Committee and explained to the patient by an appropriate healthcare professional before the patient or designate signs the document.</para>

          <title>Gadolinium-Based MRI Contrast Issues</title>
    <para>The most common adverse event leading to emergency room visits from outpatient MRI facilities is an adverse reaction to intravenous administered MRI contrast agents. No patient should be given an intravenous contrast agent without the written prescription of a licensed physician in accordance with state laws. Depending on state regulations, a physician, registered nurse, or IV-qualified MRI technologist may start and attend to the peripheral intravenous access line and administer the MRI contrast agent as a bolus or continuous injection.</para>
    <para>Before administering an intravenous MRI contrast agent, preferably at the time of scheduling the study, a history must be obtained from the patient or patient's guardian concerning prior contrast injections and possible adverse reactions (20-23). A history of asthma or allergic-type respiratory reaction not associated with MRI contrast agents is a risk factor for adverse reactions, but does not require premedication in most circumstances. Monitoring the cardiovascular and/or respiratory status (i.e., via the use of an MR Conditional pulse oximeter) is prudent during and following administration of intravenous gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents in high-risk patients. According to recommendations by the ACR, if the patient has a history of an adverse reaction to a gadolinium-based contrast agent, then the patient should be considered for premedication prior to receiving the contrast dosage (20). The patient's cardiovascular and respiratory status should also be carefully monitored using appropriate techniques during MRI and for 30 minutes following contrast administration. While serious reactions are rare (21, 23), patients who have had a severe anaphylactoid reaction to prior gadolinium-based contrast media should be given careful consideration before use in future MRI exams.</para>
    <para>According to recent recommendations in the ACR Manual on Contrast Media (20), outpatients do not need to be screened for renal function status before administration of a Group II agent at standard or lower doses unless they have the known risk factors. In other instances, screening questions designed to determine the patient's risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) should be asked at the time of scheduling and when the MRI technologist obtains the patient's history prior to MRI (24-34). <emphasis role="bold">Table 8</emphasis> lists screening questions that we recommend to ask patients relative to the issue of NSF. A positive answer to any of these questions requires calculation of the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to determine risk for NSF before administering gadolinium-based contrast agents in the outpatient setting.</para>

    <para>If the patient is on dialysis, has an estimated GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73-m<superscript>2</superscript> (stage 4 or stage 5 renal disease), or has acute renal injury, then injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent should be given cautiously only after the following information is documented:</para>

    <para>Although the benefits of hemodialysis have not been definitively established if the patient is on dialysis, the patient should undergo a hemodialysis session as soon as possible after the administration of the gadolinium-based contrast agent, preferably within a few hours of the study. The ACR no longer recommends that dialysis be repeated 24 hours later (20). Of note is that peritoneal dialysis provides less NSF risk reduction compared to hemodialysis.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Visitor Screening</emphasis>All visitors entering the Restricted Zones (III and IV) must be screened for MRI risk factors and fill out a specific screening form designed for those not undergoing an MRI examination (4) while still in the Patient Preparation Zone and undergo screening by the MRI technologist. If deemed safe to enter the Restricted Zones by the MRI technologist, then the visitor may be allowed access to these areas under direct supervision by an MRI safety-trained healthcare worker. Prior to entering the MR system room, it is recommended that the visitor change into a gown or scrubs provided by the MRI facility. However, if the visitor is allowed to remain in street clothes, pockets must be emptied of all metallic objects, external hearing aids, jewelry and analog watches, and any other objects that are ferromagnetic or could be damaged in the presence of a high static magnetic field must be removed.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Emergency Personnel</emphasis>Emergency responders (e.g., first responders), firefighters, police, and security personnel must be fully screened as a visitor and cleared by an MRI technologist before being allowed access to the scanner room. Furthermore, it is prudent for outpatient MRI facilities to periodically inform their local police and firefighter organizations of the risks of the powerful static magnetic field of the MR system and the 24-hour presence of the magnetic field for superconducting magnets before emergencies arise so that emergency personnel will be cognizant of the risks when responding to emergencies. Security personnel must remove all metallic objects from their possession including guns and ammunition, electronically-activated restraint devices, radios, cell phones, badges, name tags, jewelry, coins, wallets, keys, pocket knives, and similar items before entering the MR system room. If the patient is a detainee and requires a restraining device, a plastic restraint device must be used (7).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Employee Safety</emphasis>The outpatient MRI facility is a dynamic and often stressful environment. Therefore, it is important to establish policies and procedures for professional behavior and etiquette to</para>
    <para>avoid unnecessary patient stress on top of an anxiety-provoking examination. Center personnel who interact with patients should properly identify themselves and explain their roles.</para>
    <para>All employees of an outpatient MRI facility must be screened for MRI risk factors and any employee who is deemed to be unsafe for the MRI setting (e.g., as a result of having an unsafe implant) must be kept from the Patient Preparation and the MR system room. Employees with access to the scanner room must complete and pass an MRI safety training course, which should be repeated on an annual basis (5, 7).</para>
    <para>If an equipment malfunction occurs, then the chief or lead MRI technologist, facility manager, or radiologist should be informed in a timely manner. Only certified and qualified MRI technologists and MRI safety-trained radiologists should be permitted to operate an MR system and have unrestricted access to the scanner room. These individuals must be extensively trained and educated in the broader aspects of MRI safety, including issues related to the potential for attraction of ferromagnetic implants and devices, burns, peripheral nerve stimulation, acoustic noise, and other potential risk factors (4-7).</para>
    <para>In order to minimize errors, it is recommended that the MRI technologist indicated in the patient's medical record should be responsible for screening the patient and performing the MRI examination. Only safety-trained MRI technologists should be authorized to conduct MRI screening. Non-MRI personnel should be accompanied by and/or under the immediate supervision of an MRI technologist while they are in the immediate area prior to the MR system room and the scanner room, itself.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Pregnant Personnel</emphasis></para>
    <para>Pregnant healthcare workers can work in and around the MRI environment throughout all stages of their pregnancy (4, 5, 7). This includes, but is not limited to, positioning patients, scanning, archiving, injecting MRI contrast agents, entering the scanner room in an emergency, and performing similar tasks. However, if pregnant workers are uncomfortable with the concept of exposure to the static magnetic field of the MR system, they should not be required to work in the MR system room. Pregnant healthcare workers should not remain within the bore of the scanner during the operation of the scanner (4, 5, 7)</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Equipment</emphasis></para>
    <para>Proper installation and maintenance is necessary for the safe operation of an MR system. All equipment used in the scanner room must be deemed safe for use in the MRI environment. Oxygen tanks must be nonferromagnetic throughout the imaging facility. Fire extinguishers must be MR Conditional versions and must be placed in a conspicuous place in or near the scanner. Monitoring equipment such as pulse oximeters and anesthesia equipment must be MR Conditional in order to be used in the MR system room. All other equipment such as IV poles, step stools, stretchers, and other patient support items must also be MR Safe or MR Conditional.</para>
    <para>There are risk factors unique to the powerful magnet associated with an MR scanner. For example, if an individual is "trapped" against the MR system by a large ferromagnetic object, then the static magnetic field will likely need to be shut down immediately. If the</para>
    <para>magnet is resistive, then the power can be shut off. If the magnet is superconducting, then the field must be reduced using the "quench button", which should be located in a conspicuous place. Special training and education are important for all staff members working in the outpatient MRI facility with regard to specific procedures to follow involving a quench (4, 7).</para>
    <para>Preventive maintenance is mandatory to ensure high performance of the scanner in order to minimize down time and to maximize image quality and should be performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations and properly documented.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis>Optimal MRI safety in outpatient imaging centers requires a well-organized plan that includes the facility's management, employees, an MRI Safety Committee and committed MR Medical Director, and MR Safety Officer. A written safety plan that includes policies and procedures that address the risks uniquely associated with the MRI environment must be developed and explained to all employees, along with the assignment of specific responsibilities for execution of the plan. Since few lay people understand the risks associated with high static magnetic fields and other potential hazards associated with MRI, screening must begin at scheduling and continue prior to scanning. Strict adherence to patient safety management must be practiced before and during the MRI exam. Visitors, emergency personnel, and others must be screened and prohibited from entering the MR system room with unsafe devices to ensure both their safety as well as that of patients and staff members. Fortunately, extensive experience with MRI technology in outpatient facilities worldwide during more than thirty years has demonstrated that outpatient MRI is extremely safe if proper policies and procedures are in place and the precautions discussed herein are rigorously enforced.</para>
