    <para>Since its introduction into clinical practice in the early 1980s, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has exhibited exceptional growth and created a paradigm shift in medicine. Not only has this imaging modality markedly expanded the roles of imaging in medical diagnoses, opening up vistas in neurological, musculoskeletal, oncological, cardiovascular and a variety of other diseases not accessible to prior imaging techniques, but it has also had a profound impact on our basic understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of abnormal conditions and disease processes.</para>
    <para>The continuous growth of MRI has led to an explosion in the number of patients, healthcare professionals, and other individuals exposed to the powerful static magnetic fields, rapidly changing magnetic fields, and intense radiofrequency fields used during the procedures. Numerous investigations have been performed during the past 35+ years in an effort to characterize the bioeffects and safety aspects of MRI.</para>
    <para>The transformative impact of MRI on medicine continues to progress and advances in technology continue unabated. Whereas the highest magnetic field used in routine clinical imaging was 1.5-Tesla during most of the 1990s, 3-Tesla is currently the standard. Presently, a 7-Tesla scanner is approved for clinical use and research is routinely performed at 9.4-Tesla, 10.5- and an 11.7-Tesla MR system recently came on line to scan human subjects.</para>
    <para>Ultimately, MRI safety must begin with understanding the interactions of the electromagnetic fields used in MRI with biologic tissues. The issues concerning human safety in the MRI environment led us to enlist leading physicians and scientists around the world to collaborate on this textbook.</para>
