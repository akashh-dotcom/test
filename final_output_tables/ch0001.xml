      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Most medical professionals today are well aware of the fact that magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) technology uses systems with powerful magnets that make considerable  amounts of noise and that you generally cannot bring ferromagnetic objects or patients with  certain implants into the scanner room. However, these individuals may not be aware that  MR systems use relatively safe radiofrequency (RF) radiation instead of ionizing radiation  (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, etc.) to create images and they may not understand just how  powerful the magnets are, why they may always be “on” and why they make so much noise.  This chapter provides simple explanations for these matters by presenting information per- taining to basic MRI physics.</para>
      <para>MRI has at its root the chemical technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance or  NMR (1, 2). As every chemist knows, the use of the word &quot;nuclear&quot; has nothing to do with  radioactivity, but since the general population is not composed of mostly chemists, the med- ical community has dropped that emotionally laden word to become, simply, MRI. For most  MRI examinations, the word “nuclear” has to do with the nucleus of the hydrogen atom,  which consists of a single proton. The content of this chapter will begin by examining the  magnetic properties of protons and then continue with an explanation of the MRI signal,  some basic tissue properties, spin echo formation, and conclude with a brief discussion of  MRI hardware issues. Much of the information in this chapter is adapted from <emphasis role="italics">All You Really </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Need to Know About MRI Physics</emphasis> (3). Several other textbooks also cover this introductory  material (4-7).</para>

      <title>MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF PROTONS</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Spinning Protons Act Like Little Magnets </emphasis></para>
      <para>A moving electric charge, be it positive or negative, produces a magnetic field. The  faster a charge moves or the larger the charge, the larger the magnetic field it produces.  Think back to when you were a child and would make a crude electromagnet by wrapping  wire around a nail and connecting it to a battery. The larger the voltage of the battery, the  larger the current and the stronger the magnet.</para>
      <para>Some of the basic properties of a simple proton include mass, a positive electric charge  and spin. Granted, a proton does not have a very large electric charge, but it does spin very  fast and, therefore, does produce a very small, yet significant, magnetic field. Water is the  largest source of hydrogen protons in the body, followed by fat. Normally, the direction that  these tiny magnets point in is randomly distributed (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1A</emphasis>).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> Spinning protons are little magnets which are frequently referred to  as “spins”.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> Tesla (T) – A unit of magnetic field strength. 1 T = 10,000 Gauss (an- other unit of magnetic field). The earth’s magnetic field is roughly 0.5 Gauss.</para>
      <para>Just as a compass aligns with the Earth’s magnetic field, a spinning proton placed near  (or within) a large external magnetic field (called <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis>) will align with the external field. Un- fortunately, it is not quite so simple. At the atomic level, some of the protons align with the  field and some align against the field, cancelling each other out. A slight excess will align  with the field so that the net result is an alignment with the external field. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1B</emphasis> depicts  nine protons, four of which have aligned <emphasis role="italics">against</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis> and five have aligned <emphasis role="italics">with</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis> resulting  in an excess of one proton. (Note that this diagram showing the protons aligning perfectly  with or against <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis> is not completely accurate.

      <para>tinually oscillating back and forth between the two states but at any given instant, and with  a large enough sample, there will be a very slight majority aligned with the field. The larger  the external static magnetic field, the greater the difference in energy levels and the larger  the excess number aligned with the field. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> demonstrates this for a sample of two  million protons. At 1 T there are just six extra protons. At 1.5 T, there are only nine extra  protons for every two million. At 3 T there are 18 and at 7 T, the highest field strength used  in the clinical setting, there are 42 excess protons for every two million. The number of ex- cess protons is directly proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field.</para>
      <para>As will be discussed more fully later in this chapter, the MR signal comes from just  these excess protons. With only nine out of two million protons (at 1.5 T) in excess, one  might ask how can we even detect such a small signal? We shall answer that question by  first asking a different question: how many excess protons are there in a single imaging  voxel? (A voxel is a three-dimensional or volume pixel.) Without going into the math in  great detail, assume a voxel dimension of 1-mm x 1-mm x 5-mm = 0.005-cm<superscript>3</superscript> or 0.005-ml.  Using Avogadro’s Number, we can calculate that there are a total of 3.4 x 10<superscript>20</superscript> water protons  in a 0.005-ml voxel. If nine out of every two million protons are in excess, then there are a  total of 1.5 x 10<superscript>15</superscript> protons in every voxel that will contribute to the MR signal (or, on the  order of a million billion protons). The important lesson here is that even though a spinning  proton is a very poor magnet, the number of excess protons that align with the field is so  large that we can basically ignore quantum mechanics and focus on the classical mechanics  description.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> The total magnetic field of the excess protons is defined as <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>While it was stated above that, due to the large number of excess protons, we can pretty  much ignore quantum physics, there is still one issue that is best discussed using quantum  physics terminology. The relationship between the energy <emphasis role="bold">(E)</emphasis> of a photon or a unit of elec- tromagnetic radiation and its frequency <emphasis role="bold">(</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">ν</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">)</emphasis> (the Greek symbol ‘nu’) is described by the  Planck’s equation:</para>

At 1.5 T,  for every two million protons there  are nine more protons aligned with  the field than there are aligned  against the field. At 3 T, there are 18  excess protons.</para>

      <para>Where <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">h</emphasis></emphasis> is known as Planck’s constant. In simple words, the energy of electromagnetic  radiation goes up directly with the frequency of the radiation. <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> lists the approximate  frequency ranges for different types of electromagnetic radiation. As will be discussed in  detail shortly, MRI uses radio waves with frequencies around 10<superscript>7</superscript>-Hz (cycles per second).  Most other radiology imaging techniques (e.g., X-ray, computed tomography, and nuclear  medicine) use ionizing radiation with frequencies in the 10<superscript>18</superscript>- to 10<superscript>19</superscript>-Hz range or roughly  10<superscript>12</superscript> larger than those used in MRI. Accordingly, X-rays are roughly a trillion times more  “energetic” (and potentially damaging) than radio waves. MRI is able to provide such great  images not because of the high energy involved (like computed tomography) but because  of the large number of protons found in the body, primarily in water and fat.</para>

      <para>Previously, a spinning proton was described as being a very tiny magnet. Just as a spin- ning dreidel wobbles about its axis, so do spinning protons wobble, or precess, about the  axis of the external <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis> field. The frequency of the precession is directly proportional to the  strength of the magnetic field and is defined by the Larmor Equation:</para>
      <para>Where, <emphasis role="bold">ω</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis> is known as either the precessional, Larmor or resonance frequency and γ  (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio and is a constant unique to every atom. For a simple  proton, γ = 42.56-MHz/T. As before, <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis> represents the externally applied static magnetic  field. At the magnetic field strengths used in clinical MR systems, 0.2 to 7 T, the resonance  frequency of hydrogen ranges from 8.5-MHz to 298-MHz (8.5 x 10<superscript>6</superscript>-Hz to 2.98 x 10<superscript>8</superscript>-Hz).  In <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>, it is shown that this range is in the radiofrequency (RF) portion of the electro- magnetic spectrum.</para>
      <para>As such, it is now apparent how <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1B</emphasis> was slightly inaccurate. The spins do align  roughly with (or against) the static magnetic field but, if you could take a freeze frame snap- shot of all of the protons in a voxel, you would see that each individual proton is slightly  tilted. However, remember that the protons are each precessing at faster than ten million  times per second, so if you take the average position of the vectors over even a very short  amount of time, they will each be aligned either perfectly with, or perfectly against, the  main magnetic field.</para>

      <para>When the spins are first tilted down to the XY-plane, they are all in-phase. Think of a  playground with a million swings. If all of the children are going up and down together, at  exactly the same rate, then they are swinging in-phase. Assuming that all the children are  pumping their legs with the same force and frequency, then they will stay in-phase. But if  one child stops pumping for a few seconds and another child pumps a little harder or a little  faster, then they will start to get out of sync with everyone else. The same type of thing hap- pens to the spins. For reasons that will be described later, some protons spin a little faster  while others spin a little slower (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). Very quickly, they get out of phase relative to  some reference (usually the spins at the center of the magnet).</para>

      <para>How fast a proton wobbles or precesses depends on the magnetic field that it experi- ences. An isolated proton, far from any other proton (or electron), is only affected by the  main magnetic field, <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis>. As protons (or spins) move together (e.g., due to random motion),  their magnetic fields begin to interact. If the field from one proton increases the field that  the second proton feels, while the field from the second proton reduces the field that the  first proton feels, then the second proton will precess at a slightly faster rate, while the first  proton will precess slightly slower (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11A</emphasis>). If the fields from both protons add to the  main field, then both protons will precess more rapidly (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11B</emphasis>). As soon as the spins  move farther apart, their fields no longer interact and they both return to the original fre- quency but at different phases. This type of interaction is called spin-spin interaction. These  temporary, random interactions cause a cumulative loss of phase across the excited spins  resulting in an overall loss of signal.</para>

      <title>FREE INDUCTION DECAY (FID) AND SPIN ECHO FORMATION</title>
      <para>To summarize what has been covered so far, after the RF transmitter is turned off, the  protons immediately begin to re-radiate the absorbed energy. If nothing is affecting the ho- mogeneity of the magnetic field, all of the protons will spin at the same resonance frequency.  The initial amplitude of the signal is determined by the portion of the magnetization vector  (<emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis>) that has been tipped onto the XY-plane. This, in turn, is determined by the sine of the  flip angle, α. The maximum signal is obtained when the flip angle is 90°. [Note: sine (0°)  = 0, sine (90°) = 1.0] The signal unaffected by any gradient is known as a Free Induction  Decay (FID) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>). The time constant that determines the rate of decay is called T2.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> Free Induction Decay (FID). An MR signal in the absence of any mag- netic gradients. The decay curve is the signal envelope. The actual signal is oscillating at  the resonance frequency which is in the MHz range.</para>
      <para>In the real world, the MR signal decays faster than T2 would predict. Pure T2 decay is  a function of completely random interactions between spins. The assumption is that the  main external <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis> field is absolutely homogeneous. In reality, there are many factors creating  imperfections in the homogeneity of a magnetic field. The main magnet itself will have  flaws related to the manufacturing process. Every tissue has a different magnetic suscepti- bility which distorts the field at tissue borders, particularly at air/tissue interfaces. Addi- tionally, patients may have some type of metallic implants (e.g., clips, staples, heart valves,  etc.) which cause disruptions of the magnetic field. The sum total of all of these random  and fixed effects is called T2* (pronounced “T-two star”) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 14</emphasis>).</para>

      <para>Thus, T2 relaxation comes from random causes while T2* comes from a combination  of both random and fixed causes. There is nothing that can be done to prevent or compensate  for random losses in-phase, but what about the fixed effects? Can anything be done about  these losses? The answer is yes.</para>
      <para>Consider the following race (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15A</emphasis>). The contestants are a turtle, a bicyclist, a  pace car, an airplane, and a rocket. At the start of the race, everyone is together (in-phase.)   Once the race starts (at t = 0), the contestants all move out, each at their fastest pace. Soon,  there is a noticeable distance between them.</para>
      <para>After some time, let’s call it TE/2, a signal is given for everyone to turn around and go  back. Assuming that everyone is still going at the same rate as before, then after an additional  time, TE/2, they all arrive at the starting/finish line together (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15B</emphasis>). In terms of MRI,  at the time TE (TE/2 + TE/2), all the spins are back in-phase, producing a large signal. This  large signal is called a spin echo and the time TE is called the echo time (8).</para>

      <para>As described above, a 180° pulse can be used to reverse the T2* dephasing process and,  thereby, produce a spin echo. As soon as the spins all come back into phase at the echo time,  they immediately start to go out of phase again. A second 180° pulse will generate a second  echo. This process can be repeated many times, producing many echoes, as long as the pure  T2 decay mechanisms have left some signal to work with (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 17</emphasis>). This repeating echo  train can be used to produce multiple images or can be used to greatly speed up the acqui- sition time using a method known as fast or turbo spin echo imaging.</para>

      <para>In order to perform MRI, the patient must be placed inside of some sort of magnet.   There are many factors that go into the design of a magnet used in an MR system. As stated  above, the higher the strength of the static magnetic field, the larger the number of excess  protons there are to produce the MR signal (which usually means better quality images).

      <para>Horizontal field magnets produce magnetic field lines that go out one end of the magnet,  loop around and go back the other end. Areas with the highest density of field lines have  the highest strength. However, it is the areas that have the most rapidly changing density of  field lines (i.e., the largest spatial gradients) that produce the greatest forces that can act on  ferromagnetic materials. In other words, it is these areas that represent the greatest danger  for items to become projectiles. Examples of projectiles that occurred in the MRI environ- ment may be seen at www.simplyphysics.com (9).</para>
      <para>The vast majority of high field strength MR scanners use superconducting electromag- nets to produce the main magnetic field. [Note that some low field MR systems use perma- nent magnets, which in the past have been limited to fields ≤ 0.35 T (10). More recently, a  few vendors have released permanent magnets of 0.4 and 0.5 T (11).] A simple four-loop  design of such a magnet used in an MR system is depicted in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 18</emphasis>. The two central  loops produce the majority of the field and the two outer loops help to shape it, to make it  more homogeneous. Note that the center of the magnet is where the field lines are most  closely packed meaning this is where the highest field strength is. The area marked as  “isocenter” is also referred to as the “sweet spot”, the region with the greatest magnetic  field uniformity.</para>
      <para>A current running through a loop of wire wrapped around a nail and attached to a battery  produces a small magnetic field. (Actually the nail isn’t needed, it just acts to intensify the  field.) The larger the current flowing, the greater the magnetic field produced. This type of  magnet is called a resistive electromagnet because the wire resists the flow of electrons.  This resistance to the current flow also produces heat. While larger currents can generate  higher magnetic fields, they will also produce considerable heat.</para>
      <para>Similar to resistive magnets, the field from a superconducting magnet is produced by  current flowing in multiple loops of wires. The wires are made out of niobium-titanium  which, when cooled to 9.5°K (9.5° above absolute zero), lose all resistance to current flow.  The coils are surrounded by liquid helium which boils at 4.2° K (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 19</emphasis>).

Once it is up to its full field  strength, the power supply is disconnected and the current will continue virtually for cen- turies (as long as it’s kept cold, of course).

      <para>The magnetic field lines depicted in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 18</emphasis> that extend outside of the magnet are  known as the fringe field. It is this fringe field that can cause problems with ferromagnetic  objects. In general, the five gauss line is the demarcation between what is considered safe  or a danger for certain objects. Modern-day MR systems use what is know as “active shield- ing”. An actively-shielded magnet has an inner or primary set of field coils that produces  more than the desired field with an outer or secondary set of field coils with a lower current  going in the opposite direction (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 20</emphasis>). The smaller opposite field partially cancels the  field at the center of the magnet but cancels a much larger portion on the outside. For ex- ample, the primary set coils might produce a positive 2 T field while the secondary coils  produce a negative 0.5 T, resulting in a net 1.5 T field at the center of the magnet but, be- cause the secondary coils are closer to the outside, they create a greater amount of cancel- lation.</para>

      <para>The advantage of modern actively-shielded magnets is that the five gauss line can be  restricted relatively close to the magnet. However, this also means that as one moves closer  to the bore of the magnet, the field strength rises rapidly over a relatively short distance  (i.e., a high spatial gradient magnetic field is present). Understandably, a relatively high  spatial gradient magnetic field can produce substantial issues for ferromagnetic objects. By  way of example, <emphasis role="bold">Figure 21</emphasis> shows a hospital bed lifted completely off the ground and stuck  to the front of a 3 T MR system.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Time-Varying Gradient Magnetic Fields </emphasis></para>
      <para>The main magnetic field, <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis>, discussed above is also known as the static magnetic  field, meaning that it never changes over time. In order to actually produce MR images, it  is necessary to apply a magnetic field that changes over time and space in a predictable  fashion. What is needed is to be able to produce a change that is linear moving away from  the magnet center, with positive changes in one direction and negative changes in the other.  (Note, the field at the center of the magnet never changes.) The field produced by a current  in a single loop of wire reaches a peak at the center of the coil and drops off non-linearly as  it move out (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22A</emphasis>). Obviously, this won’t suffice for MRI.</para>
      <para>However, if a second coil with a current flowing in the opposite direction is placed one  coil diameter away from the first, the fields from each coil totally cancel each other at the  point midway between them (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22B</emphasis>). The fields interact in such a way that they pro- duce an almost perfectly linear change in the area midway between them. The field change  then drops off as you move outside of the coils. This linear change (also known as a gradient)  is not only along the centerline between the two coils but remains linear for about half of  the center volume. If properly designed, this region of reasonable linearity corresponds with  the “sweet spot” or most homogeneous portion of the magnet. Note that the locations with  the greatest offset from the field at the center of the magnet are located near the center of  each loop. This is also the location of the greatest change in magnetic field per unit time,  dB/dt, during an imaging sequence.</para>
      <para>Every MR system has three orthogonal (perpendicular) sets of gradient coils (i.e., X-,  Y-, and Z-gradient coils) that are mounted on what is referred to as the “gradient tube” (12)</para>

      <para>(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 23</emphasis>). Current passing through these coils is rapidly turned on and off during the im- aging process and are referred to as time-varying gradient magnetic fields. A diagram de- picting the gradient activity during an MRI sequence showing how the gradient is turned  on and off, is known as a “pulse profile” (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 24</emphasis>). A typical imaging sequence diagram  will use pulse profiles to show the temporal relationship between each “gradient channel”,  X-, Y-, Z- and the RF transmitter/receiver (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 25</emphasis> to <emphasis role="bold">28</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>Every gradient system is characterized by two parameters: the peak gradient amplitude,  which primarily effects how small the field of view (FOV) may be, and the peak slew rate,  which is how fast the gradients can be turned on and off, which affects things like minimum  echo and/or repetition times. Between the two, a fast slew rate is usually better from an MR  imaging consideration than a high peak amplitude, however, faster slew rates cause more  safety-related issues, as will be discussed below.</para>
      <para>From the standpoint of MRI safety, these time-varying gradients raise two primary areas  of concern. The first is acoustic noise that is associated with the gradient magnetic fields  (13-15). An MR system can be compared to a giant speaker system. In a typical stereo  speaker, there is a small permanent magnet with loops of wire wrapped around it and the  magnet is attached to the center of a diaphragm. When an oscillating current is applied  through the wire, it creates a time-varying gradient magnetic field that pushes and pulls on  the permanent magnet, causing the supporting speaker diaphragm to vibrate.</para>
      <para>The static <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis> magnet of the MR system is like the speaker’s permanent magnet. The  imaging gradients are like the loop of wire wrapped around the permanent magnet. The gra- dient tube is like the diaphragm. During the imaging process, the imaging gradient can be  turned on and off in as little as 1-msec (corresponding to 1000-Hz) or as much as 20-msec  (corresponding to 50-Hz). This causes the imaging gradients to push and pull against the  main magnetic field, and the physical supporting structures, resulting in vibrations that  occur in the typical audio range. The higher the magnetic field, <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Ø</emphasis>, and the faster the im- aging sequence (higher slew rates), the louder the noise is that will be produced. The re- sulting acoustic noise can be at levels that may cause hearing damage if hearing protection  is not used in the MR system room. As shown in the pulse profile of <emphasis role="bold">Figure 24</emphasis>, imaging  gradients can be turned on and off rather abruptly (i.e., the trapezoidal lobe) or more grad- ually (i.e., the sinusoidal lobe). There are always trade-offs when designing an imaging se-</para>

      <para>quence (see below), but using the lowest amplitude and lowest slew rates possible helps to  minimize acoustic noise.</para>
      <para>One of the important properties of electromagnetism is that just as an electric current  creates a magnetic field, a time-varying gradient magnetic field can produce an electric cur- rent in any nearby conductor. This brings us to the other issue that is associated with time- varying gradient magnetic fields. The human body is an electrical conductor. If a patient  undergoing MRI has crossed-arms or crossed-legs, these may create a closed loop for current  to flow under certain imaging conditions. The rapidly changing imaging gradients can in- duce current to flow across the body and peripheral nerve stimulation may occur (16). The  area near the center of the coils in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 22B</emphasis> is the location of the largest dB/dt, so it is at  this location where the greatest danger of induced currents exists with respect to peripheral  nerve stimulation. Note that at the center of the magnet, the gradients do not produce any  change in the magnetic field, so this is where the potential for nerve stimulation is the least.</para>
      <para>To summarize, the potential problems caused by time-varying gradient magnetic fields  are, as follows: (1) acoustic noise and (2) peripheral nerve stimulation. The more rapidly  the gradients change and the higher the amplitude, the greater the risks. Importantly, for pa- tients with electronically-activated devices, the location of the greatest risk is not at the cen- ter of the MR system but at the outer edges of the gradient coils where the absolute changes  in the magnetic fields per unit time (i.e., dB/dt) is the highest.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">RF Coils and RF Power Deposition </emphasis></para>
      <para>As discussed above, MRI requires the use of a radio transmitter to provide the RF ex- citation pulses. Every scanner has a built in body RF coil (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 19</emphasis>) which is used for  many of the imaging sequences. Alternatively, the RF excitation pulses can be applied by  a smaller transmit RF coil, most commonly designed for imaging either the patient’s head  or a knee. While some of the applied RF energy that is absorbed ends up producing the MRI  signal, most of it actually results in tissue heating of the patient (17). The amount of RF  power absorbed by the body increases approximately with the square of the field strength.  Accordingly, at higher static magnetic fields, there can be an inherent danger of over-heating  the patient (17). The mass normalized rate at which RF energy is coupled to biological tissue  is characterized by the specific absorption rate (SAR) and is reported in W/kg relative to  the use of a particular pulse sequence and the body weight of the patient.</para>
      <para>The built in transmit body RF coil deposits RF energy over a relatively large area of  the patient. Even if only a small amount of tissue is actually being imaged, a large amount  of tissue will absorb much of the transmitted energy. By comparison, smaller transmit/re- ceive RF coils have a limited volume of coverage and result in greatly reduced RF power  deposition. Additionally, a class of RF coils known as quadrature (quadrature is an engi- neering term that has nothing to do with the number four) coils result in less power depo- sition than comparably-sized linear coils. Notably, this information has implications for  scanning patients with certain types of biomedical implants insofar as it may be necessary  to prevent substantial implant heating by limiting the MRI examination to the use of a trans- mit/receive head RF coil only, versus performing the MRI procedure using a transmit body  RF coil and a receive-only head coil (e.g., certain neurostimulation systems used for spinal  cord stimulation have these particular conditions specified in the MRI labeling).</para>

      <para>While there are many different types of imaging sequences used for MRI, most have  three basic steps in common which are: (1) Exciting a slice or slab of tissue by using a slice  select gradient combined with one or more RF excitation pulses. In an axial image, the Z- gradient is the slice select gradient. (2) Applying one (2D) or two (3D) spatial encoding  gradients known as phase encoding pulses. The details of how this works are beyond the  scope of this chapter. In an axial plane 2D image, the phase encoding direction can be in ei- ther the X-direction (i.e., left/right) or the Y-direction (i.e., anterior/posterior). For the mo- ment, let’s assume it is in the Y-direction. For a three dimensional image, there will also be  a phase encode pulse in the Z or slice select direction. (3) Reading out the MRI signal while  applying a third spatial encoding gradient known as the frequency encoding gradient.</para>
      <para>The pulse diagrams of two of the simplest imaging sequences, a basic gradient echo  (GRE) (18), also known as a field echo (FE) and a basic spin echo (SE) are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">25</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 26</emphasis>, respectively (8). As was previously discussed (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 16</emphasis>), a SE sequence  requires two RF pulses while, as shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 25</emphasis>, a GRE sequence uses a single RF  pulse. The SE pulse sequence is most commonly used for T1-weighted imaging incorpo- rating a 90°/180° pair of RF pulses. The GRE pulse sequence can use virtually any flip  angle, which then impacts the type of image-weighting that results, in part, by the combi- nation of the flip angle, echo time (TE) and repetition time (TR). Typically, flip angles from  20° to 40° are used for T2*-weighting and flip angles from 70° to 90° are used for T1-weight- ing. The key point here is that, with only one RF pulse, the RF power deposition, or SAR,  is substantially lower with GRE sequences than with SE sequences. This is particularly im- portant on MRI examinations using MR systems operating at 3 T or higher.</para>

This type of sequence can have an echo train length (ETL) as short as two to four for  T1-weighted or proton density-weighting, or moderate echo train lengths of eight to 32 for  T2-weighted imaging, or as long as 128 to 256 for MRI procedures such as single shot myel- ograms or cholangiograms (20, 21). The advantage of using a FSE pulse sequence is the  decreased acquisition time that is due to acquiring multiple echoes or lines of data during  one repetition time (TR) interval.</para>

      <para>With all of the associated gradient activity, a FSE pulse sequence may suffer from the  consequences of time-varying gradient magnetic fields discussed earlier. More importantly,  particularly at 1.5-T and higher fields, all of the 180° RF pulses significantly increase the  specific absorption rate (SAR) level. Accordingly, the MR system reported SAR may exceed  the recommended FDA limits for specific absorption rate. When this happens, there are five  possible options: (1) Increase the repetition time (TR) so that the average power per unit  time goes down. (2) Decrease the total number of slices acquired per TR (3, 17), as half the  number of slices means half the RF power. (3) Use the technique known as Half-Fourier  imaging (22). This takes advantage of the symmetry in MRI raw data to reduce the number  of lines of data required (and the associated acquisition time and RF power) by roughly one  half. The disadvantage to this is that it reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by the square  root of two. (4) Use refocusing RF pulses less than 180°. The amount of RF energy per RF  pulse of a given duration is proportional to the square of the flip angle so a 180° RF pulse  deposits four times as much as a 90° pulse of the same length. Reduce the flip angle of a  large number of RF pulses and the total SAR will be decreased. (5) Use “low SAR” RF  pulses. The amount of RF energy per RF pulse of given amplitude is proportional to the  duration of the pulse. Instead of doubling the amplitude of the 90° RF pulse to obtain a 180°  flip, you can double the duration. This will reduce the specific absorption rate in half but  will also result in much longer time between echoes reducing the number of echoes possible  per repetition time (TR) thereby increasing the total scan time.</para>
      <para>Reducing the flip angle of the refocusing pulse does reduce the SAR, but with all things  in MRI, there are tradeoffs. In terms of refocusing spins that are going out of phase due to  T2* affects (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 16</emphasis>), a 180° pulse is optimal. Reducing the refocusing flip angle from  180° to 140° for a single echo will reduce the effectiveness by about 12%. The effect on  the signal-to-noise (SNR) when using multiple refocusing pulses becomes very complicated  but suffice to say that the SNR is maximum with 180° pulses and goes down from there.  While RF power deposition is mainly a problem at higher static magnetic field strengths,</para>

The RF excitation  utilizes a single 90°/180° pair so the SAR levels associated with these pulse sequences are  usually not a problem.

      <para>The goal of most clinical MRI examinations is to achieve the best quality that is possible  in the shortest acquisition time. Over the years, gradient slew rates have increased dramat- ically, improving the imaging speed of many techniques (such as FSE and EPI discussed  above). However, there is still a physical limit as to how fast gradients can be turned on  and off as well as the practical limit that exists to prevent problems such as peripheral nerve  stimulation. The main purpose of the imaging gradients is to impart spatial information to  the MRI signal. One might ask is there any other way of obtaining at least some of the  spatial information?</para>
      <para>As discussed earlier, with the exception of transmit/received RF coils such as those  used for the knee or head, most MRI procedures use the body RF coil for excitation and  passive receive-only coils to detect the MRI signal. Modern-day MR systems use multi- channel phased-array (PA) RF coils that are designed for specific, limited anatomical cov- erage. These PA coils consist of multiple small coils (anywhere from two to 64) where each  coil is sensitive to signal from only a portion of the FOV. A very simple four channel con- figuration typical of early torso phase-array coils is shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 29</emphasis>. In this case, four  images are produced, one from the signal obtained from each coil, which are then combined  to make a single composite image. Roughly speaking, the SNR of the final image obtained  with a PA coil increases by the square root of the number of channels used (24).</para>

      <para>of a class of parallel imaging reconstruction methods, utilize the known or measured sen- sitivity profile of each individual coil to impart some spatial information. This makes it pos- sible to reduce the number of phase encoding (PE) steps that are required for virtually any  imaging technique. As the number of PE steps goes down, so does the total SAR. If the ac- quisition time is reduced by a factor of two, then the SAR is cut in half. If the acquisition  time is reduced by a factor of four, then the SAR is cut to one-fourth. Theoretically, while  it is possible to “speed up” a scan by a factor equal to the number of different coil elements,  in practice the speed up factors are usually less than four. The main reason for this limitation  is that while the acquisition time may be faster, the SNR of the final image is proportional  to the square root of the number of actual phase encoding views used. If the scan is speeded  up by a factor of four, the SNR is cut in half. Therefore, while high field strength MR sys- tems have an initially high SNR, there is a limit as to how much SNR can be “thrown away”.</para>
      <para>One final cautionary note about parallel imaging techniques: some MRI centers may  decide to use “speed up” factors of two or three but then are unhappy with the SNR of the  final images. Therefore, these MRI facilities use two or three signal averages for the pulse  sequence. Of course, that just takes the acquisition time back to what it would have been  without the use of parallel imaging. In fact, parallel imaging reconstruction can actually  add artifacts to the image, particularly if the patient moves. Thus, parallel imaging should  only be used with one signal average. If better SNR is desired, it is best to not use parallel  imaging.</para>

      <para>As of 2020 there are at least 16 different companies that manufacture and sell FDA ap- proved MR systems in the United States with static magnetic field strengths ranging from  0.2 T to 7 T (11). An obvious question to ask is, is there an optimal field strength for MRI?  The simple answer is, no. A better question is, what are the various tradeoffs at different  field strengths? In this final section, many considerations including safety issues when se- lecting a magnetic field strength for a clinical MR scanner will be presented. A more thor- ough discussion of the physics of MRI safety is presented in another chapter in this textbook.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Cost </emphasis></para>
      <para>As a general rule of thumb, the cost of an MR scanner is around $1M per Tesla (28).  The cost will also go up with the number of RF coils and the number of channels the system  can handle. Furthermore, higher field magnets are usually larger and heavier and have more  expensive siting requirements. Choosing an MR system requires a careful examination of  the cost-to-benefit ratio.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Signal-To-Noise </emphasis></para>
      <para>As was illustrated in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>, the number of excess protons that align with the static  magnetic field goes up linearly with field strength. It is these excess protons that are used  to produce the MR image. Therefore, the signal strength goes up with the field strength.  While there are many other issues that affect SNR, such as the differences of RF penetration  and sources of RF noise at different field strengths, as well RF coil design, the number of</para>

      <para>channels, differences in relaxation time constants and details of the imaging sequences, in  general, the SNR goes up linearly with the field strength (29-31).</para>
      <para>This extra SNR can be utilized to obtain higher resolution images in the same scan time  or to keep the overall resolution constant but with shorter scans, meaning potentially higher  patient throughput. Because the SNR of a scan is proportional to the square root of the scan  time, to get the same SNR of a four minute scan at 1.5 T would only require a one minute  scan at 3 T. (Of course what usually happens at 3 T is that a higher resolution scan is obtained  at some slightly shorter scan time.) At higher static magnetic fields it is also possible to per- form techniques that inherently have low SNR such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and  functional MRI (fMRI) (32-33). However, for these techniques there are still tradeoffs. For  example, scanning at 3 T may be roughly four times faster than at 1.5 T, but problems with  image distortion also go up proportional to field strength.</para>
      <para>In addition to the inherent higher SNR at higher field strengths, most high and ultra- high field scanners utilize phased array coils with a high number of channels, typically be- tween 8 and 32 channels or even as high as 64. As was stated above, the SNR increases,  roughly, with the square root of the number of channels providing more opportunities for  faster and/or higher resolution scans. Of course, the greater the number of channels, the  higher the monetary cost.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Tissue Heating (SAR) </emphasis></para>
      <para>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has set guidelines for the specific  absorption rate (SAR) during a clinical MRI examination (<emphasis role="bold">Table 4</emphasis>). It is important to note  that these guidelines are independent of the strength of the static magnetic field. Because  the RF power deposited in the body increases roughly with the square of the magnetic field  (17, 31, 34-36) higher field strength scanners are more likely to bump up against these  limits, (1.5 T occasionally, 3 T and up quite frequently).</para>
      <para>There are a number of approaches to reducing SAR and/or its impact on the patient but  most of them have noticeable drawbacks. Just a few of the approaches presented by Allison  and Yansak are, as follows (36):</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Acoustic Noise </emphasis></para>
      <para>One of the most commonly asked questions about an MR scanner is, why is it so noisy?  As was discussed above in the section on time-varying gradient magnetic fields, an MRI  system is comparable to a stereo speaker. The force that causes the vibrations is known as  the Lorentz force and is described for a single charged particle moving through a magnetic  field as (34):</para>
      <para>Where q is the charge of a particle, <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">v</emphasis></emphasis> is the velocity of the charge and <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">L</emphasis></emphasis> is the Lorentz  force. If we change q, the charge of a single particle, to Q, the total charge going through a  wire, then the product <emphasis role="bold">Q</emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italics">v</emphasis></emphasis> is effectively the current in the wire which determines the strength  of the applied gradient. We see from this that the relevant forces that result in the acoustic  noise go up with both the magnetic field and the amplitude of the imaging gradients. Typ- ically, low field magnets have low amplitude gradients with low slew rates and high field  magnets have higher amplitudes with higher slew rates.</para>
      <para>Price, et al. (34) reported typical acoustic noise levels of approximately 83 dB(A) on a  0.23 T low field open MR system and over 118 dB(A) on a 3 T scanner. These investigators  found that pulse sequence parameters (particularly FOV and TR) had a greater effect on the  acoustic noise level than did the field strength. However, it should be noted that high field  systems typically utilize smaller FOVs and faster scans, inherently resulting in greater  acoustic noise.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Flying Objects (Projectiles) </emphasis></para>
      <para>It is well known that ferromagnetic objects are attracted to magnets and, thus, they  should not be brought near an MR scanner lest the object become a projectile. Does the  danger go up with the field strength? Not necessarily! The translational force exerted on a  ferromagnetic object as it is moved near a magnet is not dependent on the strength of the</para>

      <para>magnet but, rather, it is dependent on the rate of change or spatial gradient of the magnetic  field (35). At the magnet isocenter, where the field is fairly homogenous, there is almost no  translational force regardless of the field strength. However, consider the case of two whole  body magnets, a 1.5 T and 3 T. Typically, the 5 gauss line is somewhere just past the foot  of the patient table or maybe near the scan room door. Between the 5 gauss line and the  center of the magnet there is a region where the magnetic field changes fairly rapidly. If the  design of the two magnets are similar, then the maximum spatial gradient of the 3 T scanner  will be roughly twice that of the 1.5 T scanner. However, you could have one design where  most of the change of the 1.5 T field occurs over a shorter distance, say 0.5 meter while a  3 T magnet may be designed to have most of the change occur over a 1.0 meter distance.  The spatial gradient magnetic fields would be similar. That being said, the higher the static  magnetic field, the greater the likelihood is that it will have a higher spatial gradient and a  greater danger of projectile-related incidence objects.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Artifacts </emphasis></para>
      <para>Another consideration for image quality is the presence of imaging artifacts. In general,  higher field strengths are more prone to motion artifacts (37). While it is easier to do fat  suppression at higher fields, they can also suffer from chemical shift artifacts (38). Suscep- tibility artifacts also increase with magnetic field strength and may be very problematic in  the presence of metallic implants (38, 39). One of the biggest sources of artifacts at high  field strengths, and the last topic for this chapter, is the dielectric effect.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">RF Penetration and the Dielectric Effect </emphasis></para>
      <para>With all imaging sequences, image contrast depends greatly on the type of RF pulse(s)  used. The assumption is that all of the protons in the field of view (FOV) experience roughly  the same levels of RF during the imaging sequence. In other words, we assume that the RF  field (also known as the B1 field) is fairly uniform across the FOV. With a well-designed  transmit RF coil, at 1.5 T and lower, this is a reasonable assumption. However, at higher  field strengths than 1.5 T, dielectric effects can cause substantial variation in the B1 field  across the FOV which, in turn, can cause significant variations in signal amplitude and/or  contrast in an image (35, 40-42).</para>
      <para>The dielectric constant, ε<emphasis role="italics">r</emphasis>, of water (which predominates in the human body) is approx- imately 80 (in a vacuum it is 1.0). The wavelength of radio waves moving through a medium  other than a vacuum is reduced by the square root of ε<emphasis role="italics">r</emphasis>, or in this case roughly a factor of  9. At 3 T, with a resonance frequency of 128 MHz, the wavelength in a vacuum is 235 cm  but in the human body it is approximately 26 cm. This is on the same order as the dimensions  of the human body, particularly of the torso. As a result, “standing waves” can form inside  of the body resulting in peaks and troughs of different effective RF strength or flip angles.  At 7 T the wavelength drops to around 11 cm and you get substantial dielectric effects in  the brain, as well.</para>
      <para>When using simple gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequences to image a uniform phantom,  the signal amplitude is determined by the amount of spins tipped onto the XY plane and is  proportional to the sine of the flip angle (ignoring T1, T2, TR and TE). <emphasis role="bold">Figure 30</emphasis> depicts  a series of images obtained on a Siemens 1.5 T Aera and a Siemens 3 T Skyra using a GRE</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 30A</emphasis> shows axial, coronal, and sagittal MR images acquired using a water filled  phantom on a 1.5 T scanner. The dark ring in each image shows where in the phantom the  spins were all tipped the full 720°. The brighter regions show where spins experience either  a little more RF or a little less. (Remember, most MR images are magnitude images. If they  had been “real” or “complex”, then any spins experiencing more than 720° would have a  positive signal and less than 720° would have a negative signal.) Unfortunately, with this  single GRE sequence, it is not possible to tell exactly how much more or less than 720° the  other spins experienced. The important thing to note about these images is that the signal  distribution is rather simple, moderately uniform, and with good circular symmetry.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis> shows the same water filled phantom imaged on the 3 T MR system. These  images are much more complicated, with multiple bands or regions of bright and dark signal.  The dark signal occurs everywhere a spin experiences a flip angle that is close to a multiple  of 180°, most likely either 540° of 720°. The brightest regions occur where the flip angle is  a multiple of 180° ± 90°, most likely 630°, with the grey signal somewhere in between. The  situation is actually still more complex. Not only does the RF have to penetrate the phantom  and excite the spins, the signals from these spins have to make it back out to the RF coil,  further complicating the interpretation of these images.</para>

General Electric uses poly(dimethylsiloxane) or silicone based oils which have  a dielectric constant less than 3.

      <para>While the images in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 30</emphasis> help to visualize the problem of the dielectric effect they  lack detailed quantitative information. There are many approaches to provide better maps  of the B1 distribution (43-48) the details of which are beyond the scope of this chapter.  Siemens provides in their standard service protocol library a sequence, (rf_map), where the  amplitude of each pixel in the phase image is directly proportional to the effective flip angle  at that pixel assuming that a nominal 90° RF pulse is applied. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 31</emphasis> shows two 3 T  axial B1 field maps obtained with this sequence. A contour map has been super-imposed on  the phase images with the actual flip angles. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 31A</emphasis> was obtained using the water filled  phantom and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 31B</emphasis> the oil filled phantom. Note that the contours agree with the axial  images in <emphasis role="bold">Figures 30B</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">D</emphasis>. The actual flip angles in the water phantom show extensive  spatial fluctuation and range from a low of 69° on the left and right ‘wings’ to a high of 90°  at the exact center. The average flip angle is 77.1° ± 5.3°. In contrast, the oil filled phantom  smoothly changes from about 83° at the center to 93° in the upper left corner with a mean  of 87.2° ± 2.5°. While not shown, at 1.5 T, both phantoms yielded a mean flip angle of  about 87° ± 2°) This shows that an oil filled phantom can be used to evaluate the perform- ance of an RF coil without the complication of the dielectric effects.</para>
      <para>The final question is, how does this affect clinical MR images? This is not an easy ques- tion to answer because it depends on the type of pulse sequence being used. The greater the  number of RF pulses used, the greater the effect. For this discussion, let’s only consider a  few simple pulse sequences. In each case, we shall call the excitation RF pulse alpha (α)  and any refocusing pulse(s), <emphasis role="bold">2</emphasis>α.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Gradient Echo:</emphasis> This is the simplest sequence with only a single α RF pulse. If you  have a long TR so that all of the spins have full Mz recovery, then the signal amplitude is  proportional to sin(α). Since sin(90) = 1.0, the maximum signal is obtained with a 90° flip</para>

      <para>angle. The average flip angle in the water filled phantom of <emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis> was 77.1° and  sin(77.1) = 0.975, so there is less than a 3% decrease in signal. Where the flip angle is 69°  (the minimum value shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis>) there is a 7% loss in signal. However, because  the spins are <emphasis role="italics">not</emphasis> flipped all the way down to the XY plane, they don’t take as long to recover  back to Mz=Ø, so T1 contrast can be reduced.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Spin Echo</emphasis>: This is the next level up in complexity. An ideal spin echo has a 90° excita- tion pulse and a 180° refocusing pulse. However, any two RF pulses will generate what is  known as a Hahn Echo (8) and the signal amplitude is proportional to the product  sin(α1)•sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α2/2), ignoring T1 recovery. In our case α2 = 2α1 so the product becomes  sin(α1)•sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α1) = sin<superscript>3</superscript>(α) If α = 90°, then the product equals 1.0. If α = 77.1, then the prod- uct equals 0.93, a loss of 7%. At α = 69°, the product equals 0.81, so a loss of 19%. If the  TR is short as for a T1-weighted image, then things become complicated. If we assume that  the TE is short relative to the T2 decay rate, then most of the spins effectively experience  an α+2α=3α flip angle. When α = 90°, then that is 270° or completely on the XY plane  (Mz = Ø). However, if α = 70° then this becomes 210° or just 30° past 180° meaning that  most of the spins are much closer to the -Mz axis than they are the XY plane and, therefore,  will take longer to recover resulting in greater T1 contrast.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Fast Spin Echo</emphasis>: One would expect that each additional non-optimal refocusing pulse  would further reduce the MR signal. However, this is not the case. While the first echo in  the echo train is just like the spin echo discussed above and is reduced by sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α2/2) (49,  50), the longer echo train drives the magnetization into a pseudo-steady state with a signal  that is reduced by only sin(α2/2). Again, since α2 = 2α1 the net signal is proportional to  sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α), (squared instead of cubed). If α = 90°, then the product equals 1.0. If α = 77.1, then  the product equals 0.95, a loss of 5%. At α = 69°, the product equals 0.87, so a loss of 13%.</para>
      <para>The analysis of other types of imaging pulse sequences is beyond the scope of this text.  Suffice to say that the non-uniformities in the B1 field at higher static magnetic field  strengths caused by dielectric effects seriously complicate image contrast. However, there  has been much work done to reduce these effects such as the use of dielectric pads (51-54)  or multi-channel, transmit RF coils (51-58).</para>

      <para>This chapter presented information on the basic MRI physics that are involved in cre- ating exquisite images of human anatomy. The same physics helps us to understand the po- tential risks and problems associated with MRI technology and guides us in how to deal  with those issues. There is no one optimal static magnetic field strength to use, instead there  are a long list of tradeoffs which must be carefully considered. MRI is a safe and effective  imaging modality as long as careful attention is given to established safety policies and pro- cedures (59). The other chapters in this textbook provide comprehensive details related to  the bioeffects, safety, and patient management aspects of MRI.</para>
