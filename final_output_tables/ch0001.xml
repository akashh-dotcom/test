      <para>Most medical professionals today are well aware of the fact that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology uses systems with powerful magnets that make considerable amounts of noise and that you generally cannot bring ferromagnetic objects or patients with certain implants into the scanner room. However, these individuals may not be aware that MR systems use relatively safe radiofrequency (RF) radiation instead of ionizing radiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, etc.) to create images and they may not understand just how powerful the magnets are, why they may always be "on" and why they make so much noise. This chapter provides simple explanations for these matters by presenting information pertaining to basic MRI physics.</para>
      <para>MRI has at its root the chemical technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance or NMR (1, 2). As every chemist knows, the use of the word "nuclear" has nothing to do with radioactivity, but since the general population is not composed of mostly chemists, the medical community has dropped that emotionally laden word to become, simply, MRI. For most MRI examinations, the word "nuclear" has to do with the nucleus of the hydrogen atom, which consists of a single proton. The content of this chapter will begin by examining the magnetic properties of protons and then continue with an explanation of the MRI signal, some basic tissue properties, spin echo formation, and conclude with a brief discussion of MRI hardware issues. Much of the information in this chapter is adapted from<emphasis role="italics">All You Really Need to Know About MRI Physics</emphasis> (3). Several other textbooks also cover this introductory material (4-7).</para>

            <para>A moving electric charge, be it positive or negative, produces a magnetic field. The faster a charge moves or the larger the charge, the larger the magnetic field it produces. Think back to when you were a child and would make a crude electromagnet by wrapping wire around a nail and connecting it to a battery. The larger the voltage of the battery, the larger the current and the stronger the magnet.</para>
            <para>Some of the basic properties of a simple proton include mass, a positive electric charge and spin. Granted, a proton does not have a very large electric charge, but it does spin very fast and, therefore, does produce a very small, yet significant, magnetic field. Water is the largest source of hydrogen protons in the body, followed by fat. Normally, the direction that these tiny magnets point in is randomly distributed (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1A</emphasis>).</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> Spinning protons are little magnets which are frequently referred to as "spins".</para>

            <para>Just as a compass aligns with the Earth's magnetic field, a spinning proton placed near (or within) a large external magnetic field (called<emphasis role="bold">B0</emphasis>) will align with the external field. Unfortunately, it is not quite so simple. At the atomic level, some of the protons align with the field and some align against the field, cancelling each other out. A slight excess will align with the field so that the net result is an alignment with the external field. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1B</emphasis> depicts nine protons, four of which have aligned <emphasis role="italics">against</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">B0</emphasis> and five have aligned <emphasis role="italics">with</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">B0</emphasis> resulting in an excess of one proton. (Note that this diagram showing the protons aligning perfectly with or against <emphasis role="bold">B0</emphasis> is not completely accurate. This will be addressed further with <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>.)</para>

            <title>Some Quantum Physics</title>
            <para>A complete explanation of why the protons align both with and against the external magnetic field would require a study of quantum mechanics. Suffice it to say that both alignments are possible but the one<emphasis role="italics">with</emphasis> the field is at a lower energy state. The protons are con-</para>
            <para>tinually oscillating back and forth between the two states but at any given instant, and with a large enough sample, there will be a very slight majority aligned with the field. The larger the external static magnetic field, the greater the difference in energy levels and the larger the excess number aligned with the field.<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> demonstrates this for a sample of two million protons. At 1 T there are just six extra protons. At 1.5 T, there are only nine extra protons for every two million. At 3 T there are 18 and at 7 T, the highest field strength used in the clinical setting, there are 42 excess protons for every two million. The number of excess protons is directly proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 2.</emphasis> The number of excess protons aligned with the B<subscript>0</subscript> field is directly proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field. At 1.5 T, for every two million protons there are nine more protons aligned with the field than there are aligned against the field. At 3 T, there are 18 excess protons.</para>
            <para>As will be discussed more fully later in this chapter, the MR signal comes from just these excess protons. With only nine out of two million protons (at 1.5 T) in excess, one might ask how can we even detect such a small signal? We shall answer that question by first asking a different question: how many excess protons are there in a single imaging voxel? (A voxel is a three-dimensional or volume pixel.) Without going into the math in great detail, assume a voxel dimension of 1-mm x 1-mm x 5-mm = 0.005-cm<superscript>3</superscript> or 0.005-ml. Using Avogadro's Number, we can calculate that there are a total of 3.4 x 10<superscript>20</superscript> water protons in a 0.005-ml voxel. If nine out of every two million protons are in excess, then there are a total of 1.5 x 10<superscript>15</superscript> protons in every voxel that will contribute to the MR signal (or, on the order of a million billion protons). The important lesson here is that even though a spinning proton is a very poor magnet, the number of excess protons that align with the field is so large that we can basically ignore quantum mechanics and focus on the classical mechanics description.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Key Definition:</emphasis> The total magnetic field of the excess protons is defined as <emphasis role="bold">M0</emphasis>.</para>
            <para>While it was stated above that, due to the large number of excess protons, we can pretty much ignore quantum physics, there is still one issue that is best discussed using quantum physics terminology. The relationship between the energy (E) of a photon or a unit of electromagnetic radiation and its frequency (ν) (the Greek symbol 'nu') is described by the Planck's equation:</para>
            <para>E = h ν                                                                                                                                    (1)</para>

          <title>Basic MRI Physics: Implications for MRI Safety</title>
          <para>Where h is known as Planck's constant. In simple words, the energy of electromagnetic radiation goes up directly with the frequency of the radiation.<emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> lists the approximate frequency ranges for different types of electromagnetic radiation. As will be discussed in detail shortly, MRI uses radio waves with frequencies around 10<superscript>7</superscript>-Hz (cycles per second). Most other radiology imaging techniques (e.g., X-ray, computed tomography, and nuclear medicine) use ionizing radiation with frequencies in the 10<superscript>18</superscript>- to 10<superscript>19</superscript>-Hz range or roughly 10<superscript>12</superscript> larger than those used in MRI. Accordingly, X-rays are roughly a trillion times more "energetic" (and potentially damaging) than radio waves. MRI is able to provide such great images not because of the high energy involved (like computed tomography) but because of the large number of protons found in the body, primarily in water and fat.</para>

            <para>Three spinning dreidels (i.e., a toy top traditionally used during Chanukah) are shown in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>. Imagine the first one is spinning on the international space station. In the absence of gravity, it behaves just like a gyroscope and spins without wobbling. Imagine the second one is spinning on the moon. In the low gravity of the moon, the Dreidel will wobble rather slowly. The third dreidel is spinning on the Earth and wobbles faster than the dreidel on the moon. Imagine a fourth dreidel somewhere on Jupiter (if you could find a solid surface, that is). That dreidel would be wobbling the fastest yet.</para>

            <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 3.</emphasis> Dreidels (toy tops) rapidly spin about their axis while at the same time they wobble or "precess" at a rate that depends on the strength of the gravity field.</para>
            <para>Previously, a spinning proton was described as being a very tiny magnet. Just as a spinning dreidel wobbles about its axis, so do spinning protons wobble, or precess, about the axis of the external B<subscript>0</subscript> field. The frequency of the precession is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field and is defined by the Larmor Equation:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italics">Memorize this!</emphasis> ω<subscript>0</subscript> = γB<subscript>0</subscript>                    (2)</para>
            <para>Where, ω<subscript>0</subscript> is known as either the precessional, Larmor or resonance frequency and γ (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio and is a constant unique to every atom. For a simple proton, γ = 42.56-MHz/T. As before, B<subscript>0</subscript> represents the externally applied static magnetic field. At the magnetic field strengths used in clinical MR systems, 0.2 to 7 T, the resonance frequency of hydrogen ranges from 8.5-MHz to 298-MHz (8.5 x 10<superscript>6</superscript>-Hz to 2.98 x 10<superscript>8</superscript>-Hz). In Table 1, it is shown that this range is in the radiofrequency (RF) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.</para>
            <para>As such, it is now apparent how<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1B</emphasis> was slightly inaccurate. The spins do align roughly with (or against) the static magnetic field but, if you could take a freeze frame snapshot of all of the protons in a voxel, you would see that each individual proton is slightly tilted. However, remember that the protons are each precessing at faster than ten million times per second, so if you take the average position of the vectors over even a very short amount of time, they will each be aligned either perfectly with, or perfectly against, the main magnetic field.</para>

            </para>
            <para>If an electromagnetic radiofrequency (RF) pulse is applied at the resonance (Larmor, precession, wobble) frequency, then the protons can absorb that energy. At the quantum level, a single proton "jumps" to a higher energy state. At the macro or classical level, to an observer in the external or laboratory frame of reference, the magnetization vector, M<subscript>0</subscript>, (roughly a million billion protons) spirals down towards the XY plane (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4A</emphasis>). If you could somehow jump aboard M<subscript>0</subscript>, just like onto a merry-go-round, the laboratory would be seem to be rotating around you. In this rotating frame of reference, M<subscript>0</subscript> would seem to smoothly tip down (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4B</emphasis>). The tip angle is a function of the strength and duration of the RF pulse. The absorption of the energy from the applied RF excitation pulse can be</para>

            <para>When the spins are first tilted down to the XY-plane, they are all in-phase. Think of a playground with a million children on swings. If all of the children are going up and down together, at exactly the same rate, then they are swinging in-phase. Assuming that all the children are pumping their legs with the same force and frequency, then they will stay in-phase. But if one child stops pumping for a few seconds and another child pumps a little harder or a little faster, then they will start to get out of sync with everyone else. The same type of thing happens to the spins. For reasons that will be described later, some protons spin a little faster while others spin a little slower (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). Very quickly, they get out of phase relative to some reference (usually the spins at the center of the magnet).</para>

An isolated proton, far from any other proton (or electron), is only affected by the main magnetic field,<emphasis role="bold">BO</emphasis>. As protons (or spins) move together (e.g., due to random motion), their magnetic fields begin to interact. If the field from one proton increases the field that the second proton feels, while the field from the second proton reduces the field that the first proton feels, then the second proton will precess at a slightly faster rate, while the first proton will precess slightly slower (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11A</emphasis>). If the fields from both protons add to the main field, then both protons will precess more rapidly (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11B</emphasis>). As soon as the spins move farther apart, their fields no longer interact and they both return to the original frequency but at different phases. This type of interaction is called spin-spin interaction. These temporary, random interactions cause a cumulative loss of phase across the excited spins resulting in an overall loss of signal.</para>

          <title>FREE INDUCTION DECAY (FID) AND SPIN ECHO FORMATION</title>
          <para>To summarize what has been covered so far, after the RF transmitter is turned off, the protons immediately begin to re-radiate the absorbed energy. If nothing is affecting the homogeneity of the magnetic field, all of the protons will spin at the same resonance frequency. The initial amplitude of the signal is determined by the portion of the magnetization vector (M<subscript>0</subscript>) that has been tipped into the XY-plane. This, in turn, is determined by the sine of the flip angle, α. The maximum resonant signal is obtained when the flip angle is 90°. [Note: sine (0°) = 0, sine (90°) = 1.0] The signal unaffected by any gradient is known as a Free Induction Decay (FID) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>). The time constant that determines the rate of decay is called T<subscript>2</subscript>.</para>

          <para>In the real world, the MR signal decays faster than T<subscript>2</subscript> would predict. Pure T<subscript>2</subscript> decay is a function of completely random interactions between spins. The assumption is that the main external B<subscript>0</subscript> field is absolutely homogeneous. In reality, there are many factors creating imperfections in the homogeneity of a magnetic field. The main magnet itself will have flaws related to the manufacturing process. Every tissue has a different magnetic susceptibility which distorts the field at tissue borders, particularly at air/tissue interfaces. Additionally, patients may have some type of metallic implants (e.g., clips, staples, heart valves, etc.) which cause disruptions of the magnetic field. The sum total of all of these random and fixed effects is called T<subscript>2</subscript>* (pronounced "T-two star") (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 14</emphasis>).</para>

          <para>Thus, T<subscript>2</subscript> relaxation comes from random causes while T<subscript>2</subscript>* comes from a combination of both random and fixed causes. There is nothing that can be done to prevent or compensate for random losses in-phase, but what about the fixed effects? Can anything be done about these losses? The answer is yes.</para>
          <para>Consider the following race (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15A</emphasis>). The contestants are a turtle, a bicyclist, a pace car, an airplane, and a rocket. At the start of the race, everyone is together (in-phase.) Once the race starts (at t = 0), the contestants all move out, each at their fastest pace. Soon, there is a noticeable distance between them.</para>
          <para>After some time, let's call it TE/2, a signal is given for everyone to turn around and go back. Assuming that everyone is still going at the same rate as before, then after an additional time, TE/2, they all arrive at the starting/finish line together (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15B</emphasis>). In terms of MRI, at the time TE (TE/2 + TE/2), all the spins are back in-phase, producing a large signal. This large signal is called a spin echo and the time TE is called the echo time (δ).</para>

(The astute observer will note that the arrows drawn to represent the 180° rotation about the X'-axis go above the X'Y'-plane, not below it. This is true only if a negative 180° pulse is what is actually used. Whether a positive or negative 180° is used, or one that rotates about the Y'-axis instead of the X'-axis, the end result is the same.)</para>
          <para>As described above, a 180° pulse can be used to reverse the T<subscript>2</subscript>* dephasing process and, thereby, produce a spin echo. As soon as the spins all come back into phase at the echo time, they immediately start to go out of phase again. A second 180° pulse will generate a second echo. This process can be repeated many times, producing many echoes, as long as the pure T<subscript>2</subscript> decay mechanisms have left some signal to work with (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 17</emphasis>). This repeating echo train can be used to produce multiple images or can be used to greatly speed up the acquisition time using a method known as fast or turbo spin echo imaging.</para>

          <para>In order to perform MRI, the patient must be placed inside of some sort of magnet. There are many factors that go into the design of a magnet used in an MR system. As stated above, the higher the strength of the static magnetic field, the larger the number of excess protons there are to produce the MR signal (which usually means better quality images). Also, in order to reduce T<subscript>2</subscript>* signal dephasing the magnetic field in the imaging volume should be as homogeneous as possible over as large a volume as possible.</para>
          <para>A third issue that has not been discussed, nor will it be possible to discuss in any great detail, is the need to be able to change the magnetic field at will. Equation (2) states that the resonance frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. By changing the strength of the magnetic field in some sort of known or predictable fashion,</para>
          <para>different resonance frequencies can be assigned to different locations in the magnet. This is accomplished using what are known as the X-, Y- and Z-gradients.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">The Magnet and the Fringe Field</emphasis>Horizontal field magnets produce magnetic field lines that go out one end of the magnet, loop around and go back the other end. Areas with the highest density of field lines have the highest strength. However, it is the areas that have the most rapidly changing density of field lines (i.e., the largest spatial gradients) that produce the greatest forces that can act on ferromagnetic materials. In other words, it is these areas that represent the greatest danger for items to become projectiles. Examples of projectiles that occurred in the MRI environment may be seen at www.simplyphysics.com (9).</para>
          <para>The vast majority of high field strength MR scanners use superconducting electromagnets to produce the main magnetic field. [Note that some low field MR systems use permanent magnets, which in the past have been limited to fields ≤ 0.35 T (10). More recently, a few vendors have released permanent magnets of 0.4 and 0.5 T (11).] A simple four-loop design of such a magnet used in an MR system is depicted in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 18</emphasis>. The two central loops produce the majority of the field and the two outer loops help to shape it, to make it more homogeneous. Note that the center of the magnet is where the field lines are most closely packed meaning this is where the highest field strength is. The area marked as "isocenter" is also referred to as the "sweet spot", the region with the greatest magnetic field uniformity.</para>

(Actually the nail isn't needed, it just acts to intensify the field.) The larger the current flowing, the greater the magnetic field produced. This type of magnet is called a resistive electromagnet because the wire resists the flow of electrons. This resistance to the current flow also produces heat. While larger currents can generate higher magnetic fields, they will also produce considerable heat.</para>
          <para>Similar to resistive magnets, the field from a superconducting magnet is produced by current flowing in multiple loops of wires. The wires are made out of niobium-titanium which, when cooled to 9.5°K (9.5° above absolute zero), lose all resistance to current flow. The coils are surrounded by liquid helium which boils at 4.2° K (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 19</emphasis>). When the scanner is first installed, a power supply is utilized to slowly build up the current and, thus,</para>
          <para>the magnetic field. This can take several hours to accomplish. Once it is up to its full field strength, the power supply is disconnected and the current will continue virtually for centuries (as long as it's kept cold, of course). This is why you will typically see signs outside MR system rooms that state, "Danger! This Magnet is Always On!"</para>

          <para>The magnetic field lines depicted in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 18</emphasis> that extend outside of the magnet are known as the fringe field. It is this fringe field that can cause problems with ferromagnetic objects. In general, the five gauss line is the demarcation between what is considered safe or a danger for certain objects. Modern-day MR systems use what is known as "active shielding". An actively-shielded magnet has an inner or primary set of field coils that produces more than the desired field with an outer or secondary set of field coils with a lower current going in the opposite direction (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 20</emphasis>). The smaller opposite field partially cancels the field at the center of the magnet but cancels a much larger portion on the outside. For example, the primary set coils might produce a positive 2 T field while the secondary coils produce a negative 0.5 T, resulting in a net 1.5 T field at the center of the magnet but, because the secondary coils are closer to the outside, they create a greater amount of cancellation.</para>

        <para>The advantage of modern actively-shielded magnets is that the five gauss line can be restricted relatively close to the magnet. However, this also means that as one moves closer to the bore of the magnet, the field strength rises rapidly over a relatively short distance (i.e., a high spatial gradient magnetic field is present). Understandably, a relatively high spatial gradient magnetic field can produce substantial issues for ferromagnetic objects. By way of example,<emphasis role="bold">Figure 21</emphasis> shows a hospital bed lifted completely off the ground and stuck to the front of a 3 T MR system.</para>

          <title>Time-Varying Gradient Magnetic Fields</title>
          <para>The main magnetic field, B<subscript>0</subscript>, discussed above is also known as the static magnetic field, meaning that it never changes over time. In order to actually produce MR images, it is necessary to apply a magnetic field that changes over time and space in a predictable fashion. What is needed is to be able to produce a change that is linear moving away from the magnet center, with positive changes in one direction and negative changes in the other. (Note, the field at the center of the magnet never changes.) The field produced by a current in a single loop of wire reaches a peak at the center of the coil and drops off non-linearly as it move out (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22A</emphasis>). Obviously, this won't suffice for MRI.</para>
          <para>However, if a second coil with a current flowing in the opposite direction is placed one coil diameter away from the first, the fields from each coil totally cancel each other at the point midway between them (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22B</emphasis>). The fields interact in such a way that they produce an almost perfectly linear change in the area midway between them. The field change then drops off as you move outside of the coils. This linear change (also known as a gradient) is not only along the centerline between the two coils but remains linear for about half of the center volume. If properly designed, this region of reasonable linearity corresponds with the "sweet spot" or most homogeneous portion of the magnet. Note that the locations with the greatest offset from the field at the center of the magnet are located near the center of each loop. This is also the location of the greatest change in magnetic field per unit time, dB/dt, during an imaging sequence.</para>
          <para>Every MR system has three orthogonal (perpendicular) sets of gradient coils (i.e., X-, Y-, and Z-gradient coils) that are mounted on what is referred to as the "gradient tube" (12)</para>

          <para>Every gradient system is characterized by two parameters: the peak gradient amplitude, which primarily effects how small the field of view (FOV) may be, and the peak slew rate, which is how fast the gradients can be turned on and off, which affects things like minimum echo and/or repetition times. Between the two, a fast slew rate is usually better from an MR imaging consideration than a high peak amplitude, however, faster slew rates cause more safety-related issues, as will be discussed below.</para>
          <para>From the standpoint of MRI safety, these time-varying gradients raise two primary areas of concern. The first is acoustic noise that is associated with the gradient magnetic fields (13-15). An MR system can be compared to a giant speaker system. In a typical stereo speaker, there is a small permanent magnet with loops of wire wrapped around it and the magnet is attached to the center of a diaphragm. When an oscillating current is applied through the wire, it creates a time-varying gradient magnetic field that pushes and pulls on the permanent magnet, causing the supporting speaker diaphragm to vibrate.</para>
          <para>The static B<subscript>0</subscript> magnet of the MR system is like the speaker's permanent magnet. The imaging gradients are like the little loop of wire wrapped around the permanent magnet. The gradient tube is like the diaphragm. During the imaging process, the imaging gradient can be turned on and off in as little as 1-msec (corresponding to 1000-Hz) or as much as 20-msec (corresponding to 50-Hz). This causes the imaging gradients to push and pull against the main magnetic field, and the physical supporting structures, resulting in vibrations that occur in the typical audio range. The higher the magnetic field, B<subscript>0</subscript>, and the faster the imaging sequence (higher slew rates), the louder the noise is that will be produced. The resulting acoustic noise can be at levels that may cause hearing damage if hearing protection is not used in the MR system room. As shown in the pulse profile of Figure 24, imaging gradients can be turned on and off rather abruptly (i.e., the trapezoidal lobe) or more gradually (i.e., the sinusoidal lobe). There are always trade-offs when designing an imaging se-</para>

          <para>sequence (see below), but using the lowest amplitude and lowest slew rates possible helps to minimize acoustic noise.</para>
          <para>One of the important properties of electromagnetism is that just as an electric current creates a magnetic field, a time-varying gradient magnetic field can produce an electric current in any nearby conductor. This brings us to the other issue that is associated with time-varying gradient magnetic fields. The human body is an electrical conductor. If a patient undergoing MRI has crossed-arms or crossed-legs, these may create a closed loop for current to flow under certain imaging conditions. The rapidly changing imaging gradients can induce current to flow across the body and peripheral nerve stimulation may occur (16). The area near the center of the coils in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 22B</emphasis> is the location of the largest dB/dt, so it is at this location where the greatest danger of induced currents exists with respect to peripheral nerve stimulation. Note that at the center of the magnet, the gradients do not produce any change in the magnetic field, so this is where the potential for nerve stimulation is the least.</para>
          <para>To summarize, the potential problems caused by time-varying gradient magnetic fields are, as follows: (1) acoustic noise and (2) peripheral nerve stimulation. The more rapidly the gradients change and the higher the amplitude, the greater the risks. Importantly, for patients with electronically-activated devices, the location of the greatest risk is not at the center of the MR system but at the outer edges of the gradient coils where the absolute changes in the magnetic fields per unit time (i.e., dB/dt) are the highest.</para>

            <emphasis role="bold">RF Coils and RF Power Deposition</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>As discussed above, MRI requires the use of a radio transmitter to provide the RF excitation pulses. Every scanner has a built in body RF coil (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 19</emphasis>) which is used for many of the imaging sequences. Alternatively, the RF excitation pulses can be applied by a smaller transmit RF coil, most commonly designed for imaging either the patient's head or a knee. While some of the applied RF energy that is absorbed ends up producing the MRI signal, most of it actually results in tissue heating of the patient (17). The amount of RF power absorbed by the body increases approximately with the square of the field strength. Accordingly, at higher static magnetic fields, there can be an inherent danger of over-heating the patient (17). The mass normalized rate at which RF energy is coupled to biological tissue is characterized by the specific absorption rate (SAR) and is reported in W/kg relative to the use of a particular pulse sequence and the body weight of the patient.</para>
          <para>The built in transmit body RF coil deposits RF energy over a relatively large area of the patient. Even if only a small amount of tissue is actually being imaged, a large amount of tissue will absorb much of the transmitted energy. By comparison, smaller transmit/receive RF coils have a limited volume of coverage and result in greatly reduced RF power deposition. Additionally, a class of RF coils known as quadrature (quadrature is an engineering term that has nothing to do with the number four) coils result in less power deposition than comparably-sized linear coils. Notably, this information has implications for scanning patients with certain types of biomedical implants insofar as it may be necessary to prevent substantial implant heating by limiting the MRI examination to the use of a transmit/receive head RF coil only, versus performing the MRI procedure using a transmit body RF coil and a receive-only head coil (e.g., certain neurostimulation systems used for spinal cord stimulation have these particular conditions specified in the MRI labeling).</para>

            <title>Imaging Sequences</title>
            <para>While there are many different types of imaging sequences used for MRI, most have three basic steps in common which are: (1) Exciting a slice or slab of tissue by using a slice select gradient combined with one or more RF excitation pulses. In an axial image, the Z-gradient is the slice select gradient. (2) Applying one (2D) or two (3D) spatial encoding gradients known as phase encoding pulses. The details of how this works are beyond the scope of this chapter. In an axial plane 2D image, the phase encoding direction can be in either the X-direction (i.e., left/right) or the Y-direction (i.e., anterior/posterior). For the moment, let's assume it is in the Y-direction. For a three dimensional image, there will also be a phase encode pulse in the Z or slice select direction. (3) Reading out the MRI signal while applying a third spatial encoding gradient known as the frequency encoding gradient.</para>
            <para>The pulse diagrams of two of the simplest imaging sequences, a basic gradient echo (GRE) (18), also known as a field echo (FE) and a basic spin echo (SE) are shown in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 25</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 26</emphasis>, respectively (8). As was previously discussed (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 16</emphasis>), a SE sequence requires two RF pulses while, as shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 25</emphasis>, a GRE sequence uses a single RF pulse. The SE pulse sequence is most commonly used for T1-weighted imaging incorporating a 90°/180° pair of RF pulses. The GRE pulse sequence can use virtually any flip angle, which then impacts the type of image-weighting that results, in part, by the combination of the flip angle, echo time (TE) and repetition time (TR). Typically, flip angles from 20° to 40° are used for T<subscript>2</subscript>*-weighting and flip angles from 70° to 90° are used for T<subscript>1</subscript>-weighting. The key point here is that, with only one RF pulse, the RF power deposition, or SAR, is substantially lower with GRE sequences than with SE sequences. This is particularly important on MRI examinations using MR systems operating at 3 T or higher.</para>

This type of sequence can have an echo train length (ETL) as short as two to four for T<subscript>1</subscript>-weighted or proton density-weighting, or moderate echo train lengths of eight to 32 for T<subscript>2</subscript>-weighted imaging, or as long as 128 to 256 for MRI procedures such as single shot myelograms or cholangiograms (20, 21).

            <para>With all of the associated gradient activity, a FSE pulse sequence may suffer from the consequences of time-varying gradient magnetic fields discussed earlier. More importantly, particularly at 1.5-T and higher fields, all of the 180° RF pulses significantly increase the specific absorption rate (SAR) level. Accordingly, the MR system reported SAR may exceed the recommended FDA limits for specific absorption rate. When this happens, there are five possible options: (1) Increase the repetition time (TR) so that the average power per unit time goes down. (2) Decrease the total number of slices acquired per TR (3, 17), as half the number of slices means half the RF power. (3) Use the technique known as Half-Fourier imaging (22). This takes advantage of the symmetry in MRI raw data to reduce the number of lines of data required (and the associated acquisition time and RF power) by roughly one half. The disadvantage to this is that it reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by the square root of two. (4) Use refocusing RF pulses less than 180°. The amount of RF energy per RF pulse of a given duration is proportional to the square of the flip angle so a 180° RF pulse deposits four times as much as a 90° pulse of the same length. Reduce the flip angle of a large number of RF pulses and the total SAR will be decreased. (5) Use "low SAR" RF pulses. The amount of RF energy per RF pulse of given amplitude is proportional to the duration of the pulse. Instead of doubling the amplitude of the 90° RF pulse to obtain a 180° flip, you can double the duration. This will reduce the specific absorption rate in half but will also result in much longer time between echoes reducing the number of echoes possible per repetition time (TR) thereby increasing the total scan time.</para>
            <para>Reducing the flip angle of the refocusing pulse does reduce the SAR, but with all things in MRI, there are tradeoffs. In terms of refocusing spins that are going out of phase due to T<subscript>2</subscript>* effects (Figure 16), a 180° pulse is optimal. Reducing the refocusing flip angle from 180° to 140° for a single echo will reduce the effectiveness by about 12%. The effect on the signal-to-noise (SNR) when using multiple refocusing pulses becomes very complicated but suffice to say that the SNR is maximum with 180° pulses and goes down from there. While RF power deposition is mainly a problem at higher static magnetic field strengths,</para>

The RF excitation utilizes a single 90°/180° pair so the SAR levels associated with these pulse sequences are usually not a problem. However, these sequences use the absolute fastest changing gradients so they have the greatest potential for creating the possible problems related to the time-varying gradient magnetic fields discussed above.</para>

          <title>Parallel Imaging Reconstruction</title>
          <para>The goal of most clinical MRI examinations is to achieve the best quality that is possible in the shortest acquisition time. Over the years, gradient slew rates have increased dramatically, improving the imaging speed of many techniques (such as FSE and EPI discussed above). However, there is still a physical limit as to how fast gradients can be turned on and off as well as the practical limit that exists to prevent problems such as peripheral nerve stimulation. The main purpose of the imaging gradients is to impart spatial information to the MRI signal. One might ask is there any other way of obtaining at least some of the spatial information?</para>
          <para>As discussed earlier, with the exception of transmit/received RF coils such as those used for the knee or head, most MRI procedures use the body RF coil for excitation and passive receive-only coils to detect the MRI signal. Modern-day MR systems use multi-channel phased-array (PA) RF coils that are designed for specific, limited anatomical coverage. These PA coils consist of multiple small coils (anywhere from two to 64) where each coil is sensitive to signal from only a portion of the FOV. A very simple four channel configuration typical of early torso phase-array coils is shown in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 29</emphasis>. In this case, four images are produced, one from the signal obtained from each coil, which are then combined to make a single composite image. Roughly speaking, the SNR of the final image obtained with a PA coil increases by the square root of the number of channels used (24).</para>

          <para>of a class of parallel imaging reconstruction methods, utilize the known or measured sensitivity profile of each individual coil to impart some spatial information. This makes it possible to reduce the number of phase encoding (PE) steps that are required for virtually any imaging technique. As the number of PE steps goes down, so does the total SAR. If the acquisition time is reduced by a factor of two, then the SAR is cut in half. If the acquisition time is reduced by a factor of four, then the SAR is cut to one-fourth. Theoretically, while it is possible to "speed up" a scan by a factor equal to the number of different coil elements, in practice the speed up factors are usually less than four. The main reason for this limitation is that while the acquisition time may be faster, the SNR of the final image is proportional to the square root of the number of actual phase encoding views used. If the scan is speeded up by a factor of four, the SNR is cut in half. Therefore, while high field strength MR systems have an initially high SNR, there is a limit as to how much SNR can be "thrown away".</para>
          <para>One final cautionary note about parallel imaging techniques: some MRI centers may decide to use "speed up" factors of two or three but then are unhappy with the SNR of the final images. Therefore, these MRI facilities use two or three signal averages for the pulse sequence. Of course, that just takes the acquisition time back to what it would have been without the use of parallel imaging. In fact, parallel imaging reconstruction can actually add artifacts to the image, particularly if the patient moves. Thus, parallel imaging should only be used with one signal average. If better SNR is desired, it is best to not use parallel imaging.</para>

An obvious question to ask is, is there an optimal field strength for MRI? The simple answer is, no. A better question is, what are the various tradeoffs at different field strengths? In this final section, many considerations including safety issues when selecting a magnetic field strength for a clinical MR scanner will be presented. A more thorough discussion of the physics of MRI safety is presented in another chapter in this textbook.</para>

            <emphasis role="bold">Cost</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>As a general rule of thumb, the cost of an MR scanner is around $1M per Tesla (28). The cost will also go up with the number of RF coils and the number of channels the system can handle. Furthermore, higher field magnets are usually larger and heavier and have more expensive siting requirements. Choosing an MR system requires a careful examination of the cost-to-benefit ratio.</para>

          </para>
          <para>As was illustrated in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>, the number of excess protons that align with the static magnetic field goes up linearly with field strength. It is these excess protons that are used to produce the MR image. Therefore, the signal strength goes up with the field strength. While there are many other issues that affect SNR, such as the differences of RF penetration and sources of RF noise at different field strengths, as well RF coil design, the number of</para>
          <para>channels, differences in relaxation time constants and details of the imaging sequences, in general, the SNR goes up linearly with the field strength (29-31).</para>
          <para>This extra SNR can be utilized to obtain higher resolution images in the same scan time or to keep the overall resolution constant but with shorter scans, meaning potentially higher patient throughput. Because the SNR of a scan is proportional to the square root of the scan time, to get the same SNR of a four minute scan at 1.5 T would only require a one minute scan at 3 T. (Of course what usually happens at 3 T is that a higher resolution scan is obtained at some slightly shorter scan time.) At higher static magnetic fields it is also possible to perform techniques that inherently have low SNR such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI) (32-33). However, for these techniques there are still tradeoffs. For example, scanning at 3 T may be roughly four times faster than at 1.5 T, but problems with image distortion also go up proportional to field strength.</para>
          <para>In addition to the inherent higher SNR at higher field strengths, most high and ultra-high field scanners utilize phased array coils with a high number of channels, typically between 8 and 32 channels or even as high as 64. As was stated above, the SNR increases, roughly, with the square root of the number of channels providing more opportunities for faster and/or higher resolution scans. Of course, the greater the number of channels, the higher the monetary cost.</para>

          <title>Tissue Heating (SAR)</title>
          <para>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has set guidelines for the specific absorption rate (SAR) during a clinical MRI examination (Table 4). It is important to note that these guidelines are independent of the strength of the static magnetic field. Because the RF power deposited in the body increases roughly with the square of the magnetic field (17, 31, 34-36) higher field strength scanners are more likely to bump up against these limits, (1.5 T occasionally, 3 T and up quite frequently).</para>

          <title>Acoustic Noise</title>
          <para>One of the most commonly asked questions about an MR scanner is, why is it so noisy? As was discussed above in the section on time-varying gradient magnetic fields, an MRI system is comparable to a stereo speaker. The force that causes the vibrations is known as the Lorentz force and is described for a single charged particle moving through a magnetic field as (34):</para>
          <para>F<subscript>L</subscript> = q (v × B)                    (5)</para>
          <para>Where q is the charge of a particle, v is the velocity of the charge and F<subscript>L</subscript> is the Lorentz force. If we change q, the charge of a single particle, to Q, the total charge going through a wire, then the product Qv is effectively the current in the wire which determines the strength of the applied gradient. We see from this that the relevant forces that result in the acoustic noise go up with both the magnetic field and the amplitude of the imaging gradients. Typically, low field magnets have low amplitude gradients with low slew rates and high field magnets have higher amplitudes with higher slew rates.</para>
          <para>Price, et al. (34) reported typical acoustic noise levels of approximately 83 dB(A) on a 0.23 T low field open MR system and over 118 dB(A) on a 3 T scanner. These investigators found that pulse sequence parameters (particularly FOV and TR) had a greater effect on the acoustic noise level than did the field strength. However, it should be noted that high field systems typically utilize smaller FOVs and faster scans, inherently resulting in greater acoustic noise.</para>

          <title>Flying Objects (Projectiles)</title>
          <para>It is well known that ferromagnetic objects are attracted to magnets and, thus, they should not be brought near an MR scanner lest the object become a projectile. Does the danger go up with the field strength? Not necessarily! The translational force exerted on a ferromagnetic object as it is moved near a magnet is not dependent on the strength of the</para>
          <para>magnet but, rather, it is dependent on the rate of change or spatial gradient of the magnetic field (35). At the magnet isocenter, where the field is fairly homogenous, there is almost no translational force regardless of the field strength. However, consider the case of two whole body magnets, a 1.5 T and 3 T. Typically, the 5 gauss line is somewhere just past the foot of the patient table or maybe near the scan room door. Between the 5 gauss line and the center of the magnet there is a region where the magnetic field changes fairly rapidly. If the design of the two magnets are similar, then the maximum spatial gradient of the 3 T scanner will be roughly twice that of the 1.5 T scanner. However, you could have one design where most of the change of the 1.5 T field occurs over a shorter distance, say 0.5 meter while a 3 T magnet may be designed to have most of the change occur over a 1.0 meter distance. The spatial gradient magnetic fields would be similar. That being said, the higher the static magnetic field, the greater the likelihood that it will have a higher spatial gradient and a greater danger of projectile-related incidence objects.</para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">Artifacts</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>Another consideration for image quality is the presence of imaging artifacts. In general, higher field strengths are more prone to motion artifacts (37). While it is easier to do fat suppression at higher fields, they can also suffer from chemical shift artifacts (38). Susceptibility artifacts also increase with magnetic field strength and may be very problematic in the presence of metallic implants (38, 39). One of the biggest sources of artifacts at high field strengths, and the last topic for this chapter, is the dielectric effect.</para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">RF Penetration and the Dielectric Effect</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>With all imaging sequences, image contrast depends greatly on the type of RF pulse(s) used. The assumption is that all of the protons in the field of view (FOV) experience roughly the same levels of RF during the imaging sequence. In other words, we assume that the RF field (also known as the B<subscript>1</subscript> field) is fairly uniform across the FOV. With a well-designed transmit RF coil, at 1.5 T and lower, this is a reasonable assumption. However, at higher field strengths than 1.5 T, dielectric effects can cause substantial variation in the B<subscript>1</subscript> field across the FOV which, in turn, can cause significant variations in signal amplitude and/or contrast in an image (35, 40-42).</para>
          <para>The dielectric constant, ε<subscript>r</subscript>, of water (which predominates in the human body) is approximately 80 (in a vacuum it is 1.0). The wavelength of radio waves moving through a medium other than a vacuum is reduced by the square root of ε<subscript>r</subscript>, or in this case roughly a factor of 9. At 3 T, with a resonance frequency of 128 MHz, the wavelength in a vacuum is 235 cm but in the human body it is approximately 26 cm. This is on the same order as the dimensions of the human body, particularly of the torso. As a result, "standing waves" can form inside of the body resulting in peaks and troughs of different effective RF strength or flip angles. At 7 T the wavelength drops to around 11 cm and you get substantial dielectric effects in the brain, as well.</para>
          <para>When using simple gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequences to image a uniform phantom, the signal amplitude is determined by the amount of spins tipped onto the XY plane and is proportional to the sine of the flip angle (ignoring T1, T2, TR and TE). Figure 30 depicts a series of images obtained on a Siemens 1.5 T Aera and a Siemens 3 T Skyra using a GRE</para>
          <para>pulse sequence with a flip angle of 720°. Since the sine of 720° = 0 (as are the sine of 0°, 180°, 360° and 540°) any spins that experience a full 720° flip angle should produce little to no signal.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 30A</emphasis> shows axial, coronal, and sagittal MR images acquired using a water filled phantom on a 1.5 T scanner. The dark ring in each image shows where in the phantom the spins were all flipped the full 720°. The brighter regions show where spins experience either a little more RF or a little less. (Remember, most MR images are magnitude images. If they had been "real" or "complex", then any spins experiencing more than 720° would have a positive signal and less than 720° would have a negative signal.) Unfortunately, with this single GRE sequence, it is not possible to tell exactly how much more or less than 720° the other spins experienced. The important thing to note about these images is that the signal distribution is rather simple, moderately uniform, and with good circular symmetry.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis> shows the same water filled phantom imaged on the 3 T MR system. These images are much more complicated, with multiple bands or regions of bright and dark signal. The dark signal occurs everywhere a spin experiences a flip angle that is close to a multiple of 180°, most likely either 540° or 720°. The brightest regions occur where the flip angle is a multiple of 180° ± 90°, most likely 630°, with the grey signal somewhere in between. The situation is actually still more complex. Not only does the RF have to penetrate the phantom and excite the spins, the signals from these spins have to make it back out to the RF coil, further complicating the interpretation of these images.</para>
          <para>At 3 T and higher, many phantoms used to perform QA testing are filled with some sort of oil (42). General Electric uses poly(dimethylsiloxane) or silicone based oils which have a dielectric constant less than 3. This translates into a wavelength of 136 cm (at 3 T), which is long enough to avoid the same problems that plague water filled phantoms.<emphasis role="bold">Figures 30C</emphasis></para>

          <para>While the images in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 30</emphasis> help to visualize the problem of the dielectric effect they lack detailed quantitative information. There are many approaches to provide better maps of the B<subscript>1</subscript> distribution (43-48) the details of which are beyond the scope of this chapter. Siemens provides in their standard service protocol library a sequence, (rf_map), where the amplitude of each pixel in the phase image is directly proportional to the effective flip angle at that pixel assuming that a nominal 90° RF pulse is applied. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 31</emphasis> shows two 3 T axial B<subscript>1</subscript> field maps obtained with this sequence. A contour map has been super-imposed on the phase images with the actual flip angles. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 31A</emphasis> was obtained using the water filled phantom and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 31B</emphasis> the oil filled phantom. Note that the contours agree with the axial images in <emphasis role="bold">Figures 30B</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">D</emphasis>. The actual flip angles in the water phantom show extensive spatial fluctuation and range from a low of 69° on the left and right 'wings' to a high of 90° at the exact center. The average flip angle is 77.1° ± 5.3°. In contrast, the oil filled phantom smoothly changes from about 83° at the center to 93° in the upper left corner with a mean of 87.2° ± 2.5°. While not shown, at 1.5 T, both phantoms yielded a mean flip angle of about 87° ± 2°) This shows that an oil filled phantom can be used to evaluate the performance of an RF coil without the complication of the dielectric effects.</para>

          <para>The final question is, how does this affect clinical MR images? This is not an easy question to answer because it depends on the type of pulse sequence being used. The greater the number of RF pulses used, the greater the effect. For this discussion, let's only consider a few simple pulse sequences. In each case, we shall call the excitation RF pulse alpha (α) and any refocusing pulse(s), 2α.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italics">Gradient Echo:</emphasis> This is the simplest sequence with only a single α RF pulse. If you have a long TR so that all of the spins have full M<subscript>z</subscript> recovery, then the signal amplitude is proportional to sin(α). Since sin(90) = 1.0, the maximum signal is obtained with a 90° flip</para>
          <para>angle. The average flip angle in the water filled phantom of<emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis> was 77.1° and sin(77.1) = 0.975, so there is less than a 3% decrease in signal. Where the flip angle is 69° (the minimum value shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 30B</emphasis>) there is a 7% loss in signal. However, because the spins are <emphasis role="italics">not</emphasis> flipped all the way down to the XY plane, they don't take as long to recover back to M<subscript>z</subscript>=0, so T<subscript>1</subscript> contrast can be reduced.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italics">Spin Echo</emphasis>: This is the next level up in complexity. An ideal spin echo has a 90° excitation pulse and a 180° refocusing pulse. However, any two RF pulses will generate what is known as a Hahn Echo (8) and the signal amplitude is proportional to the product sin(α<subscript>1</subscript>)•sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α<subscript>2</subscript>/2), ignoring T<subscript>1</subscript> recovery. In our case α<subscript>2</subscript> = 2α<subscript>1</subscript> so the product becomes sin(α<subscript>1</subscript>)•sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α<subscript>1</subscript>) = sin<superscript>3</superscript>(α) If α = 90°, then the product equals 1.0. If α = 77.1, then the product equals 0.93, a loss of 7%. At α = 69°, the product equals 0.81, so a loss of 19%. If the TR is short as for a T<subscript>1</subscript>-weighted image, then things become complicated. If we assume that the TE is short relative to the T<subscript>2</subscript> decay rate, then most of the spins effectively experience an α+2α=3α flip angle. When α = 90°, then that is 270° or completely on the XY plane (M<subscript>z</subscript> = 0). However, if α = 70° then this becomes 210° or just 30° past 180° meaning that most of the spins are much closer to the -M<subscript>z</subscript> axis than they are the XY plane and, therefore, will take longer to recover resulting in greater T<subscript>1</subscript> contrast.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="italics">Fast Spin Echo</emphasis>: One would expect that each additional non-optimal refocusing pulse would further reduce the MR signal. However, this is not the case. While the first echo in the echo train is just like the spin echo discussed above and is reduced by sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α<subscript>2</subscript>/2) (49, 50), the longer echo train drives the magnetization into a pseudo-steady state with a signal that is reduced by only sin(α<subscript>2</subscript>/2). Again, since α<subscript>2</subscript> = 2α<subscript>1</subscript> the net signal is proportional to sin<superscript>2</superscript>(α), (squared instead of cubed). If α = 90°, then the product equals 1.0. If α = 77.1, then the product equals 0.95, a loss of 5%. At α = 69°, the product equals 0.87, so a loss of 13%.</para>
          <para>The analysis of other types of imaging pulse sequences is beyond the scope of this text. Suffice to say that the non-uniformities in the B<subscript>1</subscript> field at higher static magnetic field strengths caused by dielectric effects seriously complicate image contrast. However, there has been much work done to reduce these effects such as the use of dielectric pads (51-54) or multi-channel, transmit RF coils (51-58).</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis>This chapter presented information on the basic MRI physics that are involved in creating exquisite images of human anatomy. The same physics helps us to understand the potential risks and problems associated with MRI technology and guides us in how to deal with those issues. There is no one optimal static magnetic field strength to use, instead there are a long list of tradeoffs which must be carefully considered.
