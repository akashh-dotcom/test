      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is itself one of the best examples that electromag- netic fields interact with biological tissue, providing a wide variety of soft-tissue contrasts  that can be generated by the subtle interplay between radiofrequency (RF) pulse amplitudes  and timing. Unfortunately, RF energy not only subtly disturbs the Boltzmann equilibrium  of the nuclear spins, it also produces heat as it drives rapid molecular reorientation in cells  and induces currents in the human body. Strain and friction might not functionally impair  cellular and enzymatic processes, but will definitely lead to dissipation and local, non-uni- form tissue heating. Such thermal effects are used therapeutically to kill tumors (i.e., RF  field-induced hyperthermia) and applied in the food processing industry to sterilize at rel- atively low temperatures (50 to 60°C).</para>
      <para>The aim of this chapter is to present an overview of experimental data and modeling  studies for core and local tissue temperature rises in clinical MRI, which mostly operates  at 1.5 T (64 MHz) or 3 T (128 MHz). Safe temperatures must be maintained at all times  during the MRI examination. Health effects related to mild hyperthermia will be used to  explain necessary restrictions for temperature increase and thermal dose, expressed as tem- perature exposure of tissue at cumulative equivalent minutes at 43°C (CEM43) (1), and the  derived exposure limits for whole-body averaged and head RF power deposition, expressed  as specific absorption rate (SAR in W/kg) in the MRI product safety standard from the In- ternational Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 60601-2-33 (2). A simplified version of the  applicable limits is shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Basic restrictions for temperature and thermal dose apply equally at ultra-high field  MRI (7 T and higher), but SAR management requirements may be different due to the more  localized exposure to RF energy from parallel-transmit arrays (3). Considerations related  to partial-body and localized exposures using such arrays, and analyses of RF field-related  implant heating are beyond the scope of this chapter.</para>

      <title>POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS FROM RF EXPOSURE</title>
      <para>Potential risks associated with exposure to RF fields are actively monitored by the World  Health Organization (WHO), the European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly  Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radi- ation Protection (ICNIRP) (4) and the International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety  (ICES, part of IEEE) (5). After decades of research related to RF exposures in wireless com- munication, the general consensus of these scientific expert groups is that prevention of ad- verse health effects from exposure to RF fields can be based on avoidance of acute thermal  effects (during or within minutes after exposure). It should be noted, however, that a few  recent, well-designed studies comparing RF and non-RF field-induced hyperthermia in food  safety (6) and humans (7) indicate that induced cross-membrane electric fields enhance  thermal damage at moderately elevated temperatures.</para>
      <para>While the energy of RF photons is too low to dissociate chemical bonds, for example  in DNA, coupling to vibrational modes in proteins may alter reaction kinetics. Reported  proliferation effects in cell lines, <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> and in animals, caused the International Agency  of Research of Cancer (8) to classify RF radiation in 2011 as “possibly carcinogenic to hu- mans” (Group 2B). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed evidence  for tumorigenesis and concluded that “a lack of clear dose response relationship, a lack of  consistent findings or specificity, and a lack of biological mechanistic plausibility” (9).

For global exposure or protection  from systemic thermal effects, 6 minutes-averaged whole-body SAR and head SAR must  be controlled. Additional limits apply to control local exposure, for example, from small  transmit RF coils or inhomogeneous RF fields. This table contains only a subset of re- quirements. Refer to (2) for detailed specifications including partial body SAR, short- term SAR, and specific absorption (limits not shown).</para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 001-434_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:22 PM  Page 255</para>
      <para>ditional studies published in 2018 by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) and  from Italy (10) indicated that the risk  may increase in laboratory animals as a result of pro- longed exposure at high SAR levels. Potential biochemical mechanisms relate to thermal  vulnerability of routine DNA repair pathways: exposure to heat (stress) leads to accumula- tion of DNA double-strand break (DSB) recognition proteins such as γH2AX and micro- nucleation (11) and references cited therein (12, 13). The latter paper shows that heat stress  affects the DNA integrity in a cell cycle phase-dependent manner (i.e., DSBs in G1/G2  phase) and stalling DNA replication forks in synthesis (S) phase (14). Additionally, Taka- hashi A, et al. (15) reported that γH2AX foci formation is rapid and shows similar Arrhenius  kinetics as cell killing by temperature.</para>
      <para>Notably, no epidemiological indications exist from over 35 years of the use of MRI,  with  more than 150 million examinations being performed annually, to suggest an increased  cancer incidence. Alleged excess DNA damage caused by MRI was excluded in a well-de- signed study (16). Similarly, no oncological concerns are known for the (local) thermal bur- den in diagnostic ultrasound (17-20), taking into account that clinical practice guidelines  nevertheless strongly recommend “as low as reasonably possible” thermal exposure levels.  Exposure to RF fields during MRI examinations can also lead to substantial thermal load,  and only slightly-higher power levels are used in RF field-induced hyperthermia or focused  ultrasound to ablate tumors (1, 21).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Thermal Thresholds and Basic Restrictions </emphasis></para>
      <para>The recent update of RF exposure guidelines by ICNIRP (4) defines the concepts for  establishing exposure restrictions to prevent harmful effects to human health. This commit- tee has performed an extensive literature review (see Appendix B of their guidelines) to  identify substantiated effects with adequate scientific evidence. This includes independent  reproduction of reported effects and adequate study design and dosimetry, but allows for  inclusion of known biological mechanisms from which adverse effects can reasonably be  hypothesized. A relevant discussion topic, which has not been closed to satisfaction, is  whether excessive sweating and strong recruitment of thermoregulation would constitute  adverse health effects, at least in some groups of human subjects. For now, it is assumed  that this is not the case.</para>
      <para>Thresholds for health effects were determined from the RF field exposure literature or  from other sources (e.g., burns, hyperthermia, etc.). The latter are called “operational thresh- olds”. The ICNIRP applies reduction factors to derive the restriction values. These reduction  factors are chosen to account for biological variation, variation of the baseline physiological  and environmental conditions, and dosimetric uncertainty. The threshold value combined  with the reduction factor results in the “basic restrictions”. Relative to earlier publications,  three notable changes were introduced in the 2020 Guidelines:</para>
      <para>(1) The averaging time for whole-body averaged SAR (4 W/kg) has been increased from 6  minutes to 30 minutes, which is the assumed time to reach steady-state temperature in the  adult. For reference, metabolic rates are approximately 1 W/kg at rest (22), 2 W/kg stand- ing, and 12 W/kg when running (23, 24). Note that the local SAR averaging time is re- tained at 6 minutes, based on numerical simulations in the GHz range (25). The basic  restrictions also remain unchanged at 10 W/kg and 20 W/kg for 10 gram averaged local</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">256</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Thermal Effects Associated with RF Exposures During Clinical MRI</emphasis></para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 001-434_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:22 PM  Page 256</para>
      <para>SAR in head/torso and limb, respectively. The 10 gram averaging volume is based on the  insight that heat diffusion is rapid and equilibrates temperature at these length scales (26).</para>
      <para>(2) Using CEM43 to assess thermal burden and potential harm was evaluated and explicitly  discarded as (operational) threshold. Rather, two “tissue types” have been introduced  with maximum-allowed temperature increases:</para>
      <para>a) “Type-1” tissue includes all tissues in the upper arm, forearm, hand, thigh, leg, foot,  pinna and the cornea, anterior chamber and iris of the eye, epidermal, dermal, fat,  muscle, and bone. Normothermal temperature for Type-1 tissue is typically &lt; 33 to  36°C, and allowed temperature increase is set to 5°C.</para>
      <para>b) “Type-2” tissue includes all tissues in the head, eye, abdomen, back, thorax, and  pelvis, excluding those defined as Type-1 tissue. Its normothermal temperature is  &lt;38.5°C, and allowed temperature increase is set to 2°C. Note that this includes the  fetus, but does not provide a clear understanding how peripheral nerves in muscle  and bone should be treated.</para>
      <para>The use of specific absorption (SA) in any 10g of cubic mass as restriction at frequen- cies &gt; 400 MHz (a somewhat arbitrary cut-off value based on RF penetration depth argu- ments.) The newly introduced formula leads to (not explicitly disclosed) allowance for  short-term high local SAR. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> provides an overview of the time dependence of this  restriction, where the exposure of groups of pulses must satisfy the restrictions at all time  scales.</para>
      <para>The ICNIRP’s methodological approach provides a concise overview of the available  evidence for health effects to identify adverse health effects and their thresholds. A similarly  structured review concerning thermal effects associated with RF exposures in diagnostic  MRI is available in (27). In clinical settings, a benefit to risk assessment may justify appli- cation of higher exposure levels than those applicable in daily life. IEC 60601-2-33 therefore  adopted local SAR restrictions of 20 W/kg and 40 W/kg for 10 gram (10g) averaged local  SAR in head/torso and limb, respectively. Extensive simulations have since been performed</para>

      <para>(28-32) to evaluate if higher allowed exposures can be justified based on CEM43 analyses  and their allowable safe values (20, 33).</para>
      <para>No thermal risk is assumed to result if the Basic Safety Restriction for thermal dose is  set to the lowest CEM43 level, at which no apoptotic (i.e., the process of programmed cell  death) effects have been reported. The diagnostic ultrasound community has evaluated the  usefulness of CEM43 to provide user feedback on potential thermal risks (17, 18) and has  established that 1 CEM43 is a conservative safety threshold for fetal, neonatal and adult  exposure (19, 20). Higher thresholds have been proposed for MRI (33), taking into consid- eration the type of tissue and patient’s health status, with 2 CEM43 proposed as a conser- vative safety threshold for MRI examinations under all conditions. In addition to this  proposal, higher allowable local SAR values have been proposed based on a limited set of  RF field-induced hyperthermia exposures and reported complaints (34).</para>
      <para>Derivation of temperature-based local SAR limits needs to account for whole-body av- eraged RF deposition, equilibration of core temperature towards the legs, thermoregulatory  responses and capabilities, and patient variability. Temperature effects from MRI exposures  were established in the late 1980s using animal and human volunteer experiments (35), and  thermophysiological modeling. The allowed maximum temperature increases postulated by  the ICNIRP include such global and systemic effects, but (reversely) cannot be directly re- lated to the temperature increase from the local SAR, alone: especially in whole-body av- eraged MRI, effects of the whole-body averaged specific absorption must be included when  controlling RF power deposition.</para>
      <para>This chapter will first addresses the available systemic temperature data from MRI ex- posures, both experimental and simulated. It then presents an analysis of health effects to  determine thermal thresholds, corroborating those presented by the ICNIRP. The potential  role of CEM43 as a control measure will also be discussed in relation to local SAR simu- lations and their accuracy, reproducibility and representativeness.</para>

      <title>TEMPERATURE DATA FROM MRI EXPOSURES: SYSTEMIC BURDEN</title>
      <para>MR systems intentionally expose patients to high RF power, generally for a single  episode (examination) of short duration, typically less than one hour. RF deposition is ex- pressed as SAR in W/kg and accumulated as specific absorption in J/kg. First generation  MR scanners operated at relatively low SARs and initially exposed the head with local  transmit RF coils. Such exposures are nowadays common for 7 T MR systems (localized,  small coverage transmit RF coils) and deposit relatively little energy in the body of adult  patients. With the advent of whole-body averaged transmit (quadrature birdcage) RF coils  for 1.5 T systems, increases in SAR levels to 2 to 4 W/kg were deemed necessary to ensure  adequate image quality and scan efficiency for spine and body imaging, with total exposure  durations of 20 to 40 minutes. In current clinical practice, even longer examinations with  continuous high-SAR scanning are not uncommon.</para>
      <para>The generally-accepted upper limit to the whole-body averaged SAR is 4 W/kg (36),  established from observed behavioral changes in animal studies. Such exposures are re- ported to induce strong heat sensations in healthy human subjects. A reduced whole-body</para>

      <para>averaged SAR of 2 W/kg already falls within the normal temperature variation due to meta- bolic activity and exercise: the average metabolic rate, as a conversion of chemical into me- chanical and thermal energy in the human body, is estimated to be 80 W at rest and 270 W  for moderate physical activity (24). Thus, 2 W/kg for a 100 kg person represents a situation  of homeostasis without undue stress, and is chosen as an acceptable exposure for the Normal  Operating Mode for MR systems, which all individuals, regardless of health status, should  be able to tolerate.</para>
      <para>Several investigations have evaluated the physiological implications of such exposures  on healthy volunteers and patients, studying heart rate, blood pressure, sweating and skin  or core temperature. Profound sweating and mild cardiovascular challenge at a higher SA  have not been considered a potential reason for concern. <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> provides an overview of  identified reports of temperature increase related to MRI exposures, including an example</para>

      <para>of a large whole-body averaged study on RF field-induced hyperthermia. Unfortunately,  most identified studies lack appropriate dosimetric information to confirm SAR and SA  values. This may explain the anomaly of the reported mean temperature increase in (37),  although measurement approach and volunteer characteristics may explain a low core tem- perature increase. Notably, however, a recent investigation of 15 volunteers in an MRI setup  without RF exposure showed (repeatable) increasing and decreasing temperatures (ranging  from +0.5 °C to –0.5 °C; Nicolas Boulant, Caroline Le Ster and Alexandre Vignaud, <emphasis role="italics">private </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">communication</emphasis>). This casts additional doubt on the quality of the data used as reference for  the core temperature predictions as discussed in the next section. The high temperature in- crease reported by Wust, et al. (38) indicates that patients may experience a higher core  temperature elevation than normal volunteers. A confounding factor may be that thermal  insulation is applied in the hyperthermia setup and, thus, thermoregulation may be com- promised while high SAR levels are applied. In previous assessments, reported mean core  temperature increases were used to argue that effects are marginal. A more appropriate pa- rameter to consider when establishing exposure limit values is the maximum reported core  temperature increase, for which esophageal measurements are the most accurate, but tym- panic membrane temperatures can also provide representative data (39-44).</para>
      <para>Total energy absorbed, or SA, provides an easy estimate for systemic thermal burden.  Actual temperatures reached depend on many factors such as initial temperature distribution  in the body, thermoregulatory capability, and dissipation options (clothing and blankets),  see (44) and the section in this chapter discussing core temperature predictions from simu- lation models. An additional confounding factor not accounted for in these studies is the  psychological response to the MRI exposure: are people feeling at rest or stressed? A careful  analysis of sham exposure has also not been performed but recent data suggests significant  inter-subject variability. Irrespectively, the data suggests that an SA of approximately 4  kJ/kg is sufficient to raise core temperature by 1 °C, which corresponds to a continuous  high whole-body averaged SAR (&gt; 3 W/kg) applied for 15 to 20 minutes.</para>
      <para>Predicted SA values in the tens of millions of MRI examinations performed annually  can be assessed from scanner utilization data. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> shows a representative distribution  obtained from 367,000 examinations at 1.5 T systems. Resulting core temperature values  of examinations with (predicted) SA values &gt; 7 kJ/kg are not known, and will depend on  the length of the examination (long term RF duty cycle) and the thermoregulatory and heat  loss capabilities of the patient. In general, high SA levels can be expected, and have been  reported as being uncomfortable, and MRI scanner manufacturers recommend not to exceed  the value of 7 kJ/kg unless a clinical benefit-risk assessment is made and patient surveillance  is in place. On the other hand, no evidence exists that the 0.01% of examinations with SA  &gt; 10 kJ/kg correlate significantly with adverse events. The lack of large-scale data for core  temperature increase in patients associated with MRI examinations warrants additional and  well-controlled measurements in routine clinical settings. Such data should include tympanic  membrane (pre and post) temperature, patient weight, gender, age, body part examined,  ambient temperature, and appropriate dosimetry for SA and SAR values. Beyond core tem- perature, several studies report rapidly-developing profound sweating, whereas heart rate  and blood pressure effects were generally negligible (45, 46). Significant but highly variable  skin temperature increases have also been reported (37, 46-50) (<emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>), but that data is  not considered to constitute an indicator of potential health concerns.</para>

      <para>Thermophysiological models can be used to estimate RF-induced core temperature in- crease as function of SAR and exposure duration. Heat accumulation in the human body  mostly depends on ambient temperature and insulation (clothing), as well as thermoregula- tory capabilities. In their pioneering work, Adair and Berglund (48, 49, 51) used a two-node  model (70 kg man) based on the Stolwijk approach to evaluate core temperature increase  as a function of whole-body averaged SAR, skin blood flow impairment, ambient temper- ature, relative humidity, and insulation. Predicted core temperature increases correlate well  with experimental data, and a sensitivity analysis provided strong indications that the am- bient temperature should not exceed 21°C, air humidity should be kept around 50%, and  only light clothing can be tolerated (i.e., avoid the use of blankets). Under these circum- stances, and limiting SA to 10 kJ/kg, moderate cardiovascular impairment effects will not  seriously enhance core temperature elevations to levels &gt; 1°C. Adair and Berglund also rec- ommended keeping the SAR to &lt; 3 W/kg, and to limit examination time to 20 min. Their  modeling showed that cool down and recovery time is at least 30 minutes under optimal  patient health conditions.</para>

      <para>The Stolwijk approach used by Adair and Berglund has been superseded by advanced  multi-node human models in the context of heat exposure in buildings, cars, and under (oc- cupational) activity (52, 53). Application of such advanced models to the context of MRI  (i.e., the supine patient in an enclosed space) may be of future interest, once more experi- mental data is available for core temperature and dosimetry over a large number of patients,  including analysis of sham exposures.</para>
      <para>In the current situation, the rationale for exposure limits and guidance relies on the  Adair and Berglund model. This can be done with confidence, since more recent and more  detailed RF exposure modeling studies have confirmed their thermal predictions (54-59).  These studies indicated that the effect of aging requires additional conservativeness when  establishing exposure limits, but pediatric exposure is of lesser concern. Children have a  greater surface-to-volume ratio than adults, and can tolerate approximately 30% higher  whole-body averaged SAR than adults for the same core temperature increase (60).</para>
      <para>A simplified parametric approach is suggested by Adair, et al. (48) to enable a sensitivity  analysis of core temperature increase as a function of SAR, skin blood flow impairment,  clothing/insulation, ambient temperature and air humidity. Temperature rise correlates with  total deposited energy (SA) and restriction of the allowable SA value was suggested by Bar- ber, et al. (61). Some scenarios of this linearized parametric approach are provided in <emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">3</emphasis> to illustrate the relative importance of the model parameters. For further detailed analyses,  refer to the work by Adair, et al. (48-49). Notably, the effect of room humidity is not a major</para>

      <para>This section provides an overview of the global thermal thresholds for sensitive internal  organs, especially the brain and the eyes. The temperatures in these organs relate directly  to blood temperature, and are part of the assessment of systemic burden. Basic restrictions  in RF field-related safety standards and guidelines (4, 36) aim to prevent the occurrence of  high core temperature rises (i.e., average blood temperature) (63-65), primarily to prevent  functional changes and structural damage in the brain (including the eye) and to avoid a  potential overload of thermoregulation capacity, such as stress to cardiovascular function  (42). Maintenance of core temperature and protection against thermal insults at cellular and  organ levels rely on intricate mechanisms of neuronal and biochemical signaling. For a re- cent review, see the work by Morrison and Nakamura (66).</para>
      <para>Induced thermal stress results in a rapid increase in cutaneous blood flow, coupled to  an increase in sweat rate, an increased cardiac output, and a potential decrease in arterial  blood pressure (49, 67, 68). Precise levels for core temperatures at which biophysical control  mechanisms are activated or may fail are not well established, and may vary as function of  age, pregnancy, obesity and hypertension, or additional stress factors (e.g., diuretics, tran- quillizers and sedatives, vasodilators and other drugs, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy) (35,  69, 70).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Core Temperature Considerations </emphasis></para>
      <para>Healthy human subjects can tolerate core temperature increases &gt; 1°C for a few hours,  but longer exposure at slightly higher temperatures can lead to serious adverse effects (e.g.,  heat stroke, often associated with severe dehydration). The ICNIRP has adopted and recon- firmed the use of 1°C as a conservative limit for a core temperature rise, or “operational  adverse health effect threshold,” in occupational settings (4). Higher values can be allowed  in a controlled setting when appropriate training is provided for workers with normal health  conditions. Since RF exposures during MRI examinations may cause a temperature increase  &gt; 1 °C in certain patients, further evaluation of this safety criterion is needed.</para>
      <para>Normal core temperature for humans is commonly postulated to be 37°C (40) with vari- ations up to 0.5°C (mean 0.25°C) associated with the diurnal cycle. Additional temperature  variation up to 0.5°C (mean 0.25°C) is associated with the menstrual cycle (71). A critical</para>

      <para>review of thermometer technology and the site of measurement reported that the mean value  for core temperature is 0.2 to 0.5°C lower than 37°C (40). A diverse cohort study of 35,488  patients (mean age 52.9 years, 64% women, 41% non-white race) with 243,506 temperature  measurements reported a mean temperature of 36.6°C (95% range 35.7 to 37.3°C, 99%  range 35.3 to 37.7°C) (72). This range includes effects of the circadian cycle, and will be  used in this section to assess if additional margin can be allowed for the commonly adopted  limit of 1°C for core temperature increase for MRI exposures.</para>
      <para>Preventing harm from core temperature elevations relies on two arguments (36, 42, 63):  (1) effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and induced permeability of the blood- brain barrier (BBB), and (2) heat exhaustion and behavioral aversion. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis> summarizes  human core and brain temperatures and the variations concerning these guiding principles.  In the subsequent paragraphs, both arguments are discussed in greater detail.</para>

      <para>Limits to core or blood temperature intend to prevent indirect (additional) heating of  internal organs, especially the brain. Note the presence of an approximate 1°C temperature  gradient in the brain, where the surface temperature (e.g., at the tympanic membrane) equals  core (blood) temperature (73). The average and deep brain temperatures are 0.5 to 1.0°C  higher than core temperature due to the intense metabolic activity in gray matter. Activation  of the visual cortex is reported to locally increase its temperature by 0.7°C (73). Arterial  blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) provide the necessary cooling capacity to maintain  homeostasis. Notably, even higher temperatures can be caused by certain drugs or neuro- logic diseases (43, 74).</para>

      <para>Physiological Stress. MR systems intentionally expose patients to high RF amplitude  and dose, generally for a short duration (i.e., less than 1 hour). Such exposures must be con- trolled to avoid “physiological stress”, defined as occurrence of effects beyond modest dis- comfort. Control mechanisms include considerations of transient effects (75-78) and local  effects (see the section on Thermal Dose). The requirement that diagnostic imaging proce- dures shall not invoke undue stress is different from limits based on risk versus benefit con- siderations which are used in treatments like RF field-induced hyperthermia, where  occasional side effects could be acceptable when treating a known serious health risk (38,  79-81). The onset of sweating and the additional load of the cardiovascular system related  to the thermoregulatory response may, however, need to be avoided in certain patient groups  (35, 49, 67, 68). The whole-body averaged SAR limit for the Normal Operating Mode in  IEC 60601-2-33 (2) is, therefore, set to 2 W/kg. Simulations indicate that no special provi- sions are needed for elderly people, since the estimated effect of aging is less than variations  in the increase in core temperature associated with other factors (54, 57).</para>
      <para>Blood-Brain Barrier. The ICNIRP proposes to limit the temperature increase for the  brain (including the eye) conservatively to 2°C for occupational settings (4). Such temper- ature increases, however, cannot be justified in cases of brain injury, such as stroke or trau- matic brain injury (TBI), where modest temperature increases have been reported to  adversely affect outcomes (43, 82, 83). Similar caution is needed for cerebral disease or  drug regimens where brain temperatures are elevated (71, 74).</para>
      <para>Limited experimental data from animal models indicates that functional abnormalities  of the CNS, and BBB disruption are initiated at temperatures of 39 to 39.5°C (74, 84). Ef- fects on brain function and tissue seem reversible in the case of a short duration temperature  elevation, and an upper limit of 39.5°C for maximum (deep) brain temperature seems suf- ficiently conservative. Taking into account the temperature allowance necessary to account  for possibly unknown pathologic brain conditions, and at maximum core temperature levels,  deep brain temperature without exposure to RF energy may reach 38.8°C. Consequently,  an increase of 0.6 to 0.7°C is deemed acceptable for vulnerable patients.</para>
      <para>IEC 60601-2-33 requires scanning such patients in the Normal Operating Mode, with  reduced RF energy output and clinical observation. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2b</emphasis> indicates that under such  conditions, the temperature increase will not exceed these limits. Temperature in patients  with normal thermoregulation will be considerably (at least 0.7°C) lower than 38.8°C, and  a 1.3 to 1.4°C core temperature increase can be considered acceptable. This value is pre- dicted in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2a</emphasis> for long duration examinations performed at high SAR levels (i.e., with  the MR system operating in the First Level Controlled Operating Mode), and is consistent  with the history of the safe use of MRI.</para>
      <para>The Eye. Thermal sensitivity of the eye is inherently linked to thermal limits for sys- temic protection, because the temperature of the eye is largely determined by arterial blood  temperature. Corneal temperature is approximately 3°C lower than core temperature (85,  86). Cataract formation is reported in rabbits (albeit, a poor model due to the lateralized po- sition of the eyes compared to human subjects) for 20 to 40 W/kg local SAR at the eye. The  absence of such effects at these SAR levels in monkeys is attributed to differences in skull  and eye anatomy (87).</para>

      <para>Lesions have also been detected in isolated bovine eyes for incidental exposure to tem- peratures &gt; 39°C (88). Damage of the bovine lenses was recoverable when exposed for one  hour to 39.5°C, but remained in the lens epithelial cells. Experimental data reported tem- perature increases of the cornea &lt; 1.8°C in 33 patients at RF field exposures of 3 W/kg for  the head SAR (89), which is of no concern considering the low basal temperature of the  lens (85). Such an increase is consistent with numerical simulation results predicting a tem- perature increase &gt; 1°C in the eye when applying 3.2 W/kg head SAR for 30 minutes (90,  91). The local-to-head SAR ratio in quadrature RF excitations is approximately 4 W/kg (77,  92), and 3.2 W/kg head SAR corresponds to a local SAR exposure of 10 to 13 W/kg, or   &lt; 1°C temperature increase in brain tissue (93, 94). Note that 3.2 W/kg head SAR applies  to both the Normal Operating Mode and the First Level Controlled Mode in IEC60601-2- 33, and is inconsistent with different local SAR limits for those modes (10 and 20 W/kg,  respectively).</para>
      <para>The local SAR hotspot for quadrature-excitation does not coincide with the eye and, in  that case, no temperature concerns are present. Of course, this would be different for parallel  transmit, RF-shimmed excitations (91). Specific attention is needed to prevent an excessive  temperature increase in the eye for localized transmit or parallel transmit scenarios where  RF energy is focused in the ocular area (93). Steering of local SAR by RF pulse design and  averaging of RF power deposition by multiple shimmed RF pulses can be used to mitigate  such high local SAR hotspots, especially at ultra-high static magnetic fields and using multi- channel parallel transmit RF systems (93). Notably, exposure to higher levels of local SAR  (20 W/kg, 0.56 CEM43) in the context of RF field-induced hyperthermia in oncology pa- tients did not reveal cataract formation (95).</para>

      <para>Thermally-induced task aversion resulting from 4 W/kg RF exposure has been reported  in animals (36). Similarly, humans will adapt their behavior in warm environments to avoid  heat stroke. Studies in healthy volunteer subjects have shown significant adverse effects  when exposed to core temperatures approaching 39°C as associated with severe exercise  (36, 44, 96). Effects of temperature and dehydration cannot be separated in such studies.  There is a broad consensus that avoidance of undue heat stress in healthy humans requires  core temperature to stay below 38.5°C, as measured at the tympanic membrane, and should  likely be less in vulnerable human subjects. This value is consistent with an allowable in- crease of 1.3 to 1.4°C beyond the highest reported core temperature in non-febrile patients,  that is, 37.3°C (72).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Thermal Protection of the Fetus </emphasis></para>
      <para>Episodes of high temperature in the embryonic stage can be teratogenic or can result in  developmental defects (97). A retrospective review supported concerns for a potential neg- ative health impact associated with first trimester fever in human subjects (98). To the con- trary, a subsequent large-scale prospective study by the same investigators concluded that  there was no evidence that maternal fever during pregnancy induced congenital defects  (99). The latter finding corroborates reports that (non-contrast enhanced) MRI during preg- nancy does not negatively impact childhood outcomes (100, 101).</para>

      <para>MR imaging was likely performed using the Normal Operating Mode (2 W/kg whole- body averaged SAR), as required by IEC 60601-2-33 in the case of pregnancy. Additional  information on this topic is presented by Hand, et al. (102). Alternatively, a level of 1.5  W/kg for up to one hour of scanning is suggested as the limit for second and third trimester  patients by Ziskin and Morissey (97). Guidelines for obstetricians also suggest deferring  MRI, if any, to after the first trimester (103). This is in line with consensus guidelines for  fetal ultrasound (19, 20) which aim for As Low As Reasonable Achievable (ALARA) risk  by limiting thermal dose to the fetus to 1 CEM43 (see below).</para>
      <para>Fetal temperature is 0.3 to 0.5°C above maternal core temperature (32, 104, 105), and  heat exchange depends almost completely on the umbilical cord and placental heat ex- change. Numerical simulations of 80 MHz plane wave exposure show that the average fetal  temperature increase may exceed that of the mother (28), with values of 0.4 to 0.8°C for  one hour at 2 to 4 W/kg whole-body averaged SAR in the mother. Similar values have been  reported by various researchers for one hour MRI exposures in the Normal Operating Mode  (1.5 to 2 W/kg) (32, 102, 104). These predicted increases will keep the average temperature  in the fetus below 38°C.</para>
      <para>High-resolution numerical modeling indicates the existence of local thermal hotspots  in the fetus and the placenta (32), similar to inhomogeneous local SAR and temperature  distributions in adults (28-31, 75, 77, 106). Hotspots in the fetus may be particularly en- hanced in case of unfavorable RF shimming conditions at 3 T (32), where image quality  optimization (B1 + homogenization) in the mother may unduly increase the RF load in the  fetus. Safe use of RF shimming is possible when the MR system software takes into account  appropriate constraints on the allowed shim conditions (107). Otherwise, the use of the cir- cularly-polarized (CP) mode is recommended, at the expense of uniform flip angle distri- bution. Note that frequent fetal movements are expected to reduce the severity of local SAR  and temperature hotspots in the fetus, but not in the placenta. Short duration, low SAR, CP  mode scanning should remain the guidance for the utilization of MRI in pregnant patients.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Thermal Dose and its Proposed Used in MRI </emphasis></para>
      <para>Globally uniform RF transmit fields, such as CP in birdcage volume transmit coils, lead  to a highly non-uniform local SAR distribution in the human body (108). Early attempts  aimed to reflect this effect by using partial-body SAR instead of whole-body averaged SAR,  but simulations have shown that this approach allows for higher RF duty cycles and thereby  even higher local SAR (109, 110). Local SAR hotspots may cause a local temperature rise,  which may, at least in patients with sufficient thermoregulatory response, be moderated by  thermal diffusion and (increasing) blood flow.</para>
      <para>An overview of the biophysical aspects connecting SAR and local temperature is pro- vided in the work by Szasz, et al. (111), where it is argued that vasodilation may not be ef- fective for localized exposures. Numerical electromagnetic simulations provide local SAR  values which can be used in combination with Pennes’ Bioheat Equation (PBE) to derive  temperature distributions with an acclaimed accuracy of 10 to 15% (28-31, 75, 77, 93, 106,  112). A more advanced model, the Generic Bioheat Transfer Model, was proposed to better  fit data obtained in anesthetized swine (113), and addresses issues related to the assumption  of constant blood temperature in PBE. The lack of experimental data in human subjects,</para>

      <para>and variability of human anatomy and physiology, make it virtually impossible to decide  which model is more appropriate. The required accuracy for the local SAR and temperature  simulations with respect to averaging volume: 1g versus 10g (114, 115), averaging scheme  (4, 94, 116), and the number of required tissue types is discussed by Homann, et al. (114).</para>
      <para>The use of steady state approaches clearly overestimates the initial thermal response  (15 minutes), since energy deposition can, under normal circumstances, first be redistributed  in the peripheral body parts (111). A critical review of the merits and implications of the  use of PBE concludes that it is adequate in the context of RF field-induced heating simula- tions (117). This modeling approach has been validated with measurements in RF field-in- duced hyperthermia (118), for local exposure at 7 T (119), and in anesthetized swine where  severe muscle damage was observed for &gt; 4 W/kg and SA of 8 to 15 kJ/kg (120). The ob- served damage in the work by Nadobny, et al. (120) points to the usefulness of applying  the thermal dose concept, or CEM43, from hyperthermia to assess potential risks associated  with long-term, high-SAR MRI examinations.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Cumulative Equivalent Minutes at 43°C as a Basic Restriction </emphasis></para>
      <para>CEM43, or Cumulative Equivalent Minutes at 43°C is a local thermal dose “iso-effect”  metric (1), representing the duration of exposure at a reference temperature of 43°C, asso- ciated with the magnitude of a thermally-induced bio-effect observed or predicted to occur  at a different temperature, <emphasis role="italics">T</emphasis>, for duration, <emphasis role="italics">t</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">exam</emphasis>.

Note,  however, that CEM43 is based on Arrhenius plot for counted death cells, while the onset of  detectable death cells is not immediate. A more accurate parameter to describe the absence  of risk would be the fraction of living cells, which involves higher-order biochemical feed- back paths (122).

The delay of ob- servable damage (122) may, however, indicate a risk of unnoticed thermal overburden re- lated to an MRI examination.</para>
      <para>The exponential constant, R, is determined from cell cultures and animal models (121).  Human data is scarce but indicates that the R-values in human tissue may reflect a higher  thermal tolerance. Using the established R-values of 0.25 and 0.5 provides a more conser- vative accumulation of CEM43, and thresholds for basic restrictions have also been derived  based on these values for R (121, 122). Thresholds vary by more than two orders of mag- nitude with animal species and tissue type, and an analysis of the lowest value with reported  damage, and the highest value with no reported damage is provided by van Rhoon, et al.  (33). A conservative threshold of 2 CEM43 is proposed for all tissues and all patients. Higher  values (i.e., 9 CEM43 and 15 CEM43) are suggested to be safe for skin, muscle, fat and  bone. The ultrasound community has used the same information to derive a limit value of  1 CEM43, but acknowledges that 2 CEM43 would also be acceptable (20, 97). This thresh- old will protect nerves, both in the spinal cord and embedded in muscle. Peripheral nerves  are reported to be particularly vulnerable in sensitive patient classes, such as those with di- abetes or multiple sclerosis, and those undergoing chemo- or radiotherapy (123, 124).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Local SAR Modeling and Model Variability </emphasis></para>
      <para>CEM43 can easily be calculated from local SAR values obtained from numerical mod- eling (i.e., peak 10g averaged specific absorption rate, psSAR10g) (125). The use of 10 g  versus 1g averaging for local SAR has been evaluated in several studies (114, 115), with  the consensus being that a cubic averaging mass of 10g is appropriate when considering  thermal effects. For additional information, refer to the ICNIRP document and references  sited, therein (4). The use of smaller volumes does not reflect the typical heat diffusion  length and time scales, although some studies suggested that higher resolution might point  to the high local E-fields and locations at risk of skin-to-skin burns (126, 127). Different  approaches to spatial averaging have been shown to correspond to a factor of two difference  in estimated values (128). This is of course already potentially problematic when consider- ing that the difference in the exposure limits for the Normal Operating Mode and the First  Level Controlled Operating Mode differ by just a factor of two.</para>
      <para>Inhomogeneous local SAR and distributions have been studied using high-resolution  models for adults and children at different landmarks and poses (28-31, 75, 77, 106). Inter- pretation of the results remains a challenge for several reasons: in the real-world exposure  scenario, the transmit RF coil is tuned for an average load which, together with the design  details of the resonator, are difficult to represent in multiple setups. When appropriate cau- tion is taken, the results from the modeling packages, Remcon XFDTD and Sim4Life, match  extremely well (Private communication, Z. Zhang, 2021). Posing the model and avoiding  undue artifactual hotspots requires careful model setup and evaluation. Another parameter  to choose is the distance to shift the model through the transmit RF body coil when assessing  exposure scenarios. The difference in observed psSAR10g for actual simulation at a shift  of 2.5 cm or when interpolating from data simulated at 10 cm shifts is in the order of 2%  with outliers up to 10% (Private communication, Z. Zhang, 2021). This gives confidence</para>

      <para>that a limited set of exposure scenarios is sufficient to characterize the SAR behavior. In  addition, segmentation of tissues and assignment of boundaries for different conductivities  further contributes to uncertainty in simulated local SAR values. Early studies showed that  5 mm resolution is sufficient to obtain robust estimates of psSAR10g (129, 130), and a re- duction to three tissue types (muscle, fat, and lung) does not alter the overall reliability of  psSAR10g averages in the Visible Human Male and Female (114).</para>
      <para>A similar study was performed on the Chinese Adult Male and Female models and for  a comparable Chinese individual (deformable) model, reporting agreement to within 10%  for simulated psSAR10g between multi-tissue and reduced tissue-type simulations (131).  This approach using a limited set of tissue types was further advanced by the introduction  of the so-called Q-matrix formalism, which allowed for a rapid patient-individualized SAR  determination to control RF shimming at 3 T (106, 132). B1 + optimization while also con- trolling local SAR in the arms was shown to provide a far (up to four times) lower local  SAR in both the torso and in the extremities than when the arms were not taken into con- sideration. This suggests that individualized SAR assessment is a valuable asset for reducing  variability of actually delivered SAR across subjects. Evaluation of psSAR10g for 7 T, local  transmit RF coils in the brain (133) and in the prostate/pelvis using four-tissue segmented  data from 23 subjects indicated that a safety margin of one-half to two-times is necessary  if no explicit assessment of inter-subject variability is taken into account (134). RF shim- ming simultaneously improves the B1 uniformity and lowers psSAR10g relative to regular  quadrature-excitation (i.e., circularly-polarized).</para>
      <para>Additional studies focused on the effects of RF shimming in fetal imaging (32) and the  intra-subject and mother’s posture differences in maternal and fetal SAR (135). The ob- served variability in psSAR10g, especially in whole-body averaged exposure scenarios, in- dicates that appropriate model choice and selection of additional safety margin is not trivial.  Irrespectively, the data in by Homann, et al. (114) shows that the Visible Human Male pro- vides a reasonable worst-case human model for assessment of whole-body averaged SAR  and for psSAR10g in torso and extremities. An additional safety margin of 10 to 20% for  extremity SAR may be needed to ensure coverage of different poses of the arms across hu- mans.</para>

      <para>Peak temperature increases and thermal time constants were obtained for six numerical  human models at different imaging positions at 1.5 T and 3 T (28-30), under the conditions  of thermoregulation, and for basal perfusion. Extension to impaired thermoregulation is  presented in the work by Murbach, et al. (31), with an update of the parameters to be used  in the model. Temperature increase is calculated as a function of the value of psSAR10g  for the voxel where local SAR is highest (125). Using an estimated baseline body temper- ature (e.g., 36.8°C or 38°C), a worst-case estimate for CEM43 is obtained, albeit those ef- fects of core temperature increase are not accounted for. A re-evaluation of the results by  Neufeld, et al. (125) seems warranted since the core temperature increase could add 20 to  25% to the temperature increase caused by local SAR. Another necessary extension relates  to local exposure scenarios (125), using detachable transmit RF coils for head and knee im-</para>

      <para>Worst-case CEM43 values were calculated for the exposure scenario where local SAR  limits from IEC 60601-2-33 are applied to a whole-body averaged RF excitation (125). The  calculated thermal dose values are based on predicted local SAR values from the Philips  MR system software (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands). <emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis> shows a  correlation of calculated CEM43 and predicted specific absorption for 6,500 body/torso  exams with SA between 4 and 11 kJ/kg (subset of data used for <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>), using a baseline  temperature of 37°C and assuming that either all patients have fully-regulated perfusion or  all patients present with severely impaired thermoregulation. High SA levels will only be  reached for landmarks between the neck and groin (whole-body averaged SAR is lower for  other landmarks). Considering that local torso SAR is limited to 20 W/kg, the thermal dose  will not exceed 1 CEM43 in examinations of the torso. In other words, high SA does not  directly correlate with the high local thermal dose.</para>
      <para>Higher CEM43 values may be reached for landmarks where the ratio of local SAR to  whole-body averaged SAR is higher. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis> provides an overview of 210,000 examina- tions at 1.5 T and 3 T to assess the predicted temperature distribution and the resulting like- lihood of high CEM43 values, under conditions of normal and compromised  thermoregulation. Under the assumptions used in the work by Neufeld, et al.

      <para>atures and thermal dose values require further investigation before safe thresholds can be  established.</para>
      <para>High local thermal dose is delivered on purpose in RF field-induced hyperthermia,  where acute adverse effects (e.g., pain and RF burns) are reported for high local SAR values  (100 W/kg and higher) (38, 81). Where Wust, et al. (38) uses their observation that 1% of  (700) patients in 3,000 treatment sessions showed burns to propose safe local SAR limits  for MRI at 20 W/kg for head, neck and torso, and 30 W/kg for the extremities, the results  from Adibzadeh, et al. (81) and other data in the peer-reviewed literature (121) are used by  Adibzadeh, et al. (136) to derive the lowest thermal dose (TD) required to induce acute  local tissue damage, and to calculate the corresponding TD-functional SAR limits  (SARTDFL) for a 10 minute and a 60 minute steady-state exposure.</para>
      <para>CEM43 restrictions can be realized by applying appropriate SARTDFL limits to whole- body transmit RF coils, in conjunction with limits for whole-body averaged SAR or head  SAR values. Using the thermal damage threshold for muscle (60 CEM43) (136) suggests  that a SARTDFL of 200 to 300 W/kg could be tolerable. Current local SAR limits in IEC  60601-2-33 are 5 to 10 times lower (20 W/kg in the trunk and 40 W/kg in the extremities).  These reduced limits seem justified given the uncertainties in modeling and across the pop- ulation. Care must be taken, however, to not apply the uncertainty in both defining the limits  and when applying modeling approaches to demonstrate compliance with the limits. Pre- liminary analysis of CEM43 “big data” indicates that 2 CEM43 corresponds with current  limit values for local SAR in IEC 60601-2-33 (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>), but that higher values could oc- casionally occur. Such higher values have been previously suggested to be safe based on  an extensive review of CEM43 data (33), but evidence is insufficient to adopt thermal dose  thresholds &gt; 2 CEM43. Further studies are necessary to establish the appropriate model to  evaluate CEM43 and conservative values for CEM43 limits in the brain and lower extrem- ities, especially when using detachable transmit head or knee RF coils at 7 T. These use  scenarios are insufficiently covered by Neufeld, et al. (125), but their methodology can be  used to assess potential thermal risks in such designs.</para>

      <title>SUMMARY</title>
      <para>Protecting patients undergoing MRI examinations from adverse thermal effects neces- sitates considering both systemic and local temperature increases, as well as the thermal  dose. Prolonged duration, high-SAR MRI examinations can cause a core temperature in- crease &gt; 1°C, which is generally not problematic considering normal body temperatures,  thermoregulatory capabilities, and the allowable brain temperature. To prevent an excessive  core temperature increase (&gt; 1.3°C), the temperature in the MR system room should be  maintained at or below 22°C, the use of blankets should be avoided or blankets should be  removed from patients after a few initial scans, and the actual-delivered, specific absorption  should not exceed 4 kJ/kg. If higher SA levels are necessary, active cooling of the patient  by airflow and medical intervention may be warranted to prevent serious discomfort. Lower  whole-body averaged SAR (&lt;2 W/kg) values and short duration examinations should be  considered in vulnerable patient groups, including pregnant women. Local SAR control  (&lt;20 W/kg) for torso and spine MRI examinations is in most cases sufficient to prevent ex- ceeding 2 CEM43 if the increase in core temperature is not considered.
