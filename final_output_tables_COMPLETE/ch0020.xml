      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Magnetic resonance (MR) scanners utilize static magnetic, time-varying gradient mag- netic, and radiofrequency (RF) fields to image human subjects. Even when interacting with  purely biological tissues, these electromagnetic fields can pose a hazard for the patient by  excessive tissue heating due to the transmitted RF field. While still an active area of re- search, a high level of understanding has been achieved for this phenomenon and mature  safety provisions have emerged from this knowledge. The situation becomes more compli-</para>

      <para>cated when a patient has a metallic biomedical implant, especially if that device contains  electrically conductive parts.</para>
      <para>By the physical nature of their interactions, patient hazards related to magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) that are due to the presence of metallic implants can be grouped into  four categories: (1) forces and torques acting on ferromagnetic objects due to the static mag- netic field, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>0; (2) forces, sometimes referred to as Lenz forces, and related torques exerted  by the static magnetic field on moving metallic objects, even if nonferromagnetic; (3) mal- function of an active implanted medical device (AIMD, i.e., an implant relying on an em- bedded energy source to function such as a cardiac pacemaker or a neuromodulation system)  because of the strong electromagnetic fields used during MRI, which may impact the vital  functions of the device or even damage it; and (4) localized heating and resulting tissue  damage due to currents in the implant induced by the RF fields and the time-varying gradient  magnetic fields (1-3).</para>
      <para>Today’s MR systems are built to image biological tissues but not to deal with implanted  metallic objects and, thus, they have no means to automatically detect and adjust to them  even though implemented safety measures are no longer adequate in the presence of metals  (4). Ultimately, appropriate safety concepts for scanning patients with implants must be  carried out at a <emphasis role="italics">system level</emphasis>. That is, MR scanners must be designed to detect an implant in  the patient and respond accordingly by adjusting scan parameters or, in extreme cases, by  rejecting the MRI exam if it cannot be conducted safely. However, this technology is not  yet available and, until then, it will remain the responsibility of the MR system operators  (i.e., the MRI technologists and radiographers) to ensure the safe scanning of patients with  metallic implants.</para>
      <para>Severe injuries and fatalities have occurred in patients with implants that underwent  MRI (5-10). Most of these incidents were related to dislodgement of a ferromagnetic implant  (e.g., an aneurysm clip) or the malfunction of a device, such as a cardiac pacemaker. Severe  injuries solely because of excessive implant heating have been documented (8–12). In these  instances, RF-induced heating of deep brain stimulation leads was believed to be responsible  for the greatest risk during MRI (8-12). Of note is that, in phantom experiments, the tem- perature at the tip of a long wire may increase by as much as 75°C under certain RF exposure  conditions (13).</para>
      <para>The present chapter focuses on the state of knowledge on the important topic of MRI- related heating of implants and devices. This attention to this single subject is not because  other MRI-related hazards would be less dangerous (the opposite is most certainly true) but  because it is (1) omnipresent, and (2) scientifically and practically the most challenging  case for a risk assessment (14). Within the limited space of this chapter, we will consider  fully incorporated biomedical implants, while interventional and intraoperative devices will  not be covered, despite plentiful conceptual similarities.</para>
      <para>In the following sections, the underlying physics of implant heating will be presented  and summarized. Additionally, the most relevant standardization documents in this field  will be recapitulated since they define how both MR systems and implants are designed,  built, and tested. Importantly, such standards inform MRI users as to what they can, or rather  should not, expect from a device.</para>

      <para>While this first part aims to provide a conceptual background at a level suited also for  general readership, the subsequent sections address mostly the active researchers in the  field. Methods to assess and emerging concepts to actively mitigate implant-related hazards  in association with MRI technology will be reviewed, with a focus on recent developments.  An extensive evaluation of past developments that brought the field to where it stands today  is not possible within the present format. MR system users and operators seeking practical  advice about scanning or not scanning a patient with implants or devices are kindly referred  to the literature, continuously updated websites on this important subject (15, 16), and other  chapters in this textbook.</para>

      <title>PHYSICS OF IMPLANT HEATING</title>
      <para>MRI relies on two time-varying magnetic fields, that is, the RF field and gradient mag- netic field, which differ in frequency and amplitude. The sinusoidal RF field, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1, is required  to excite the spins to be imaged. Usually, it is generated by a volume transmit RF coil like  the scanner’s body RF coil or a dedicated transmit/receive head RF coil. The design target  is a homogeneous <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1-field over most of the RF coil’s geometrical volume. Amplitudes are  in the 10 µT range and frequencies are in the 100 MHz regime. The gradient magnetic field,  <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>G, provides spatial encoding for image generation. The water-cooled gradient coils create  <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>(0, z) gradients in three orthogonal directions. The design targets are linearly varying offset  fields around the isocenter (where <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>G=0). Radially, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>G fields are maximal at the MR sys- tem’s bore; axially, they have maxima around the ends of the gradient coils (i.e., at |z|≈30  to 50 cm). In modern clinical MR scanners, amplitudes reach the 10 mT regime in those  areas. Gradient magnetic fields have base frequencies in the kilohertz range, but higher har- monics up to several 10 kHz often exist.</para>
      <para>Faraday’s law requires that all time-varying magnetic fields <emphasis role="italics">B(t)</emphasis> are accompanied by  electric fields <emphasis role="italics">E(t)</emphasis>, where <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>∝<emphasis role="italics">f B</emphasis> for sinusoidal <emphasis role="italics">B(t)</emphasis> with frequency <emphasis role="italics">f</emphasis>. In an electrically con- ductive metallic implant with conductivity <emphasis role="italics">σ</emphasis>, those <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-fields drive so-called eddy currents  with current densities <emphasis role="italics">J = </emphasis><emphasis role="italics">σ</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>. This occurs also in biological tissue but is much more dramatic  in metals (including “poorly conducting” alloys), which typically have ~ 10<superscript>6</superscript> times higher  electrical conductivities. These induced currents have two effects: (1) due to ohmic losses,  power <emphasis role="italics">P </emphasis>∝<emphasis role="italics">JE</emphasis> is locally deposited <emphasis role="italics">inside</emphasis> the implant, leading to a temperature increase with  an initial slope of <emphasis role="italics">dT </emphasis>∕<emphasis role="italics"> dt=P </emphasis>∕ <emphasis role="italics">C</emphasis>, where <emphasis role="italics">C</emphasis> is the heat capacity of the exposed mass, and (2)  secondary <emphasis role="italics">B-</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">E-</emphasis>fields are induced around the implant which superimpose the incident  <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field and modify the power deposition. Both effects can lead to tissue heating but the  mechanisms depend on frequency and, thus, are very different for gradients and RF fields.</para>

      <para>where the angular brackets denote temporal averaging. Electrical conductivity <emphasis role="italics">σ</emphasis> and  mass density <emphasis role="italics">ρ</emphasis> are tissue parameters; <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis> depends on MRI hardware and software, the transmit  RF coil, and pulse sequence. SAR is a local quantity since all parameters are position de- pendent and Equation (1) holds with or without an implant being present.</para>
      <para>In a periodic MRI pulse sequence, 〈<emphasis role="italics">P</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">RF</emphasis> 〉t in Equation (1) is given by the sum of all  pulse energies ∫ <emphasis role="italics">P</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">RF</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">dt</emphasis> divided by the repetition time, TR. Consequently, sequences with a  short repetition time (TR) and a high density of high-power pulses have increased SAR val- ues. The time-averaged SAR can be modified and limited to safe exposure levels, for ex- ample, by reducing the flip angle and, thus, the power per RF pulse, and/or by extending  the TR and, thus, the mean time between RF pulses.</para>
      <para>RF currents at <emphasis role="italics">f</emphasis> ~ 100 MHz in metallic objects are restricted to a thin surface layer of  about ~100 µm by the laws of electrodynamics (i.e., the skin effect). The mass of directly  heated implant material remains too small, therefore, to affect the neighboring tissue no- ticeably. The current-induced secondary <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field (i.e., the “scattered field”) around the im- plant becomes highly relevant, however, as it can vastly exceed the primary “background”  <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field in critical locations. RF currents induced directly in tissue by the scattered <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field  are the dominant effect for RF-induced implant heating (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>). In particular, a one-di- mensional implant tends to exhibit the so-called “antenna effect” which is a pronounced  maximum of the scattered <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field at the distal end, whose intensity peaks when the electrical  length of the implant is in the range of one-quarter to one-half of the RF wavelength in  tissue (17). The electromagnetic energy of the background field is then most effectively  converted into implant current and corresponding scattered field.</para>

      <para>In contrast to the RF energy case, secondary <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-fields and the direct induction of currents  <emphasis role="italics">in tissue</emphasis> are both negligible for gradient switching at kilohertz frequencies. Switched gra- dients can heat-up the metallic implant, itself, however, via eddy currents. These currents  and the associated power deposition are confined to the metal, but thermal energy diffuses  into adjacent tissues, subsequently. Such confined eddy-current loops are intrinsically lim- ited in small or approximately one-dimensional implants (e.g., screws or leads) but are pos- sibly substantial in implants with a large cross-sectional area (e.g., orthopedic prostheses  such as total hip or knee replacement implants), where large, low-resistance closed current  paths exist (18, 19).</para>

      <para>For a given implant, gradient heating is maximal, when the implant is positioned in the  aforementioned locations of highest <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">G</emphasis>, when the gradients are ramped at the highest avail- able slew rate, and when pulse sequences are run with a high “slew percentage” (i.e., a high  fraction of ramp time during the TR). The gradient strength itself is only indirectly a factor,  insofar as higher gradients need longer ramp times to reach them.</para>
      <para>Few studies on MRI-related gradient magnetic field-induced implant heating exist. Ear- lier reports did not find significant temperature elevations (20, 21), yet did not systematically  investigate critical scenarios, as described in the previous paragraph. More recent work  demonstrated that gradient magnetic field-inducted heating of a hip prostheses (namely, the  acetabular cup component) can increase the temperature in adjacent tissue by several de- grees using a manufacturer-provided, “gradient aggressive” pulse sequence, in the afore- mentioned sense, on a clinical MR system (18, 22–24) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>). Very close agreement  between experimental findings and computational results indicated that the effects are well  understood (24).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">From Power Deposition to Heating to Tissue Damage </emphasis></para>
      <para>So far, only implant-related changes in the power deposition were discussed, but the  hazards are excessive tissue temperatures. As such, temperature is established by the balance  between heating and cooling. Implant heating is a local phenomenon and the most widely  used description in this context is Pennes Bioheat Equation (PBE) (25), as follows:</para>

Subscripts <emphasis role="italics">t </emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">b</emphasis> refer to tissue and (arterial) blood, respectively. Tissue temperature change on the left  is expressed as the balance of heat diffusion, perfusion cooling, metabolic heat   <emphasis role="italics">Q</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis> (W kg<superscript>-1</superscript>) and external heat, <emphasis role="italics">Q</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">ext</emphasis> (W kg<superscript>-1</superscript>), such as SAR. Equilibrium (<emphasis role="italics">d T</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">t</emphasis> ∕ <emphasis role="italics">dt </emphasis>= 0) is  reached when the terms on the right-hand side compensate each other. PBE is not a funda- mental law and makes a number of questionable assumptions (e.g., the blood pool as an in- finite heat sink, isotropic thermal conduction, inadequate perfusion model, absence of  thermoregulation, etc.). Still, it appears to work remarkably well in predicting tissue tem- peratures (see (26) for an extended discussion).</para>
      <para>Thermal modeling is indispensable to assess hazards related to implant heating by gra- dient switching since the deposited power reaches the tissues only via thermal diffusion.  But also for RF energy-induced heating it is highly advisable even though the existing reg- ulations only impose limits on SAR. The tissue parameters <emphasis role="italics">k</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">t</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italics">w</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">t</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="italics">Q</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">m</emphasis> in Equation (4)  can vary by orders of magnitude between tissue types (27). Therefore, even a uniform ex- ternal power deposition would result in a non-uniform distribution of equilibrium temper- atures in the human body. Equivalently, it can be said that for a non-uniform SAR  distribution, the temperature hotspots will not normally coincide with the SAR hotspots  (28). This discrepancy can be further enhanced by the high thermal conductivity of metallic  implants. This reduces temperature differences along the implant and tends to “smear” out  localized hotspots.</para>

</table><para>For a conclusive safety assessment, however, even a realistic temperature distribution  is not yet sufficient, because tissue types vary not only in cooling properties but also in tem- perature resilience.

As previously mentioned, RF-induced cur- rents in metals are confined to a thin surface layer by the skin effect, while the low-frequency  gradient currents fill almost the whole implant volume. Compared to RF fields, gradient  switching has a lower frequency content (&lt;10<superscript>5</superscript> Hz vs. ~10<superscript>8</superscript> Hz) but a higher magnitude (~10  mT vs. ~10 µT). The combined effect is that, in “bulky” (i.e., implants with a relatively  larger surface area such as an implantable infusion pump or a total hip prosthesis) metallic  objects, switched gradients can deposit much more power than RF energy (19).

      <para>A set of international standards was established in recent decades covering implant  safety in MRI (34), which was supplemented by recommendations from governmental agen- cies (35, 36). All refer to the international MRI safety standard from the International Elec- trotechnical Commission, IEC 60601-2-33, first established in 1995 (37). Below, we  summarize the three most relevant standards concerning implant-related heating in the MRI  environment, namely ASTM F2182 (38), IEC 60601-2-33 (37), and International Organi- zation for Standardization/Technical Specification, ISO/TS 10974 (39). Note, however, that  the instructions of use provided by the MR system manufacturer may be more restrictive  than the currently applicable standard. These instructions are legally relevant, because not  following them constitutes “off-label” use with potentially severe liability implications for  the physician supervisor as well as the MR system operator.</para>
      <para>All three standards adopt a scheme from ASTM F2503 (40) where implants are labeled  as either <emphasis role="italics">MR Unsafe</emphasis> (“an item that is known to pose hazards in all MRI environments”),  <emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional</emphasis> (“an item that has been demonstrated to pose no known hazards in a spec- ified MRI environment with specified conditions of use”), or <emphasis role="italics">MR Safe</emphasis> (“an item that poses  no known hazards in all MRI environments”). Note that metallic items can always exert  Lenz forces and create image artifacts, which may present diagnostic hazards (41) and hence  are never <emphasis role="italics">MR Safe</emphasis> in this terminology. This labeling is the responsibility of the implant  manufacturer who defines the conditions for safe use in association with MRI technology.</para>

      <title>ASTM F2182</title>
      <para>The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International standard F2182  is fully designated to RF-induced implant heating (38). It provides the implant manufacturer  with well-defined procedures and materials for <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> heating tests of their devices. The  standard itself defines no pass or fail criteria. The test results are sent to and evaluated by a  competent authority, most notably the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA),  for a decision on the conditionality of the implant for MRI. There are other related ASTM  International standards (i.e., ASTM F2052, F2119, F2213, and F2503) that are outside the  scope of this chapter.</para>
      <para>ASTM F2182 describes in detail a test procedure where the implant under test is em- bedded in gelled-saline filled phantom setup and exposed to a relatively high, whole-body  averaged SAR value (i.e., 2 W/kg or higher) by using either a 1.5 T or 3 T MR scanner or  a suitable benchtop system, reproducing the RF fields from a transmit body RF coil oper- ating in a circularly-polarized (CP) mode. For 15 minutes, the temperature is monitored.  By repeating the measurement with the implant removed, the background temperature rise  is also measured, and the implant-related temperature rise can be determined.</para>
      <para>The scope of ASTM F2182 is limited to passive implants that are completely inside the  human body. However, similar methods described in ASTM F2182 can be applied for de- vices penetrating the body’s surface (e.g., external fixation systems, vascular catheters, etc.).  Procedures described in ASTM F2182 are also appropriate to perform validation experi- ments as required by ISO/TS 10974.</para>

It provides manufacturers of MR systems with a comprehensive set of criteria  and limits, thus allowing them to self-declare conformity if all requirements are met. This  standard is generally all about the MR scanner and implant safety is only one of many topics  presented in this document.</para>
      <para>According to IEC 60601-2-33, the risk of RF field-induced heating of an MR Condi- tional device should be assessed in terms of the root-mean-square (RMS) averaged, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1+RMS</para>
      <para>with an averaging period <emphasis role="italics">t</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">x</emphasis> = 10 s. From pre-scan flip-angle measurements, the absolute  value of <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><superscript>+</superscript>1 can be determined, making <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1+RMS a reliably calibrated quantity when averaged  over a proper region of interest in a central axial slice. <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1+RMS is typically calibrated by the  MR system, and its values should be displayed by the MR scanner’s software. However, it  is important to note that implant heating is related to the total <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">1</emphasis> (i.e., all three vector com- ponents), not just <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><superscript>+</superscript>1, and the standard gives some guidance to estimate the uncertainties  when using <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1+RMS. This quantity is a much more consistent approach to assess RF-induced  implant heating than the whole-body averaged SAR, which was previously the reference  metric. In contrast to the whole-body averaged SAR, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1+RMS is independent of the patient  and calculated consistently by different MR system manufacturers.</para>
      <para>In the latest version of IEC 60601-2-33, the so-called Fixed-Parameter Option (FPO)  was introduced for 1.5 T MR scanners (FPO:B), which specifically addresses scanning pa- tients with implants. In the FPO:B mode, both the RF and the gradient outputs are restricted,  and the MR system manufacturer guarantees that specified maximum values are nowhere  exceeded, within a defined volume in the bore of the MR scanner. Important FPO:B limit  values are <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1+RMS = 3.2 μT and |(<emphasis role="italics">dB</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">G</emphasis>) ∕ <emphasis role="italics">dt</emphasis>|RMS = 56 T/s where</para>

The latter limit relates to  gradient-induced implant heating but was introduced primarily to protect the device from  damage. Note that the FPO:B limits do not by themselves define “safe scan” conditions.  The FPO rationale is that the MR system manufacturer guarantees that those field limits  are kept, such that implant manufacturers can design and test their devices, accordingly.  Only the combination, that is, a MR system operating in the FPO mode and an FPO-ap- proved implant or device, would then establish a safe setting for the patient.

Lower levels are synony- mous with lower accuracy and larger safety margins that need to be applied. Tier 1 does  not require electromagnetic modeling. Tier 2 uses simulated human RF exposures to “de- termine the electric field in the implant volume of interest”. Tiers 1 and 2 are restricted to  “electrically short” AIMDs, since phase effects are not included. For Tier 3, an equivalent  electromagnetic model of the AIMD is required to determine the transfer function (42). Tier  4 assesses the AIMD electromagnetic model within anatomical models for relevant RF field  exposure conditions. Except for very simple implants, the Tier 4 approach is the most chal- lenging, requiring state-of-the-art computational capabilities.</para>

      <title>METHODS TO ASSESS IMPLANT SAFETY</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Simplifications </emphasis></para>
      <para>Long, one-dimensional shaped implants (e.g., cardiac pacemaker leads) collect RF en- ergy over their entire length which makes them potentially hazardous and simultaneously  defies simplifying assumptions like a constant <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field, in magnitude and phase, over the  entire implant. Their structural detail, for example, a finely wound helix or multiple elec- trodes, and steep field gradients near the implant call for a high mesh resolution but the  simulation space, defined by the transmit body RF coil, remains large. To aggravate the  problem, the trajectories for long leads are not well defined and, thus, a variety of different  clinically relevant pathways needs to be investigated. Numerical simplification approaches  exist and are widely used, such as the Huygens box concept where a high-resolution simu- lation of the implant region is embedded in a lower-resolution simulation of the rest of the  body (43). For a discussion of the pros and cons of such procedures, the reader is referred  to specialized reviews on numerical techniques including the work by Li, et al. (44).</para>
      <para>To simplify the geometry, helices are often modeled as straight wires plus lumped ele- ments to account for their inductance or stents as cylinders, ignoring their complex wire- mesh structure (45, 46). Despite these efforts, full Tier 4 simulations are not yet feasible  with normal computational resources, and Tier 3 represents the actual state of the art. There,  first the full-scale native problem, that is, a numerical body model without the implant in  an MR scanner, is computed at an appropriate resolution providing the spatial distribution  of the unperturbed background <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field. This part may be repeated for different body models,  positions, postures, or transmit RF coils, resulting in a library of background fields. In a  second step, the electrodynamic response of the metallic implant to that background field  is computed. Frequently, this is expressed as the “scattered field,” that is, the difference be- tween the total <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field with the implant and background field.</para>
      <para>The critical spot of a wire-like implant is always at the distal tip and a frequent simpli- fication, therefore, is to ignore all other locations. The scattered field at the tip can be derived  from the background-field distribution along the implant trajectory. A first step in that di-</para>

      <para>rection was the definition of a “safety index” as a metric to characterize one-dimensional  implants (47). Later, this was succeeded by the introduction of the transfer function (TF)  (42), the most widely-used approach to assess the MRI safety of one-dimensional implants  today. To determine the scattered <emphasis role="italics">E-</emphasis>field at some reference  in tissue, close to the tip, one  needs to know the response   of the <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field at the reference point to a unit tangential  <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field applied somewhere along the implant (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>). The latter location is uniquely  identified by a scalar coordinate, ẑ measuring its distance from the tip along the implant  trajectory. This response can be expressed as a complex weight function   and the  desired ‘scattered’ field   can then be obtained by integrating the weighted tangential  background field <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis><emphasis role="italics">tan</emphasis><emphasis role="italics"> </emphasis>(ẑ) along the wire:</para>
      <para>The normalized, dimensionless function   describes the spatial distribution of the  scattered <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field around the tip and is assumed to be independent of how the implant was  excited. Thus, the problem is broken down into two independent steps, namely to determine  (1) the background <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field without implant, and (2) the transfer function <emphasis role="italics">S</emphasis>(ẑ) of the implant.  The former means a state-of-the-art EMF simulation, the latter can be achieved either by  simulations or experimentally. TF is a normalized, complex function, determining how var- ious elementary RF currents induced along the length of the implant superimpose at the tip.</para>

      <para>In this instance, the TF phase describes the propagation and the TF magnitude the attenua- tion of an RF current along the implant. In the simplest case, the TF phase would be a linear  function of the distance from the tip. The <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field “collected” within a certain distance from  the tip would then increase the scattered field around the tip while contributions from be- yond that point would decrease it again (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). For longer distances, attenuation damp- ens the interference pattern, but a critical “resonance length” of one quarter to one half the  RF current wavelength persists. This wavelength, and hence the TF, depend on the dielectric  parameters of the tissue and possibly an insulation surrounding the implant. The TF of an  implant depends on its environment, therefore, but for simplicity this fact is often ignored.  For unfavorable phase distributions of the background <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field the tip heating can signifi- cantly exceed even the values for the resonant length (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>The TF can be determined by measuring or calculating the scattered <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field at some  reference point,   close to the tip when the implant is exposed to a piece-wise excitation  by a unity tangential <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field. In simulations, this can be approximated artificially by a short  boxcar function (42) or as the <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field between two parallel metallic plates in close proximity  to one another (48). Experimentally, for example, short toroid coils or coaxial cables with  a few millimeters of bare inner conductor can be used (49, 50).</para>
      <para>An important advancement to reduce the multitude of piece-wise excitations and meas- urements (and/or simulations) to a single excitation is based on the principle of reciprocity  (51). Injecting a unit current at its tip, the TF is represented by the current distribution along  the implant and several experimental strategies were proposed to determine this current (50,  52, 53).</para>

The numerical assessment of implant heating in the MR scanner  involves a whole chain of exposure assessments, which can broadly be categorized into (1)  three-dimensional (3D), computer aided design (CAD) models of RF or gradient coil, im- plant, and patient, (2) the electromagnetic simulation including dielectric properties of all  involved tissues and electrical elements, and (3) the thermal simulation along with thermal  and physiological tissue parameters.</para>
      <para>Here, we focus on the implant-related aspects of simulations. A more detailed overview  of electromagnetic-simulation techniques in an MRI safety context, in general, can be found,  in the work by Fiedler, et al. (54).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Realistic Simulation and Body Models</emphasis>. If the 3D-CAD model of an implant cannot be  obtained from the manufacturer, an electrically equivalent simulation model could be cre- ated from the actual implant, based on its geometry, composition, and size. Transmit RF  and gradient coils are integral parts of the MR scanner and their actual design is more dif- ficult to create. However, RF field measurements can be utilized to give a good estimate  about the design, length, and diameter of commercial transmit body RF coils (55, 56). Reg- ularly at 7 T but occasionally at lower field strengths, too, local transmit-receive RF coils  are used (e.g., for head or knee MRI exams). In such a case, safety assessments of implants  are only possible if the RF fields or the transmit RF coil model are known (57, 58). It is im- portant to apply the correct transmit coil-driving conditions (e.g., circularly-polarized, CP,  quadrature-driven). Transmit RF body coils of 1.5 T MR systems typically apply only the  CP mode, whereas at 3 T and above, RF shimming is common to counteract <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><superscript>+</superscript>1 inhomo- geneities (59–61).</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italics">Electromagnetic Simulation Techniques – RF Fields and Currents</emphasis>. There are several  simulation techniques in computational electromagnetics, each with advantages and weak- nesses. For birdcage coils, the method of moments (MOM) also called the Boundary Ele- ment Method (BEM), or the finite elements method (FEM) may be the best choices, because  they can treat curved geometrical objects more accurately than other techniques. However,  when complex anatomical models or structures are involved, the simulation space can easily  reach dimensions of 100 million voxels (three-dimensional pixels) or more, which is most  efficiently handled by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique.</para>

The  simulation output contains the induced <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field distribution in the patient for a given exposure  scenario and can be expressed as SAR maps, which are subjected to different averaging  volumes. The most important of which are the whole-body averaged SAR and the local  SAR averaged over 10 g of tissue (37). For implants, there is an ongoing discussion whether  smaller averaging masses should be used to assess temperature and thermal dose more cor- rectly (45, 68, 69).</para>
      <para>The exposure condition in the simulation model such as linearly-polarized, CP, or RF  shimming, is important and needs to match reality since it determines the background <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>- field distribution responsible for the RF field-induced implant heating. With state-of-the- art electromagnetic modeling, satisfactory agreement (for the given purpose) with phantom  measurements can be obtained and (standard) uncertainties in the range of 10 to 15% (70)  should be achieved for local SAR values, because the dielectric properties of the tissues are  only minimally affected by the physiological response.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Electromagnetic Simulation Techniques – Gradient Fields and Induced Currents</emphasis>. Most  investigations dealing with the simulations of gradient-induced heating of bulky implants  adopt the hybrid FEM/BEM frequency-domain formulation described by Zilberti, et al.  (22). Such a formulation applies to non-magnetic metallic implants and, at the frequencies  of interest, assumes that the current density induced inside bulky implants is much higher  than in the surrounding tissues, thus limiting the electromagnetic problem to the implant  volume. To simulate a gradient sequence realistically, the harmonic solutions are moved  back to the time domain, where they are properly combined to follow the actual waveforms  of the three gradient coils.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Electromagnetic Simulation Techniques – Thermal Simulations</emphasis>. The power-density dis- tribution from electromagnetic simulations can be used as input for thermal simulations  (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>). For one-dimensional implants, RF power is absorbed along the whole length of  the lead(s) but tissue heating occurs only around the tip or end and this fact can be exploited  to reduce the total computational burden (71). Steady-state solvers can be used when only  absolute equilibrium temperatures are of interest. To simulate temperature increase versus  time, more complex transient time-domain solvers are required. As previously-stated,  Pennes Bioheat Equation (PBE) (25) is presumably the most widely used formulation, and  most commercial software to calculate tissue temperatures employs PBE or amended vari- ants, for example, with thermoregulation included (i.e., temperature dependent tissue pa- rameters). It performs well for the given exposure scenarios but is a heatsink model  assuming stable core temperatures. If a patient’s core temperature increase must be consid- ered, the PBE can be enhanced by a variable blood temperature formulation. Other aspects  remain neglected, however, such as anisotropic heat-flux or blood temperature variations  along the vessel. For the latter, the impact of the thermal vasculature could be investigated  based on a model which couples, one-dimensional convective vascular tree thermal simu- lations with 3D thermal modeling (72). While the PBE assumes that the arterial inflow to  tissue is still at core temperature, such discrete vasculature (DIVA) models (73) acknowl- edge the flow directionality and the gradual thermalization of blood along the (arterial) vas-</para>

Sophisticated  electromagnetic modeling can be performed on virtual body models, but these models never  represent the true patient geometry.

This allows regional shrinkage or  expansion of certain tissues (e.g., fat, muscle, etc.) to investigate the effect of different tissue  distributions.

      <para>If a certain target anatomy of the actual patient is aimed for in higher detail, a 3D image  registration is better suited to capture the actual skeletal anatomy and posture. Sparse (e.g.,  cross-sectional) pilot-scan images of the patient could be used as input for the non-rigid  registration approach to map the numerical phantom to the patient-specific anatomy (77- 79). The resulting 3D-registered derivative can then be used to compute the exposure esti- mation on-the-fly. Unfortunately, as of today, personalized electromagnetic simulations are  not yet in widespread use.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Measurements </emphasis></para>
      <para>Measurement procedures for <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> model validation are well described in ISO/TS  10974 (39). Assessments can be performed at points of interest near the implant, by meas- uring either (1) electromagnetic-field quantities using time-domain sensors, or (2) root- mean-square (RMS) quantities like voltage or temperature. Fiber-optic temperature probes  are the most widely used sensors for safety assessments involving patients and metallic im- plants in MRI (11). They use a non-conducting transmission medium and are nonferromag- netic, preventing RF coupling and enabling a precise and accurate application to record  temperatures in the harsh electromagnetic environment associated with the MR system. Im- portantly, in order to obtain an accurate assessment of temperatures, probe positioning rel- ative to the implant is crucial. For example, for a peak temperature of 10°C, a 1°C change  can be observed over less than 250 µm (80) .</para>
      <para>Time-domain probes yield information on amplitudes and phases of field quantities  which is necessary, for example, for TF measurements (50, 81). For <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis> applications in  the MR scanner, the field probes must be nonferromagnetic and must not generate static  magnetic fields by internal DC currents. Examples of <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis> RF current measurements on  implanted wires using optical fibers for signal transfer have been reported by Zanchi, et al.  (13) and Weidemann, et al. (82). Recently, fully optical <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field measurements based on  electro-optic field sensing have been used to assess the RF safety of different stent config- urations (83). While this technique is promising, it is too premature for a final judgment  with respect to its validity.</para>
      <para>Another approach to perform <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis> measurements especially in active devices is the  use of already built-in sensors. Due to the lack of a phase reference, this appears to be  limited to RMS measurements so far, but this issue may be resolved in the near future using  state-of-the-art electronics. In a proof-of-principle investigation, it was shown that the tem- perature at the tip of an implanted pacemaker lead surrogate can be reliably measured during  <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> MRI using wireless data transfer (84).</para>

      <para>Recently, methods have been investigated to assess implant safety <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> by MR-based  methods. This methodology, if further developed and validated, would enable patient-spe- cific safety evaluations of implanted devices. Approaches to “put the implant patient in the  scanner and see what happens” exist (85) and are not automatically unethical, if done with  the necessary caution. Still, they are not discussed here as they do little to quantify the pa- tient hazard.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Non-MR Based Methods</emphasis>. A metallic implant with strong coupling to the transmit RF  coil causes substantial impedance changes. These can be measured via the RF coil’s current  distribution or scattering (S) parameters and related to the induced current strengths and  the location of the implant if a multichannel transmission system is used (86–88) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">8</emphasis>). Such an “implant detector” at an MR system level would solve many problems, only it  would be very difficult to ensure that every hazardous implant is detected.</para>
      <para>Another method to determine potential RF field-induced heating <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> independently  of prior simulations is the use of integrated temperature sensors in the implant at locations  where the maximum temperature increase is expected (84, 89). Alternatively, the thermo- acoustic effect can be utilized for external temperature monitoring (90, 91). The latter ex- ploits the pressure waves that a sudden temperature increase inevitably generates and can  be detected by sensitive acoustic receivers. It has been shown in a proof-of-concept study  that this ultrasound signal can be used to detect RF field-induced heating of a lead tip and,</para>

      <para>therefore, could be utilized in a pre-scan MRI procedure (91). Translating such ultrasound- based systems to a robust clinical <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> application is challenging, however (i.e., due to  receiver size and positioning, movement, acoustic window, signal-to-noise constraints,  quantified measurements etc.), and still needs to be demonstrated.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">MR-Based Methods</emphasis>. The MR scanner itself is a versatile machine, and several publica- tions demonstrated that it could be utilized for a noninvasive, implant safety assessment  and monitoring, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>. However, this is ongoing research and not yet routinely available.</para>
      <para>For elongated implants, tip heating is related to the induced RF currents in the implant  (92), which then induce a new <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1,<emphasis role="italics">ind</emphasis>-field altering the total <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><superscript>+</superscript>1. Consequently, tip heating  can be estimated by MR-based measurements of <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><superscript>+</superscript>1 around the implant (93, 94) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">9</emphasis>). If <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1,<emphasis role="italics">ind</emphasis> has a <emphasis role="italics">z</emphasis>-component, it will also shift the RF phase (95).</para>
      <para>Implant-related image <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1 effects can also be translated to direct measurements of the  induced RF current in the implant. This may appear as a detour because, ultimately, the  quantity of interest is temperature, and implant current is only a surrogate. The advantage  of current measurements is their sensitivity. In principle, relatively small and harmless im- plant currents are detectable <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>, while a measurable temperature rise may be potentially  hazardous for the patient. Frequently, model assumption like a perfect quadrature excitation  or simplifications like a quasi-static treatment neglecting displacement currents are being  used to facilitate direct current quantification without extensive numerical simulations. The  measured <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><superscript>+</superscript>1 magnitude at a certain radius from the conductor can be converted into the  magnitude of the current by applying a simplified Ampere’s circuit law (96–98). The back- ground signal around the lead, which <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> is often inhomogeneous, represents a source  of error for magnitude-based methods. A way to suppress this background signal is by using  reversed RF polarization on the transmitter and receiver (98) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). In this manner,  ideally only the implant coupling is visualized in the MR image and can be used to deter- mine the current amplitude. On the receiver side, reverse polarization reconstruction is in- trinsic to the acquired dataset, while on the transmit side, parallel RF transmission (pTx)  systems with ≥ 2 channels would allow for reversed polarization during transmission.</para>
      <para>Another method to quantify induced currents is based on analyzing the phase of an MR  image around the implant (99). This way, RF field-induced implant currents can be detected  with a low SAR, pre-scan sequence that poses no hazard in itself. Since the RMS-averaged  RF current in the implant is proportional to <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1+RMS, the result from the pre-scan can easily  be scaled to subsequent MR imaging sequences at higher SAR levels. Compared to magni- tude-based methods, phase-based current measurements are potentially faster, independent  of proton-density weighting and have lower SNR requirements. A disadvantage of phase- based methods is their sensitivity to gradient nonlinearities and phase variations of other  origin, such as frequency shifts due to temperature variations, susceptibility jumps at inter- faces, or blood flow. To reduce these influences, short echo times combined with a fast read- out using an ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequence was applied <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> and demonstrated  the ability to characterize RF currents within an accuracy of ~10 mA/μT (100). Based on  these measurements and some simplifying assumptions, the corresponding RF-induced im- plant heating could be predicted accurately.

Typically, two null-locations can be identified in the signal intensity emerging  from the transmitter and receiver separately. Since the location of the receiver-null is inde- pendent of the transmitter and different for each receiver element, the receiver-null and  transmitter-null locations can be identified independently by inspecting the MR images  from each receive-coil element separately. The phase of the current can then be calculated  from the geometric null location and is an important parameter to allow mitigation of RF  field-induced currents on the DBS lead using pTx systems (101).</para>
      <para>The MR-based determination of the transfer function represents another promising ap- proach to measure implant currents (48, 102). This expands the TF approach beyond phan- toms to more complex exposure scenarios with realistic tissue heterogeneity, implant  geometry and location. The methodology uses the wire-like implant as a transceiver antenna.  The implant is excited via a coaxial cable soldered to its tip and the resulting current distri- bution along its trajectory, reflecting the transfer function by virtue of the principle of rec- iprocity– can be measured by MRI (48, 51). The necessity to connect a cable to the implant  modifies the TF, however, and prevents <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> applications. This restriction was overcome  by the introduction of the transfer matrix. This approach measures the RF field-induced  currents in the implant directly and without the need of any galvanic contact from MR meas- urements alone (102–104) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>). The transfer matrix derived from this data contains</para>

      <para>not only the full TF, but additionally determines the total current along the implant for a  given exposure situation. This allows not only the ability to fully evaluate tip heating based  on an incident background field but also to assess other locations of potential RF-induced  heating along the implant. Like its “ancestor” TF, the transfer matrix describes how the im- plant responds to a pre-existing background <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field. Therefore, the latter must be known,  that is, simulations are still required while the aforementioned sensor-based methods are,  in principle, independent of such prior knowledge. The techniques applied for transfer-ma- trix acquisition have similarities with electric-properties tomography (EPT) (105, 106) and  consequently share some of its problems as well, most notably the transceive-phase approx- imation and assumptions on the vector orientation of <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><superscript>+</superscript>1 and <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>Most of these described MR-based techniques to assess implant safety still need further  investigations, in particular if more complex implant geometries or locations, multiple im- plants or complex lead trajectories come into play. Also, most of these MR-based current- measurement techniques assume a homogeneous or known <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1 transmit and/or receive field  to work accurately (100, 101). These assumptions are increasingly difficult to attain at higher  field strengths, which may limit the general applicability of such methods.</para>
      <para>Current measurements are only an indirect measure of implant heating because they  rely on thermal models that might be incomplete (e.g., neglecting perfusion or thermoreg- ulation). Measuring temperatures around the implant is a more direct assessment of implant  safety and a variety of temperature-dependent MR contrasts exists that can be exploited for  that purpose (107, 108). As of today, however, MR thermometry could not replace RF- power monitoring in conjunction with dedicated SAR models as an MRI-related safety</para>

Nevertheless, several studies have been performed showing  the potential of MR thermometry around implants to assess heating with reasonable accu- racies &lt;1℃ compared to fiber-optic thermometry (45, 109).

      <title>MITIGATION STRATEGIES</title>
      <para>Mitigation strategies, that is, active countermeasures against implant heating, can target  either the background <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field the implant is exposed to or the scattered <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field generated  by the implant. The latter methods may require the implant manufacturer to modify the im- plant in terms of geometry, size, or materials, while the former addresses the MR system  manufacturer because it requires variations in transmit RF coil design or transmission-field  properties to reduce heating independently of the implant type. Mitigation of gradient field- induced heating is not yet supported by implant or scanner manufacturers. Therefore, to  date, it is up to the MR system operator’s common sense to avoid critical scenarios that  may be injurious to patients.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Implant Geometry and Materials </emphasis></para>
      <para>Suppressing RF field-induced currents by replacing electrically conductive material is  the ideal solution but not always feasible. Other alterations of the implant structure can be  implemented, which at least reduce RF-induced currents and possibly allow them to shift  their occurrence to less critical areas. These techniques can be grouped into the following  approaches:</para>
      <para>1) Increasing the resistivity of the implant reduces the induced currents (110–112).  2) Increasing the capacitance (permittivity and thickness) and conductivity of the insulation  around the conductor attenuates the wave propagation along the conductor (113).  3) Implementing “RF chokes” or traps, that is, resonating circuits tuned to block RF currents  at the Larmor frequency (112, 114, 115).   4) Adding inductances (e.g., by helical winding for one-dimensional implants) or capaci- tances (e.g., by adding dielectric materials) along the conductive lengths of the implant  (116–119). This way, low-pass or high-pass filters are implemented, blocking or reducing  RF-induced currents along the implant.   5) Cloaking the implant by using metamaterials (i.e., material engineered to have a property  not found in naturally occurring materials) to reduce RF field interactions (120, 121).  While approaches (1), (2) and (5) focus on reducing the magnitude of the induced cur- rent, approaches, approaches (3) and (4) change the effective resonant length of the wire/im- plant. In the latter case, the result is frequency dependent, implying that the same  configuration that safely reduces heating at 1.5 T/64 MHz might not be working effectively  at 3 T/128 MHz, and vice versa.</para>

      <para>Each transmit RF coil produces a characteristic <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field distribution inside the human  body. If a second coil element with another characteristic <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field distribution is added, the  overall incident <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field is a coherent superposition of both <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field vectors. In particular, the  phase difference, which allows the incident <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field vectors to be of opposite direction at a  particular location, provides an opportunity to reduce the background <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field in dedicated  regions. Most importantly, the relative pulse amplitudes and phases for different RF coil  elements can be changed at the pulse sequence level without hardware modifications and,  at least in principle, in real-time. A birdcage RF coil, the standard body RF coil design for  many clinical MR systems, consists of two ports driven with a 90° phase difference to  achieve the CP or quadrature-driven mode. However, if the two channels are driven indi- vidually as two independent linear polarization modes, the <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field distribution in the human  body can change completely. Eryaman, et al. (122) have demonstrated that the linear mode  has <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field null zones in which an implant would be exposed to highly reduced background  <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field, hence strongly reduced RF field-induced heating. If the linear birdcage modes are  combined, accordingly, to reduce the RF current on an implant such as a lead, this two- channel, pTx system effectively mitigates RF heating (101, 123–125) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11</emphasis>).</para>

      <para>Increasing the number of pTx channels increases the degrees of freedom to reduce the  <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field near the implant and, hence, suppresses unwanted hotspots with minimal loss of di- agnostic image quality (126–130) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 12</emphasis>). This is achieved in an optimization process  that also reveals the worst-case and best-case RF heating scenario for a particular implant  and transmit RF coil configuration, indicating the potential safety risk margins (131, 132).  Investigators have demonstrated that an eight-channel pTx coil outperforms a four-channel  pTx coil in suppressing unwanted SAR hotspots induced by DBS leads (130, 133, 134).  Other constraints that can be embedded in the optimization of the RF pulse process are local  SAR, whole-body averaged SAR, adaptive SAR (135), or the k-space trajectory for spokes  pulses (127).</para>
      <para>Interestingly, these pTx techniques are not restricted to proof-of-concept studies in phan- toms on simplified implant geometries under controlled conditions; they could be an actual  game changer for patients with implants that have complex geometries. This was recently  demonstrated by two independent simulation studies investigating pTx mitigation of RF- induced heating of DBS leads with realistic trajectories extracted from CT-based patient  data (130, 134) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 12</emphasis>). Those studies showed that the local SAR could be decreased  by more than 94% compared to body RF coil excitation at comparable <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><superscript>+</superscript>1 homogeneity  and global SAR. These results suggest that pTx systems could be a viable strategy to deal  with the increasing complexity and number of medical implants in patients undergoing MRI</para>

      <para>exams. However, more validation studies are needed to support this claim. Access to robust  and flexible pTx system hardware is still very limited. Fortunately, efforts exist to attend to  this need such as the ongoing development of an open-source, hardware-based pTx im- plant-safety testbed, which is adaptable to experiments with up to 32-channels at all relevant  static magnetic field strengths (i.e., 1.5 to 7 Tesla) (136).</para>
      <para>An interesting approach is to combine sensor measurements from on or around implants  and use this information for pTx based mitigation. This has been demonstrated by using  time-domain current (129, 132) and <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field sensors (136). More recently, even simple RMS  sensors such as thermistors or diodes were utilized in proof-of-concept studies for real-time  mitigation of RF-induced heating. In addition to being real-time capable, these sensor meas- urements also contain imaging information that can be used to maintain image quality, while  at the same time RF field-induced heating is reduced substantially (136, 137). While still  in its infancy, it is imaginable that in the future, sensor equipped “smart” medical implants  could communicating with a pTx cable MRI device to guarantee safe scanning of implants  even under varying conditions such as patient movement.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Other Techniques </emphasis></para>
      <para>If pTx hardware is not available, other methods can be applied to reduce implant heating  by shaping the RF field. For example, the linear-polarization mode of the birdcage RF coil  has regions of reduced <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field, and if these regions overlap with the implant, RF-induced  currents are reduced (122). If a birdcage coil had multiple ports along its circumference,  one could ‘rotate’ the linear-polarization mode by changing the feeding port. Similarly, a  birdcage coil in the linear-polarization mode with a single transmit channel can be physically  rotated to align the low <emphasis role="italics">E-field</emphasis> zone with the implant (138). This concept has been applied  to DBS leads and showed significant improvement compared to the standard CP mode of  the same birdcage coil (139). Another mitigation approach that does not rely on pTx tech- nology or modified RF coil hardware is to put high-permittivity material pads on the subject  at strategic locations. The high-permittivity dielectric modifies the background-field and it  has been demonstrated that this can be efficiently used to reduce RF field-induced tip heating  (140). A simple, but effective solution is using vertical MR scanners, where <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>0 is directed  perpendicular instead of parallel to the axis of the bore. Consequently, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis><superscript>+</superscript>1 and the <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field  directions change, and the same implant experiences a different background <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field. Sim- ulations have shown that more than a ten-fold tip SAR reduction could be achieved for re- alistic DBS implants and lead geometries if scanned in a vertical MR system versus a  horizontal one (141).</para>

      <para>Implant safety is an important field in MRI and much has been accomplished, but fur- ther work is needed. Three international standards are most relevant in this field: the MRI  standard IEC 60601-2-33 and the implant standards that include ASTM F2182 and ISO/TS  10974. The latter set their scopes either on “passive” (ASTM) or “active” (ISO) implants.  From the implant manufacturer’s point of view, this distinction is fundamental since active  implants need electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and other tests, while passive implants  do not. From an MRI perspective, however, this distinction appears less relevant. Passive  implant-related hazards are a subset of active implant-related hazards and are comprehen- sively covered by the document, ISO/TS 10974, as well. The document from the ASTM  International, ASTM F2182, was a significant milestone and many of its procedural devel- opments will prevail for the testing of passive implants. But no reasons exist, in these au- thors’ opinion, to maintain two implant standards in parallel. ISO/TS 10974 is in many  respects more up-to-date and more general. Accordingly, all implants, active or passive,  should be tested against it. Low-cost test procedures for low-risk implants would be on the  wish list for future editions. For example, test strategies to easily translate an existing safety  assessment from, say, one spinal fixation system to a similar one. The concept of an empir- ical parametrization of the implant-related hazard as demonstrated by Winter, et al. (45)  may be helpful in this context (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>It is important to note that the assessments of implant safety that are based on the current  standards are always limited to a single, functional implant. Modifying this test scenario in  any electromagnetically relevant way such as having multiple MR Conditional implants  close to each other (83), multiple AIMD leads in close distance (142), or broken or aban- doned AIMD leads of a previously MR Conditional implant (143) may pose potential safety  hazards to the patient.</para>
      <para>The paucity of peer-reviewed literature on gradient field-induced heating of implants  suggests that excessive heating occurs only in unfavorable and potentially, unrecognized  cases. Regardless, such cases are possible and, thus, it is unsatisfactory that presently, neither  the manufacturer of the scanner nor the implant informs the MR system operator’s when a  critical situation may arise and how to avoid it.</para>
      <para>Accurate numerical simulations are the key to implant safety because they have reached  a high level of maturity and can provide both insight and practical solutions. Future devel- opments must be directed towards treating complex implants in realistic detail. To date,  ISO/TS 10974’s Tier 4 is only of conceptual but not yet of any practical value. Simulations  need validation, however, and measurements are often restricted to phantoms. This is ac- ceptable as long as phantom measurements are not misunderstood as predictive for the <emphasis role="italics">in </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">vivo</emphasis> case. Phantom experiments are a testbed to validate the simulation methodology, trans- mit RF coil models, and other situations that are then identically applied to anatomical voxel  models.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Ex ante</emphasis> simulations of certain numerical models remain surrogates, however. Ulti- mately, any safety assessment must be specific to the given subject or patient, implant, and  scan conditions. This means, that the scanner and implant must somehow “communicate”.  For example, the implant must “inform” the MR system about its presence and condition,  and the scanner must be able to “respond” to this input. The combination of real-time sensors</para>

      <para>In implant safety-related discussions, it is often taken for granted that lower static mag- netic field strengths automatically reduce the risk. ISO/TS 10974 or the Fixed-Parameter  Option were initially conceived for 1.5 T but not for 3 T MR systems and, recently, the idea  of dedicated or niche, low field strength scanners with fields less than 0.6 T (and as low as  0.05 T) is gaining new attention (144-147). Conceptually, the translation of <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1+RMS into im- plant SAR, for example, at the tip of a cardiac pacemaker lead, is a two-step process, how- ever. First, <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>1+RMS creates a background <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field. This effect scales with the frequency, hence  <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis>0, and the lower field strength may have the safety edge. In the second step, background  <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field creates the tip <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field, and this conversion scales linearly with the RF wavelength  in tissue (as long as half this wavelength is shorter than the implant and the transmit body  RF coil). This time, the higher field strength has the advantage. Qualitatively, this effect  can be seen in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 14</emphasis> (148). There is no universal answer to the question of a safest  field strength, therefore, the individual implant, transmit RF coil, and scan parameters must  be considered.</para>
