      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Conventional physiological monitoring equipment and patient support devices were  not originally designed to be utilized in the harsh magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) en- vironment where static, time-varying gradient, and radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic  fields can adversely impact (e.g., as a result of missile effects), affect, or alter the operation  or use of these devices (1). Fortunately, various monitors and other patient support devices  have been specially modified or specifically developed to be utilized safely in the MRI set- ting (1-32). Thus, commercially available MR Conditional monitors and other devices (note,  certain devices are MR Safe if made from nonconducting, non-metallic materials) are readily  available and can be used routinely for patients in the MRI environment (1-32).</para>
      <para>MRI healthcare professionals must carefully consider the ethical and medicolegal ram- ifications of providing proper patient care that includes identifying patients who require  monitoring in the MRI setting and following a protocol that ensures their safety by using  appropriate equipment, devices, and accessories (1, 33-43). The early detection and imme- diate treatment of complications that may occur in high-risk, critically ill, or anesthetized  patients undergoing MRI can prevent relatively minor problems from becoming life-threat- ening situations.</para>

      <para>This chapter provides information, recommendations, and guidelines for patient mon- itoring in the MRI environment. In addition, techniques, equipment, and devices that may  be used to monitor and support patients undergoing MRI examinations are described herein.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">MONITORING PATIENTS DURING MRI: RECOMMENDATIONS AND </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">GUIDELINES </emphasis></para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">General Policies and Procedures </emphasis></para>
      <para>In general, monitoring during an MRI examination is indicated whenever a patient re- quires observations of vital physiological parameters due to an underlying health problem  or whenever a patient is unable to respond or alert the MRI technologist or another health- care professional regarding pain, respiratory or cardiac distress, or other difficulty that might  arise during the examination (1-3). In addition, patients should be monitored if there is a  greater potential for a change in their physiological status or condition during MRI (1-3).  Besides physiological monitoring, various support devices and accessories may be needed  for use in high-risk patients to ensure safety (1-32).</para>
      <para>With the advent of advanced MRI applications such as MRI-guided interventional or  intraoperative procedures, there is an increased need to monitor patients, especially since  these individuals are typically anesthetized during the procedures. Additionally, patients (or  volunteer subjects) undergoing MRI examinations using experimental MR systems, exper- imental MRI accessories (e.g., transmit radiofrequency coils), or experimental pulse se- quences should be monitored continuously to ensure their safety due to possible problems  that may be encountered.</para>
      <para>Because of the widespread use of MRI contrast agents and the potential for adverse ef- fects or idiosyncratic reactions to occur, it is prudent to have appropriate monitoring equip- ment and accessories readily available for the management and support of patients who  may experience deleterious side effects (1-3). This is emphasized because adverse events,  while extremely rare, may be serious or fatal.</para>
      <para>In 1992, the Safety Committee of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Imaging pub- lished guidelines and recommendations concerning the monitoring of patients during MRI  examinations (2). The information indicated that all patients undergoing MRI should, at the  very least, be visually and/or verbally (e.g., intercom system) monitored, and that patients  who are sedated, anesthetized, or are unable to communicate should be physiologically  monitored and supported by the appropriate means (2).</para>
      <para>Severe injuries and fatalities have occurred in association with MRI technology that  could have been prevented with the proper use of monitoring equipment and devices (1, 3).  Notably, recommendations issued by The Joint Commission state that MRI facilities should  proactively plan for the management of critically ill patients who require physiological  monitoring and continuous use of life-sustaining drugs while in the MRI suite (33).</para>
      <para>Over the years, the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Anesthetic  Care for Magnetic Resonance Imaging has regularly issued practice advisories that include  advice on performing physiological monitoring in patients undergoing MRI examinations.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">436</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Physiological Monitoring of Patients During MRI </emphasis></para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 435-748_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:30 PM  Page 436</para>
      <para>The latest advisory, published in 2015, has the following indicated purposes: (1) to promote  patient and staff safety in the MRI environment, (2) to prevent the occurrence of MRI-as- sociated accidents, (3) to promote optimal patient management and reduce adverse patient  outcomes associated with MRI, (4) to identify potential equipment-related hazards in the  MRI environment, (5) to identify limitations of physiological monitoring capabilities in the  MRI setting, and (6) to identify potential health hazards associated with the MRI environ- ment (34). With specific reference to monitoring patients during MRI, the Practice Advisory  suggests the use of appropriate equipment (e.g., MR Conditional monitors and other de- vices) and compliance with standards from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (34).</para>
      <para>The American College of Radiology’s (ACR) Manual on MR Safety has information  and recommendations for physiological monitoring of patients during MRI (35). The ACR’s  document states that monitoring techniques should be carefully selected primarily because  of the risk of thermal injury associated with monitoring equipment in the MRI setting. While  not all RF-induced thermal injuries can be detected as they are developing, sedated, anes- thetized, or unconscious patients are especially vulnerable to such injuries because they are  unable to provide the MR system operator with adequate warning of actively developing  thermal injuries. The ACR’s Manual on MR Safety also has advice regarding suitable mon- itoring devices that can be safely utilized to record various physiological parameters in the  MRI environment.</para>
      <para>Other organizations similarly recommend the need to monitor certain patients using  proper equipment and techniques in the MRI setting (36-38). <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> summarizes the types  of patients who may require physiological monitoring and support during MRI examinations  (1).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Selection of Parameters to Monitor </emphasis></para>
      <para>The proper selection of the specific physiological parameter(s) that should be monitored  during MRI is crucial for patient safety. Various factors must be considered including the  patient’s medical history, present condition, the use of medication and possible associated  side effects, as well as the aspects of the MRI procedure to be performed (1-3, 34-39). For  example, if the patient is to receive a sedative, it is generally necessary to monitor respiratory</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Table 1.</emphasis> Types of patients that may require physiological monitoring and support during  MRI examinations.</para>
      <para>• Sedated or anesthetized patients.  • Critically ill or high-risk patients.  • Patients that may have a reaction to an MRI contrast agent.  • Neonatal and pediatric patients.  • Patients that have compromised physiological functions.  • Patients that are physically or mentally unstable.  • Patients that are unable to communicate.  • Patients undergoing MRI-guided interventional or intraoperative procedures.  • Patients undergoing MRI examinations using experimental MR systems.  • Patients undergoing MRI examinations using experimental techniques.</para>

      <para>rate, apnea, and/or oxygen saturation (34-38). If the patient requires general anesthesia dur- ing MRI, monitoring multiple physiological parameters is required (1, 3, 34-39).</para>
      <para>Policies and procedures for the management of the patient in the MRI environment with  respect to monitoring should be comparable to those used in the operating room or critical  care setting, especially with respect to monitoring and support requirements. Specific rec- ommendations for physiological monitoring of patients during MRI examinations should  be developed in consideration of “standard of care” issues as well as in consultation with  anesthesiologists, critical care specialists, and other similar healthcare professionals (1, 3,  11, 28, 29, 34-40).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Personnel Involved in Patient Monitoring </emphasis></para>
      <para>Only healthcare professionals with appropriate training and experience should be per- mitted to be responsible for monitoring patients during MRI (1, 3, 28, 29, 34-40). This in- cludes several facets of training and experience. The healthcare professional must be well  acquainted with the operation of the monitoring equipment and accessories used in the MRI  setting and should be able to recognize equipment malfunctions, device problems, and  recording artifacts. Furthermore, the healthcare professionals responsible for monitoring  the patient should be well versed in screening patients for conditions that may complicate  the procedure. For example, patients with asthma, congestive heart failure, obesity, obstruc- tive sleep apnea, and other underlying health conditions are at increased risk for having  problems during sedation or anesthesia (29, 34-40). Also, the healthcare professionals must  be able to identify and manage adverse events (e.g., respiratory or cardiac arrest) using ap- propriate equipment and procedures that are applicable for the MRI environment (1, 3, 11,  28, 29, 34-40).</para>
      <para>If a sedated patient suddenly exhibits a rapid decline in oxygen saturation during MRI,  a  healthcare professional must be able to recognize this problem, assess the patient for po- tential causes, and rapidly determine if intervention is necessary. At the very minimum, the  individual should be capable of recognizing and responding quickly to contact an emergency  team in the event that an adverse event is experienced by the patient. Additionally, there  must be policies and procedures implemented to continue physiological monitoring and  support of the patient, as needed, by trained personnel after the MRI examination is per- formed. This is especially necessary for a patient recovering from the effects of a sedative  or general anesthesia.</para>
      <para>The monitoring of physiological parameters and management of the patient during MRI  may be the responsibility of one or more individuals depending on the level of training for  the healthcare worker and in consideration of the condition, medical history, and procedure  that is to be performed on the patient. These individuals include anesthesiologists, nurse  anesthetists, imaging nurses, and registered nurses (34-40).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Emergency Plan </emphasis></para>
      <para>The development, implementation, and regular practice of an emergency plan that ad- dresses and defines the activities, use of equipment, and other pertinent issues pertaining to  a medical emergency are important for patient safety in the MRI environment (1, 3, 29, 35-</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">438</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Physiological Monitoring of Patients During MRI </emphasis></para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 435-748_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:30 PM  Page 438</para>
      <para>38). For example, a plan needs to be developed to immediately remove the patient from the  MR system room in order to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of cardiac  or respiratory arrest. Obviously, taking vital equipment such as a cardiac defibrillator, intu- bation instruments, “crash cart,” or other similar devices near the MR scanner could pose  a substantial hazard to patients and healthcare professionals since these items tend to be un- safe for use in the MRI setting. Appropriately-trained healthcare professionals that are in  charge of the emergency or code blue team, maintaining the patient’s airway, administering  drugs, recording events, and conducting other emergency-related duties must be identified,  trained, and continuously practiced in the performance of these critical activities in the MRI  environment. Accordingly, a “mock code” that includes all essential personnel should be  scheduled and practiced on a regular basis.</para>
      <para>Attempting to manage an emergency in the MR system room is widely considered an  unsafe practice and, thus, must be avoided in the interest of safety (1, 3, 28, 29, 34-40).  This is primarily because unacceptable equipment may be brought into the area by first re- sponders unaware of the dangers associated with the MRI environment. Therefore, for emer- gencies, it is important that there is a policy to immediately remove the patient from the  MR scanner room and to transfer the patient to a suitable, designated location where the  management of the patient may be safely conducted with appropriate equipment and devices  that are readily available (1, 3, 28, 29, 34-40).</para>
      <para>For outpatient MRI facilities or mobile MR systems, it is usually necessary to have an  advanced agreement with outside emergency personnel, such as the local paramedics, and  an acute care hospital willing to take care of their patients in the event of emergencies. Typ- ically, MRI facilities not affiliated with or in close proximity to a hospital must contact  paramedics to handle medical emergencies and to transport patients to the hospital for ad- ditional care. Therefore, personnel responsible for summoning the paramedics, notifying  the hospital, and performing other essential activities must be designated beforehand to  avoid problems and confusion during an actual emergency event.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">TECHNIQUES AND EQUIPMENT FOR PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORING </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">PATIENT AND SUPPORT </emphasis></para>
      <para>Physiological monitoring and support of patients is not a trivial task in the MRI envi- ronment. A variety of potential problems and hazards exist. Furthermore, the types of equip- ment used for patient monitoring and support must be considered carefully and implemented  properly to ensure the safety of both patients and MRI healthcare professionals.</para>
      <para>During the early days of MRI, MR Conditional monitoring equipment did not exist.  Therefore, it was a common practice to modify or otherwise adapt conventional physiolog- ical monitoring equipment in order for it to be utilized on patients undergoing MRI (2-21,  28). Over the years, monitoring equipment was specially designed to be acceptable for use  in the MRI setting (i.e., properly tested and labeled MR Conditional) and there are now  many commercially available devices that may be used to monitor patients during MRI  which include stand-alone individual monitors (e.g., used to record heart rate, blood pres- sure, oxygen saturation, temperature, etc.) as well as more sophisticated, multi-parameter</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Potential Problems and Hazards </emphasis></para>
      <para>Several potential problems and hazards are associated with the performance of patient  monitoring and support in the MRI setting. Conventional or even MR Conditional physio- logical monitors and other accessories that contain ferromagnetic components (e.g., trans- formers, power supplies, batteries, etc.) may be strongly attracted by the powerful static  magnetic field of the MR system, posing a serious missile or projectile hazard to patients  and MRI healthcare professionals. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> shows various examples of projectile-related  accidents, all of which could have been easily prevented if policies and procedures were in  place along with proper safety training of all staff members working in the MRI setting.  Notably, several serious injuries and at least one fatality have occurred as a result of bringing  MR Unsafe gas cylinders (e.g., oxygen tanks) into the MR system room (1, 3, 41-44). In  addition to being a tragedy for the involved individuals that could have been avoided, MR  scanners can sustain substantial damage as a result of being struck by large ferromagnetic  objects. Further expense is incurred if it is necessary to quench a superconducting magnet  associated with an MR system in order to remove a large ferromagnetic object (43).</para>
      <para>If possible, MR Conditional devices that have specific gauss-level ratings as part of the  specified conditions of use (e.g., a device that is labeled to state that it must not be used in  a gauss level above 200-gauss) such as monitoring equipment, gas anesthesia machines,  and ventilators because of the presence of ferromagnetic materials or operational compo- nents that may be damaged by exposure to higher magnetic fields should be permanently  fixed to the floor or otherwise “tethered” to prevent them from becoming projectiles. Fur- thermore, these devices must have prominent warning labels to inform MRI healthcare pro- fessionals and others that they should not move this equipment too close to the MR scanner.</para>

      <para>spurious electromagnetic noise that, in turn, produces artifacts on the MR images (<emphasis role="bold">Figure </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">2</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>Physiological monitors that contain microprocessors or other similar components may  “leak” RF, producing electromagnetic interference that can substantially impact MR images  (1, 3). To prevent adverse radiofrequency-related interactions with physiological monitors,  RF-shielded cables, RF filters, special outer RF-shielded enclosures, and/or fiber-optic tech- niques can be utilized to prevent image-related or other problems in the MRI setting (1, 3,  28).</para>
      <para>During the operation of an MR system, electrical currents may be generated in the con- ductive materials of monitoring equipment that are used as the interface to the patient (e.g.,  electrodes, cables, leads, probes, etc.). These currents may be of sufficient magnitude to  cause excessive heating and thermal injuries to patients (1-3, 41, 45-62). The primary bio- effect associated with the RF power deposition used during MRI is related to the thermo- genic qualities of this electromagnetic field (1). Notably, numerous burns have occurred in  association with MRI examinations that were directly attributed to the use of monitoring  devices (1, 3, 45-62) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>). These thermal injuries have been associated with the use  of electrocardiographic (ECG) leads, ECG electrodes, plethysmographic gating systems,  pulse oximeters, intracranial pressure monitoring catheters, and other types of monitoring  equipment comprised of wires, cables, and catheters with thermistors or similar components  made from conductive materials (1, 3, 45-62).

      <para>Insulating material (minimum recommended thickness, 1-cm) should be placed between the  • patient’s skin and transmit RF coil that is used for the MRI exam.  Alternatively, the transmit  RF coil itself should be padded. There should be no direct contact between the patient’s skin  and the transmit RF body coil of the MR system. This may be accomplished by having the  patient place his/her arms over his/her head or by using elbow pads or foam padding be- tween the patient’s tissue and the transmit RF body coil of the MR system. This is especially  important for MRI exams that use the transmit RF body coil or other large RF coils for  transmission of RF energy.</para>
      <para>Use only electrically conductive devices, equipment, accessories (e.g., ECG leads, elec- • trodes, etc.), and materials that have been thoroughly tested and determined to be safe or  otherwise acceptable for MRI exams.</para>
      <para>Carefully follow the MR Safe or MR Conditional criteria and recommendations for implants  • and devices made from electrically-conductive materials (e.g., bone fusion stimulators, neu- rostimulation systems, cardiac devices, cochlear implants, etc.).</para>
      <para>Before using electrical equipment, check the integrity of the insulation and/or housing of all  • components including surface RF coils, monitoring leads, cables, and wires. Preventive  maintenance should be practiced routinely for such equipment.</para>
      <para>Remove all non-essential electrically conductive materials from the MR system prior to the  • MRI exam (i.e., unused surface RF coils, ECG leads, EEG leads, cables, wires, etc.).</para>

      <para>Keep electrically conductive materials that must remain within the transmit body RF coil or  • other transmit RF coil from forming conductive loops. Note: The patient’s tissue is conduc- tive and, therefore, may be involved in the formation of a conductive loop, which can be cir- cular, U-shaped, or S-shaped.</para>
      <para>Position electrically conductive materials to prevent “cross points”. A cross point is the point  • where a cable crosses another cable, where a cable loops across itself, or where a cable  touches either the patient or sides of the transmit RF coil more than once. Even the close  proximity of conductive materials with each other should be avoided because cables and RF  coils can capacitively-couple (without any contact or crossover) when placed close together.</para>

      <para>This section describes the physiological parameters that may be assessed in patients  during MRI examinations using MR Conditional monitoring equipment. In addition, various  devices and accessories that may be utilized to support and manage patients in the MRI set- ting are presented.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Electrocardiogram and Heart Rate</emphasis>. Monitoring the patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG)  in the MR system room is particularly challenging because of the inherent distortion of the  ECG waveform that occurs (1, 3, 11, 18, 19, 22, 27, 28, 63, 68). This effect is observed as  blood, a conductive fluid, flows through the large vascular structures in the presence of the  static magnetic field of the MR system (11, 21, 63, 68). The resulting induced biopotential  is seen primarily as an augmented T-wave amplitude, although other non-specific waveform  changes are also apparent on the ECG (1, 3, 63, 64). Since altered T-waves or ST segments  may be associated with cardiac disorders, static magnetic field-induced ECG distortions  can be particularly problematic.</para>
      <para>Importantly, additional artifacts caused by the static, time-varying gradient, and RF  electromagnetic fields can severely distort the ECG, making observation of morphologic</para>

      <para>RF surface coil decoupling failures can cause localized RF power deposition levels to reach  • excessive levels. The MR system operator will recognize such a failure as a set of concentric  semicircles in the tissue on the associated MR image or as an unusual amount of image non- uniformity related to the position of the transmit RF coil.</para>
      <para>Closely monitor the patient during the MRI exam. If the patient reports sensations of heating  • or other unusual sensation, discontinue the MRI exam immediately and perform a thorough  assessment of the situation.</para>

      <para>changes and detection of arrhythmias extremely difficult (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). To minimize some of  these artifacts, a variety of filtering techniques, including passive and active methods, may  be used. Passive techniques include the use of special cable and lead preparation methods  along with the proper placement of leads that will minimize the artifacts seen on the ECG  in the MRI environment (64, 65). Active techniques involve the use of low pass filters or  the electronic suppression of noise that decrease the artifacts from the gradient and RF elec- tromagnetic fields, while maintaining the intrinsic qualities of the ECG.</para>
      <para>ECG artifacts that occur in the MRI environment may also be markedly decreased by  implementing several simple techniques including (1-3, 11, 18, 21, 22): (1) using ECG elec- trodes that have minimal metallic components, (2) selecting electrodes and cables that con- tain no ferromagnetic materials, (3) using leads that are nonmetallic (i.e., fiber-optic leads),  (4) placing the limb electrodes in close proximity to one another, (5) positioning the line  between the limb electrodes and leg electrodes parallel to the magnetic field flux lines of  the scanner, (6) maintaining a relatively small distance between the limb and leg electrodes,  (7) placing the anatomic area of the electrodes near or in the center of the MR system, and  (8) twisting or braiding the ECG cables.</para>
      <para>The use of proper ECG electrodes is required to ensure patient safety and proper record- ing of the electrocardiogram in the MRI setting (22). Accordingly, this means that only the  ECG electrodes recommended or otherwise approved by the manufacturer of the ECG  recording equipment (i.e., the MR Conditional monitoring device) should be used in order  to protect the patient from potentially hazardous conditions. Similarly, the ECG leads and  cables should also be those recommended by the manufacturer and deemed acceptable for  use in the MR system room.</para>

      <para>As previously indicated, it is well known that the use of standard ECG electrodes, leads,  and cables may cause excessive heating that results in patient burns at the electrode sites or  where the leads and cables are in direct contact with the patient’s tissues. Notably, even MR  Conditional, ECG monitoring systems have been responsible for patient burns in association  with MRI as the result of improper uses of the devices. As such, whenever using MR Con- ditional monitoring systems, the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis> should always be followed carefully.</para>
      <para>Various techniques have been developed to prevent excessive heating related to the use  of ECG recording equipment in the MRI setting, including using fiber-optic technology  and/or wireless methods to record the ECG. The use of the fiber-optic technique combined  with a wireless method to monitor the ECG during MRI removes the potential for burns  associated with hard-wired ECG systems by eliminating the conductive leads and cable,  which prevents the “antenna effect” that is typically responsible for excessive heating of  these items during MRI. Accordingly, most modern day, MR Conditional ECG monitoring  systems employ this technological solution to ensure patient safety.</para>
      <para>Heart rate may be monitored in the MR system room using a number of different meth- ods. Besides using the ECG monitor to record heart rate in patients undergoing MRI, this  physiological parameter may be determined using MR Conditional devices such as the pho- toplethysmograph found with a pulse oximeter or a noninvasive, heart rate/blood pressure  monitor (see section below) that can also be utilized to obtain intermittent or semi-contin- uous recordings of heart rate during MRI (1, 3, 11).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Blood Pressure</emphasis>. Several different techniques may be used to monitor blood pressure in  patients undergoing MRI (1, 3, 4, 11, 66-69). MR Conditional sphygmomanometers are  commercially available to manually measure blood pressure in patients. When using this  methodology, it’s important to also use an MR Conditional stethoscope.</para>
      <para>An MR Conditional blood pressure monitor that uses the oscillometric method can ob- tain semi-continuous recordings of systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures as well as  heart rate in patients. Thus, this device can be utilized to record systemic blood pressure in  adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients by selecting the appropriate size for the blood pressure  cuff based on the type of patient that will be monitored.</para>
      <para>It should be noted that the intermittent inflation of the blood pressure cuff from a manual  or an automated, noninvasive blood pressure device can disturb lightly-sedated patients,  especially pediatric or neonatal patients, causing them to move and disrupt the MRI exam- ination. For this reason, the use of a noninvasive blood pressure monitor may not be the  best instrument to perform physiological monitoring in every type of patient.</para>
      <para>Arterial blood pressure may also be monitored using a direct hemodynamic monitoring  technique, which is considered the most accurate means of assessing blood pressure in pa- tients undergoing MRI. In order to accomplish this, a catheter is inserted into the radial ar- tery and attached by pressure tubing to an MR Conditional pressure transducer, which is  then interfaced with an appropriate MR Conditional monitor.</para>

      <para>specially designed, fiber-optic pressure transducers, nonferromagnetic, micromanometer- tipped catheters, or by other means. These monitoring devices are unaffected by the elec- tromagnetic fields used for MRI and are capable of invasively recording pressures (6, 9,  11, 45, 46).</para>
      <para>Monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) is essential in the management of severe head  injuries and for other conditions. However, it should be noted that, ICP monitoring devices  labeled MR Conditional require special positioning of the catheter in order to ensure patient  safety (1, 45, 46), otherwise serious patient injuries can occur due to excessive heating of  these devices, as reported by Tanaka, et al. (45) and Newcombe, et al. (46).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Respiratory Rate and Apnea</emphasis>. Because respiratory depression and upper airway obstruc- tion are frequent complications associated with the use of sedatives and anesthetics, moni- toring techniques that detect a decrease in respiratory rate, hypoxemia, or airway obstruction  should be used during the administration of these drugs (1, 3, 29, 34, 36-38, 66-69). Im- paired respiratory function due to existing conditions such as tonsillar hypertrophy is also  a risk factor (34). This is particularly important in the MRI setting because visual observa- tion of the patient’s respiratory effort is often difficult, especially when the patient is entirely  inside the bore of an MR system and the direct line of sight is obstructed (34). Other factors  impacting direct patient observation during an MRI examination include the typically dark- ened environment, acoustic noise, and other distractions (34).</para>
      <para>Respiratory rate monitoring can be performed effectively during MRI examinations by  various techniques. The impedance method that utilizes MR Conditional chest leads and  electrodes (similar to those used to record the ECG) can be used to monitor respiratory rate.  This method of assessing respiratory rate measures a difference in electrical impedance in- duced between the leads that correspond to changes in respiratory movements. Unfortu- nately, the electrical impedance method of determining respiratory rate may be inaccurate  in pediatric patients because of the small volumes and associated motions of the relatively  small thorax area. Additionally, the leads and electrodes used with impedance-based tech- niques must be designed to prevent excessive heating, similar to what is done when moni- toring the ECG in the MRI setting.</para>
      <para>Respiratory rate may also be monitored during MRI examinations using a rubber bel- lows placed around the patient’s thorax or abdomen (i.e., for “chest” or “belly” breathers)  (1, 3, 11). The bellows device is attached to a remote pressure transducer that records  changes in body movements associated with inspiration and expiration. However, the bel- lows monitoring technique, like the electrical impedance method, is only capable of record- ing body movements associated with respiratory efforts. Therefore, these techniques of  monitoring respiratory rate do not detect apneic episodes related to upper airway obstruction  (i.e., absent airflow despite respiratory effort) and, thus, may not provide sufficient sensi- tivity for assessing patients undergoing MRI. For this reason, assessment of respiratory rate  and detection of apnea should be accomplished using other, more appropriate monitoring  methods.</para>
      <para>Respiratory rate and apnea may be monitored during MRI using an MR Conditional,  end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor or a capnometer. These different devices measure the level  of carbon dioxide during the end of the respiratory cycle (i.e., end-tidal carbon dioxide),</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">448</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Physiological Monitoring of Patients During MRI </emphasis></para>
      <para>BioRef 2021 V10 435-748_Layout 1  12/5/2021  3:30 PM  Page 448</para>
      <para>when carbon dioxide is at its maximum level. Additionally, capnometers can provide quan- titative data with respect to end-tidal carbon dioxide that is important for determining certain  aspects of gas exchange in patients. The waveform provided on end-tidal carbon dioxide  monitors is also useful for visually determining whether the patient is having difficulties  breathing. Importantly, the interface between the patient for the end-tidal carbon dioxide  monitor and capnometer is a nasal or oro-nasal cannula that is made out of plastic and, thus,  it is MR Safe. Obviously, this type of interface prevents any potential adverse interaction  between monitors, which typically must be positioned outside the 200-gauss line associated  with the MR scanner, and the patient.</para>
      <para>Anesthesiology personnel should have a clear plan of how to deal with patients that ex- perience respiratory distress while undergoing MRI, including how best to utilize airway  management equipment and the suction system, both of which should be readily accessible  outside the MR system room (i.e., Zone IV) (34) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Oxygen Saturation</emphasis>. Oxygen saturation is a critical variable to measure in high-risk, se- dated or anesthetized patients, especially in the MRI setting (1, 3, 11, 14, 24, 29, 34-40, 66- 69). This physiological parameter is measured using pulse oximetry, a technique that  assesses the oxygenation of tissue, which may be accomplished using an MR Conditional  pulse oximeter. Because oxygen-saturated blood absorbs differing quantities of light com- pared to unsaturated blood, the amount of light that is absorbed by the blood can be utilized  to determine the ratio of oxygenated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin and displayed as the  oxygen saturation on the monitor. Additionally, the patient’s heart rate may be determined  using the pulse oximeter by measuring the frequency that pulsations occur as the blood  moves through the vascular bed. Thus, the pulse oximeter determines oxygen saturation  and heart rate on a continuous basis by measuring the transmission of light through a vas-</para>

      <para>Conventional pulse oximeters typically have hard-wire cables that are of great concern  and have been responsible for causing serious burns in patients in the MRI environment (1,  3, 24, 47, 53-57). Fortunately, pulse oximeters have been developed that use fiber-optic  technology to obtain and transmit the physiological signals from the patient (1, 3, 11, 24)  (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>). It is physically impossible for a patient to be burned by a fiber-optic pulse oxime- ter during an MRI procedure because there are no conductive pathways formed by metallic  materials directly contacting the patient. Notably, these commercially available, MR Con- ditional devices operate without interference from the electromagnetic fields used during  MRI.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Temperature</emphasis>. In human subjects, “deep” body or core temperature is regulated between  36°C and 38°C by the hypothalamus and continuously fluctuates due to diurnal, internal,  and external factors (68, 70). Importantly, the regulation of body temperature is suppressed  by anesthesia and generally results in the patients becoming hypothermic (71, 72). Health  conditions related to a decrease in body temperature include hypovolemia, myocardial is- chemia, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary edema, decreased cerebral blood flow, and mortality  (i.e., caused by extreme hypothermia) (73). In the MRI setting, besides monitoring body  temperature in anesthetized adult patients, it is also important to record temperatures in</para>

      <para>With further regard to patients who are anesthetized during MRI, some patients may  experience malignant hyperthermia, which is a rare life-threatening condition that may be  triggered by exposure to certain drugs used for general anesthesia. In susceptible individuals,  these drugs can induce a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative me- tabolism, which overwhelms the body’s capacity to supply oxygen, to remove carbon diox- ide, and to regulate body temperature. Malignant hyperthermia can eventually lead to  circulatory collapse and death if not quickly identified and treated.</para>
      <para>Those responsible for administering anesthesia in the MRI environment, that is, the  anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist, may not be able to adequately visualize or have close  access to the patient during MRI due to the design of the scanner. Therefore, it is imperative  to continuously monitor body temperature in certain patients, obtaining real-time informa- tion for the anesthesia provider. It is also important that the measurement site used to de- termine body temperature has clinical relevance and a relatively “fast” response time to any  substantial fluctuation because the anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist is unable to readily  observe the discoloration of the patient’s skin, which is a hallmark sign of a sudden tem- perature change.</para>
      <para>Over the years, the accuracy and efficacy of the measurement of body temperature has  been a topic of discussion (70, 74-80). Temperature measurements in human subjects are  affected by many factors, including (70, 76, 77): (1) the site of measurement (e.g., skin,  oral, esophagus, rectal, pulmonary artery, bladder, tympanic membrane, or axillary area);  (2) the environmental conditions (i.e., temperature and humidity); and (3) the measurement</para>

      <para>The most accurate deep body temperature is measured at the hypothalamus, but this  site is obviously not accessible by any practical means. Therefore, a “deep” body site that  directly reflects the temperature “sensed” by the hypothalamus will provide the optimal,  clinically relevant information (70). For example, sites that provide high levels of accuracy  and correlate well with the deep body temperature are pulmonary artery blood, urinary blad- der, the esophagus, and rectum. However, the temporal resolution for each site varies, which  can dramatically impact the ability to recognize clinically important changes that may re- quire prompt patient management (71-76).</para>
      <para>When monitoring temperature during MRI, the decision on which body site to use  should be based on accuracy as well as accessibility. Additionally, there may be limitations  on the type of equipment available for temperature measurements in the MR system room.  For example, hard-wire thermistor or thermocouple-based sensors are prone to measurement  errors due to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and can introduce artifacts in the MR im- ages (1-3, 11). Additionally, wire-based temperature measurement techniques are prone to  excessive MRI-related heating and can result in burn injuries to patients. Fiber-optic sensors  (i.e., fluoroptic thermometry) are optimally used to record temperatures in the MRI envi- ronment because they are unaffected by EMI and are safe (3). Of note is that, similar to  other methods used to assess physiological parameters in patients undergoing MRI, the  measurement of temperature must employ a suitable technique that is MR Conditional (81- 83). Fluoroptic thermometry, which utilizes fiber-optic technology has been successfully  used to monitor body and skin temperatures in the clinical MRI setting (81-85).</para>
      <para>In the MR system room, anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists, and clinicians may feel  that they are limited to measure “surface” temperatures in patients, such as the temperatures  of the skin, axilla, or groin. However, these measurement sites are problematic because they  do not properly reflect “deep” body temperature nor do they respond rapidly to quick fluc- tuations in body temperature. While a so-called “surface” temperature site (i.e., skin, axilla,  and groin) has been used to record temperature during MRI mainly because of the ease of  obtaining the measurement with currently available equipment, this method does not provide  an accurate representation of body temperature and is susceptible to substantial variations  and erroneous information relative to the deep body temperature due to the specific site se- lected for temperature probe placement, patient movement, and environmental conditions  (75-77, 79).</para>
      <para>Notably, the level of the patient’s perspiration due to RF-induced heating and the use  of blankets or air circulation from the fan in the bore of the scanner can greatly influence  the recording of skin or other surface temperature during MRI. Additionally, investigations  have demonstrated that peripheral vasoconstriction resulting from cooling of the skin de- creases the surface temperature without influencing the deep body temperature, resulting  in misleading information if the intent was to use a surface site as a surrogate for deep body  temperature (79).</para>
      <para>Two of the most prevalent core temperature measurement sites used during MRI ex- aminations are the rectum and esophagus. Rectal temperature measurements are highly ac-</para>

      <para>curate and within 0.6°C of deep body temperature (72, 75, 76). The main drawback to this  measurement site is associated with a lag or delay in the temporal response to a changing  body temperature due to the presence of thermal inertia from the intervening tissues (i.e.,  the tissues between the rectum and hypothalamus). This temporal delay may also be caused  by the presence of feces and poor blood supply in the rectum (75, 76, 80). Newsham, et al.  (80) reported that rectal temperature substantially lagged when compared to changes in  tympanic membrane temperature (which is a well known surrogate for deep body temper- ature). This delay can present issues when the intent is to identify body temperature excur- sions that require medical intervention. Of note is that the lack of proper temporal resolution  for a temperature recording method can subject the patient to a hypothermic or hyperthermic  condition for an extended period without being recognized by the clinician. Also of consid- eration when using the rectum as the site of temperature measurement is the fact that special  care must be taken when placing a rectal temperature probe in a neonatal or pediatric patient  in order to prevent perforation or infection (80).</para>
      <para>Measurement of esophageal temperature provides a high level of accuracy and good  temporal correlation to deep body temperature due to the close proximity to the aorta, a  “deep body” site (76). In addition to this accuracy, esophageal temperature is responsive to  fluctuations in body temperature and readily tracks changes compared to rectal or surface  temperature measurement sites (75, 76). The only caveat is that the accuracy of measuring  temperature in the esophagus is directly linked to the proper positioning of the thermometry  probe (75, 76). Airflow in the trachea can impact the measured temperature if the probe is  not inserted deep enough into the patient’s esophagus. For accurate deep body temperature  measurements, the recommended placement of the thermometry probe is in the lower one- third of the esophagus (75, 76).</para>
      <para>In consideration of the available temperature measurement sites that may be monitored  during MRI, especially with regard to which site provides the most accurate information  along with the best temporal resolution, the temperature of the esophagus is considered to  be the site of the most acceptable and clinically relevant information. Furthermore,  esophageal temperature is insensitive to ambient air circulation and has the added benefit  of fast response time to temperature fluctuations in the body compared to the measurement  of temperature in the rectum.</para>
      <para>The current availability of fiber-optic temperature probes and recording equipment  properly designed for use in the MRI setting permits the monitoring of body temperature  in the esophagus, which provides physiological information that is vital to patient care.  Temperature monitoring capabilities are typically found in association with multi-parameter  physiological monitoring equipment that have been properly tested and labeled, MR Con- ditional.</para>

In certain cases, it may be neces- sary to monitor several different physiological parameters simultaneously in patients un- dergoing MRI (1, 3, 11, 29, 32, 36-40, 66-69). While several different stand-alone units  may be combined together to accomplish this task, the most efficient means of recording  multiple parameters is by utilizing a monitoring system that permits the measurement of  vital physiological functions such as heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen sat-</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italics">Ventilators</emphasis>. Devices used for mechanical ventilation of patients typically contain me- chanical switches, microprocessors, and ferromagnetic components that may be adversely  affected by the electromagnetic fields associated with MR systems (1, 3, 8, 11, 15, 75). Ven- tilators that are activated by high-pressure oxygen and controlled by the use of fluidics (i.e.,  no requirements for electricity) may still have ferromagnetic parts that can malfunction as  a result of interactions with MR scanners.</para>
      <para>Fortunately, MR Conditional ventilators have been specially designed for use in the  MR system room and can be utilized in adult as well as pediatric and neonatal patients  (<emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>). These devices are constructed from nonferromagnetic materials and have under- gone pre-clinical evaluations to ensure that they operate properly in the MRI environment,  without producing artifacts on MR images (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>).</para>
      <para>Importantly, many ventilators classified as MR Conditional have specific fringe field  requirements due to the presence of ferromagnetic parts or functional aspects that may be  compromised in association with powerful static magnetic fields. For example, the ventilator  may not be used in fields greater than a certain gauss level, such as 300-gauss. Therefore,  as always, to prevent accidents and incidents, it is crucial for all healthcare professionals  working in the MRI environment to have an understanding of the issues related to the use</para>

      <para>If the ventilator must be maintained at a designated gauss level relative to the MR scan- ner, this area should be clearly demarcated on the floor of the room and all healthcare per- sonnel must be educated regarding the importance of maintaining the device at or behind  this marked area. One way to ensure this would be to attach a tether or restraint strap to the  ventilator that provides a mechanism that would “catch” in order to prevent encroachment  of the device to an unsafe area. Importantly, the tethering system should only be used to  prevent disaster and not relied on as the primary restraint mechanism.</para>
      <para>Alternatively, a device called the GaussAlert (Kopp Development, Inc.,   www.koppdevelopment.com) can be utilized to help maintain an MR Conditional ventilator  (or other similar equipment such as infusion pumps, contrast injectors, patient monitors,  gas anesthesia machines, etc.) outside of a particular MRI exclusion zone (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>). This  magnetic field strength alarm system was specifically designed for this task and produces  an audio alert when a preset magnetic field strength is exceeded.</para>

Patient safety is assured by having clear  processes established for patient monitoring, sedation or anesthesia, and management of  emergencies (i.e., remove the patient immediately from the MR system room and then pro- ceed with emergency care). In addition, anesthesiologists should be attentive and aware of  the potential for emergencies that may arise in the MRI environment and know where all  appropriate and safe support devices are located (1, 4, 11, 34-41). A variety of devices and  accessories are often necessary for support and management of patients in the MRI setting.  MR Safe or MR Conditional gurneys, wheelchairs, oxygen tanks, stethoscopes, suction de- vices, intubation equipment, infusion pumps, power injectors, gas anesthesia systems, and  other similar devices and accessories are commercially available and may be obtained from  various manufacturers and distributors (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11</emphasis>) (<emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>).</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>The care and management of high-risk, critically ill, and sedated or anesthetized patients  undergoing MRI examinations presents special challenges. These challenges are related to  requirements for MR Safe and MR Conditional equipment and devices as well as the need  for MRI facilities to implement MRI-specific policies and procedures that ensure patient  safety. Safely performing MRI examinations in patients that require physiological moni- toring is straightforward as long as there is clear and consistent communication among all  staff members, proper labeling of all devices and equipment, and an understanding of the  unique aspects of the MRI environment.</para>
