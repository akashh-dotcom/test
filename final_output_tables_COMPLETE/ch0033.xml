      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>In 1976, the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was given the  authority to regulate medical devices through the Medical Device Amendments to the U.S.  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act. The FDA’s regulation of medical devices roughly  coincided with the first experimental uses of nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) systems in  1979. The FDA develops guidance documents to communicate its current thinking on med- ical device review and policy and participates in the development of voluntary consensus  standards by national and international standards development organizations (SDOs) to pro- mote methods important to the evaluation of medical devices. Following the publication of  consensus standards, the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) uti- lizes a process to publicly recognize all, or parts, of a consensus standard that is helpful to  assess the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. CDRH updates the list of FDA-rec- ognized consensus standards periodically, adding newly recognized consensus standards  for medical devices and radiation-emitting electronic products, while replacing certain rec- ognized consensus standards with newly approved revisions.The FDA believes that con- formance with recognized consensus standards can provide sound performance  characteristics, testing methodologies, manufacturing practices, scientific protocols, com- pliance criteria, and labeling as part of the data used to establish a reasonable assurance of  safety and effectiveness of a medical device. However, conformance with recognized con- sensus standards may not always provide enough information to establish safety and effec- tiveness and, thus, additional data or information may be necessary. Conformance with</para>

      <para>recognized consensus standards is strictly voluntary for a medical device manufacturer.  Therefore, a manufacturer may choose to conform to applicable consensus standards or  may choose to obtain evidence about safety and effectiveness in another manner. It should  be noted that relevant and up-to-date information for medical device and radiation-emitting  product standards can be found at CDRH’s Standard website (1).</para>
      <para>This chapter provides an overview of FDA’s statutory authority, and subsequent regu- latory interpretations, over magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices in the United States.  Furthermore, it describes the procedures that have been developed to facilitate the medical  device review mechanisms, followed by a discussion of current FDA guidance documents  related to MRI (2), current international consensus standards for MRI equipment safety  (also referred to as the “MR system” or “scanner”), and consensus standards for the safety  of medical devices in the MRI environment, including some discussion of possible future  developments in the field of MRI safety.</para>

      <title>FDA AUTHORITY AND REGULATORY MECHANISMS</title>
      <para>The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the FD&amp;C Act provide the statutory au- thority for FDA regulation of medical devices, including those involving MRI equipment.  The Medical Device Amendments established three classes of devices, which are differen- tiated by the degree of risk and the amount of regulatory control needed to ensure safety  and effectiveness. The three classifications are, as follows: (1) Class I devices, which are  generally low risk and require only general controls; (2) Class II devices, which are devices  for which general controls alone are insufficient for reasonable assurance of safety and ef- fectiveness, but for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls to pro- vide such assurance; and (3) Class III devices, which are the highest risk and are those  devices for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely  through general or special controls.</para>
      <para>Most Class II devices require premarket notification, that is, a 510(k) submission (3),  prior to marketing. A 510(k) is a premarket submission to demonstrate that the device is at  least as safe and effective or “substantially equivalent (SE)”, to a legally marketed device  (21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)). A legally marketed device (also known as a predicate device) is a  device that was (1) legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (preamendments device), (2) a  device which has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, (3) a device which has  been found to be SE through the 510(k) process, or (4) a device that was granted marketing  authorization via the <emphasis role="italics">de novo</emphasis> classification process under section 513(f)(2) of the Federal  FD&amp;C Act. Although devices recently cleared under 510(k) are often selected as the pred- icate to which equivalence is claimed, any legally marketed device may be used as a pred- icate.</para>

      <para>Class III devices are those that (1) support or sustain human life, (2) are of substantial  importance in preventing impairment of human health, or (3) which present a potential, un- reasonable risk of illness or injury. Manufacturers of Class III devices must submit a pre- market approval (PMA) application demonstrating that the device is safe and effective.  Clinical data is generally needed to support a PMA. If a study for an investigational device  involves a significant risk to patients, the manufacturer must submit an Investigational De- vice Exemption (IDE) to the FDA prior to beginning clinical trials in the U.S.</para>
      <para>A Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) designation may be requested for devices that are  intended for use in treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affect 8,000 or less  individuals per year in the United States. A HUD designation must be obtained prior to sub- mitting a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application.</para>
      <para>Since the 1976 Medical Device Amendments, new mechanisms have been developed  to facilitate the introduction of medical devices into the marketplace. These mechanisms  include alternatives to the traditional 510(k) pathway: (1) the Special 510(k) Program, (2)  the Abbreviated 510(k) Program, and (3) the Third-Party Review. The Special 510(k) Pro- gram is used for devices with modifications or changes and utilizes design controls to show  substantial equivalence of the modified device to the manufacturer’s own legally marketed  predicate device. (3). If a new 510(k) is needed for the modification, then summary infor- mation that results from the design control process can serve as the basis for clearing the  application. Under the Special 510(k) review, 510(k) holders who intend to modify their  own legally marketed devices shall conduct a risk analysis and the necessary verification  and validation activities to demonstrate that the design outputs of the modified device meet  the design input requirements. The Abbreviated 510(k) Program is an alternative approach  that uses guidance documents, special controls and voluntary consensus standards to aid  FDA’s premarket review of 510(k) submissions. An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must  include the required elements identified in 21 CFR 807.87 (information required in a pre- market notification submission). However, in an Abbreviated 510(k) submission, device  manufacturers elect to provide summary reports on the use of guidance documents, special  controls, or declarations of conformity to FDA-recognized consensus standards. Effective  February 1, 1989 MRDDs were reclassified by the FDA from Class III to Class II as de- scribed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 (4). As Class II devices MRDDs  are granted marketing authorization in the U.S. using a regular premarket notification  (510(k)). However, an Abbreviated 510(k) can be appropriate for an MR system because  there are several applicable consensus standards, such as IEC 60601-2-33 Edition 3.2 (5)  and the standards developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)  (6).</para>
      <para>The FDA’s regulatory authority applies to medical device manufacturers, including  medical device distributors. For example, the FDA can ask MR system manufacturers to  provide information regarding the spatial distribution of the static magnetic field associated  with the MR system and to establish a controlled access zone at the 5-Gauss line in the in- struction manuals provided with the scanner. However, the FDA does not inspect MRI fa- cilities and cannot require end-users to establish a controlled access zone. Authority for  such activities resides with state governmental agencies or other similar entities. Another  common misconception is that the FDA premarket approval or marketing clearance of a</para>

      <title>FDA GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS REGARDING MAGNETIC RESONANCE  IMAGING</title>
      <para>Over the last decade, CDRH has developed and published five guidance documents re- lated to MRI for industry and the FDA’s staff members: two related to Magnetic Resonance  Diagnostic Devices (MRDDs) and three related to the safety and compatibility of passive  implants in the MRI environment. The following two sections provide summaries regarding  the purpose and content of these guidance documents. The FDA guidance documents do  not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the  Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless  specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Guidance Documents Regarding Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices (MRDD)  </emphasis></para>
      <para>CDRH published two guidance documents related to the safety of MRDDs:</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Submission of Premarket Notifications for Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices  </emphasis></para>
      <para>The purpose of this guidance is to provide a detailed description of the information  needed in a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, for a MRDD submitted to the  FDA. This guidance is applicable to premarket notifications not only for MRI, but also for  magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) systems, MR system components of dual-modality  devices, for example positron emission tomography (PET)/MR systems, components, and  accessories, which could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the MRDD. It  describes FDA-recognized consensus standards which can be used to help demonstrate sub- stantial equivalence and defines the information needed to adequately describe the MRDD  in the submission. Related to electrical, mechanical, structural, and system safety it guides  the user to specific FDA-recognized consensus standards to be used to evaluate these safety  aspects. Furthermore, it defines the physical laboratory testing related to safety and per- formance to demonstrate substantial equivalence. It describes the details needed for sample  clinical images to support the ability of the MRDD to generate diagnostic quality images.  Finally, it provides examples to better understand possible changes in a previously-cleared  MRDD which would trigger the requirement for a new 510(k) and gives detailed instructions  of what information the labeling should include.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Criteria for Significant Risk Investigations of Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices </emphasis></para>
      <para>This guidance describes MRDD operations that the FDA considers significant risk for  the purposes of determining whether a clinical study requires the FDA approval of an IDE.  The FDA believes that an MRDD used under specific conditions and exposure limits of the  operating conditions is a significant risk and, therefore, studies involving such a device do  not qualify for the abbreviated IDE. A sponsor should consider the following operating con- ditions when assessing whether a clinical study may be considered significant risk: (1) the  main static magnetic field; (2) the specific absorption rate (SAR), (3) the gradient, time- varying fields, rate of change; and (4) the sound level, that is, the acoustic noise.

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Guidance Documents Regarding Passive Implants in the MRI Environment </emphasis></para>
      <para>CDRH published three guidance documents related to the safety and compatibility of  passive implants:</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italics">Establishing Safety and Compatibility of Passive Implants in the MR Environment </emphasis></para>
      <para>This guidance addresses testing and labeling of passive implants for MRI safety, that  is, “MR Safe” or “MR Conditional” labeling, in the MRI environment. More information  about labeling of implants can be found in (7). This guidance document gives recommen- dations for MRI-related language to be included in the labeling of passive implants only,  which are implants without the supply of electronic power or electronic circuits, that are  submitted through PMA, IDE, or 510(k). Active implants, or devices that are not implants,  do not fall within the scope of this guidance. The main safety concerns affecting the “MR  Safe” or “MR Conditional” labeling of a passive implant in the MRI environment are mag- netically induced displacement force and torque, radiofrequency (RF) heating, and image  artifacts. The static magnetic field induces displacement forces and torque on magnetic ma- terials. The RF fields may induce substantial heating in tissues near metallic implants. The  presence of an implant may also produce image artifacts that can appear as region or signal  loss, or as a geometric distortion of the MR image. If the image artifact is near the area of  interest, the artifact could render the MR image non-diagnostic or may lead to an erroneous  clinical diagnosis, potentially leading to inappropriate medical action.</para>
      <para>The guidance recommends non-clinical testing for PMA, IDE, or 510(k) submissions  to establish the MR status of the passive implant in the MRI environment. Testing should  encompass the entire range of sizes of the implant or device, particularly the size or implant  combinations that represent a worst-case scenario. The guidance further recommends the  marking terminology defined in ASTM F2503, <emphasis role="italics">Standard Practice for Marking Medical De-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">vices and Other Items for Safety in the Magnetic Resonance Environment</emphasis> (8), for defining  the safety of items in the MRI environment: “MR Safe”, “MR Conditional”, and “MR Un- safe”. If a passive implant is labeled as “MR Safe”, the premarket submission should include  a scientific rationale or adequate test results supporting the “MR Safe” labeling. For “MR  Conditional” labeling of passive implants, the premarket submission should include MRI  test results indicating the safety and efficacy of the implant under the proposed labeling  conditions. For “MR Unsafe” labeling of passive implants, a scientific rationale or MRI  test results should be provided to support the implant as “MR Unsafe”.</para>

      <para>For all passive implants, the guidance recommends the following consensus standards  to be used: ASTM F2052, ASTM F2213, ASTM F2182, and ASTM F2119 (9-12). All  ASTM consensus standards will be discussed in detail below. Importantly, if a medical de- vice which is deemed “MR Safe” or “MR Conditional” in a 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz MR system,  it may not be “MR Safe” or “MR Conditional” in an MR system with a higher or lower  static magnetic field/RF frequency.</para>

      <para>This guidance provides an assessment paradigm for RF-induced heating for multi-con- figuration passive medical devices in the MRI environment (2). Certain passive devices are  not single-configuration devices, but rather multi-configuration devices, such as orthopedic  implants. Multi-configuration implants are either multi-component devices or single-com- ponent devices with various dimensions and shapes. Multi-component passive devices, such  as orthopedic external or internal fixation devices, may result in a very large number of  possible device configurations and combinations of individual components. Single-com- ponent devices, such as cardiovascular stents, are also frequently available in multiple sizes  or shapes. For these multi-configuration passive devices, it can be challenging to leverage  RF-induced heating test results from one device configuration or combination to other de- vice configurations or combinations, because the geometry or configuration of the device  can affect the heating in an unknown manner. As a result, the total number of possible con- figurations or combinations that need to be assessed for RF-induced heating can be very  large. Importantly, the paradigm presented in this guidance provides an approach to reduce  the total number of possible device configurations or combinations to a manageable number  for testing the RF-induced heating in the MRI environment. Additionally, this guidance  document provides recommendations on how to assess RF-induced device heating for multi- configuration passive medical devices.</para>

      <para>This guidance document which is entitled, The Standard Practice for Marking Medical  Devices and Other Items for Safety in the Magnetic Resonance Environment, applies to all  implanted medical devices, external medical devices that are fastened to or carried by (i.e.,  implanted) a patient, and all medical devices that are intended to enter the MRI environment.  This guidance document does not apply to the MR system itself. It provides recommenda- tions on MR safety assessments and labeling information, that should be included in all pre- market submissions. Specifically, the document covers terminology, relevant consensus  standards and guidance documents, addressing hazards for medical devices in the MRI en- vironment, reporting results, and MRI safety labeling.</para>

The National Electrical  Manufacturers Association (NEMA) formed the Magnetic Resonance Section and then the  Magnetic Resonance Technical Committee (under the MR Section) to develop standards  for MR Systems. The MR Technical Committee currently has published various MRI stan- dards that are readily available at NEMA’s website (5). According to NEMA mandates,  these standards must be reviewed every five years and either re-approved, updated and re- approved, or withdrawn. NEMA provides standardized methods for measuring performance  and safety parameters for MRDDs which can be utilized in Traditional, as well as, Abbre- viated 510(k)s. The following information provides an overview of currently published  NEMA Standards (5):</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">NEMA MS 1-2008 (Revision 2014), Determination of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">Diagnostic Magnetic Resonance Imaging </emphasis></para>
      <para>NEMA MS 1-2008 (R2014) defines four test methods for measuring the signal-to-noise  ratio (SNR) under a specific set of conditions, using head and body radiofrequency (RF)  coils. NEMA MS 1-2008 (R2014) does not address the use of surface RF coils, chemical  shift imaging, or spectroscopy.</para>
      <para>The major feature of the first method is that the SNR performance of the MR system is  evaluated using a standard clinical scan sequence. However, this method involves the sub- traction of two images, and therefore it can be very sensitive to MR system instabilities that  may occur during the data acquisition process. If the results are highly variable, the MS 1  recommends performing the alternative calculation of the standard deviation, described in  the first method, or using one of the other methods. These alternative methods have been  designed to be less susceptible to MR system instabilities and can be used to determine if  any variability in the SNR is due to the scanner instability or genuinely poor SNR. All meth- ods are intended to measure thermal and other broadband noise, and specifically do not ad- dress low frequency variations in an image or artifacts.</para>

      <para>NEMA MS 2-2008 (R2014) defines a method for determining the maximum percent  difference between the measured distances in an image and the actual phantom dimensions.  This standard evaluates the geometric distortion in three orthogonal planes passing through  the center of the specification volume. The purpose of the defined procedure is to provide  a standardized method of measuring and reporting two-dimensional geometric distortion  in an MR system (i.e., the maximum percent difference between the measured distances in  an image and the actual corresponding phantom dimensions). Radial measurements, those  that are between points spanning the geometric center of the test object, are used to charac- terize the geometric distortion. Measurements should be evenly spaced with an angular sep- aration less than 45-degrees to sample sufficiently the angular variation of the geometric  distortion.</para>

      <para>NEMA MS 3-2008 (R2014) defines a test method for measuring image-uniformity per- formance of MRDDs using head and body RF coils. NEMA MS 3-2008 (R2014) does not  address the use of surface RF coils, chemical shift imaging, or spectroscopy. Image unifor- mity can be characterized in different ways. The choice of a measurement and reporting  method was guided by a desire for simplicity, accuracy, and ease of implementation on all  MR systems. The peak deviation method represents a single image test that can quickly de- termine and report uniformity with a single number. It works best with very high SNR im- ages. The gray-scale uniformity map image represents a single image test that can visually  describe image uniformity. Both the American College of Radiology (ACR) MR Accredi- tation Procedure method and the Normalized Absolute Average Deviation method resolve  some of the image SNR issues of the peak deviation method. Measurements are made over  a volume that is representative of the region used for typical clinical studies. Due to the dif- ficulty in handling large phantoms, it is permitted to use a test phantom that only covers  85% of the specification area. This document does not address the use of special purpose  RF coils (see MS 6) or RF coils that require multiple receiver channels for operation (see  MS 9).</para>

      <para>NEMA MS 5-2010 defines two methods for determining slice or section thickness in  diagnostic MRI. The methods presented are essentially numerical in character and, conse- quently, will require the preparation and use of supplementary dedicated computer software  to perform the computations. The methods are based on determining the slice profile, from  which the slice thickness is obtained as the full width at half maximum. The slice profile is  obtained either by direct measurement with a thin inclined slab of signal-producing material,  or by numerical differentiation of the measured edge response function from an inclined  surface of a wedge immersed in signal producing material. A correction technique is pro- vided to compensate for errors caused by tilting the phantom. With the inclined slab ap- proach, better SNR can be realized. However, the extremely thin slabs required for  measurement of very thin slices are not practical to fabricate. Differentiation of the edge  response function degrades the SNR that is obtained for the slice profile and usually requires  the averaging of several measurements.

      <para>NEMA MS 6-2008 (R2014) defines methods for evaluating single-channel non-volume  coils or a single channel of an array RF coil. Both receive-only and transmit-receive RF  coils are included. Head and body RF coils, and single-channel volume specialty RF coils,  are excluded (see NEMA MS 1 and NEMA MS 3), as are RF coils requiring multiple re- ceiver channels for operation (i.e., array RF coils, see NEMA MS 9) (5). R2014 presently  permits the analysis of one channel of a multi-channel coil. These RF coils are used to re- ceive signals from a limited region of interest and include linear or quadrature combined  surface RF coils, flexible coils, pairs of coils such as Helmholtz coils, or RF coils that par- tially surround a specific tissue such as the calf or other extremity. NEMA MS 6-2008  (R2014) refers to these coils as “surface coils.” These RF coils achieve good SNR perform- ance because of their increased filling factor. The purpose of the defined test procedure is  to provide a standard means for measuring and reporting the SNR and uniformity of signal  intensity in images acquired with surface RF coils. These quantities are helpful in evaluating  RF coil performance and effectiveness. Evaluations are performed on phantom images gen- erated using standard clinical MRI sequences.</para>

Both methods were based on the maximum peak dB/dt that the gradient system can  produce, when using pulsed waveforms. If the static magnetic field is oriented along the z- axis, then time-varying gradient fields necessary for an MRI procedure are the dBz/dt com- ponents produced by the x-, y, and z-gradients.</para>

      <para>NEMA MS 8-2016 defines two measurement procedures to assess the whole-body av- erage, specific absorption rate (WB-SAR). This standard does not define a relationship be- tween the SAR and the body temperature increase. Two procedures for WB-SAR  measurements, the calorimetric method and the pulse-energy method are defined. The doc- ument does not apply to gradient (low-frequency time-varying magnetic fields) safety where  nerve and possible cardiac excitation are the primary safety issues. It is also not intended  to apply to spatial peak or local average SAR, nor does it address other factors involved  with patient heating. The tests are specifically developed for volume RF transmit coils that  produce relatively homogeneous RF fields. In 2016 NEMA MS 8 has been significantly re- vised. Changes were made to clarify the measurement methods and to make them easier  for use by those who are not MR manufacturers. Specifically, the methods to consider the</para>

      <para>NEMA MS 9-2008 (R2014) defines a test method for measuring the SNR and image  uniformity of MR images produced using receive-only phased array coils. These quantities  are helpful in evaluating the impact of MR system changes on performance or in demon- strating effectiveness for FDA applications. Other RF coil configurations have been ad- dressed in MS 1, MS 3, and MS 6. Phased array RF coils consist of multiple receive-only  coils that are used to detect signals from a limited portion of the patient’s anatomy. The out- put of each RF coil element, or combined set of elements, is connected to the input of an  independent receiver chain. Phased array RF coils may be composed of surface coils, flex- ible coils, pairs of coils such as Helmholtz coils, or RF coils that surround a specific anatom- ical region as well as combinations of these coils. Phased array RF coils achieve good SNR  performance because of their increased filling factor and the use of smaller, higher SNR,  receive coils. Major changes to R2014 are additional information related to noise statistics  for coils with more than one channel and a table with the channel count dependent noise  statistics.</para>

      <para>NEMA MS 10-2010 defines a measurement method for local specific absorption rate  (SAR). The measurement method requires construction of a radiofrequency phantom for a  given frequency and the use of radiofrequency transparent thermometry. The procedure is  intended for local SAR measurements only and specifically does not address whole-body  SAR. Local SAR is a parameter that relates to the safety of MRI scanners. The primary  safety concern with transmit surface coils involves local SAR which may be highest near  electrical conductors. This standard does not attempt to establish relationships between SAR  and body temperature.</para>

The  measurement method requires construction of electric field dipoles, spacers, a phantom,  and the use of a high impedance device for measuring voltages. The electric field measure- ments are done in a solution with a conductivity value similar to that of the human body.  Numerical methods of estimating the electric field are discussed in an appendix to NEMA  MS 11-2010. Gradient-induced electric fields may affect the safety and comfort of patients.

      <para>MS 12-2016 defines test methods for measuring the absolute spatial variation of geo- metric accuracy within MR images. The methods present an absolute geometric accuracy  as a map, graph, or table throughout the imaging region rather than as simple figures of  merit such as average or worst-case error. This standard deals exclusively with absolute  error measurements, because it is assumed the end user will need geometric distortion error  measurements in absolute terms. While the intent of this standard is to quantify equipment  induced geometric errors only, the phantom used for these measurements will also introduce  some geometric errors. It is not possible to remove the phantom-induced errors within the  scope of this standard, and this standard assumes that the measured errors are exclusively  equipment errors. Therefore, it is necessary for the user of this standard to be able to differ- entiate between geometric errors due to the MR system and errors that arise from measuring  geometric distortion with a test object. The user should attempt to estimate the error the  phantom introduces for the specific test conditions used.</para>
      <para>This standard also recognizes that the measurements are ideally performed with three- dimensional acquisitions and large volume phantoms, but the cost, weight, and size of the  required phantom may be prohibitive in certain situations. Therefore, this standard permits  the use of a substantially two-dimensional phantom in conjunction with a set of two-dimen- sional image acquisitions in different orientations. These procedures could also be helpful  in evaluating the impact of system changes on performance, for quality control programs  that seek to continually reaffirm system performance, or in demonstrating effectiveness for  FDA applications. However, this standard does not supersede NEMA MS 2 Determination  of Two-Dimensional Geometric Distortion in Diagnostic Magnetic Resonance Images. MS  2 is designed to produce simple figures of merit that describe basic geometric distortions,  or image field of view errors, that could arise from imaging gradient amplitude scaling er- rors. The revision in 2016 includes various changes to the spherical harmonic analysis- based methods.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">ASTM INTERNATIONAL MRI STANDARDS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES AND </emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">IMPLANTS </emphasis></para>
      <para>In 1997, CDRH requested that the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)  (now known as the “ASTM International”) develop test methods to address safety and ef- fectiveness issues for medical devices in the MRI environment. Based on this request, the  ASTM formed the task group F04.15.11 on the safety and compatibility of implant materials  and medical devices in the MRI environment. Task group F04.15.11 developed test methods  for evaluating magnetically induced displacement force and torque, radiofrequency (RF)  heating, image artifacts, and MR labeling. The first ASTM MRI test method was published  in 2000 as the consensus standard, F2052-00, <emphasis role="italics">Standard Test Method for Measurement of </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Magnetically Induced Displacement Force on Passive Implants in the Magnetic Resonance </emphasis></para>

      <para><emphasis role="italics">Environment</emphasis>. Presently, ASTM International has five different consensus standards for MRI  evaluation of passive implants and devices, including, the following:</para>
      <para>(1) <emphasis role="italics">ASTM F2052 Standard test method for measurement of magnetically induced dis-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">placement force on medical devices in the magnetic resonance environment</emphasis> (9) defines a  method for determining the displacement force or translational attraction. The spatial gra- dient of the magnetic field of the MR system produces a displacement force on magnetic  objects placed in the magnetic field. This displacement force is responsible for the projectile  effect that continues to cause injuries in the MRI environment.</para>
      <para>ASTM F2052 requires the test object to be suspended by a thin string, less than 1% of  the weight of the tested device and moved to the position in the magnetic field that produces  the greatest displacement. The angular deflection of the device from the vertical is measured  and the deflection force is calculated. If the angular deflection is less than 45°, and the mag- netic force is in the horizontal direction, then the deflection force is less than the device’s  weight and it is assumed that the risk imposed by the magnetically-induced deflection force  is no greater than the risk due to the gravitational force. However, counter-forces may also  need to be considered, because these can act on an implant and prevent movement or dis- placement of the object. ASTM F2052 was revised in 2015 to require the test be performed  in a MR system and change the test location to a location along the axis of the scanner’s  bore where the static magnetic field and spatial gradient of the magnetic field have compo- nents in the z direction only. A method was added to Appendix X3 for calculating the max- imum allowable spatial gradient of the magnetic field for an implant or device.</para>
      <para>(2) <emphasis role="italics">ASTM F2213 Standard test method for measurement of magnetically induced torque </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">on medical devices in the magnetic resonance environment</emphasis> (10) defines a method for meas- uring the torque on a medical device in the MRI environment. The static magnetic field  produces a torque on an object and forces it to align the long-axis of the object with the  magnetic field. For this test procedure, the medical device with one principal axis aligned  in the vertical direction is placed on a holder suspended on a torsional spring. The test fixture  is then placed in the center of the MR system where the effect of torque is at a maximum.  The angular deflection of the holder from its equilibrium position is recorded and the torque  is calculated. The frame supporting the spring and holder is rotated through 360-degrees,  and the torque, as a function of the angle of the device is determined. This measurement is  repeated for the other two principal axes of the device to determine the maximum torque.  According to ASTM F2213, the torque is acceptable if the maximum torque induced by the  MR system is less than the product of the longest dimension of the implant and its weight.  For medical devices within the acceptance criteria, the magnetically induced torque is less  than the worst-case torque on the implant due to gravity. Again, counter-forces may also  need to be considered because these can act on an implant and prevent movement or dis- placement of the object associated with torque. ASTM F2213 was revised in 2017 to add  the Low Friction Surface Method, the Pulley Method, the Suspension Method, and the Cal- culation Based on Measured Displacement Force Method.</para>

      <para>with an MR system induces electrical currents in the body, which generate heat. The specific  absorption rate (SAR), reported in Watts per kilogram (W/kg), is the mass normalized rate  at which RF energy is coupled to biological tissue, which, if a metallic implant is present,  is an important parameter to prevent excessive heating that may result in patient injury. Ac- cording to ASTM F2182, the implant to be tested is placed in a phantom filled with a  medium that simulates the electrical and thermal properties of the human body. The implant  is placed at a location with well-characterized exposure conditions. The phantom material  is a gelled-saline consisting of a saline solution and a gelling agent. Temperature probes,  which are typically fluoroptic thermometry probes, are placed at locations where the induced  implant heating is expected to be the greatest (this may require pilot experiments to deter- mine the proper placement of the temperature probes). The phantom is then placed in an  MR system or an apparatus that reproduces just the RF field. ASTM F2182 recommends  using an RF field producing a whole-body averaged SAR of about 2 W/kg applied for ap- proximately 15-minutes (or other time sufficient to characterize the temperature rise and  the local SAR). The test procedure is divided into two steps: (1) the temperature rise on or  near the implant at several locations is measured using the temperature probes during ap- proximately 15-minutes of RF application. The temperature rise is also measured at a ref- erence location during Step 1. (2) The implant is removed, and the same RF application is  repeated while the temperature measurements are obtained at the same probe locations as  in Step 1 (i.e., at the positions applied to the implant that is undergoing evaluation). From  these measurements, the local SAR is calculated for each probe, including the reference lo- cation. The local SAR at the temperature reference probe is used to verify that the same RF  exposure conditions are applied during Steps 1 and 2 of the test procedure.</para>
      <para>ASTM F2182 underwent a major revision and ASTM published a new version end of  2019 (11). This new version has less emphasis on scaling the measured temperature rise to  the average whole-body (WB) SAR. Instead of WB-SAR scaling, which is no longer re- quired, the heating results are scaled to the local RF background exposure. The local RF  background exposure can be characterized with either temperature probes (as it was done  before) or with electric field measurements. The phantom shape changed by removing the  “head” section from the phantom. The head section of the phantom was confusing because  it suggested the idea that the phantom was an acceptable replica of the human anatomy. The  new version emphasizes that the shape of the phantom is not specifically required. One ex- ample of phantom size and shape is provided in the document, but other types of phantoms  are also allowed, as long as the local exposure is well characterized and that there is at least  2 cm distance between the implant and the phantom surface. Further changes included re- moving the requirement for intermediate conductivity measurements when building the  phantom and revising certain sections regarding the implant holder and multi-configuration  devices. The ASTM International committee agreed that a future revision should include  computational modeling for passive implants. Notably, such modeling is already performed  by many companies and MRI testing experts. This type of modeling uses computer-aided  design (CAD) models of the implant to compute the <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> heating with respect to local  SAR, and then calculates the <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> heating by scaling the <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> results to the computa- tionally assessed <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> electric fields.</para>

Although image artifacts do  not generally affect the safety of a device in the MRI setting, physicians may need infor- mation about the size and location of image artifacts with respect to the location of the por- tion of the body that is to be imaged. The test defines pairs of spin echo and gradient echo  MR images generated both with and without the implant in the field of view. The image ar- tifacts are assessed by computing the differences between the reference and implant images.</para>
      <para>(5) <emphasis role="italics">ASTM F2503 Standard practice for marking medical devices and other items for </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">safety in the magnetic resonance environment</emphasis> (8) defines the terms, “MR Safe”, “MR Con- ditional”, and “MR Unsafe”, as follows: “MR Safe” — an item that poses no known hazards  in all MRI environments; “MR Unsafe” — an item that is known to pose hazards in all MRI  environments; and “MR Conditional” — an item that has been demonstrated to pose no  known hazards in a specified MRI environment with specified conditions of use. The par- ticular conditions that define the specified MRI environment include the static magnetic  field strength, spatial gradient magnetic field, time-varying magnetic fields, radiofrequency  fields, and the specific absorption rate (SAR). Additional conditions, including specific con- figurations or operational conditions of the implants or device, may also be defined.</para>
      <para>In addition to these definitions, ASTM F2503 defines icons for the three definitions.  The icons are intended for use on implants, devices, and other items that may be brought  into, or near, the MRI environment, as well as in product labeling. The icons can be in color  or in black and white. The MR Safe icon consists of the letters “MR” in green in a white  square with a green border, or the letters “MR” in white within a green square. The MR  Conditional icon consists of the letters “MR” in black inside a yellow triangle with a black  border and the MR Unsafe icon consists of the letters “MR” in black on a white field inside  a red circle with a diagonal red stripe. The MR Conditional item labeling must include in- formation for the acceptable conditions that are sufficient to characterize the behavior of  the item in the MRI setting. This additional information should address magnetic field in- teractions (i.e., magnetically-induced displacement force and torque) and RF-induced heat- ing. Other possible safety issues may include induced currents/voltages, electromagnetic  field-related issues, thermal injury, nerve stimulation, possible acoustic noise issues, inter- action among different devices, the safe functioning of the device, and the safe operation  of the MR system. Any parameter that affects the safety of the item should be listed and  any condition that is known to produce an unsafe condition must be described in the MR  Conditional labeling for the item. F2503 was revised in 2013 to create an ASTM Interna- tional and an IEC standard with identical content.</para>

      <para>ports of off-label scanning and the possible perception that the risk is not as significant as  believed by AIMD manufacturers, MR system manufacturers, and regulatory bodies. Inter- estingly, FDA’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) (13) database  for adverse event reporting still indicates instances of device failures and patient injuries  associated with MRI examinations performed on patients with AIMDs. Because of the harsh  electromagnetic environment associated with MRI, the testing of AIMDs in these fields is  especially challenging. The development of appropriate test methods required detailed tech- nical knowledge of the electromagnetic fields emitted by the MR system.</para>
      <para>In 2005, CDRH held meetings with representatives from both MR system and AIMD  manufacturers that led to an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recom- mendation to form a liaison with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC/SC  62B/MT 40, responsible for the safety standard for MRI equipment, IEC 60601-2-33, <emphasis role="italics">Par-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">ticular requirements for the basic safety and essential performance of magnetic resonance </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">equipment for medical diagnosis</emphasis>) (5), to consider recommendations that could be used to  write MRI-related safety requirements for AIMDs. In April 2018, the joint ISO/IEC working  group (JWG) published the second edition of the dual logo Technical Specification (TS)  10974 entitled, “<emphasis role="italics">Assessment of the safety of magnetic resonance imaging for patients with </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">an active implantable medical device</emphasis>” (14). This second edition incorporated experience  gained from the first edition of its use in practice and the current understanding of relevant  issues and concerns at 1.5 T. Based on information received from the committee the JWG  is currently working on converting the TS into an International Standard. By mutual agree- ment between the JWG and MT 40, all MR scanner-related requirements will be considered  by MT 40 and will be released through future amendments and editions of IEC 60601-2- 33. It is important to mention that no requirements contained within 60601-2-33, including  the use of clinical scanners, construe or imply any obligation for compliance on the part of  MR scanner manufacturers. The test methods contained in TS 10974 for evaluating device  operation against several hazards are applicable to a broad class of AIMDs. Specific com- pliance criteria and the determination of risk resulting from device responses during these  tests are outside the scope of TS 10974. The test methods in TS 10974 were derived from  six known potential hazards to patients with an AIMD undergoing an MR scan. These po- tential hazards are: device heating due to the RF field and the gradient magnetic fields, vi- bration due to the gradient magnetic fields, force and torque due to the static magnetic field,  unintended stimulation due to the gradient magnetic field-induced lead voltage and the RF  field-induced rectified lead voltage, and device malfunction due to the static magnetic field,  the RF field, and the gradient magnetic fields. Evaluation of the AIMD for these hazards  involves some combination of testing and modeling. Tests may use bench-top testing, mod- eling, MR scanners, or a combination of these approaches. Implants and devices are sub- jected to radiated fields or injected voltages in order to elicit device responses. Modeling  may be employed to determine appropriate test signal voltage levels or to estimate tissue  heating. Major changes planned to be incorporated in the new International Standard (IS)  10974 is the addition of 3 T test methods, enhancement of the combined field test method,  and eliminating what is referred to as a Tier 1 approach for RF-induced heating testing. The  JWG is attempting to maintain the requirements for IS 10974 backwards compatible with  the second edition of TS 10947 so that regulators don’t require re-testing legacy devices.  The JWG plans to develop the draft for IS 10974 in the near future.</para>

      <title>THE IEC STANDARD 60601-2-33 FOR MR SYSTEMS</title>
      <para>As outlined in detail above the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)  has developed standards for the measurement of performance and safety parameters in MRI.  Another international standard setting organization, the International Electrotechnical Com- mission (IEC) has developed IEC 60601-2-33 that addresses many of the safety issues as- sociated with MRI examinations. In the early 1990s, work began on IEC 60601-2-33,  <emphasis role="italics">Particular Requirements for the Safety of Magnetic Resonance Equipment for Medical Di-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">agnosis</emphasis>, and the first edition was finalized in 1995. The FDA participated in the development  of this document, which had a significant influence on current FDA policies and guidance  documents relating to MRI. This is particularly important because the FDA has the respon- sibility of ensuring both the safety and effectiveness of medical devices.</para>
      <para>The latest version of IEC 60601-2-33 Edition 3.2, <emphasis role="italics">Particular Requirements for the Basic </emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">Safety and Essential Performance of Magnetic Resonance Equipment for Medical Diagno-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">sis</emphasis>, was published in 2015 (5). Although the title mentions “essential performance”, no such  requirements have been identified within the scope of the standard. The third edition mainly  establishes particular basic safety to provide protection for the patient and the MRI health- care worker. Because IEC 60601-2-33 does not address performance issues, such as the sig- nal-to-noise ratio, image uniformity, geometric distortion, and slice thickness, the FDA has  specified in the guidance titled <emphasis role="italics">Submission of Premarket Notifications for Magnetic Reso-</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">nance Diagnostic Devices</emphasis> (2) from November 2016, performance tests for MR imaging  and spectroscopy.</para>
      <para>Before working on the Fourth Edition of 60601-2-33 the Committee (IEC  62/62B/MT40) released two Amendments to the Third Edition. The first amendment  (AMD1) was released in 2013 with formal updates to the latest general and collateral stan- dards, whereas the second amendment (AMD2) was released in 2015. AMD1 was published  to adapt IEC 60601-2-33:2010 to the technical corrections introduced to IEC 60601-1:2005.  AMD2 was  developed to increase the First Level Controlled Operating Mode limit for the  static magnetic field from 4 T to 8 T considering the FDA, the ICNIRP (15), and the peer  reviewed scientific literature. In addition, a non-compulsory option, called the Fixed Pa- rameter Option B (Basic) (FPO:B) (16), was introduced to limit RF and gradient field out- puts (peak and the root mean square, RMS) for scanning patients with MR Conditional  implants and devices. Consequently, text was proposed for the Instructions For Use (IFU)  to guide users in scanning patients with MR Conditional implants and devices. Plans for  the Fourth Edition of 60601-2-33 include the single fault safety of the emergency rundown  button, to reestablish acoustic protection, to include reference to the Medical Imaging &amp;  Technology Alliance (MITA) RF coil/cable heating test standard, and to reestablish systemic  and local RF protection without introducing the CEM43 concept (17, 18).</para>

      <para>field of AIMD safety, where the TS 10974 was developed and is widely used to assess the  safety of AIMDs in relative to the use of  MRI technology. In general, recommended patient  exposure limits have risen as a result of increased knowledge regarding the biological effects  of the static, time-varying magnetic, and RF fields associated with MRI. One of the most  important lessons learned is that safety standards and guidance documents, although subject  to change over time, provide the most current and generally accepted guidance towards safe  use of MRI technology and should be followed, if applicable, to address safety concerns.  Any deviations from recommended guidance documents should be accompanied by a de- tailed and scientifically sound rationale.</para>
