      <title>15.1 Introduction</title>
      <anchor id="ch0028-head-2-193"/>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0003">Veterinary technicians are skilled professionals who communicate with clients during some of the most challenging moments they face as caregivers to their companion animals. Technicians are well‐positioned to support clients as they navigate the grief associated with losing a companion animal. By offering compassionate communication and care, technicians help preserve and validate the bond between clients and their pets.</para>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0004">Approaching conversations about end‐of‐life (EOL) and pet loss can be intimidating. Veterinary teams can quickly be overwhelmed by the uncertainty of how clients may respond to grief, along with the discomfort that can arise when dealing with emotions such as sadness and guilt. For this reason, technicians need to understand where their role in providing grief support begins and ends. This chapter does not ask technicians to act as therapists or counselors. Instead, it aims to equip them with practical skills and strategies that align with their scope of practice. When technicians are well‐prepared with resources and know how to offer comfort in grief‐related conversations, they gain confidence in their roles and interactions. Engaging in compassionate interactions not only adds value and meaning to one’s work but also nurtures a sense of fulfillment and encourages self‐preservation.</para>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0005">In<ulink url="ch0027">Chapter 14</ulink>, technicians gained insight into grief responses and reactions that people may experience after the loss of a companion animal. Building on the communication techniques and strategies discussed in <ulink url="ch0017">Chapters 6</ulink> and <ulink url="ch0018">7</ulink>, this chapter focuses on language, actions, and resources that can help technicians respond effectively to common grief reactions, as well as more specific grief scenarios. The author’s objective is to equip technicians with practical tools to navigate these difficult conversations, provide emotional support, walk with clients through the grieving process with empathy and understanding, and provide guidance around memorialization, all while maintaining professional boundaries.</para>

      <title>15.2 Language Sensitivity in Grief Support</title>
      <anchor id="ch0028-head-2-194"/>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0006">When working with someone who has experienced a loss, it is often challenging to know what to say. It is common to worry about saying the “wrong thing” out of fear that it might make things worse for the person who is grieving. Therefore, what is the “right” language to use? Realistically, there are no magic words or phrases that can rid a person of their grief, and that is not the point of providing support. Grief is going to be present no matter what a technician says or does. Rather than “fixing” or “solving” a person’s grief, technicians can focus on using empathy to create a supportive space for clients to express themselves and share their experiences.</para>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0007">Technicians can use thoughtful language and open‐ended questions to meet an individual where they are in their grieving process. Empathy is actively working to understand a person’s unique perspective. Empathic language encourages people to share their feelings, thoughts, and needs without judgment.<link linkend="ch0028-c15-tbl-0001">Table 15.1</link> includes practical examples of supportive language as well as language to avoid.</para>

      <title>15.3 Providing Grief Support and Memorialization</title>
      <anchor id="ch0028-head-2-195"/>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0062">Memorialization refers to the ways an individual acknowledges and honors the life of the deceased. To further enhance compassionate care for clients grieving the loss of their pets, technicians may also facilitate memorialization. Death often prompts existential fear, dread, and anxiety for people who have lost a loved one. Memorialization can provide comfort in the face of this vast unknown. When those experiencing pet loss engage in meaningful memorialization, it helps to strengthen and preserve the bond they had with their pet<citation>ch0028-c15-bib-0001</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0063">By offering practical support and resources such as aftercare options, memorial items, keepsakes, and follow‐up care, technicians can enhance the level of EOL care offered. These thoughtful gestures not only demonstrate empathy but also offer clients tangible ways to navigate their grief. This can even help to strengthen the rapport between the veterinary practice and its clientele<citation>ch0028-c15-bib-0002</citation>. Be aware that not every client will need or want assistance with this. Let clients guide the level of support they require and do not force them to participate in something in which they are not interested.</para>

      <anchor id="ch0028-head-3-145"/>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0064">Memorialization often begins with the aftercare process. Clients want to know that their animals’ remains are handled with dignity and respect. Knowing the options for aftercare allows people to personalize the way their pet is kept and cherished. See<ulink url="ch0025">Chapter 13</ulink> for more information about aftercare. Having a technician to support and guide clients through the aftercare process helps alleviate some of the <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=5714">stress</ulink> and uncertainty that follow the death of a pet. Clients are usually thankful that they have someone to help with arrangements, especially a trusted professional like a technician (<link linkend="ch0028-c15-fea-0001">Case Study 15.1</link>).</para>

         <beginpage pagenum="249"/>Technicians should aim to discuss aftercare options before the pet’s death, ideally during EOL planning. However, there are times when this isn’t possible, and decisions must be made soon after the pet has died. This may add challenges to this conversation, as it can be overwhelming for clients to make decisions around aftercare while they are freshly grieving. If clients feel rushed or pressured, they may feel they didn’t get a chance to really think their options through. This can <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=14726">lead</ulink> to regret around their decisions, which may negatively impact their memorialization and grief going forward.</para>

      <title>15.3.2 Memorial Activities and Keepsakes</title>
      <anchor id="ch0028-head-3-146"/>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0072">Memorial activities and keepsakes create lasting memories that offer comfort and remembrance for years to come. The physical presence of pets in the lives of their caretakers is incredibly important. For many, pets occupied significant space in their home: their spot on the couch, the bed or crate where they slept, the spot where their food and <ulink type="drug" url="link.aspx?id=15160">water</ulink> bowls were placed, the spaces where their leashes and toys were kept, and the physical comfort they provided (e.g. greeting them at the door after work, affection when feeling sad or overwhelmed, sleeping beside them). As a result, their absence is deeply felt. Many describe an emptiness or void in their homes after such a loss<citation>ch0028-c15-bib-0001</citation>.</para>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0073">Memorial items will never replace the pet’s physical presence, but they can offer a tangible reminder of the special companion and the unbreakable bond that remains. Sometimes people will know exactly what they would like to do, whereas others may be unsure of where to start. The nice thing about memorialization is that there is no timeline on when it should be started or completed and no one way to do it (see<link linkend="ch0028-c15-fea-0002">Pro Tip 15.1</link>).</para>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0074">Memorialization is an important consideration for veterinary teams because there is often little guidance available for clients navigating this deeply personal process, and clients will likely ask about it. Many clients welcome suggestions on how to personalize their journey of honoring their beloved companion’s memory (see<link linkend="ch0028-c15-tbl-0002">Table 15.2</link>, <link linkend="ch0028-c15-fea-0003">Case Study 15.2</link>). Technicians can provide personalized keepsakes for their clients like fur clippings or nose/paw prints (see <link linkend="ch0028-c15-fig-0001">Figure 15.1</link>). It is important that client permission is always obtained before any additional handling of the body or preparation of memorial items. Some clients may be upset that these activities occurred without their knowledge or consent. It is also very important that the requests and consent for these items be recorded in the medical record and ideally on the euthanasia (or hospice‐supported natural death) consent form.</para>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0078">Along with providing a list of suggestions for clients to memorialize their pets, technicians might also facilitate memorialization through the practice itself (see<link linkend="ch0028-c15-fig-0002">Figure 15.2</link>, <link linkend="ch0028-c15-tbl-0003">Table 15.3</link>). Clients often appreciate it when the practice offers a touching gesture to honor their pets. This also gives the veterinary staff an opportunity to engage in memorializing their patients, as many technicians develop strong bonds with clients and patients and may also be impacted by these losses. See <ulink url="ch0029">Chapter 16</ulink> for memorialization geared towards families with children.</para>

Anticipatory grief is a familiar experience for many caregivers but is often unacknowledged by people’s social support or by the person themselves <citation>ch0028-c15-bib-0003</citation>. Technicians working with clients may notice the emotional impact of anticipatory grief. For example, anxiety and fear are common as clients brace themselves for the inevitable loss of their pets. This may present as guilt related to spending time with their pets and the decisions being made about their care as well as caregiver burden. The responsibility of decision‐making and caregiving during this time can be overwhelming for clients, leading to emotional and physical exhaustion <citation>ch0028-c15-bib-0003</citation>.

      <title>15.5.2 Integrating Cultural Sensitivity in Grief Support</title>
      <anchor id="ch0028-head-3-150"/>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0117">In<ulink url="ch0027">Chapter 14</ulink>, the impact of culture and spirituality on the grief experience was discussed. Cultural and spiritual sensitivity in EOL care does not require specific knowledge of different cultures or spiritual traditions. A technician’s role in these situations is to simply encourage clients to express their needs, beliefs, and wishes in relation to their pet’s EOL journey and their memorialization and mourning. The technician can then offer support as families prepare and carry out those wishes. This section and 15.5.3. will more specifically examine how memorial activities and rituals are important in multiple cultures or spiritual beliefs and their role in pet loss.</para>
      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0118">In Western culture, rituals in memorializing are well‐established for people but not for pet loss. For example, consider Catholic traditions for human loss: a funeral service typically follows a predetermined structure, starting with a religious service, followed by a viewing, a procession to the cemetery for burial, and concluding with socialization. Even dress codes are established and widely understood. These traditions around memorializing the deceased often establish a “right to grieve”<citation>ch0028-c15-bib-0004</citation>. In Catholicism, for instance, the bereaved may find comfort in the belief that the deceased has gone to heaven and will reunite with loved ones in the afterlife, and the Catholic ceremony reaffirms this belief. <link linkend="ch0028-c15-fea-0009">Case Study 15.3</link>

         <anchor id="ch0028-head-2-206"/>
         <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0119">Alina is a young adult living with her parents and their beloved Pomeranian Daisy in their family home. At 16 years old, Daisy’s health has been declining. After a particularly difficult week where Daisy’s quality of life noticeably worsened, Alina and her family make the hard decision to euthanize her.</para>
         <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0120">Before taking Daisy to her final appointment, Alina and her parents gather in their home to say prayers and sing hymns, in a modification of their Sikh tradition usually observed when a human family member passes away. This ritual brings them comfort, as they honor Daisy as a beloved member of the family.</para>
         <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0121">After Daisy’s euthanasia, Alina struggles with the decision about her aftercare. She knows that both she and her parents want Daisy to be cremated, but Alina feels conflicted. On one hand, she wants to be present when the cremation service prepares Daisy’s body, believing that Daisy, as a member of their family, deserves the same respect and rituals as any other loved one. On the other hand, she and her parents are uneasy at the thought of seeing Daisy’s body in that state. They want to remember Daisy as she was in life, not as she is now. Alina worries that if she doesn’t witness the preparation, she might later feel guilty.</para>
         <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0122">Seeking guidance, Alina shares her concerns with the technician at the veterinary practice. The technician listens empathically and suggests that Alina first contact the crematory to inquire about the possibility of viewing Daisy’s body preparation and what that experience might entail. The technician emphasizes that gathering information could be a helpful first step, allowing the family to make a more informed decision. She also suggests that Alina consider consulting a spiritual advisor or trusted person within their faith who might offer additional insight.</para>
         <para>Alina feels reassured after speaking with the technician. Initially overwhelmed by the decision, she agrees that it’s worth exploring the options before making a final choice. A few days later, Alina called the technician to follow up. She expresses her gratitude for the suggestions and shares that the crematory was willing to accommodate viewing. After further discussion with her parents, they decide against the viewing. They feel more at peace with their decision, preferring to remember Daisy as she was during her life. They are comforted by the prayers they offered before the euthanasia and plan to scatter Daisy’s ashes together in her favorite spot, another Sikh tradition they can include.</para>

      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0124">There are times when grieving clients may ask technicians questions about spirituality and the afterlife concerning their deceased pets. Technicians should approach these conversations with sensitivity, avoiding the disclosure of their personal beliefs. Often, clients are not seeking concrete answers but rather comfort and reassurance.<link linkend="ch0028-c15-fea-0010">Communication Corner 15.5</link> gives examples of technicians responding to caregiver questions relating to spirituality. In these responses, the technician is putting the question back to the client. This can help the technician guide their response in a way that acknowledges the clients’ beliefs around the afterlife without imposing a particular opinion or belief system. As a general rule when answering questions of this nature, avoid assuming a person’s set of beliefs. Instead, ask open‐ended questions and listen with compassion. Technicians can also suggest that clients connect with a spiritual advisor of their faith.</para>

      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0128">There are those instances where an individual is so overwhelmed by their grief that they experience suicidal ideations or intent. Suicidal ideation refers to thoughts of ending one’s own life, while suicidal intent involves concrete plans or preparations to carry out suicidal acts. Suicidality as a grief response can happen for different reasons. As mentioned in<ulink url="ch0027">Chapter 14</ulink>, Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) can influence this response, but there are also factors like preexisting health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders or <ulink type="disease" url="link.aspx?id=8412">substance abuse</ulink> issues that might contribute to suicidal thoughts and actions [<citation>ch0028-c15-bib-0006</citation>, <citation>ch0028-c15-bib-0007</citation>]. Grief can be so deeply painful, sometimes the thought of living without a beloved companion animal can feel devastating and unbearable. People who have struggled with suicidal ideations or intent in the past will sometimes share that it was their companion who gave them the purpose to continue living.</para>

When a bereaved person is exhibiting these signs, symptoms, and behaviors, it warrants compassionate inquiry and referral to mental health professionals.

      <para id="ch0028-c15-para-0130">Responding to a client who discloses suicidal thoughts can be incredibly stressful for a technician, yet it also presents an opportunity to provide compassionate care. Veterinary practice staff should strongly consider engaging in crisis and suicide intervention training. Courses such as Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) and Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) provide people with the skills and confidence needed to respond effectively to such sensitive situations, ensuring that they fulfill their duty of care in keeping clients safe. With the right training, technicians can approach these situations with greater confidence and preparedness. Along with training for these scenarios, it is also useful for veterinary practices to have a guideline or protocol for how the team can respond to suicidality. A full sample template for suicide response guidelines is located at the end of the chapter (15B). See<link linkend="ch0028-c15-fea-0011">Communication Corner 15.6</link> for sample dialogue to use in these challenging situations.</para>
