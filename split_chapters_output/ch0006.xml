    <para>During the operation of the magnetic resonance (MR) system, various types of acoustic noises are produced. The problems associated with acoustic noise for patients and healthcare workers are wide ranging, from simple annoyance and difficulties in verbal communication between staff and patients, to heightened anxiety or discomfort, and even potentially permanent hearing impairment (1-9). Acoustic noise may pose a particular problem for specific patient groups that may be at increased risk. For example, patients with head injuries or psychiatric disorders, the elderly, young children, and infants may be confused or suffer from heightened anxiety during MRI procedures (2). Patients taking medications may experience increased hearing sensitivity (3). Additionally, neonates with immature anatomical development may be at increased risk for adverse effects associated with acoustic noise. For example, significant fluctuations in vital signs of newborns have been reported during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, which may partly be attributable to acoustic noise (4). High levels of acoustic noise may also impact the quality of the MRI procedure by causing distress in the patient.</para>
    <para>Due to several of the issues listed above and the more specific issues discussed below, acoustic noise levels also pose a significant problem for one particular area of MRI: the increasing amount of research in functional MRI (fMRI) studies of brain activation. Typically, patients and volunteer subjects will be provided earplugs to wear during fMRI. However, these may impair vocal communication with staff members and also the perception of study stimuli. The acoustic noise associated with fMRI procedures can often be comparatively loud, as the use of fast acquisition sequences (e.g., echo planar imaging, EPI) are normally used. Acoustic noise can often lead to motion-related artifacts and degraded image quality. Furthermore, acoustic noise has been reported to interfere with auditory functional studies,</para>

    <para>and more broadly, with cross modal neural activity (10-14). A summary of the potential issues related to the acoustic noise that is associated with MRI is shown in Table 1.</para>
    <para>MR system-related acoustic noise will interfere with the communication of activation task instructions that often must be provided during scanning. One area of particular interest is the study of auditory and language function (13). In this work, the response to pure tone stimuli is analyzed. Therefore, any background levels of unwanted or uncontrolled acoustic noise can interfere with the delivery of these sound stimuli and affect experimental integrity. Solutions specific to controlling acoustic noise exposure during fMRI are generally sequence-related and a full discussion of this topic is presented later in this chapter.</para>
    <para>Acoustic noise levels during echo planar imaging have been reported to significantly increase pure tone hearing thresholds in the optimal frequency hearing range (0- to 8-kHz) (15). These effects vary across the frequency range and the threshold changes depend on the characteristics of the sequence-generated acoustic noise. It may be possible to take into account, or adjust for, the MR system-induced auditory activation by using a control series</para>

    <para>of scans during task paradigms. Results have been reported on mapping auditory activation induced by MR system-induced acoustic noise (16).</para>
    <para>The problem of acoustic noise may also have implications for the operational costs of an MRI facility. Notably, there can be a potential decrease in image quality due to patient movement resulting from the patient being startled or uncomfortable in association with acoustic noise. This may add to the need to repeat scans or to interrupt studies that can adversely impact the efficiency of an MRI facility. For all the above reasons, it is important that the MRI-related acoustic noise is quantified and characterized as part of a safety and quality assurance program. Furthermore, any exposure to acoustic noise that is excessive must be controlled or alleviated.</para>
    <para>Acoustic noise experienced during routine clinical MRI examinations can generally be confined to levels within permissible limits with relatively little effort by using passive hearing protection (e.g., disposable earplugs). Several more sophisticated methods are also under investigation by researchers, offering more comprehensive and elegant solutions without the disadvantages of passive methods. This chapter will discuss acoustic noise and hearing, describe the common characteristics of MRI-related acoustic noise, explain the current permissible levels for acoustic noise, and present the main methods used for measurement and control of this potential hazard.</para>

        <title>ACOUSTIC NOISE AND HEARING</title>
    <para>The ear is a highly sensitive wide-band receiver, with the typical frequency range of 2-Hz to 20-kHz for normal hearing (17). The arrival of sound waves at the ear sets up a fluctuating pressure just outside the entrance to the external auditory canal. These fluctuations are then transmitted as pressure waves along the auditory canal. Normally under slight tension, the eardrum, or tympanic membrane, is physically moved by these pressure waves.</para>
    <para>On the other side of the membrane, three tiny bones known as the ossicles, transmit this movement across the middle ear cavity to another membrane, the oval window, which forms the end of the spiral-shaped, fluid-filled cochlea. The vibration of the membrane and hair cells in the cochlea is transformed, via the auditory nerve, to give a sense of hearing. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> shows the main components of the hearing mechanism.</para>
    <para>At high sound intensities, the muscles that control the motion of the ossicles alter their tension creating the acoustic reflex to protect the ear from damage. However, this reflex occurs approximately 0.5-milliseconds after the insult, such that the ear is particularly vulnerable to impact noise of high intensity. The human ear does not tend to discern sound powers in absolute terms, but assesses how much greater one power is than another. Reflecting the very wide range of powers that exist, the logarithmic decibel scale, dB, is used when referring to sound power.</para>
    <para>The sound level that is measured depends not only on the source, but also the environment (e.g., the proximity of surfaces that may reflect sound). Thus, sound levels are usually quoted in terms of sound pressure level (SPL), which accounts for the environment of the measurement. <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> displays a range of sound pressure levels for some typical sources of acoustic noise.</para>

    <para>The sensitivity of the ear is also frequency dependent, as shown is <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> (18). Peak hearing sensitivity occurs in the region of 4-kHz. This is also the region where potential maximum hearing loss will occur, with damage spreading into neighboring frequencies. Since the ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies, measured data may be weighted using the DBA measurement or "A-weighted" scale, which biases the meter to respond similarly to the human ear. The quality, or efficiency of hearing, is defined by the audible threshold, which is the SPL at which one can just begin to detect a sound. This is normally defined as 0 (zero)-dB.</para>
    <para>Acoustic noise is defined in terms of frequency spectrum (measured and indicated in Hz), intensity (indicated in decibels or dB), and duration (or time). Additionally, noise may be steady state, intermittent, impulsive, or explosive. Time-varying noise is reported in terms of L<subscript>eq</subscript>, which is defined as the continuous SPL that contains the same sound energy as the time-varying sound over the measurement period. This can be considered as the average noise level. Stimulation of the ear by acoustic noise has three potential effects: 1) Adaptation, 2) Temporary threshold shift (TTS) (post-stimulation fatigue), and 3) Permanent threshold shift (PTS) (permanent impairment).</para>
    <para>In hearing adaptation, loud sounds cause a small muscle attached to one of the bones of the inner ear to contract. This attenuates the transmission of sound vibration to the inner ear, which is a protective mechanism that does not work well for short duration, very intense sounds. Transient hearing loss may occur following loud noise (&gt;100-dBA), resulting in a temporary threshold shift (i.e., a shift in audible threshold). With a TTS, subjects may experience a dulling in hearing at the end of the noise and tinnitus in some cases. Recovery typically occurs quickly (1). However, full recovery can take up to several weeks if the noise insult is particularly severe. Intense impulsive noises at 650-Hz with cut-offs at 300- and 1-kHz have also been shown to generate substantial TTS (19). Noise above 100-dBA can cause disturbances of the microcirculation in the cortical organ and short impulsive noise at levels of 120- to 130-dBA can lead to mechanical damage in this organ.</para>
    <para>If the noise is sufficiently severe, this may result in a permanent threshold shift at specific frequencies (20, 21). Hearing damage from steady-state noise usually takes the form</para>

    <para>of inner ear damage. That is, destruction of the hair cells that convert acoustic energy to electrical impulses transmitted via the nervous system to the brain. These cells cannot regenerate and, therefore, the damage is irreversible. This damage is similar to age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) in that it progresses slowly, with the affected hearing threshold rising. Mean hearing loss is a function of noise frequency and duration (20). Permanent damage is primarily a risk for prolonged daily exposure to loud (&gt;85-dB) occupational noise or short impulsive noise around 140-dB. Excessive noise is known to be one of the most common causes of hearing loss (20). The risk of hearing damage increases with the noise level, duration of the noise, the number of exposures to the noise, and the susceptibility of the individual (20, 21). Along with sensitive groups, children have a lower threshold for hearing damage and, therefore, restricting exposure levels to around 120-dB or lower is recommended (22). It is generally accepted that exposure to noise levels up to a maximum of 75-dBA will not result in PTS irrespective of the duration of exposure (22). Over the years, several instances of noise-related incidents have been reported in the literature (see below).</para>

        <title>Noise That Is Not Perceived By the Ear Canal</title>
    <para>The ear canal is not the only path for transmission of sound to the cochlea. Sound may be conducted via air and bone conduction, through the ear canal, head, and body. Protection of the ear canal via earplugs will, thus, never lead to silence, due to the remaining sound conduction via the other paths. Sound can be conducted directly to the cochlea, to the middle ear and then to the cochlea, or through the walls of the middle ear, along the ear canal to the middle ear, and then to the cochlea (23). When the ear canal is relatively unprotected, this path will be the dominant one for perception of sound. However, as noise is attenuated along the ear canal, the other paths become increasingly dominant and further hearing protection measures will have little effect on the residual noise. Using a helmet in addition to conventional earplugs and "defenders", Ravicz and Melcher, (24) studied the impact of isolating the head and ear canal from sound. Isolating the head enabled the original noise attenuation of 39- to 41-dB to increase to 55- to 63-dB.</para>

        <title>Prenatal and Neonatal Hearing and Acoustic Noise</title>
    <para>By around the twentieth week of gestation, the outer, middle, and inner ear of the fetus appear to be fully formed. The fetus can then begin to detect sounds (25). Indeed, Hepper and Shahidullah, (26) reported that the responsiveness of the fetus to audio stimuli occurs between 19 to 35 weeks, with initial responses being to sounds at low frequencies. They measured an initial response at 20 weeks to a 500-Hz pure tone. As the pregnancy progressed, there was a significant reduction (20- to 30-dB) in the intensity of sound required to elicit a response. Studies report that maternal tissues and fluid surrounding the fetal head act as efficient low-pass filters for sound (27-31).</para>
    <para>Acoustic noise is known to be a concern for neonates who generally have sensitive hearing. Aside from artifacts introduced from involuntary motion related to startle reflexes, the noise can provoke adverse responses such as autonomic instability (32-36). Neonatal intensive care unit guidelines often suggest minimizing the risk of physiological stress by adhering to a limit for exposure to acoustic noise (see below).</para>

        <title>CHARACTERISTICS OF MRI-RELATED ACOUSTIC NOISE</title>
    <para>Early measurements of MRI-related acoustic noise offered little more than an assessment of intensity levels. Over time, researchers began to investigate the noise in more detail and to characterize it in terms of frequency components, variability with pulse sequences, and the contribution of individual gradients.</para>
    <para>The gradient magnetic field of the MR system is the primary source of acoustic noise associated with MRI. This noise occurs during the rapid alterations of currents within the gradient coils. These currents, in the presence of the strong static magnetic field of the MR system, produce significant (Lorentz) forces that act upon the gradient coils. From basic physics, a conductor element dl carrying a current I = I <emphasis role="bold">j</emphasis> placed into a magnetic uniform field <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> = B <emphasis role="bold">k</emphasis>, will experience a Lorentz force F per unit length given by,</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">F</emphasis> = <emphasis role="italics">I</emphasis> × <emphasis role="italics">B</emphasis> = <emphasis role="italics">jBI</emphasis> sin <emphasis role="italics">θ</emphasis>                    (1)</para>
    <para>where θ is the angle between the conductor and the field direction and <emphasis role="italics">i</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">j</emphasis> <emphasis role="italics">k</emphasis> are unit vectors along the conductor, force, and magnetic field direction, respectively. Therefore, simplistically we would expect acoustic noise to be theoretically linear with the static magnetic field of the MR system (37). In fact, Moelker, et al. (38) reported on a measured nonlinearity, with noise levels measured at high field being lower than that expected with a linear dependence The noise from these mechanical forces is then transformed into airborne acoustic noise or sound pressure, due to an acoustic noise transfer function (38).</para>
    <para>Acoustic noise, manifested as loud tapping, knocking, and other sounds is produced when the forces cause motion or vibration of the gradient coils as they impact against their mountings, which then also flex and vibrate. All structures have intrinsic resonance frequencies and these frequencies have their own modal shapes. In fact, there are several pathways of noise generation associated with MRI (40).</para>
    <para>If the gradient coil modal shape due to deformation corresponds to the shape of the exciting Lorentz force distribution, then large gradient coil displacements occur and result in the generation of significant acoustic noise. Current designs of gradient coils are often manufactured to have a high stiffness, which minimizes coil motion and, thus, the structural resonances of the coils.</para>
    <para>Various factors have been shown to affect the acoustic noise generated during MRI, including the strength of the static magnetic field (mentioned above) and alteration of the gradient output (i.e., rise time and amplitude). Interestingly, Price, et al. (39) reported that there is greater impact on acoustic noise levels generated from imaging parameters than the field strength. Acoustic noise is enhanced by decreases in section thickness, field of view, repetition time, and echo time. The physical features of the MR system and its environment as well as the material and construction of the gradient coils and support structures also affect the transmission of the acoustic noise and its perception by the patient and MR system operators.</para>

        <title>Acoustic Noise Associated With MRI Procedures</title>
    <para>Gradient magnetic field-induced noise levels have been measured during a variety of pulse sequences for clinical and research MR systems with static magnetic field strengths ranging from 0.35- to 4-T, with acoustic noise levels of over 130-dB reported (39-54). Obviously, since the gradient magnetic field is primarily responsible for acoustic noise, the ability of the MR system to produce noise is dependent upon the specifications for the gradients (amplitudes and slew rates) as well as the types of imaging parameters that are available on the scanner.</para>
    <para>Not surprisingly, fast gradient echo pulse sequences produce, comparatively, louder noise during MRI than spin echo sequences. Three-dimensional and diffusion MR pulse sequences, where multiple gradients are applied simultaneously, are among the loudest. Many studies have focused on assessing the maximum MR system acoustic noise, which is usually related to using EPI methods, due to the associated high gradient performance inherent in these ultrafast sequences. Echo planar sequences, in collecting a complete image in one radiofrequency (RF) excitation of the spin system, require extremely fast gradient switching times and high gradient amplitudes. The increased interest in diffusion imaging and fMRI has meant a heightened interest in using high field strength MR systems (i.e., mostly 3-, 4-, and 7-T) with fast gradient capability (switching rates and high amplitudes) to acquire multi-slice, EPI images of high quality (see below for more on high field issues).</para>
    <para>Shellock, et al. (43) reported relatively high levels of acoustic noise, up to 102- to 103-dBA on the two 1.5-T MR systems tested when running EPI sequences with parameters selected to represent a "worst-case" protocol. Nevertheless, these acoustic noise levels were within current permissible limits for MR systems. Miyati, et al. (50) conducted an extensive survey of EPI sequences performed on eleven MR systems. The results of the sound level measurements reported to be at levels within permissible limits.</para>
    <para>Price, et al. (39) surveyed fifteen MR scanners, with static magnetic field strengths from 0.2-T to 3-T, reporting worst case noise levels in the range 82.5- to 118.3-dBA, but for two-dimensional MRI techniques, only. They reported the lowest noise levels for the lowest static field strength scanner and the highest noise recorded for the highest field strength scanner, but noted low levels of acoustic noise recorded for a 1.5-T scanner fitted with vacuum-encased gradient coils. Higher acoustic noise levels have been reported by Ravicz, et al. (52) (up to 138-dB for 3-T) and More, et al. (53) (130-dB for 4-T).</para>
    <para>Foster, et al. (54) reported EPI-related acoustic noise levels of 123- to 132-dBA for a 3-T research scanner. Since EPI sequences are significantly shorter in duration than conventional sequences, in terms of acoustic noise exposure, higher sound exposure levels are possible for the shorter times involved. However, these levels, when converted to eight hour equivalent values (L<subscript>eq</subscript> = 108-dBA), are higher than the limits for occupational acoustic noise exposure used in the United Kingdom (UK) and in the United States (U.S.). Therefore, hearing protection must be used for patients undergoing MRI procedures under these circumstances. Conventional EPI sequences generally comprise constant readout gradients and a train of very short high level trapezoidal phase encode gradient 'blips'. It is not surprising that the blipped gradient contributes the larger proportion of the sequence-related acoustic noise (55). As the gradient blips are at higher frequency than the readout gradient, the resultant acoustic noise will have a larger proportion of high frequencies.</para>

    <para>Measurements of sound pressure levels offer a limited amount of information with regard to the quality of the noise and its impact on hearing. In addition to measurements of noise level, several groups have recorded and analyzed the acoustic noise. Similar noise levels and characteristics are found when comparing different clinical MR systems. Frequency analysis of the noise shows that noise is pseudo-periodic, with variations in the degree of periodicity depending on the pulse sequence used and the vibrational characteristics of the gradient coils (46).</para>
    <para>For conventional pulse sequences used for MRI, peak noise levels are found at the low frequency region of the spectra. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis> shows an example of the octave band spectra for a 1.0-T and 1.5-T MR systems (44, 45). Spectral peaks in the sound levels were found in the range of 0.2- to 1.5-kHz (22). Cho, et al. (48) have also reported that pre-scan noise generated high levels (100-dB, C-weighted scale) across a wide spectral range up to 4-kHz with peaks around 2.4-kHz.</para>
    <para>More, et al. (53) noted that repetition time (TR) had a minimal impact on overall SPL, while increasing the echo time (TE) increased attenuation, in agreement with Price, et al. (39). Unlike the use of conventional sequences, EPI-related sound levels have been reported to contain a larger fraction of high frequency noise (around 4-kHz) with most noise comprising the fundamental frequency and harmonics in the frequency range of 0.5- to 4-kHz (52). For EPI sequences, More, et al. (53) also noted considerable non-harmonic noise flanking the harmonics. The acoustic noise was also noted to contain a higher proportion of broad frequency spectrum noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). For their pulse sequence, More, et al. (53) found the even harmonics to be associated with the phase-encoding gradient, the frequency encoding gradient generated the odd harmonics and non-harmonic acoustic noise, while the slice-selective gradients generated the broad spectrum noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>).</para>

    <para>In addition to the dependence on pulse sequence parameters, MR system hardware and construction, acoustic noise is dependent on the immediate environment. Spatially, the acoustic noise will vary along the bore of the scanner. However, how it varies will depend on the MR system's structure and design. Price, et al. (39) presents acoustic noise measurements across a range of scanner geometries and designs, systems ranging from static magnetic field strengths of 0.2 to 3-T. Reports providing values of acoustic noise tend to disagree because of differences related to whether the maximum acoustic noise levels were measured at the isocenter of the bore or not (39, 47, 49). The noise distributions along radial and axial directions are also likely to be asymmetric, due to standing wave effects in the scanner's bore (53).</para>
    <para>Furthermore, noise levels have been found to vary by as much as 10-dB as a function of the patient's position inside the MR system (47) such that the presence and size of the patient affects the level of acoustic noise. For example, an increase of 1- to 3-dB has been measured with a patient present inside of the MR system (47), which may be due to pressure doubling (i.e., the increase in sound pressure close to a solid object, caused when sound waves reflect and undergo in-phase enhancement).</para>

Interestingly, research is on-going for possible human scanning using MR systems operating up to 20-T (56). As mentioned above, knowing that there is a strong (non-linear) dependence between the acoustic noise levels that are generated and the strength of the static magnetic field (38), we might expect acoustic noise levels to</para>

When increasing the static magnetic field strength from 1.5-T to 11.7-T, a simple linear model predicts an increase in the acoustic noise level by approximately 22-dB. But, in fact, in line with earlier results (38), this has not been observed in practice (57). Applying a logarithmic scale, changing from 7-T to 20-T, a 9-dB increase in acoustic noise level would be predicted. However, building in additional effects such as Lorentz damping (58), results in increases in acoustic noise levels that are actually lower than expected, and in some cases very similar to reported noise levels at 3-T (59-60).</para>
    <para>Notably, one practical difference (61) is that head coils at 7-T are generally more tightly fitting that those used at 3-T because they are comprise of a multi-channel insert. This makes using double passive hearing protection (earplugs and earmuffs) impractical and, thus, the acoustic noise is only attenuated by earplugs alone.</para>
    <para>Presently, findings obtained at 7-T remain sparse (61-64). Costagli, et al.

The simulation was based on finite element (FE) analysis. Acoustic frequency responses predicted by the simulation were compared to experimental measures, showing broad agreement. Further reports investigated experiments and simulation of purpose-built gradient coils, including vibration and acoustic noise measurements (68, 69).

        <title>ACOUSTIC NOISE LEVELS AND PERMISSIBLE LIMITS</title>
    <para>Several of the available guidance documents discussed below adopt a similar framework, referring back to the same source for action levels and permissible limits. Much of the international guidance is based on occupational exposure limits that assume chronic exposures. These are not entirely satisfactory for application to patient exposures associated with MRI, which can be short but with potentially intense noise, causing discomfort. When time-averaged, these types of exposures can fall below action levels but still present a hazard. For normal individuals, the typical threshold for discomfort related to acoustic noise is approximately 120-dB in the 1- to 5-kHz range (78), however, those with particular sensitivity can experience discomfort at much lower acoustic noise levels (79).</para>
    <para>For acoustic noise exposure involving <emphasis role="bold">staff members</emphasis>, the current UK occupational guidelines are based on the Control of Noise at Work legislation, published in 2005 (80). This document sets out the responsibilities of the employer and makes a number of recommendations based on a small set of action levels. Acoustic noise is graded to that which is below 80-dBA, a lower action level at 80-dBA daily or weekly exposure (peak 135-dBC), and upper action level at 85-dBA daily or weekly exposure (peak 135-dBC). It should be noted that values for lower and upper action levels have been reduced by 5-dBA, compared to previous Noise at Work action levels published in 1989. This document also recommends that hearing protection should be available for all staff members, and that its use be mandatory for noise above the upper action level. For MRI healthcare workers, there is generally little need to be in the MR system room during scanning. Because the acoustic noise levels that exist outside the scanner's bore are relatively low, the risks are similarly low.</para>

    <para>The management of exposure to acoustic noise for the <emphasis role="bold">general public</emphasis> is covered by the Management of Health and Safety at Work (1999) (81), but, since the general public does not have access to the controlled area or MR system room, again, the risks are low. European guidance is published as directive 2013/35/EU (82) and has similar limits and action levels to those in the U.K.</para>
    <para>In the United States (U.S.), occupational limits are mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA) (83) and have also been adopted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (84). OSHA guidance is geared towards traditional 'heavy' industries where there are very noisy environments and medium-to-high risk to hearing. Their list of affected industries does not include MRI/Healthcare. Now somewhat outdated, the OSHA guidelines apply to a slightly raised action level of 90-dBA (daily or eight-hour average) in line with the older UK guidance (85).</para>
    <para>Current UK guidance on noise exposure limits for MRI <emphasis role="bold">patients and volunteer subjects</emphasis> (including staff members) is presented in the MHRA guidelines (86). For patients and volunteer subjects, it suggests hearing protection should always be offered unless noise levels are proven to be below 80-dBA. Hearing protection should reduce levels at the ear to below 85-dBA. The recommended action levels are based on the noise at work regulations (72) and are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis>. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) (87, 88) notes the range of guidance from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) (89), but accepts the need for a conservative approach to protect vulnerable patient groups, also recommending the MHRA action levels. The MHRA document shows the relationship between the acoustic noise level and time necessary to reach the daily action level (86) (<emphasis role="bold">Table 3</emphasis>). Recommendations for acoustic noise and hearing protection are, as follows (86):</para>

    <para>In the U.S., various patient exposure guidelines related to the MRI environment were initially recommended in a document issued by the American College of Radiology in 2002 (90) and this was updated in 2013 (91). The ACR document makes little mention of the risks associated with acoustic noise, however, it does recommend that all patients should be offered hearing protection and that this is mandatory for those undergoing MRI procedures using research pulse sequences.</para>
    <para>While the acoustic noise levels suggested for patients exposed during MRI examinations on an infrequent and short-term temporal basis are considered to be highly conservative, they may not be appropriate for individuals with underlying health problems who may be sensitive to noise at certain levels or at particular frequencies.</para>
    <para>Overall, the acoustic noise produced during MRI on a modern-day scanner should represent a minimal risk to patients if good quality hearing protection is used. However, the possibility exists that substantial gradient magnetic field-induced noise may represent a heightened risk in certain patients who are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of loud noises or for those with poorly fitting hearing protection. In fact, there have been unconfirmed claims of permanent hearing loss associated with MRI examinations (9). Therefore, vigilance and care is essential when controlling noise levels associated with MR procedures.</para>

        <title>Limits During Pregnancy and Neonatal Imaging</title>
    <para>Due to lack of data and a full understanding of response, UK guidance (86) suggests a cautious approach to scanning the fetus and pregnant patients. Scanning during the first trimester is discouraged unless justified by a critical risk assessment. Because acoustic noise is known to be a concern for neonates who have sensitive hearing, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) guidelines suggest minimizing the risk of physiological stress by adhering to a limit for noise exposure to 65-dBA (92).</para>
    <para>Fetal MRI has become increasingly important, particularly in diagnosis of fetal abnormalities and for the management of the mother. Although discouraged, if necessary MRI procedures may be performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. In a survey conducted by De Wilde, et al. (93), 83% of the clinics that responded suggested that they would scan patients during the first trimester in cases of clinical need. While the mother may wear hearing protection, the fetus is protected only by the attenuation provided by the intra-uterine fluid and the maternal abdomen. Thus acoustic noise has the ability to impact the fetus (94). To minimize motion-related artifacts, fast imaging techniques are required for fetal MRI examinations, which results in the potential for exposures to comparatively high levels of acoustic noise. Glover, et al. (95) investigated acoustic noise absorption through the ab-</para>
    <para>domen using a hydrophone in the stomach of a (male) volunteer. For scans performed at 0.5-T, these researchers reported a reduction of approximately 30-dB in acoustic noise levels. However, this study was a very limited approximation to scanning a pregnant patient and the associated sound absorption. The strength of the static magnetic field of the MR system, which directly affects acoustic noise levels generated, was also low (0.5-T) compared to the majority of clinical scanners in current use. Certain research has reported high frequency hearing loss, shortened gestation, and decreased birth weight following exposure to high levels of acoustic noise (&gt;99-dBA) (96).</para>
    <para>To investigate this particular safety issue, there have been a number of follow-up studies (97-106). For example, Reeves, et al. (97) investigated the rates of cochlear impairment for a cohort of second and third trimester neonates who had been exposed to acoustic noise during 1.5-T MRI examinations. Their data showed no association between exposure to noise and an increased risk of hearing impairment. General guidelines for managing exposure to acoustic noise produced by the United Kingdom (UK), Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (86) and based on evidence in several reports (98-100) suggest that the data on the effects of noise on the health of the fetus is inconclusive.</para>
    <para>Bouissant-Kobar, et al. (101) followed-up (i.e., at approximately 24 months) on a cohort of 72 pre-school children scanned at 1.5-T during their mothers' pregnancies (mean gestational age at scanning, 30 weeks). All children were born at term and achieved age-appropriate scores in the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS) tests. In addition, all study subjects passed their new-born otoacoustic tests and demonstrated normal hearing at preschool age. These findings confirmed a lack of MRI-related impact on functional outcomes or hearing impairment at pre-school age. De vita, et al. (102) and Jaimes, et al. (103) investigated the effects of higher field strength scanning on pre-terms (4.7-T and 3-T, respectiv). Both groups noted no increase in risks in moving to a higher field strength MR system. Clements, et al. (104) report similar normal findings, in this case for a smaller cohort (20 cases) whose mothers had been exposed to echo planar imaging (EPI) at 0.5-T four times between 20 weeks and term. Thus, the current data appears to provide general reassurance in that there is low risk present when applying MRI in prenatal and neonatal patients (101-106). An optimized solution for neonatal imaging with clear benefits was reported by Tkach, et al. (107, 108). This group scanned 15 non-sedated neonates in an adapted small-bore (diameter 22- cm) 1.5 -T orthopedic MR system. Although the scanner has approximately twice the gradient strength (70-mT/m) and slew rate (300-mT/m/s) of conventional fullsize MR systems, the gradient coil was smaller and shorter, leading to lower levels of acoustic noise or equivalent pulse sequences (107). Using specifically designed hearing protection, high quality images were obtained for and all MRI examinations that were completed successfully, suggesting minimal impact of the acoustic noise. Of further note is that De Vita, et al. (102) reported successful imaging of nine ventilated neonates at 4.7-T without any acute adverse effects.</para>
    <para>Overall, the use of a combination of hearing protection (e.g., earplugs and earmuffs or headphones) and the additional attenuation of having the neonate placed inside the transmit RF coil, mean that the acoustic noise at the ear is likely to be lower for neonates than for adults, which may explain why no adverse effects have been reported, to date. The anatom-</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Adverse Incidents Associated with Exposure to MRI-Related Acoustic Noise</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(A) Temporary Threshold Shifts (TTS)</emphasis></para>
    <para>As mentioned above, short-term exposure to intense noise (&gt;100-dBA) can induce a temporary shift in the hearing threshold. Brummett, et al. (1) reported temporary shifts in hearing thresholds in 43% of the patients scanned without hearing protection or with improperly fitted earplugs. Normal hearing returned after 15-minutes. Notably, noise levels during scanning were not measured as part of their study. However, Hurwitz, et al. (42) made measurements using the same scanner, reporting values for gradient echo sequences (likely to be some of the loudest sequences on this system) of around 93-dBA. Of the 14 patients scanned without hearing protection in their study, six suffered TTS with threshold loss greater than 15-dB. For those using hearing protection, only one experienced a TTS. It should be noted that these data were associated with scans performed on a comparatively low field strength MR system (0.35-T). A study by Wagner, et al. (109), found conflicting results.</para>
    <para>Ulmer, et al. (16) measured changes in pure tone thresholds in volunteer subjects wearing hearing protection exposed to EPI pulse sequences. Intense impulse noise at 0.65-kHz with cut-offs at 0.3-kHz and 1.0-kHz were also shown to generate substantial hearing threshold shifts. In 2011, Govindaraju, et al. (110) reported a possible incidence of TTS for a man scanned while wearing earplugs on a 3-T scanner. The patient experienced unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus immediately following the MRI examination. The hearing loss resolved completely within 24-hours but the tinnitus persisted. Acoustic noise levels were checked for the conventional sequences that were performed and found to be in the range of L<subscript>eq</subscript> 101- to 112-dBA (L<subscript>peak</subscript> 115- to 124-dB).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(B) Permanent Threshold Shifts (PTS)</emphasis></para>
    <para>If the noise exposure at intense levels is prolonged, or repeated in close time intervals, threshold shifts can be permanent. The threshold for permanent hearing damage is approximately 140-dB for short impulsive noise and around 85-dB for chronic exposure. Commercial MR systems that are designed to be compliant with IEC standards are not able to generate noise in excess of 140-dB (89). De Wilde, et al. (9) reported one case of excessive acoustic noise that occurred in the United Kingdom. The patient reported severe headaches, dizziness, and ear pain following the MRI examination. Importantly, this patient was not provided hearing protection because the manager of the MRI site was confident that the noise levels generated by the 0.5-T MR system were not at a level of concern.</para>

    <para>Controlling acoustic noise is generally accomplished in one of three simple ways: control of noise at the receiver (e.g., using earplugs, or anti-noise interference), control along the path of the noise, or control of the noise at the source (e.g., redesigned gradients, or</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Passive Hearing Protection</emphasis></para>
    <para>The simplest, most convenient, and least expensive means of preventing problems associated with acoustic noise during MRI procedures is to use disposable earplugs and/or headphones. Earplugs, when properly fitted can abate noise by 10- to 30-dB (depending on the frequency), which is usually an adequate amount of sound attenuation for the MRI environment. Figure 8 shows examples of the octave band spectra of some commercially available earplugs and other hearing protection devices, demonstrating typical noise attenuation values. The use of earmuffs, headphones, or disposable earplugs has been shown to provide a sufficient decrease in acoustic noise that, in turn, would be capable of preventing the potential temporary hearing loss associated with MRI procedures (1).</para>
    <para>The level and frequency range of noise attenuation will vary with the type and design of hearing protection that is utilized. If data is unavailable for the noise abatement device, the protector should be tested. Since the designs of hearing protectors do vary, care should be taken when offering these to patients. Additionally, proper fitting instructions must be provided. A patient who may be confused, young, or have difficulty in correctly fitting the hearing protection may need additional assistance to prevent poorly fitting the device and having compromised noise attenuation. If using earmuffs or headphones, these should be</para>
    <para>regularly assessed for wear to the seals and replaced, as needed. Current guidelines suggest staff members should have training in the selection and fitting of hearing protection (86).</para>
    <para>Unfortunately, earplugs, earmuffs, and headphones suffer from a number of problems. These devices tend to hamper verbal communication with the patient during the operation of the MR system. In certain circumstances, these devices can also create discomfort or impair immobilization of the patient's head, which is problematic when optimal immobilization is required for certain studies that are particularly sensitive to patient movement (e.g., diffusion and phase-sensitive studies).</para>
    <para>Standard foam-based earplugs are often too large for the ear canal of infants. Some small sizes are available from certain MRI accessory companies, although snug fit is essential if acoustic noise is to be efficiently attenuated. Neonates present a particular challenge when trying to use conventional earplugs or other similar devices. Nordell, et al. (111) reported on a patient-independent device constructed from absorbent padding, which can be placed over the neonate during the MRI examination. Reductions in peak noise levels of 16- to 22-dBA averaged over the hearing spectrum of 4- to 13-dBA were reported. Specially-designed small earplugs or earmuffs (e.g. MiniMuffs Neonatal Noise Attenuators, Natus Newborn Care, www.newborncare.natus.com) can be used in these cases.</para>
    <para>Passive devices used for hearing protection may attenuate noise non-uniformly over the hearing range. While high frequency sound may be well attenuated, attenuation can be poor at low frequency. This is unfortunate because the low frequency range is also where the peak in MRI-related acoustic noise is often generated, however, this may be balanced by the lower hearing sensitivity also in this frequency range (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>Passive protection devices will also offer poor attenuation of noise transmitted to the patient through bone conduction (112). The effect of vibration being conducted during MRI and affecting noise has been reported by Glover, et al. (95). The presence of an insulating foam mattress on the patient couch has been found to reduce vibrational coupling to the patient and noise levels by around 10-dB. This underlying bone conduction transmission path puts a practical attenuation limit for passive protection at around 40-dB (113). As previously indicated, Ravicz and Melcher (24) studied the potential for isolating the body from the MR system using a helmet to minimize acoustic noise transmission via bone conduction. They used passive hearing protection in combination with the helmet system. Adding protection, they reported a total noise attenuation of 55- to 63-dB, by using a combination of earplugs (25- to 28-dB alone), ear defenders (i.e., headphones) (39- to 41-dB alone), and an isolating helmet. While the use of a helmet may suit research studies with volunteer subjects, it may not be clinically acceptable for use in patients. However, in general, earplugs and ear defenders can also be used effectively, offering added hearing protection for patients undergoing MRI examinations.</para>

    <para>The loudspeaker producing this anti-phase noise can be built into the scanner bore or built into a pair of headphones for the patient (thus, harnessing passive protection as well). A major disadvantage of this technique is that, if it performs poorly at certain frequencies or in some spatial regions, noise levels may be enhanced rather than attenuated by the superposition of the additional anti-noise.</para>
    <para>Controlling acoustic noise from a particular source by introducing anti-phase noise to interfere destructively with the noise source is by no means a new idea (116, 117) (Figure 9). For use in the MRI environment, conventional active-noise control (ANC) systems require some modification. Notably, loudspeakers and microphones designed to be utilized in the MRI setting must be used to acquire scanner noise and to transmit control anti-noise and, secondly, the ANC controller must be optimized and synchronized to the scanner.</para>
    <para>The initial results for the use of anti-noise applied to MRI achieved only modest noise attenuation. Goldman, et al. (41) acquired MR system noise with a microphone, performed a Fourier transform (FT) of the noise, and generated control noise by inverting the phase of the major components of the FT, and then transmitted this anti-noise through a loudspeaker built into a set of headphones (i.e., a combination active-passive system), achieving an average noise reduction of around 14-dB. The performance of this system was not much better than that of some standard passive headphones, alone, in the low frequency region of the hearing range. The control sound was delivered using long tubes, introducing a time delay, which limited control efficiency.</para>

          <title>178    Acoustic Noise Associated With MRI Procedures</title>
    <para>Advances in digital signal processing (DSP) technology permit efficient modern ANC systems to be realized at a modest cost (118). The essence of an anti-noise system involves either a continuous feed-forward or feedback loop with continuous sampling of the ambient in the noise environment so that the gradient magnetic field-induced noise is attenuated. Thus, it is possible to attenuate the pseudo-periodic MR system-related noise while allowing the transmission of vocal communication or music to be maintained. The feedback loop uses a sampling microphone placed close to the ear, where noise reduction is required. It will attempt to attenuate all noise propagating into the ear. A feed-forward algorithm uses a sampling microphone close to the problematic noise source, offering a potentially more selective cancellation of noise source. Frequently, time limitations in anti-noise getting from the loudspeaker to the subject as well as stability requirements set a practical upper frequency limit for ANC systems. This problem of poorer high frequency attenuation performance is mitigated by building the systems into complementary passive ear defenders, resulting in a better broad frequency noise reduction.</para>
    <para>Similar to Goldman, et al. (41), commercial manufacturers have offered ANC systems based on delivering anti-noise to patient headphones (42), however, the long tubing imposes a time delay in getting noise to the ear, limiting the performance of such a system. In 1995, Pla, et al. (119) reported improved results using a system based on an x-filtered least mean squares (LMS) algorithm, driving piezoelectric speakers near the patient's ears. These researchers achieved noise attenuation up to 25-dB for frequencies below 1.2-kHz and for the first few harmonics only. In 1997, McJury, et al. (114) reported on the performance of a multichannel filtered U-least mean squares algorithm for acoustic noise control. Acoustic noise was recorded digitally from a series of typical clinical MRI protocols performed on a 1.0-T Siemens Impact. This noise was then replayed through a bench-top adaptive realtime DSP ANC system (Motorola DSP 56001). A typical peak sound attenuation of approximately 30-dB was achieved over the frequency range from 0- to 700-Hz (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>In 1999, Chen, et al. (115) published results using an ANC system based on a modified feedback method with a second order cascaded neural network architecture, with loudspeaker mounted in a headset. For acoustic noise up to 3-kHz, they achieved an average attenuation of 19-dB. This study was also based on recorded scanner noise attenuated with a lab-based ANC system.</para>
    <para>More recently, Chambers, et al. (120) demonstrated improved results over a wide frequency range using an ANC system that was based on an LMS feed-forward algorithm and built into a set of ear defenders (i.e., headphones). From 600-Hz to 4-kHz, peak attenuation of around 40-dB was measured for scanner noise. Importantly, the use of feed-forward methodology allows cancellation of scanner noise with less attenuation of any noise stimuli introduced during the use of fMRI protocols. However, this system did not acquire its reference noise in real-time, but required a recording phase to obtain reference data.</para>
    <para>To date, some of the most successful solutions for acoustic noise reductions were the results from Li, et al. (121) and Lee, et al. (122). Li, et al. (121) reported results with a patented, ANC system based on a feed-forward, x-LMS algorithm that uses multiple reference signals. The ANC system was built into a headset to also benefit from the passive attenuation of noise at higher frequencies. Impressive acoustic noise reductions of up to 55-dB</para>

Their methods of using active vibration control are also transferrable, however, until more recently (40, 125), they received little attention from the MRI community.

However, for a gradient coil driven by FE-EPI, their system comprising only four actuators achieved a more modest averaged vibrational amplitude reduction of 3-dB over the frequency range 0.5- to 1.5-kHz.

    <para>Because the dominant effect of acoustic noise levels is associated with the signal details of a particular MRI protocol rather than the structure of the MR system (47), it follows that it should be possible to reduce the noise level by optimizing the choice of pulse sequence parameters. Simply using a spin echo (SE) sequence rather than a gradient echo (GE) pulse sequence and running the sequence with reduced gradient parameters (i.e., rise-time and amplitude) can significantly reduce the levels of acoustic noise. Skare, et al. (128) designed so-called "quiet" sequences in this way and defined a simple "quietness factor" (QF) as,</para>
    <para>QF = RT<subscript>m</subscript>/RT<subscript>s</subscript>                    (3)</para>

On a 1.5-T MR system, a QF of six resulted in a noise attenuation of 20-dB. This procedure, however, lengthens the echo time (TE), reduces the number of acquisition slices, and results in a longer examination time.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(B) Minimizing the Number of Gradient Echoes</emphasis></para>
    <para>A reduction of acoustic noise levels may also be achieved by reducing the level of gradient pulsing in a pulse sequence (129, 130). A rapid, single-shot, multi-slice imaging technique (i.e., STEAM-Burst) is based on stimulated-echoes without the rapid gradient switching necessary in other single-shot techniques such as echo planar (130). The STEAM-Burst sequence uses a combination of the "Burst" technique (131), involving the application of multiple RF pulses under a constant gradient and subsequent refocusing of the resultant set of echoes, and the STEAM-stimulated echo acquisition mode (132). Limited data on acoustic noise measurements shows peak noise attenuation of 15-dB compared with a similar EPI sequence (130).</para>
    <para>This pulse sequence offers the potential for rapid acquisition of MR images, but it is sensitive to artifacts due to static magnetic field inhomogeneities while generating reduced levels of acoustic noise. The sequence suffers from two main problems. First, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low compared with other rapid imaging techniques. Second, the images acquired at 3-T have an SNR of approximately of 20:1. Thus, these pulse sequences remain more suited to specific research applications than routine use in the clinical MRI setting.</para>

The efficiency of soft gradient pulses.</emphasis> Magnitude spectra are shown (with an arbitrary linear scale) for the sound generated by the readout gradient of a FLASH (i.e., fast gradient echo) pulse sequence. Data was acquired with a linear ramp, 0.5-msec duration (top plot) and sinusoidal ramp duration 4-msec (lower plot). With the sinusoidal ramping, high frequency acoustic components above 500-Hz are severely attenuated (133). Reproduced by permission, Wiley - John Wiley and Son Publishers, NY.</para>
  <para>used in modern reduced acoustic noise sequence optimization and was first suggested by Hennel, (133). Notably, this technique may be applied to minimize the acoustic noise generated by a range of conventional MRI pulse sequences. As mentioned above, it has been shown that the acoustic response of the gradient system to current pulses is linear (47). Thus, the sound generated by a gradient waveform can be derived from a product of the FT of the source input and the frequency response function (FRF) of the gradient system (see Equation 2). If gradient pulses are designed such that their current waveforms contain no frequencies for which the amplitude of the FRF is high, then resultant acoustic noise levels should be minimized (133). The FRF of the gradient system in a 3-T MR system was measured and a very low response noted at low frequencies (below 200-Hz). Frequency components below this threshold should be attenuated in the acoustic spectrum of any pulse sequences.</para>
    <para>In minimizing high frequency components in the gradient pulses, it is possible to avoid or reduce sharp transitions, such as step functions in the waveform, and to replace these with more slowly varying sinusoidal transitions. This may be accomplished by following three simple rules:</para>

With the sinusoidal ramping, high frequency acoustic components above 500-Hz are severely attenuated. Acoustic noise levels, averaged over 1-second, were measured for spin echo and gradient echo sequences as a function of echo time (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>). Good quality MR images may be acquired with sound levels dropping as echo time (TE) increases. At echo times of 30- to 50-msec, good quality images are still possible and acoustic noise levels are below the ambient room noise (i.e., with the air-conditioning running, room sound levels approach 45-dBA). Three main limitations were identified with the initial implementation of this technique, as follows: 1) there was an increased sensitivity of the pulse sequences to vascular flow, 2) the high-speed MRI pulse sequences tended to be unsuitable for clinical applications, and 3) increased voltages by factor of two were needed to produce sinusoidal ramps instead of linear ramps.</para>

In this case, the limitation due to long acquisition times was minimized using interleaved spiral gradient, read-out trajectories. Using</para>
    <para>this pulse sequence with optimized sampling scheme on a 2-T MR system, an average noise reduction of 22-dBA was achieved. The use of sinusoidal gradient waveforms continues to be common (137 - 139).</para>
    <para>An algorithmic approach to sequence optimization involving gradient reshaping has been reported by Heismann, et al. (140). Here, gradient waveforms are smoothed (spline interpolation) and optimized, with the algorithm adapting some sections of the pulse sequence, and leaving others unchanged. This can be successfully applied to conventional imaging sequences (141).</para>
    <para>Rather than re-shaping the waveform, a further method is to revise the sampling of k-space. Spiral scanning was used successfully to substantially reduce acoustic noise (136). Initially, this was used to counteract the long acquisition times resulting from increased (and lower) gradient durations to reduce acoustic noise. Later, this method has been incorporated into highly successful "silent" ultrashort TE methods, and techniques for diffusion-weighted MRI (see below).</para>

    <para>Similar to the slew rate reduction associated with a soft gradient pulse technique, De Zwart, et al. (142) used SENSE parallel imaging techniques to obtain significant reductions in gradient slew rates and achieved reductions in acoustic noise. The use of sensitivity encoding in combination with multi-channel detector arrays allows reduced gradient switching through reduced k-space sampling. Using anther type of MRI sequence (i.e., SENSE), a gradient slew rate reduction was achieved at constant image acquisition time and image spatial resolution. For two-fold SENSE under sampling, the gradient amplitude was reduced to 50% (13-mT/m), and ramp time doubled (360-microseconds), resulting in a slew rate of 37-T/m/sec (a 4-fold reduction in the maximum slew rate). SPL reductions for two scanners were reported: 14-dBA (1.5-T) and 12-dB (3-T).</para>
    <para>Moelker, et al. (143) reported an interesting variant of this approach. This group built a manual controller to reduce gradient slew rates and the associated acoustic noise for use during interventional MRI, where acoustic noise may be particularly unpleasant for staff members, while small degradations to image quality can be tolerated. Their controller allowed a 16-fold reduction in slew rate, with acoustic noise reduced by up to 21-dBA.</para>
    <para>In several more recent optimized sequences, parallel imaging forms a part of the optimization, especially in challenging areas such as fast imaging and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (139, 144).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">(E) Minimizing the MR System Acoustic Response Function</emphasis></para>
    <para>For each separate gradient (x-, y-, and z-gradient), Tomasi, et al. (145) compared the current waveforms and resulting vibrational response. This group demonstrated, that by altering the read-out frequency of the EPI gradient (and, hence, the bandwidth) to avoid known vibrational resonances, significant reductions in acoustic noise could be achieved. Altering the read-out frequency from 720-Hz to 920-Hz resulted in a noise reduction of 12-dB.</para>
    <para>A similar approach was reported by Schmitter, et al. in 2008 (138). These researchers devised the so-called "sEPI" technique, which is a low noise EPI pulse sequence for use with fMRI. This sequence produces a narrow acoustic frequency spectrum by using a sinusoidal read-out gradient waveform with smooth ramps and constant phase encode gradient. By varying the switching frequency of the read-out gradient, this narrow band can be shifted in frequency to match the minima of the scanner frequency response function, avoiding major resonance modes and minimizing acoustic noise. These researchers reported that the average SPL of the standard EPI, 82.5-dBA, was reduced to 61.7-dBA. This sequence did not include optimization of the slice selection gradient, and so this work was extended in 2010 with the introduction of noise-optimized "VERSE" pulses, and a parallel imaging approach.(139). Zapp, et al. (139) further expanded sEPI with the use of parallel imaging. Segbers, et al. (146) and Ott, et al. (147) have also used a combination of methodologies, including frequency-shifting, to avoid acoustic noise resonance modes.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">(F) Ultrashort and Zero TE methods</emphasis></para>
    <para>In recent years, imaging tissues with very short T2 (for example cortical bone or lung) has been improved by the emergence of ultrashort TE (UTE) or zero TE sequences (ZTE) (148, 149). UTE sequences offer effective TE reductions of 10-200 times that offered by more conventional sequences. In ZTE sequences, the readout gradient starts simultaneously with signal excitation (ramping up prior to the excitation pulse), producing an effective TE of zero. Measurement times are short, but acquisition is inherently three dimensional.</para>
    <para>Both these techniques generally involve (non-Cartesian) radial imaging of k-space. TRs are also very short, so there is no need to switch off gradients between excitations, and this lowering of gradient activity results in almost silent sequences. ZTE methods require high-bandwidth excitation, so the specific absorption ratio (SAR) can become an issue, particularly at high field. The wide bandwidth excitation can be achieved either using short hard RF pulses, or by sweeping the frequency of an arbitrary length pulse, the so-called SWIFT technique (150, 151).</para>
    <para>These methods are highly successful in reducing acoustic noise, producing almost silent MR sequences, with sequence noise at the level of ambient levels. Hence, they have generated significant commercial interest, and form the basis of solutions implemented by GE and Siemens.</para>
    <para>GE were early implementers of UTE methods, basing their Silenz<superscript>TM</superscript> product on the RUFIS sequence (152). A prototype Silenz implementation on a 3-T scanner and running neuro sequences, produced acoustic noise levels which were similar to room ambient noise (68.8-dB) (153). Ohlmann-Knaufo, et al. (154) reported on a comparison of the image quality of Silenz T<subscript>1</subscript>-w and T<subscript>2</subscript>-w scans versus non-Silenz versions at 3-T for neuro patients. The Silenz scan quality compared well, with the main drawback being the significantly longer scan times for the T<subscript>1</subscript>-w sequences. Others reported on UTE variants for quiet MR, for fast imaging applications (155, 156).</para>
    <para>Due to the acquisition of signal from free induction decays (FIDs) rather echoes, UTE/ZTE methods are less sensitive to motion. The long readout time can also cause image blurring. Holdsworth, et al. (157) compared Silenz-based and conventional MR angiography</para>
    <para>(MRA) sequences. Silenz-based sequences scored poorly, with only 40% being rated as diagnostic quality.</para>
    <para>A further variant of these methods, is pointwise encoding time reduction with radial acquisition (PETRA) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15</emphasis>)(158). This forms the basis of sequences in the Quiet Suite™ product from Siemens. Reports have assessed silent PETRA sequences for neurological (159) and pediatric applications (160).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">(G) Using Gradient Cancellation Pulses</emphasis></para>
    <para>Some researchers proposed a technique involving additional "follow-up" gradient pulses, to cancel the initial pulses that would generate unwanted acoustic noise. This is effectively a type of an anti-noise approach, using anti-phase gradients instead of anti-phase acoustic noise (161, 162). There is, in effect, a change to the gradient input function, such that initial impulsive forces generated by the gradients are cancelled by subsequent counter impulsive forces, minimizing the potential for the generation of acoustic noise. These ideas can be seen as an extension of the initial observations of the acoustic noise characteristics of trapezoidal gradient pulses as reported by Wu, et al. (163). Shou, et al. (162) demonstrated that follow-on trapezoidal gradient pulses can cancel two frequencies and their harmonics. The initial studies from this group showed that a significant noise reduction was possible (around 13-dB) when cancelling at least three of the dominant acoustic noise spectral peaks.</para>

The gradient coil had a maximum gradient strength of 21-mT/m and slew rate of 200-mT/m/ms. Using a combination of single and double follow-on trapezoidal gradient pulses, Segbers, et al. (146) managed to suppress several of the main acoustic noise spectral frequencies and achieved a maximum noise reduction of 12-dB.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">(H) Application-Specific Methods</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">1) fMRI Methods.</emphasis> As mentioned above, MRI-related acoustic noise can interfere with the presentation and processing of functional stimuli and generate blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)-related contrast in the auditory cortex. Passive hearing protection may not offer sufficiently quiet conditions for psychological studies of hearing (164). Unfortunately, residual noise can often be loud enough to mask the perception of experimental sound stimuli (11). Due the inherent requirement for ultrafast image acquisition, quiet MRI sequences employing shallow gradient ramps or soft gradient pulses frequently cannot easily be applied to fMRI without compromising data quality. Marcar, et al. (165) modified a fMRI acquisition using soft gradient pulses (133 ) at 2-T. In achieving a silent sequence, the time penalty results in a 24 sec acquisition time for a set of 4 slices. Rather than using the approach of Hennel, et al. (133), using sinusoidal readout gradient switching and continuous phase gradients is popular and effective (139, 166). It is common to manage these issues using different types of sequence-related solutions: (1) sparse imaging (167-169) and (2) using event-related strategies (170).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">i) Modified Block Designs for fMRI.</emphasis> These sequences (also called clustered volume acquisition, flat ear design, sparse, and behavior interleaved gradients), involve using a TR that is longer that the acquisition time, allowing time for interleaving short (1- to 4-seconds) silent gaps within fMRI sequences. In the brain, the peak hemodynamic response to noise occurs after a time delay of around 5-seconds following stimulation. Knowing this, it is possible to present stimuli in these silent gaps where the scanner is silent and then to acquire the subsequent images when the peak response will occur. This cycle is then repeated for the entire block. The duration of the gap is dependent on the number of slices acquired and the repetition time (TR) used. Therefore, care is needed to avoid extending the sequence length, which can have penalties in terms of patient motion and image quality. An underlying assumption is also made with simple modified block designs, that any BOLD response to scanner noise during acquisition will apply equally when stimulus is on and when it is off. Optimization of the block design involves two additional criteria. If the silent gap is extended to 9- to 10-seconds, enough time will have elapsed to allow any hemodynamic response produced by the previous acquisition to return to baseline. Sampling of any BOLD signal relating to acoustic noise from the previous acquisition will then be minimized. Lastly, keeping the acquisition time under 2-seconds will prevent measurement of any hemodynamic response (HR) from the current acquisition.</para>
    <para>Interleaved silent steady-state imaging (ISSSS) (171) is a popular variation of sparse imaging. This sequence uses continuous excitation pulses (which maintain a steady state longitudinal magnetization) and variable readout gradients. Like sparse imaging, stimuli are presented in the quiet gaps, but longer data acquisition is used for multiple volumes, improving the sequence temporal resolution. As the data sampling rate is not consistent, it can be challenging to analyze ISSSS data. Andoh, et al. (172) reported encouraging results with a comparison of a resting-state version of ISSSS and conventional resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI).</para>

When scanner HR has dissipated, baseline sampling then occurs. The speed of data collection directly determines study data quality and the repetition time should be kept to a minimum. This type of sequence typically allows one measurement every 20-seconds (173).</para>

    <para>Arguably the best, if not the most technically challenging, solution to minimize acoustic noise is to eliminate the noise at the source by designing a "quiet" gradient coil which generates no acoustic noise or vibration. Acoustic noise and vibration arises due to physical buckling and resonance of the gradient coil (and former), as well as coupling to other structures. Noise control may be achieved by special designs taking into consideration the construction and materials of the gradient coil formers, coupling with other structures, use of noise insulation materials, and finally the design of the coil windings themselves. This however, represents (for existing scanners) probably the most inconvenient and expensive solution. This section discusses each of these aspects in more detail.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="italics">Stiffness and Damping.</emphasis> As suggested above, greater gradient coil stiffness should reduce mechanical vibration and associated noise. Stiffness is dependent on material properties and geometrical factors. Altering gradient coil dimensions or materials to increase Young's modulus will help reduce acoustic noise due to vibration. Lin, et al. (181) reported on the use of a variety of reinforcements to increase the gradient coil stiffness, reduce vibration, and the associated acoustic noise. These investigators found that increasing the stiffness of the gradient coil former reduced the amplitude of the forced vibration response of the gradient coil at low frequencies and the noise generated by the coil. In addition, the gradient coil demonstrated a reduced number of resonance modes in the low and medium frequency ranges, in turn, reducing the chance of the system being excited into resonance and generating high levels of acoustic noise.</para>
    <para>Damping the gradient coil may also attenuate the mechanical vibration. This can be achieved by using particular materials for construction or by mounting the coil in such a way that an acoustic absorber surrounds it. Damping is most efficient at or near resonance and, unfortunately, will reduce the overall stiffness of the coil structure. Several commercial manufacturers use damping techniques for their gradient coil systems (46, 51). A reduction of around 3-dBA due to the use of acoustically damped commercial gradient systems have been reported (46). Mechefske, et al. (182) reported improved results by mounting an acoustic liner inside the bore of a 4-Tesla research scanner, with damping material applied to the back. The bore of this MR system was also fitted with an "endcap". Running an EPI sequence, acoustic attenuation of around 20-dB was possible, however the scanner did not</para>

    <para>In 2005, Shao, et al. (70) reported on the development of an analytic model that predicted the acoustic noise generated by an MRI gradient coil with finite acoustic impedance, which was based on initial work by Kuijpers, et al. (75). This group modeled the use of an absorptive liner inside the gradient coils and tested predictions with measurements made in a 4-Tesla MR system. They found that an acoustic noise reduction of the order of 10-dB at the low frequency end of the spectrum was possible, but the practicality of using thick materials in limited space is doubtful.</para>

As acoustic waves can only travel in a medium, mounting or encasing the gradient coil in a vacuum should avoid transmission of any generated noise (183-186). Edelstein, et al. (185) controlled acoustic noise by using a combination of evacuating the gradient coil structure and using a magnet with a non-conducting inner cryostat bore. They achieved total reduction in acoustic noise of around 20-dB (peak). Their results showed that eddy currents caused by gradient shielding leakage can generate significant Lorentz forces on the inner cryostat bore. These forces contribute a significant level of the total scanner acoustic noise. Edelstein, et al. (185) reported that is</para>

In 2005, based on finite element modeling, they redesigned standard active gradient shielding to include an additional passive copper layer (187). This added passive shield prevented power deposition in the warm bore, which resulted in an efficient hybrid active-passive shielding system. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 16</emphasis> shows examples of typical configurations for such a strategy. The modeled power reductions associated with the system predicted a reduction in acoustic noise of approximately 25-dB.</para>
    <para>Tkach, et al. (108) reported on the acoustic noise levels generated by a purpose-designed neonatal 1.5-T MR system. One of the design features was a cantilevered patient couch. The couch effectively suspends the patient inside the scanner bore, isolating or decoupling the patient from vibration from the gradient coils and bore panels. For a range of 6 clinical sequences, they recorded noise levels of 77.3- to 88.0-dB, representing an average reduction of 11-dB for this system compared to typical adult scanners running similar clinical sequences.</para>
    <para>Katsunuma, et al. (183), evacuated the area surrounding the gradient coil system so that insulation would prevent propagation of sound and a separate mount (i.e., floor mounting the gradient coil former) that prevented transmission of vibration from other structures. Acoustic noise reduction levels of around 30-dB (peak) were possible, but this is an expensive solution and not suited for retrofit. "Enclosure" is a traditional technique used in noise control, which involves enclosing the noise source in an airtight skin, damping the source side of the enclosure, and decoupling the enclosure from the source (51).</para>
    <para>Perforating a noise-generating surface has been found to significantly reduce the levels of acoustic noise generated (188). Systems involving the use of micro-perforated panels (MPPs), first suggested by Maa (189), are typically used with an air-filled backing cavity and rigid back wall. These methods can also be difficult to implement efficiently in MR systems due to additional space requirements. More recently, Li and Mechefske (190) investigated the implementation of an MPP system for use in MRI. Their basic expansion modeling showed that the MPP systems can be particularly efficient at low frequencies. However, optimized parameters also allow good efficiency over a wider band. As with poorly designed ANC systems, noise levels have been found to increase with poorly designed perforation systems (190).</para>
    <para>Insulation has also been successful in increasing noise attenuation when applied to transmit RF coils. For example Ireland, et al. (191) reported on the results of additional insulation built into a head RF coil (18-cm inner diameter) for neonatal imaging. The insulation achieved an average additional attenuation of 9-dBA across a range of six different clinical imaging sequences at 1.5-T, resulting in noise levels of approximately 82-dBA, that were then further attenuated with passive hearing protection.</para>

    <para>Rather than trying to mount a vibrating gradient coil to a heavy and immovable former or somehow damp the coil, if the coil is considered as a harmonic oscillator and coupled to another, back-to-back, and if masses and spring constants are equal, the center of mass of the system will be constant without the need for a heavy mount (192, 193).

    <para>For optimal acoustic noise cancellation, strut material should have a large value for E and small value for ρ, resulting in a high compressional wave velocity. Thus, a light coupling structure of high strength may perform as well as a heavier structure. Composite materials have been tested and found to perform well with a frequency response up to 20-kHz (single loop coil of dimensions 30-cm × 20-cm) (125). Using a bench-top prototype 2-coil system (a square coil design measuring 40-cm along each size, powered by a 10-A sinusoidal current), the reported noise attenuation, when powered in balanced mode, was approximately 40-dB at 100-Hz, dropping to 0-dB at 3.5-Hz (Figure 18). The results of attenuation levels agree reasonably well with a theoretical prediction (curve D) (192).</para>
    <para>Designs have also been extended and tailored to include the capability of current balancing, acoustic screening and magnetic field screening in one coil (195). A head gradient coil has been designed analytically using co-axial return paths to minimize localized Lorentz forces and acoustic noise. When performing EPI (3-mm slice thickness, gradient switching frequency 830-Hz, current 207-A) in a 3-T MR system, noise levels of 102-dB (root mean square) have been reported (192).</para>
    <para>The implications for gradient coil characteristics of the acoustic screening design mean a loss of gradient strength and an increase in coil inductance, thus, reducing high-speed performance. Estimates of the increase in inductance for a three-cylinder coil system (i.e., fully force shielded as well as acoustically and magnetically shielded) over a gradient coil with only active magnetic shielding is a factor of approximately eight.</para>
    <para>To counteract this in keeping performance constant, an increase in driver current of the square root of 8 is required that will, in turn, increase the acoustic noise output of the coil. Throughout the data on sound generation in relatively simple gradient structures (37), the highest sound pressure levels were noted to come from spurious resonances, thought to be due to bending and buckling of the coil structures (Chladni resonances).

This acoustic phenomenon is referred to as "RF hearing", "RF sound" or "microwave hearing". Thermoelastic expansion is believed to be the mechanism responsible for the production of RF hearing, whereby there is absorption of RF energy that produces a minute temperature elevation (i.e., approximately 1 x 10<superscript>-6</superscript> °C) over a brief time period (i.e., approximately 10-microseconds) in the tissue of the head (212-214). Subsequently, a pressure wave is induced that is sensed by the hair cells of the cochlea via bone conduction. In this manner, the pulse of RF energy is transferred into an acoustic wave within the human head and sensed by the hearing organs.</para>
    <para>The sounds that occur with RF hearing appear to originate from within or near the back of the human head, regardless of the orientation of the head in the RF field. The actual type of noise that is heard varies with the RF pulse width and repetition rate. The relative loudness is dependent on the total energy per pulse. RF energy-related acoustic noise has been observed at frequencies ranging from 216 to 7500-MHz (212-214).</para>
    <para>RF hearing is mathematically predictable from classical physics and has been studied and characterized in laboratory animals and human subjects.

    <para>The gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise that occurs during MRI procedures is significantly louder than the sounds associated with RF hearing. Therefore, noises produced by the RF auditory phenomenon are effectively masked and not perceived by patients or MR system operators (212). Furthermore, there is no evidence of any detrimental health effects related to the presence of RF hearing. However, Roschmann, et al. (212) recommends an upper level limit of 30-kW applied peak pulse power of RF energy for head coils and 6-kW for surface coils used during MR imaging or spectroscopy to avoid RF-evoked sound pressure levels in the head increasing above the discomfort threshold of 110-dB.</para>

        <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <para>MRI procedures can generate significant levels of acoustic noise under certain conditions (41, 54). This noise can be an annoyance, hinder communication with staff members and, at high levels, presents a potential safety hazard to patients that must be managed and controlled.</para>
    <para>Many groups have measured and analyzed the acoustic noise associated with MRI. Acoustic noise levels increase with changes in imaging parameters including a decrease in section thickness, field-of-view, gradient ramp time, and an increase in the gradient amplitude. The environment, hardware design, and the presence of the patient in the MR system will also affect noise levels.</para>
    <para>Although many options are available for noise control, the use of simple passive protection in the form of earplugs is generally sufficient to decrease noise to levels within permissible limits for the great majority of patients. However, care must be taken to ensure passive protection is properly fitted and in good condition (1). Noise measurements or data for the scanner should also be acquired and checked in association with the attenuation of the passive protection to ensure resultant noise levels at the ear will be within safe limits.</para>
    <para>Current documents regarding permissible limits vary, but a general consensus appears to set a permissible average noise level at the patients ear of 85-dBA (80, 88, 96). Noise levels outside the MR system's bore are lower and present reduced risks for an MRI healthcare worker present during the MRI examination.</para>
    <para>Of course, passive methods have limitations and more elegant and effective solutions are possible. These methods range from optimizing the MRI pulse sequences in terms of minimizing gradient activity, to the utilization of active noise control and active vibration control systems, or entirely redesigning the gradient coils.</para>
    <para>As with many aspects of MRI, the specifications for achieving high noise attenuation often run counter to fast acquisition of high quality diagnostic images and compromises must be made. Optimizing procedures to lengthen gradient ramp times, lower amplitudes, or minimize pulsing can result in sequences with reduced performance (133-135). Designing gradient coils that are force-balanced to minimize acoustic resonances will compromise performance in terms of increasing inductance and loss of gradient strength (37, 192-195).</para>
    <para>A solution that presents a minimal impact on the performance of the MR system is active noise control using anti-noise (114-122). This is a promising technique but an optimal system has yet to be fully implemented on clinical scanners.</para>
    <para>Over the last decade, the most effective solutions reported, are those involving sequence optimization. UTE-type sequences which incorporate spiral k-space trajectory acquisition, and very low gradient activity produce almost silent MR scanning (148-160). Gradient fil-</para>
    <para>tering or re-shaping has also been proven to be very effective. It is no coincidence that two commercial solutions (Silenz<superscript>TM</superscript>, and Quiet Suite<superscript>TM</superscript>) are based on these approaches.</para>
    <para>These solutions (UTE methods in particular) have not been applied to every MR sequence, and are not suited to certain applications, such as ultrafast MR. However, given the comparative low cost and ease of install for these acoustic noise solutions, coupled with their efficiency, it seems likely that ongoing research in these directions will prove fruitful and silent MR sequences will multiply on clinical scanners over time.</para>
    <para>Current trends in MRI include increasing static magnetic field strengths and improved gradient performance for rapid clinical imaging applications. The need for ultrafast sequences for fMRI and other advanced techniques continues. These developments will result in increases in MRI-generated acoustic noise levels. This will mean a continuing interest and evolution in acoustic noise control methods that warrant continued investigation, development, and commercial implementation of these techniques.</para>
