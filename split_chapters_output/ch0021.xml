        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), through a well-orchestrated manipulation of electromagnetic fields, manages to create tomographic images of patients without exposure to ionizing radiation. However, MRI still exposes the patient inside the MR scanner to three different types of electromagnetic fields (a static magnetic field, time-varying gradients, and radiofrequency fields). Because these electromagnetic fields interact with the human body, MRI safety standards, such as the document from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), IEC60601-2-33 (1), provide limits for field exposure levels and characteristics to reduce patient risks from hazards including: radiofrequency (RF)-induced burns, local and whole-body heating, peripheral nerve stimulation, and cardiac stimulation, among others. While these risks are mostly mitigated through the exposure limits, and MR systems have a strong history of safe use, there continues to be reports of adverse events, including in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from the Food and Drug Administration (2).</para>
    <para>There are additional safety concerns related to implantable medical devices in patients undergoing MRI examinations due to the interactions of electromagnetic fields with the implants. These potential hazards, along with several unfortunate patient injuries related to interactions between MR scanners and implanted devices that occurred during the early days of the use of MRI technology historically led to conservative default consideration of implantable devices as being contraindicated for MRI (3-8). In the mid-1990s, passive medical devices (i.e., an implant without an internal power source), such as vascular stents and heart valve prostheses, began to undergo testing and received MR Conditional labeling following guidelines from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International (9-13) and recommended MRI safety procedures presented in publications on this topic subject (14, 15).</para>
    <para>An active implantable medical device (AIMD), which is an implant relying on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity for its function (16), continued to be contraindicated for MRI throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s due to the presence of the many different types of interactions and potential patient harms. In 2002, the neurosurgeon, Ali R. Rezai, and the group based at the Cleveland Clinic conducted multiple investigations focused on characterizing MRI-issues for deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems (17-20). This research contributed to the first successful MR Conditional labeling of an AIMD, the DBS system from Medtronic, Inc. nearly two decades ago. Despite the somewhat restrictive MRI operating conditions for this AIMD (i.e., 1.5 Tesla, only; use of a transmit/receive RF head coil was required; maximum whole body averaged specific absorption rate of 0.1 W/kg), patients were able to receive "on-label" MRI examinations for the first time.</para>
    <para>AIMD manufacturers have come a long way in designing their implants with MRI-related issues in mind and with consideration given to what conditions of the MRI examination (e.g., level of the static magnetic field, limits of gradient fields and/or RF power level, etc.) permit the procedure to take place without compromising patient safety. In 2011, the first successful FDA labeling of an MR Conditional cardiac pacemaker (Medtronic, Inc.) occurred in the United States (21), which marked the beginning of the recent era in which many more patients with AIMDs from manufacturers across the industry can now have access to MRI through MR Conditional labeling.</para>
    <para>The achievement of the current state of MR Conditional devices today, especially including the many industry-standard test methods that are the subject of this chapter, may not have been possible without an effort that started in 2006 across the MRI safety community, which included representatives from implanted device manufacturers, MR system manufacturers, safety test houses, and regulatory bodies. These experts came together as a Joint Working Group (JWG), convened under the International Standards Organization (ISO) and incorporated contributors to the existing MR system standards-making groups from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and ASTM International, with leadership from across the various stakeholders. A major outcome of this effort was the publication of an international Technical Specification (TS), ISO/TS 10974, documenting guidelines pertaining to the assessment of MRI safety for patients with AIMDs. The first version of this TS was published in 2012 (22) and the second updated version was published in 2018</para>

          <title>Important Notes About MRI Safety Testing of AIMDs</title>
    <para>The following notes address many common aspects of MRI safety testing of AIMDs and certain misconceptions that exist:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>There are many types of potential patient hazards, which require comprehensive testing. Notably, it is not simply about magnetic materials or RF energy-induced burns with respect to the MRI-related issues that exist for AIMDs.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The vast majority of implants that permit MRI examinations to be performed in patients are "MR Conditional" (i.e., a medical device with demonstrated safety in the MR environment with defined conditions including conditions for the static magnetic field, time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and radiofrequency fields) (24). Because all AIMDs contain metal, there is no, "MR Safe" (i.e., a medical device that poses no known hazards resulting from exposure to any MR environment) AIMD. Thus, if the implant has metallic components, it is either MR Conditional or MR Unsafe (i.e., a device which poses unacceptable risks to the patient, medical staff or other persons in the MR environment) (24).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>What can be considered MR Conditional is a specific device or system (e.g., a specific IPG plus a specific lead) according the device's formal MRI safety labeling conditions listed in its Instructions for Use or Clinician's Manual. These conditions, based on the field exposure conditions a device will experience within a patient in the MR scanner, are derived from the methods and results of the rigorous testing that was conducted by the device manufacturer or a test house.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>According to this rule, the MR Conditional status is a "system tag" that is not practically applicable to one component of the system.</para>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem><para>That is, for any MR Conditional system with a specific IPG and a specific lead, this specific IPG, by itself, does not carry the MR Conditional tag, because when it is combined with a lead not within the approved list of leads per this MR Conditional requirements, the "MR Conditionality" does not apply. A similar argument applies to leads. Note: Sterile packaging for such implants commonly includes a package for the IPG by itself, and a separate package for the lead by itself.</para>

            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          </listitem>
          <listitem><para>According to this rule, no generalizations of MRI safety can be made about any other device or system from the same manufacturer or from other manufacturers (e.g., lead extensions or lead-to-IPG adapter that are not included in the MRI-related label, and not MR Conditional).</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>If mixing and matching an IPG from an MR Conditional device or system with lead(s) from another MR Conditional device or system, without the explicit labeling about this combination, one cannot assume that the new combination is MR Conditional or otherwise safe for a patient undergoing an MRI examination. Importantly, there is typically no testing or data available to assess or support the safety of such combinations.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Fractured leads, abandoned leads, and other damaged or non-functional implants are typically not assessed for safety, although the test methods in ISO/TS 10974 could potentially be applied to such circumstances. Recent research suggests that excessive heating may occur under certain MRI conditions for these situations (25, 26).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>There are no generally accepted test methods or appropriate guidelines on how to safely scan a patient with multiple AIMDs (e.g., a cardiac pacemaker and a spinal cord stimulation system). Even if each device or system is MR Conditional by itself, the multi-system combination is not labeled for MR Conditional safety because of the lack of testing on such combinations. Of note is that there is a suggestion that lead electrode heating characteristics can change when another implant is present in close proximity (27).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Almost all present safety testing and MR Conditional labeling of implants is for either 1.5 Tesla or 3 Tesla cylindrical bore, horizontal field MR systems, or both. Open-bore scanners that are either lower- or higher-field MR scanners typically are not yet included in testing standards or in MR Conditional labeling.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>For testing related to RF field interactions, if an MR Conditional device or system is tested for safety in a specific static magnetic field strength and frequency (say 1.5 Tesla/64 MHz), there is no implication on MRI safety of the device within other field strengths and frequencies (e.g., lower fields such as 1 Tesla/42 MHz or higher field such as 3 Tesla/128 MHz or 7 Tesla/298 MHz)(15). No presumption of safety can be made at any field strength/frequency other than the specific ones at which the safety assessment was performed, because the RF fields-dependent properties of the system change substantially (e.g., RF field wavelength, current deposition in the leads, exposure fields in the patient due to scanner design differences, etc.) and could be either more safe or unsafe.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>In general, accessories of devices or systems (e.g., remote control, charger, etc.) are not MR Conditional, because they are neither designed nor tested for safety. Many such accessories are MR Unsafe and, therefore, cannot be brought safely into MR system rooms.</para>

        <title>MRI AND AIMD INTERACTIONS: POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARDS ACCORDING TO ISO/TS 10974</title>
    <para>The demonstration of the MR Conditional status for an AIMD by device manufacturers, for example to achieve FDA labeling, involves testing in numerous (hundreds or thousands) different exposure conditions along with modeling of many thousands (or millions) of such potential exposure conditions. This includes exposure in realistic MRI environments, benchtop injection testing, and the development of appropriate risk assessments though physical experiments and modeling. This section of the chapter describes the full range of proper test methods according to established standards that collectively form the "testing package" regulatory bodies review for a given MR Conditional device label.</para>
    <para>Importantly, while there are some abbreviated methods used by some researchers to preliminarily assess device safety through testing of a handful of configurations of a device within a phantom of tissue simulating medium (which was common in past decades, and still finds its way into the literature) such methods are simply insufficient for establishing the MR Conditional safety for AIMDs. While such tests can be a helpful first step, or potentially useful in demonstrating hazards, they unfortunately do not meaningfully evaluate safety in a comprehensive manner.</para>
    <para>According to ISO/TS 10974:2018 (23), the potential safety hazards due to the MR system and the interactions with an AIMD are presented in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>. <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> also illustrates these possible risks. As indicated, each of the three different types of electromagnetic fields associated with an MR scanner (static magnetic field, time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and RF fields) generate specific interactions and potential safety hazards for patients, as do the different combinations of the fields (e.g., device vibration is a result of the combination of the static magnetic field and time-varying gradient fields).</para>
        <sect2 id="ch0021s0000s0003s0001">
          <title>Acceptance Criteria</title>
    <para>Most test methods described in the various standards do not include explicit acceptance criteria (e.g., how many degrees of temperature rise is acceptable for electrode heating). Since the risk level depends on the nature and location of the implant, as well as the tissues surrounding it, each device manufacturer must set and justify acceptance criteria for each potential hazard according to their internal risk management procedures, which is subject</para>

The force exerted on the device is a function of the spatial gradient of the static magnetic field (or the product of B<subscript>0</subscript> and the spatial gradient of B<subscript>0</subscript>, depending on whether the materials are below or above magnetic saturation) as well as the mass of magnetic material. This established test method described in ASTM F2052 (11). It is measurement-based and is typically conducted using an MR system.</para>
    <para>The concept of testing is to measure the magnetically-induced displacement force of the implant where the "patient accessible" spatial gradient magnetic field is greatest (near the opening of the bore) and compare against value the gravitational force acting on the device (since all implanted devices are subjected to the force due to gravity without patient harm)(29). One version of this test is to suspend the device by a light-weight string at that location and measure the deflection angle. If the device deflects less than 45°, its magnetic force is less than that of gravity.</para>
    <para>Implants with a displacement force less than the force of gravity are automatically deemed acceptable for patients undergoing MRI examinations. However, if the force is greater, it still could be acceptable with the justification of an appropriate acceptance crite-</para>

For example, during the intended use of the device, counter-forces associated tissue ingrowth, scarring, granulation, or other mechanisms (i.e., fixation of the device by sutures or other means) can prevent the device from presenting a risk or hazard to a patient with regard to movement or dislodgment (30).</para>
    <para>For most AIMDs with extended leads, since the main magnetic components that are implanted subcutaneously tend to be positioned far from vulnerable anatomical structures, static magnetic field-induced force is not considered a high-risk hazard.</para>

      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Magnetically-induced torque, produced by the static magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>), has the potential to cause unwanted movement of a device containing magnetic materials (i.e., rotating the implant to align it with the direction of the static magnetic field of the MR system). Torque is sensitive to field strength of the magnet and should be measured at a location where the static magnetic field is homogeneous (e.g., at the isocenter of an MR scanner). This established test method is described in ASTM F2213 (12). It is measurement-based and is typically conducted using an MR system.</para>
    <para>Experimental approaches to conducting torque testing vary in complexity and applicability. Some methodologies are only applicable to devices that experience little or no torque, while others are appropriate for devices that experience substantial torque and must be more rigorously quantified to assess safety.</para>
    <para>Most implantable devices, including AIMDs with extended leads, experience measurable torque but have no trouble passing a reasonable acceptance criterion. Similar to magnetically-induced force, the impact of torque acting on an implant may be mitigated by counter-forces that are present, <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis> (30).</para>

      <listitem><para><emphasis role="italics">Gradient Magnetic Field-Induced Vibration</emphasis></para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Time-varying gradient magnetic fields associated with an MR system induce eddy currents on the conductive surfaces of an AIMD. These eddy currents produce a time-varying magnetic moment that interacts with the static magnetic field, causing vibration of the conductive surfaces and, subsequently, the device. The primary potential for patient harm, since the vibration of the device is typically very low-amplitude due to the high frequency of oscillation, is related to possible breakage of internal components that may lead to malfunction of the device. As such, there could be compromised functionality or a lack of therapy from the device.</para>
    <para>Vibration is sensitive to the static magnetic field and the time-varying gradient magnetic fields. This test is described in ISO/TS 10974:2018 (23). It is measurement-based and is conducted using an MR system or using a "shaker" table.</para>
    <para>There are two methods for testing. One method requires the use of an MR scanner and provides higher accuracy with an increase in test burden, while the other method employs a shaker table and uses conservative approximations to reduce test burden after initial calibration testing utilizing an MR system. Because most conceived failures are due to fatigue fractures of internal components, the concept of testing is to expose the implant to extended periods of vibration and confirm full device functionality afterwards.</para>
    <para>The test duration represents the cumulative patient scan time over the lifetime of a typical AIMD. Guidelines in the standard establish, based on prior clinical experience, that conservative total MRI examination time exposure ranges from 2.5 hours to 7.5 hours, if considering at the top 0.8% of the population to the top 0.01% of the population, respectively.</para>
    <para>For small- or medium-sized IPGs, and non-life-sustaining devices, vibration is not considered a high-risk hazard. Notably, larger devices (e.g., IPGs associated with implantable cardioverter defibrillators or implantable infusion pumps) typically vibrate more, with potentially greater likelihood of device damage.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">4. Gradient Field-Induced Device (IPG) Heating</emphasis></para>
    <para>The time-varying gradient magnetic fields associated with MRI pulse sequences induce eddy currents on conductive AIMD enclosures (i.e., the IPG for an ICD) and other conductive internal surfaces such as battery components and circuit ground planes, which can result in device heating.</para>
    <para>IPG heating is sensitive to the average or root-mean-square (RMS) gradient field amplitude |dB/dt|, with secondary dependence on the gradient waveform characteristics (i.e., the shape and frequency). It is greatest when the device is located where the gradient field |dB/dt| RMS is maximum and when the device is oriented so that the gradient field vector is orthogonal to the AIMD surface(s) with the largest conductive area. Gradient magnetic field-induced heating also scales strongly with device radius (i.e., larger devices heat more).</para>
    <para>This test is described in ISO/TS 10974:2018 (23). It is measurement-based, with preferential use of a laboratory gradient coil, amplifier, and function generator that can simulate clinical gradient field exposures. Alternatively, testing may be conducted using a clinical MR system.</para>
    <para>Testing may be conducted using one of two tiers for the gradient waveform shape. Tier 1 uses a conservative waveform shape, and Tier 2 allows the characterization and use of a clinically relevant waveform. Tier 2 is most useful for AIMDs with larger conductive surfaces.</para>
    <para>The standard calls for a test duration that is the maximum allowed for a clinical MRI examination as specified by the AIMD MR Conditional labeling, or 30 minutes. All other testing parameters are determined by the AIMD manufacturer to reflect conservative clinical use conditions for their device.</para>
    <para>The key concern is local tissue heating due to radiant heat from the IPG. For most AIMDs with extended leads, this is not considered a high-risk hazard, though some MR Conditional labels have suggested applying an ice pack near a subcutaneously implanted device if the patient reports localized heating sensations near the device (IPG) during MRI.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">5. Device (IPG) Malfunction: Static Magnetic Field, Gradient Magnetic Field, or RF Field-Induced</emphasis></para>
    <para>Exposure to the MR scanners static magnetic field and/or gradient magnetic field, and/or RF Field could have certain effects on an AIMD such as, but not limited to:</para>

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>These effects can be transient or permanent and might create a safety hazard that impacts the patient with the AIMD. Malfunction of an AIMD also has different implications based on the patient's dependence on the device (e.g., whether it is a life-sustaining therapy such as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or not). The assessment is sensitive to or is a function of the field strength of the static magnetic field, the peak value for the time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and the peak RF field.</para>

Electromagnetic simulations (gradient magnetic field or RF field) are run using these models in all relevant clinical imaging landmarks or patient positions to mimic the electromagnetic environment of the MR system. Modern-day simulations, across a range of human body models, and with a range of MR scanner coil models, can provide the electromagnetic field distribution everywhere inside the anatomical models across a range of potential clinical MRI examination scenarios.</para>

      <listitem><para>An implant with a transmit RF coil type restriction (e.g., a transmit/receive head RF coil only) requirement in the MR labeling, is also related to RF energy restriction based on sensitivity to the B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> (although, the peak RF energy is different for various transmit RF coils). Note: Transmit/receive head RF coils expose the patients to RF fields only within the confines of the head coil. When an AIMD is only cleared for use with a transmit/receive head RF coil, if the transmit body RF coil is activated for any reason with any receive-only RF coil, or if the transmit body RF coil and receive-only head RF coil is used, it could present a substantial patient hazard.</para>

      <listitem><para>For those implants with an RF limit of B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> (and its corresponding SAR limit), using the B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>-based limit is less restrictive, provided that the MR system provides the B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> value. This is because the SAR limit is the minimum value for the range of SAR values corresponding to this one particular B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> limit. That is, for each B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> value, the corresponding SAR is a range of values since SAR is a function of the patient's body weight and the imaging landmark.</para>

      <listitem><para>Not adhering to the RF limits indicated in the MR Conditional label for an AIMD can lead to exceeding the acceptable limit and result in harm to the patient that are sensitive to B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>/SAR and/or RF coil type restrictions and/or zone landmark restrictions, which are the most important for electrode heating. The most prominent example, documented in 2005, is a patient with a DBS system who was scanned in violation of multiple labeling conditions, leading to a permanent neurological deficit (8).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Malfunction of an AIMD can be related to the strength of the static magnetic field, the peak time-varying gradient magnetic fields, or the peak RF field. These are all electromagnetic field values that either cannot be changed or cannot readily be altered by the MRI technologist/radiographer. Thus, it is important to abide by the information in the MR Conditional labeling for the AIMD in order to ensure patient safety.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>For an AIMD requiring setting up or programming of the device in its "MRI mode" prior to scanning, it is important to do so to avoid potential device malfunction that can occur either during or following the MRI examination.</para>

      <listitem><para>For AIMDs requiring RF power levels lower than the Normal Operating Mode (i.e., whole body averaged SAR of 2 W/kg) when the intended pulse sequence to be used exceeds the implants B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> or SAR limit, the following may be done:</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>If the MR system is "implant friendly", use the recommended option or software. For example, ScanWise Implant software (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) may be used to place appropriate limits on the MRI parameters when scanning patients with MR Conditional implants (32). Importantly, this software provides step-by-step guidance to enter the acceptable field exposure values (e.g., B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>) for a given implant based on the Instructions for Use. Then, the MR system automatically applies these values for the entire examination, resulting in an easily implemented means of performing MRI in patients with implants and devices, especially when the conditions may be particularly restrictive. Otherwise, any parameter that affects RF power level can be adjusted to reduce the value according to the following suggestions (33).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Use the "Low SAR" option on the MR system. This feature is available on most MR scanners and helps to reduce the B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> or SAR, typically without impacting image quality. However, it is unlikely that this option, by itself, will suffice in certain instances. Therefore, use this option in combination with one or more options adjustments to the pulse sequence parameters: (1) increase the repetition time (TR), but not to the extent that it changes the image contrast, as in T1-weighted spin echo pulse sequences); and/or (2) reduce the number of section locations or the grouping of section locations); and/or (3) reduce the flip-angle used for the pulse sequence, or the refocusing flip-angle; and/or (4) use fewer RF saturation bands; and/or (5) decrease the number of phase encodes; and/or (6) reduce the number of echoes such as with respect to the echo train length or the turbo factor (34).</para>

    <para>safety because they derive directly from rigorous test methods. The MRI safety community is gaining expertise from the use of more MR Conditional ATMDs and reflecting these experiences with collaborations from experts in the field for the benefit and safety of scanning patients with implants and devices.</para>
    <para>Patients and clinicians have also benefitted from efforts by MR system manufacturers to design more advanced software, including those with options for limiting exposure to MRI-related electromagnetic fields. These have already helped clinicians to provide access to MRI technology for patients with implanted devices. Furthermore, there are exciting opportunities for improving patient access to MRI examinations in a safe manner in the future through advancing technologies and continued collaboration in the development of safety testing methods and standards.</para>
