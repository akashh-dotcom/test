        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>One of the most critical factors involved in protecting patients from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-related injuries involves an understanding of the risks associated with the presence of metallic implants and devices that may cause problems that include serious injuries and fatalities (1-21). The standard of care for managing a patient referred for an MRI examination with an implant or device is to positively identify the particular item and then determine the relative safety of scanning the patient. This is best accomplished by referring to the MRI-specific labeling for the implant or device, which is typically presented in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis> (IFU). In instances when no labeling exists, the supervising physician (which is typically a radiologist) is responsible for making a decision on whether to scan the patient based on a careful consideration of the risks associated with the metallic object and the benefit of the diagnostic information provided by the MRI examination (1, 4, 5, 12).</para>
    <para>This chapter discusses the various MRI-related issues that exist for implants and devices (1-21). Notably, a comprehensive understanding of this essential information is particularly vital when managing patients with unlabeled medical products (1, 4, 5, 12). This chapter will also review information for commonly encountered implants, as well as medical devices that may present challenges with respect to MRI-related labeling.</para>

        <title>MRI-RELATED ISSUES FOR IMPLANTS AND DEVICES</title>
    <para>It is well known that MRI may be a contraindication for a patient with a metallic implant because of various factors that can result in serious injury or death (1-16). These include movement or dislodgment of a ferromagnetic implant or device, excessive MRI-related heating associated with the time-varying, gradient magnetic fields (i.e., for certain implants) and/or the RF field, induction of currents resulting in unintentional stimulation or other issues, changes in the operational aspects of the device, damage to the function of the device, the difficulty in interpreting MR images due to signal loss and/or distortion, and the misinterpretation of an imaging artifact as an abnormality (1-19).</para>
    <para>Implants and devices are typically categorized into two types: passive and active. A passive implant, such as a vascular clip or heart valve prosthesis, is one that serves its function without any source of power other than that generated by the gravity or the human body, while an active implant (often referred to as an active implantable medical device or AIMD), such as a cardiac pacemaker or neuromodulation system, is a medical device that relies on its function from a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by gravity or the human body (1, 9, 21, 22). Because of their complexity, AIMDs inherently pose a greater number MRI-related issues for patients compared to passive implants. The possible MRI-related risks for passive and active implants are summarized in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>.</para>

        <title>Magnetic Field Interactions</title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Translational Attraction and Torque.</emphasis> With regard to magnetic field interactions and MRI, translational attraction and/or torque may cause movement or dislodgment of a ferromagnetic implant, resulting in an uncomfortable sensation for the patient, an injury, or even a fatality (1-4, 20, 21, 23-58). Therefore, both translational attraction and torque are important to evaluate for implants and devices before patients with metallic objects are allowed to undergo MRI (1, 20-58).</para>
    <para>The effect of translational attraction acting on an implanted ferromagnetic object is predominantly responsible for a hazard that may occur in the immediate area of the MR system (1, 3, 8, 10, 12). That is, as one moves closer to the scanner or as the patient is moved into the bore for the MRI examination. The predominant effect of torque (or rotational alignment to the magnetic field) as it acts on a ferromagnetic object occurs in the center of the MR system, where the magnetic field is most homogenous (1, 3, 8, 10, 12). Notably, torque, which is proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field, will greatly influence implants and devices that have an elongated shape. Obviously, both translational attraction and torque combine to impact a ferromagnetic implant or device as the patient with the object moves towards the MR system and then into the center of the bore of the scanner (1, 3, 8, 10, 12).</para>
    <para>Various factors influence the risk of performing MRI in a patient with a ferromagnetic object including the strength of the static magnetic field, the level of the spatial gradient magnetic field (discussed below), the magnetic susceptibility of the object, the mass of the object, the geometry of the object, the location and orientation of the object <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>, the presence of retentive or anchoring mechanisms (i.e., fibrotic tissue, sutures, etc.), and the length of time the object has been implanted. These factors should be carefully considered before subjecting a patient with a metallic implant or other object to an MRI examination. This is particularly important if the object is located in a potentially dangerous area of the body such as a vital neural, vascular, or soft tissue structure where movement or dislodgment could injure the patient.</para>
    <para>With respect to the potential risks associated with a ferromagnetic implant, in addition to the findings for translational attraction and torque, the "intended <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> use" of the implant or device must be considered as well as the mechanisms that may provide retention of the object once it is implanted, as discussed above (e.g., implants or devices held in place by sutures, granulation or ingrowth of tissue, fixation devices, or by other means). Accordingly, sufficient counterforces may exist to retain even a ferromagnetic implant in place, <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>Numerous studies have assessed magnetic field interactions for implants and other items by measuring translational attraction and torque associated with static magnetic fields of MR systems operating as high as 8-Tesla (1, 23-58). These investigations generally demonstrated that MRI can be performed safely in patients with metallic objects that are nonferromagnetic or "weakly" ferromagnetic (i.e., only minimally attracted by the magnetic field), such that the magnetic field interactions are insufficient to move or dislodge them, <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>Additionally, patients with certain implants or devices that have relatively strong ferromagnetic qualities may be safely scanned using MRI because the objects are held in place by retentive forces that prevent them from being moved or dislodged with reference to the "intended in vivo use" of the object. For example, there is an interference screw (i.e., the Perfix Interference Screw) used for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament that is highly ferromagnetic. However, once this implant is placed in the patient (i.e., screwed into the patient's bone), this prevents it from being moved, even if the patient is exposed to a high-field MR system. Other medical implants that exhibit substantial ferromagnetic qualities may likewise be safe for patients undergoing MRI as a result of the presence of counterforces that prevent displacement of these objects. Of note is that there are medical implants that actually incorporate magnets as their functional components, such as programmable cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) shunt valves, cochlear implants, and certain orthopedic implants (e.g., the MAGEC System, Nuvasive, www.nuvasive.com). These particular implants are safe for patients undergoing MRI as long as highly specific safety guidelines are followed.</para>
    <para>In general, medical implants should undergo testing using ex vivo techniques to assess translational attraction and torque before allowing a patient with the object to undergo an MRI exam (1, 20-22). By following this guideline, the magnetic-aspects of an object may be determined so that a competent decision can be made concerning possible risks associated with subjecting the patient to MRI. Because movement or dislodgment of an implanted metallic object is one of the main mechanisms responsible for an injury, this part of implant testing is considered to be of utmost importance and should involve the use of an MR system operating at an appropriate static magnetic field strength. That is, if the intent is to scan the patient with the implant at 3-Tesla, the implant must be tested for magnetic field interactions at that field strength.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Lenz Effect-Related Forces.</emphasis> Forces related to the Lenz Effect are of potential concern in the MRI environment. In 1835, Heinrich Lenz stated the law that an electric current induced by a changing magnetic field will flow such that it will create its own magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field that created it. These opposing fields, which occupy the same space at the same time, result in a pair of forces. The more current that is generated, the greater the force that opposes it. The so-called "Lenz Effect" occurs with electrically conductive materials (i.e. not just ferromagnetic materials) that develop eddy currents in the presence of high-field-strength static magnetic fields, such as those associated with MR systems.</para>
    <para>Force associated with the Lenz Effect may restrict movement of large metallic objects (e.g., an aluminum oxygen tank) or potentially compromise the function of certain implants in the MRI setting, such as those with moving metallic parts. Interestingly, this force has been suggested to be of concern for prosthetic heart valves that have leaflets or discs, especially if the cardiac implant is used for mitral valve replacement, where the range of pressures are relatively low (higher pressures are more likely to overcome a substantial Lenz Effect).</para>
    <para>Condon and Hadley (59) first reported the theoretical possibility of Lenz Effect-related actions for heart valve prostheses that contain metallic disks or leaflets. In theory, "resistive</para>
    <para>pressure" may develop with the potential to inhibit both the opening and closing mechanism of a mechanical heart valve prosthesis that has leaflets or disks. In 2012, Golestanirad, et al. (60) conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Lenz Effect due to motion of artificial heart valves during MRI. They concluded that mechanical heart valves with strengthening rings may be considered safe even under ultra-high-field MRI conditions with field intensities as high as 10 Tesla. Edwards, et al. (61) performed an <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> study of the occurrence of Lenz Effect-related forces on various heart valve prostheses at 1.5-Tesla and assessed the risk of the impedance of valve function. The findings provided evidence of the Lenz Effect on certain cardiac valve prostheses exposed to the static magnetic field, which resulted in functional valve impedance and a potentially increased risk of valve regurgitation. While further evaluation of this phenomenon may be warranted, to date, the Lenz Effect has not been observed in association with clinical MRI examinations nor has it posed additional risks for patients with certain heart valve prostheses (i.e. those with metallic leaflets or disks) or any other implant for that matter.</para>
    <para>One important scenario of Lenz Effect-related forces involves patients with relatively large metallic implants, like implantable infusion pumps or external fixation systems. Despite the lack of movement or displacement hazards for these implants, rapid motion of the patient (e.g., as the patient enters the scanner's bore) with a large metallic implant that is oriented perpendicular to the direction of the static magnetic field of the scanner can result in forces on the implant opposing the motion that may be detected by the patient. In the event that the patient complains of experiencing forces, such as tugging or pulling on the implant, this might lead to the patient or MRI personnel erroneously concluding that the device has ferromagnetic components, and possibly cancelling the MRI examination (1, 4). Slowly moving a patient with a large metallic implant into and out of the bore of the MR system is essential to mitigate Lenz Effect-related forces that might be induced, decreasing the likelihood of a misunderstanding or unnecessary exam cancellation (1, 4).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Magnetic Field Interactions and Operational Disturbances.</emphasis> In certain cases, there is a possibility of changing the operation or function of a medical implant or device as a result of exposure to the powerful static magnetic field of the MR system. For an implant that has a component that is magnetic (e.g., cochlear implants, programmable CSF shunt valves, magnetic reflux management device, etc.), it is possible to disrupt the function of the device or to demagnetize the magnet, rendering it unacceptable for its intended use (1, 2). Therefore, this important aspect must be evaluated using comprehensive <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> testing techniques to verify that specific MRI conditions will not alter the device's function (20-22)</para>
    <para>MR systems with very low (0.064-Tesla or less) or very high (10.5-Tesla) static magnetic fields are currently used for clinical and research applications. Considering that most metallic objects evaluated for magnetic field interactions were assessed at 1.5- or 3-Tesla, an appropriate variance or modification of the information provided regarding the safety of performing an MRI procedure in a patient with a metallic object may exist when a scanner with a lower or higher static magnetic field strength was used for testing and labeling. Therefore, it is deemed acceptable to adjust safety recommendations depending on the static magnetic field strength and other considerations of a given scanner. Obviously, performing an MRI procedure using a 0.064-Tesla MR system has different risk implications for a patient with a ferromagnetic implant compared with using a 10.5-Tesla scanner.</para>

      <sect1 id="ch0018s0000s0004">
        <title>MRI-Related Heating</title>
    <para>Temperature increases produced in association with MRI have been studied using ex vivo techniques to evaluate various metallic implants, devices, and objects that have a variety of sizes, shapes, and metallic compositions or that are made from other conducting materials (1, 2, 38-82). In general, reports have indicated that only minor temperature changes occur in association with MRI and relatively short or compact metallic objects that are passive implants, including items such as aneurysm clips, hemostatic clips, prosthetic heart valves, vascular access ports, and similar devices. Therefore, heat generated during MRI involving a patient with a relatively small, passive implant does not appear to be a substantial hazard. Notably, to date, there has been no report of a patient being seriously injured as a result of excessive heating of a small passive implant or device.</para>
    <para>However, MRI-related heating is potentially problematic for implants that have an elongated shape or those that form a conducting loop of a particular diameter (1, 2, 4, 6-12, 15, 20-22, 62-75). For example, substantial heating resulting in injuries to patients can occur under certain MRI conditions for elongated implants (e.g., leads, wires, etc.) that form resonant antennas or that form resonant conducting loops (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Radiofrequency Field-Related Heating.</emphasis> Radiofrequency (RF) fields associated with MRI can induce electric current in conductors that causes tissue heating primarily due to resistive losses (1, 2, 4, 6, 8-12). Metallic implants and devices have high conductivity and low resistance to electric currents, which results in a minimal amount of implant heating. However, tissues surrounding a metallic implant can heat due to its relatively high electrical resistance (1, 2, 4, 6, 8-12). The evaluation of an implant or device for heating is particularly challenging because of the many factors that effect temperature increases in these items.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 1.</emphasis> Example of excessive MRI-related heating of a medical implant. An abandoned lead from a neuromodulation system was placed in a gelled-saline filled phantom and scanned using a 1.5-Tesla MR system at a whole-body averaged specific absorption rate of 3.8-W/kg. Note the rapid rise in temperature that occurred at the onset of MRI (black arrow) and the substantial heating of the lead that exceeded 73°C.</para>
  <para>Variables that impact RF field-related heating include: the specific type of implant or device; the electrical characteristics of the materials used for the implant or device; the transmitted RF wavelength of the MR system (e.g., at 1.5-Tesla, 64-MHz; at 3-Tesla, 128-MHz); the type of transmit RF coil that is used (i.e., transmit body RF coil, transmit head RF coil, etc.); the amount of RF energy delivered (i.e., based on the specific absorption rate, SAR or other RF energy-related metric); the technique used to calculate or estimate the SAR that is utilized by the MR system; the landmark position or body part undergoing MRI relative to the transmit RF coil; and the orientation or configuration of the implant or device relative to the source of RF energy (i.e., the transmit RF coil) (1, 2, 4, 6-12, 15, 20-22, 62-75).</para>
    <para>One consideration of RF field-related heating of an implant that may not be intuitive is that for a given item, heating can be substantially different depending on the frequency of RF that is applied. For example, evidence from an <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> study conducted by Shellock, et al. (83) reported that significantly <emphasis role="italics">less</emphasis> MRI-related heating occurred at 3-Tesla/128-MHz (whole-body-averaged SAR, 3-W/kg) versus 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz (whole-body-averaged SAR, 1.4-W/kg) for a pacemaker lead that was not connected to a pulse generator (same lead length, positioning in the phantom, etc.). This phenomenon whereby less heating was observed at 128-MHz versus 64-MHz has also been observed for external fixation devices, Foley catheters with temperature sensors, neuromodulation systems, relatively long peripheral vascular stents, and other implants. Therefore, it is vital to perform <emphasis role="italics">ex vivo</emphasis> testing to properly characterize MRI-related heating to identify potentially hazardous medical implants.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Gradient Magnetic Field-Induced Heating.</emphasis> Exposure to gradient magnetic fields utilized during MRI can induce eddy currents on the conductive surface of a metallic implant that is located inside the bore of the MR system (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78). Thus, this is a potential safety concern for patients that have certain metallic implants. The impact of the gradient magnetic fields is primarily determined by the surface area and thickness of the conductor (i.e., with specific respect to the dimensional aspects of the implant), the electrical conductivity of the metal, the rate of change of the gradient magnetic fields, and the relative orientation of implant to the gradient magnetic fields (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78).</para>
    <para>Because of the typical small planar surface area that exists for most passive implants, gradient magnetic field-induced heating is generally not expected to pose a hazard with respect to tissue damage for passive medical devices (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78). This is also the case for active implants that may have a relatively small surface area (e.g., leads associated with cardiac pacemakers and neuromodulation systems). However, gradient magnetic field-induced heating can be substantial for patients with certain sizable passive implants such as large cranial plates, acetabular cups used with total hip replacement prostheses, and implantable infusion pumps (1, 4, 10, 14, 16, 76-78). Accordingly, these situations pose a possible safety issue. Importantly, to date (i.e., 35+ years), there has been no report of an injury to a patient that has been attributed to gradient magnetic field-induced heating of a medical implant.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Induced Currents</emphasis></para>
    <para>The potential for MRI examinations to injure patients by inducing electrical currents in implants or devices made from conductive materials such as cardiac pacemakers, neuro-</para>
    <para>modulation systems, and other similar items has been previously reported (1, 2, 79-82). Notably, the performance of ex vivo testing of implants and devices to assess induced currents is predominantly focused on AIMDs since induced currents have not been described for passive implants (1, 2, 9, 20-22). In general, AIMDs developed to be safe for patients undergoing MRI incorporate special design features to suppress or prevent induced currents from presenting problems (9).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Artifacts</emphasis>The type and extent of artifacts caused by the presence of metallic implants and devices have been described and tend to be easily recognized on MR images (1, 2, 4, 17-19). Signal loss and/or image distortion associated with metallic objects are predominantly caused by a disruption of the local magnetic field that perturbs the relationship between position and frequency. In some cases, there may be areas of high signal intensity seen along the edge of a signal void or when there is an abrupt change in the shape of the item (e.g., the tip of a biopsy needle). Additionally, artifacts seen on MR images may be caused by gradient switching due to the generation of eddy currents.</para>
    <para>The extent of the artifact on an MR image is dependent on the implant's magnetic susceptibility, size, shape, position in the patient's body, the technique used for imaging (i.e., the specific pulse sequence parameters), and the image processing method. Careful selection of pulse sequence parameters decreases the size of artifacts and this is done routinely, especially for patients that undergo MRI with implants that are particularly large, such as total hip or total knee prostheses. Additionally, software-based techniques, such as the metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS), have been described that substantially reduce artifacts associated with metallic objects. Table 3 presents techniques that may be used to reduce artifacts associated with metallic implants.</para>

Thus, over the years, test methods have been developed by various</para>

    <para>organizations including the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with an ongoing commitment to ensure patient safety in the MRI environment (20-22, 84-88).</para>
    <para>The FDA is responsible for reviewing the test information submitted to them by the implant or device manufacturer, the MRI terminology, and the labeling assigned to the product. This terminology has evolved to keep pace with advances in MRI technology. Unfortunately, members of the MRI community frequently may not understand the terms that are used and are often confused by the conditions that are specified in "MR Conditional" labeling. This lack of understanding may result in patients with implants being exposed to potentially hazardous MRI conditions or in inappropriately preventing them from undergoing needed examinations. Importantly, the current labeling terminology that exists is associated with expanded labeling information that relates to the conditions that are deemed acceptable to ensure patient safety (21).</para>
    <para>Prior to implementing the current terminology, the terms "MR Safe" and "MR Compatible" were used for labeling purposes (89, 90). In time, it became apparent that these terms were somewhat confusing and often used interchangeably or incorrectly. In particular, these terms were frequently used without including the conditions for which the device had been demonstrated to be safe. Therefore, in an effort to develop more appropriate terminology and, more importantly, because the misuse of the terms could result in serious risks for patients and others in the MRI environment, a new set of MRI labeling terms was developed and released in 2005 (91). Thus, this terminology, which is currently recognized by the FDA (as well as notified or regulatory bodies outside the United States) and applied to implants and devices is, as follows (21): (a) <emphasis role="italics">MR Safe</emphasis> - a medical device that poses no known hazards resulting from exposure to any MR environment. MR Safe medical devices are composed of materials that are electrically nonconductive, nonmetallic, and nonmagnetic. Using this terminology, MR Safe items are non-conducting, non-metallic, and non-magnetic items such as a catheter made from silicone. (b) <emphasis role="italics">MR Conditional</emphasis> - a medical device with demonstrated safety in the MR environment within defined conditions including conditions for the static magnetic field, the time-varying gradient magnetic fields, and the radiofrequency fields. Conditions that define the MRI environment may include the strength of the static magnetic field value, the spatial gradient magnetic field value, the time-varying magnetic field value, the RF field value, and the specific absorption rate (SAR) level. Additional conditions, including the specific configuration for the item (e.g., the routing of leads used for a neurostimulation system) may be required. Other possible safety issues that may be part of the MR Conditional labeling include but are not limited to thermal injury, induced currents, electromagnetic interference, unintended stimulation, and unwanted interactions among other devices. (c) <emphasis role="italics">MR Unsafe</emphasis> – a medical device which poses unacceptable risks to the patient, medical staff, or other persons within the MR environment. MR Unsafe items include items such as a pair of ferromagnetic scissors.</para>
    <para>Because of the variety of MR systems (e.g., ranging from 0.064- to 7-Tesla) and conditions in clinical use today, the current terminology is intended to help elucidate labeling matters for medical devices and other items that may be used in the MRI environment to ensure the safe use of MRI technology. However, it should be noted that this updated terminology has not been applied retrospectively to the many implants and devices that pre-</para>
    <para>viously received FDA approved labeling using the now outdated terms, "MR Safe" or "MR Compatible" (in general, this applies to those objects tested prior to the release of the ASTM International information for labeling in 2005). Therefore, this important point must be understood to avoid undue confusion regarding the matter of the labeling that has been applied to previously tested implants (i.e., those labeled as MR Safe or MR Compatible) versus those that have recently undergone MRI testing and now labeled MR Safe, MR Conditional, or MR Unsafe (89-91). Notably, the specific content of the MRI labeling for an implant or device may take various forms (especially for AIMDs) because the format continues to be refined by the FDA in an ongoing effort to properly communicate this information to MRI healthcare professionals (21).</para>

Thus, indicated as dB/dx or, in this case, as 720-gauss/cm. In certain instances, if the measured deflection is relatively low, that is, 10-degrees or less, a calculation is performed to extrapolate the spatial gradient magnetic field value to a higher value in consideration of the basic acceptance criterion of 45-degrees or less for translational attraction. Therefore, it is not unusual to see labeling for implants or devices that present a spatial gradient magnetic field value of 2,000-gauss/cm or higher.)</para>

In certain instances, the MRI labeling may change for an implant as a result of new testing that was conducted or due to a change in materials. Importantly, the labeling that ensures the safe use of MRI is highly specific to the conditions that were utilized to assess the implant or device and any deviation from the defined procedures can lead to deleterious events, severe patient injuries, or fatalities, especially when AIMDs are present (1, 2, 4, 6-10, 79-82).

By comparison, aneurysm clips classified as "nonferromagnetic" or "weakly ferromagnetic" are acceptable for patients undergoing MRI. (For the sake of discussion, the term "weakly ferromagnetic" refers to metal that demonstrates extremely low ferromagnetic qualities using highly sensitive instrumentation such as vibrating sample magnetometer or superconducting quantum interference and, thus, may not be technically referred to as being "nonferromagnetic."

          <title>Breast Tissue Expanders</title>
    <para>Adjustable breast tissue expanders are utilized for breast reconstruction following mastectomy, for the correction of breast and chest-wall deformities as well as underdevelopment, for tissue defect procedures, and for cosmetic augmentation. These devices are typically equipped with either an integrated injection port that is utilized to accept a needle for placement of saline for expansion of the prosthesis intra-operatively and/or postoperatively (47, 55, 58, 92-97).</para>
    <para>Breast tissue expanders commonly incorporate magnetic ports to allow for accurate detection of the injection site. These implants are substantially attracted to the static magnetic fields of MR systems and, therefore, may be uncomfortable, injurious, or contraindicated for patients undergoing MRI (47, 55, 58, 92-97). In general, because the magnetic infusion ports incorporated into most breast tissue expanders presumably interact adversely with the electromagnetic fields used for MRI, all such implants are labeled MR Unsafe. Therefore, the consensus practice is to use other imaging techniques when diagnostic exams, such as ultrasound or computed tomography, are needed for patient management (92-95). Another issue over and above safety is that breast tissue expanders with magnetic ports produce extremely large artifacts on MR images and, therefore, assessment of the breast using MRI is problematic (92-95). Of additional importance is that here may be a situation during which a patient is referred for MRI for the determination of breast cancer or an implant rupture, such that the presence of the excessive metallic artifact could obscure the precise location or nature of the abnormality.</para>
    <para>Over the years, there has been considerable controversy regarding the safety scanning patients with breast tissue expanders with magnetic ports (47, 55, 58, 92-97). During a period of more than three decades, only two cases reported problems associated with tissue expanders for patients that underwent MRI (96, 97), while a study conducted in a large series of patients where special precautions were taken to mitigate risks revealed no substantial issues (95).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="italics">Performing MRI in Patients with Tissue Expanders with Magnetic Ports.</emphasis> For certain indications that include neurological, musculoskeletal, or cardiovascular diagnoses, MRI is the superior diagnostic imaging modality.

    <para>As part of the practice of medicine, MRI-trained radiologists may elect to override the labeling for implants, even if they are labeled MR Unsafe, by conducting a careful risk versus benefit analysis for individual cases. Therefore, in the event that a patient with a breast tissue expander with a magnetic port needs to undergo MRI for proper clinical management, the following procedural guidelines were proposed taking into consideration the clinical experience reported by Thimmappa, et al.

Notably, there is considerable evidence that MRI-related heating is a non-issue for breast implants with magnetic ports (55, 92, 93, 98), including a comprehensive study conducted by scientists from the FDA (94).

    <para>MRI testing has been performed on the majority of the commercially available bare metal and drug eluting coronary artery stents.

    <para>The standard policy that MRI labeling information is required to be reviewed before allowing scans in patients with coronary artery stents limits access to this essential diagnostic modality when labeling is unavailable. It should be noted that there has never been an adverse event reported in association with performing MRI in a patient with a coronary artery stent. Therefore, in consideration of the relevant peer-reviewed literature and other related documents (1, 2, 98-105), guidelines were developed indicating that it is acceptable to perform MRI exams in patients with all commercially available coronary artery stents, including patients with multiple coronary stents, by following specific guidelines. These guidelines were created by taking into consideration possible safety concerns, that is, magnetic field interactions and MRI-related heating for these implants. By following these admittedly conservative MRI conditions, every patient with a coronary artery stent can benefit from the diagnostic imaging information afforded by MRI (Table 4). Notably, the previous belief that it may be necessary to wait six weeks or longer after implantation of certain coronary artery stents to allow for endothelialization or other mechanism to prevent migration has been refuted because there are no coronary artery stents made from ferromagnetic materials (82, 98-105).</para>

A large variety of heart valve prostheses and annuloplasty rings have been evaluated for MRI-related issues, especially with regard to the presence of magnetic field interactions and heating associated with exposure to clinical MR systems operating at field strengths of as high as 7-Tesla. Of these, certain ones exhibited measurable yet relatively minor magnetic field interactions. Because the actual attractive forces exerted on heart valve prostheses and annuloplasty rings are minimal compared to the force exerted by the beating heart (i.e., approximately 7.2-N), MRI will not pose a risk to patients with these implants. Furthermore, MRI-related heating has been reported to be relatively minor for all heart valve prostheses and annuloplasty rings that have undergone testing (1, 2, 82, 90, 103, 106-116).</para>

    <para>IUDs made from stainless steel may pose a hazard to a patient undergoing MRI depending on the type stainless steel that was used. Stainless steels used for implants, including IUDs, may be either austenitic, which is a nonferromagnetic form, or martensitic which is a ferromagnetic type of stainless steel. At least four different IUDs commonly used in Asia, especially China, are made from stainless steel. Of these, the only one tested to date which displayed high magnetic field interactions was the Chinese Ring (123). The other stainless steel IUDs (the Chinese Double Ring, the Ota Ring, and the Chongqing Uterine-Shaped IUD) have not undergone testing for magnetic field interactions or heating and, thus, should be considered unsafe for patients until information can be obtained to demonstrate that they are MR Conditional.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Magnetically-Activated Orthopedic Implants</emphasis>Within the domain of orthopedic implants, certain products have magnetically-activated components that permit noninvasive adjustments of their lengths. For example, the Precice and Precice Stryde Systems (Nuvasive, www.nuvasive.com) are adjustable intramedullary rods that can be used for limb lengthening procedures involving the tibia or femur. These devices are lengthened using an external programmer, which eliminates the need for an external fixation system. The Precice System and Precice Stryde System are labeled MR Unsafe.</para>
    <para>Another example of a magnetically-activated orthopedic implant is the MAGEC System (Nuvasive, www.nuvasive.com) which utilizes innovative magnetic technology that is incorporated within adjustable growing rods that are modulated by an external controller (Figure 7). The MAGEC system is designed to avoid multiple distraction surgeries for the treatment of early-onset scoliosis. As a result, the MAGEC System helps reduce associated complication risks from repetitive surgeries and simplifies the management of patients with early onset scoliosis.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Penile Implants</emphasis>Various penile implants have been evaluated for MRI-related issues (1, 2, 125, 126) (Figure 8). Of these, two (i.e., the Duraphase and Omniphase models) demonstrated substantial ferromagnetic qualities when exposed to a 1.5- and 3-Tesla MR systems (1, 2, 125, 126). Fortunately, it is unlikely for a penile implant to cause an injury in a patient undergoing MRI because of magnetic field interactions. This is because of the manner in which such a device is utilized. With regard to scanning a patient with a penile implant made from ferromagnetic material, to avoid discomfort it is advisable to stabilized the implant by a suitable means such as an elastic bandage and to consider scanning the patient in a prone position. Findings for other penile implants reported that they either exhibited no translational attraction and torque, or relatively minor magnetic field interactions. To date, MRI-related heating has not been demonstrated to be substantial for any penile implant that has undergone testing.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Vascular Access Ports</emphasis>Vascular access ports are implants commonly used to provide long-term vascular administration of chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, analgesics, and other medications. A vascular access port is usually implanted in a subcutaneous pocket under the upper chest wall (i.e., subclavicular area) with the catheters inserted in the jugular, subclavian, or cephalic vein (Figure 9). These implants have a variety of similar features that include a reservoir, central septum, and catheters and may be constructed from different materials including stainless steel, titanium, silicone, and plastic. Because of the widespread use of vascular access ports and the high probability that patients with these devices may require MRI examinations, it has been important to characterize the MRI-related issues for these implants (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129).</para>

  <para>Thus, over the years, MRI testing has been performed on the many commercially available vascular access ports (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129). These tests included evaluations of magnetic field interactions, heating, and the characterization of artifacts. The findings resulted in MRI labeling that indicates that patients may undergo MRI exams at 1.5- or 3-Tesla immediately after implantation of the vascular access ports (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129).</para>
    <para>Similar to the information presented for coronary artery stents, heart valve prostheses, and annuloplasty rings, the standard policy that MRI labeling information is required to be reviewed before allowing scans in patients with vascular access ports limits access to this essential diagnostic modality when labeling is unavailable. It should be noted that there has never been an adverse event reported in association with performing MRI in a patient with a vascular access port. Therefore, in consideration of the relevant peer-reviewed literature and other related documents (1, 2, 31, 32, 127-129), guidelines were developed indicating that it is acceptable to perform MRI exams in patients with all commercially available vascular access ports. These guidelines were created by taking into consideration possible safety concerns, that is, magnetic field interactions and MRI-related heating for these implants. By following these admittedly conservative MRI conditions, every patient with a vascular access port can benefit from the diagnostic imaging information afforded by MRI (Table 7).</para>
    <para>With respect to MRI and artifacts, vascular access ports that will produce the least amount of artifact are made entirely from nonmetallic materials such as plastic, silicon, Delrin polyethylene, or polyether ether ketone (commonly known as PEEK). The ones that produce the largest artifacts are composed of metals or have metallic components in an unusual shape (e.g., the OmegaPort Access Port). Even vascular access ports made entirely from nonmetallic materials are, in fact, seen on MR images because they contain silicone (i.e., the septum portion of the port). Using MRI, the Larmor precessional frequency of fat is close to that of silicone (i.e., 100-Hz at 1.5-Tesla). Therefore, silicone used in the construction of a vascular access port may be observed on MR images with varying degrees of signal intensity depending on the pulse sequence that is used.</para>

    <para>The highest field strength MR system approved for clinical use is the 7-Tesla scanner. The unique research and clinical applications afforded by 7-Tesla MRI are predominantly due to the associated increase in the signal-to-noise ratio that can be exploited to achieve higher resolution images (4, 130-132). In addition, imaging at this ultra-high-field (UHF) enables the improved detection of functional and metabolic (i.e., using MR spectroscopy) abnormalities compared with lower-field-strength MR scanners (4, 130-132). Importantly, the UHF MR system presents unique safety issues, especially with respect to scanning patients with implants and devices (4, 130-132)(<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>). If 7-Tesla MRI is to reach its full potential as an imaging modality, scanning must become available to research subjects and patients with metallic implants.</para>

    <para>As previously described in this chapter, attractive translational and rotational forces acting on metallic objects, including medical implants and devices, depend on a myriad of factors including the composition of the material and its shape (1, 2, 4, 130-132). Translational forces are highly dependent on the field strength and the spatial gradient magnetic field, while rotational forces are directly proportional to the strength of the static magnetic field (1, 2, 4, 130-132). Of note is that, in comparison to a 3-Tesla MR system, a scanner operating at 7-Tesla has a fringe field that changes faster as a function of distance from the static magnetic field. That is, the fringe field has a "steeper" spatial gradient magnetic field. Because both the static magnetic and spatial gradient magnetic fields are greater at 7-Tesla than at lower fields, translational attraction forces affect implants to a greater extent, which may pose higher risks for certain devices (4, 130-132).</para>

    <para>The hydrogen proton resonance frequency at 7-Tesla is approximately 298-MHz and, therefore, the corresponding RF wavelength in tissue is substantially less than what exists at 64-MHz (i.e., for 1.5-Tesla) or 128-MHz (i.e., for 3-Tesla). This results in the potential to heat shorter metallic implants and cause thermal injuries at 7-Tesla compared to what might occur at 1.5- or 3-Tesla (4, 130-132). Importantly, MRI-related heating at 7-Tesla may be of considerable concern when utilizing "stronger" RF pulses (e.g., fast spin echo pulse sequences) because temperature has been demonstrated to increase with the square of the transmitted pulse power (133).</para>

    <para>1.5- and/or 3-Tesla (1, 2, 134-144). Only a small number of medical products have undergone proper testing and labeled with MRI-specific information (i.e., labeled MR Safe or MR Conditional). Test methods developed to assess translational attraction, torque, and RF field-induced heating at 1.5- and 3-Tesla have been adapted to test medical products at 7-Tesla. With regard to the heating test, this procedure was designed for a transmit body RF coil, however, at the present time, only transmit/receive head and knee RF coils exist for the 7-Tesla scanners approved for clinical use. Accordingly, the test procedure applied to implants had to be modified in consideration of the available RF coils. Once a transmit body RF coil becomes available for 7-T MR systems, re-testing will be necessary.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Untested Passive Implants.</emphasis> In 2019, Barisano, et al. (144) described a case involving 7-Tesla MRI of the brain in a subject with untested and unlabeled, total knee replacement implants. Because these orthopedic implants were made of materials that were nonmetallic or had low magnetic susceptibilities and were implanted in an anatomic area far removed from the transmitted RF energy (i.e., a transmit/receive head RF coil was used for imaging), there were no deleterious effects anticipated for the scan. The subject had an uneventful outcome. The investigators proposed that, by following a similar strategy that takes into consideration the materials for a given implant and the anatomic area receiving the transmitted RF energy, 7-Tesla MRI may be used safely in situations where there is an untested implant (144). Note that this information applies to passive implants, only.</para>
    <para>Guidelines presented by Barisano, et al. (144) to manage patients or research subjects with untested implants were, as follows:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>The supervising physician (e.g., the MRI-trained radiologist) must perform an assessment of the risks associated with the implant versus the benefits of the MRI exam.</para>

      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>The material used to make the implant must be identified in order to establish if there may be issues with respect to magnetic field interactions and heating. Typically, material information can be obtained by contacting the manufacturer. Some common low magnetic susceptibility, metallic materials that are used for implants include cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy, nitinol, austenitic stainless steel (e.g., 316L, 316LVM, etc.), platinum, platinum-iridium, titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloy, tantalum, commercially pure titanium, and titanium alloy.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Since all metals are conductors, the position of the implant relative to the transmitted RF energy must be considered with respect to the potential for excessive heating. Thus, to ensure minimal risk, the entire implant must be located outside of the RF coil and a suitable distance from the area of the transmitted RF energy. (Note, in consideration of the possibility of "traveling-wave" effects, a minimum distance of 30-cm is deemed acceptable. See section below.) As previously indicated, the 7-Tesla MR systems approved for clinical use currently have transmit/receive head and knee RF coils, only. As such, a relatively straightforward decision may be made with respect to possible hazards related to excessive implant heating for this scanner configuration. Once a transmit body or other transmit body part-specific RF coils becomes available, the prediction of implant heating will become a greater challenge.</para>

    <para>Kraff and Quick (131) summarized additional information regarding scanning patients at 7-Tesla with untested passive implants, recognizing that because of the lack of tested and labeled implants, both research and clinical uses of 7-Tesla MRI may be limited because of the exclusion of individuals with metallic implants. They proposed that by using a well-considered, risk versus benefit analysis, the already known advantages of 7-Tesla MRI in neurological and musculoskeletal diagnostic imaging should not be denied to patients despite the presence of passive implants, particularly for those implants labeled MR Conditional at 3-Tesla (131).</para>
    <para>In 2016, the national network German Ultrahigh Field Imaging (GUFI) published a consensus recommendation on the inclusion of study subjects imaged at 7-Tesla (145). The recommendation stated that the use of local transmit/receive RF coils (i.e., head and knee) has the advantage that the transmit RF exposure volume is considerably lower compared to the large exposure volume of transmit body RF coils that are on 1.5- and 3-Tesla scanners. As a result, the RF power density that exists outside of local transmit RF coils decreases rapidly. Therefore, for individuals with passive implants that are labeled MR Conditional at 3-Tesla, that do not contain magnetizable components, and that are located at a certain distance from the transmit RF coil, an overly conservative exclusion of individuals with implants would no longer be warranted, as previously required by many ethics committees.</para>
    <para>Of note is that the minimum distance between the implant and the local transmit RF coil depends on both components and, thus, must always be considered on a case-by-case basis. At 7-Tesla, the phenomenon of the "traveling wave" effect (146) (Note, the traveling wave effect suggests that there is a possibility that the bore of the scanner can act as a hollow circular waveguide for traveling waves that could interact with an implant outside of the area of the transmitted RF) needs to be taken into account, primarily for implants that have a complex geometry or that form a conducting loop of a certain diameter, and/or with dimensions of integral multiples of half a wavelength, or in cases for partially implanted metallic objects (131, 145). Accordingly, to ensure patient safety, the minimum allowable distance between the edge of the transmit RF coil and the implant should be 30 cm. While this value has not been determined by numerical simulations of various exposure scenarios, it does represent a conservative guideline for passive implants in association with scanning at 7-Tesla. (131).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Untested Active Implants.</emphasis> As previously discussed, an active implant contains electrical circuits and/or a power supply. Presently, no active implant has been tested and labeled MR Conditional at 7-Tesla. The potential safety risks are considered to be extremely high and related to excessive magnetic field interactions, RF field-induced heating, induced currents, device malfunction, and other MRI-related issues.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">GUIDELINES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE POST-OPERATIVE PATIENT</emphasis>There is often confusion regarding the issue of performing an MRI examination during the post-operative period in a patient with a metallic implant or device. Studies have sup-</para>
    <para>ported that, if the metallic object is a "passive implant" and it is made from nonferromagnetic material, the patient may undergo an MRI exam <emphasis role="italics">immediately</emphasis> after implantation using an MR system operating at 3-Tesla or less (1, 2). In fact, there are reports that describe placement of vascular stents, coils, filters, and other metallic implants using MR-guided procedures that include the use of high-field-strength (1.5- and 3-Tesla) scanners (1, 147, 148). Additionally, a patient or individual with a nonferromagnetic, passive implant is allowed to enter the MRI environment associated with a scanner operating at 3-Tesla or less immediately after the implantation of the device.</para>
    <para>Importantly, for a passive implant that does not state a "wait" period in the <emphasis role="italics">Instructions for Use</emphasis> (IFU) or MRI-related labeling, there is no need to delay the MRI examination for the patient. For patients with implants that are "weakly magnetic" but rigidly fixed or otherwise anchored in the body (e.g., orthopedic implants or other similar devices), these individuals may undergo MRI immediately after implantation of the device.</para>
    <para>For an implant or device that exhibits ferromagnetic qualities, it may be necessary to wait a period of six weeks after implantation before performing MRI. For example, certain intravascular and intracavitary coils, stents, and filters designated as "magnetic" become firmly incorporated into tissue a minimum of six weeks following placement. In these cases, retentive or counter-forces provided by tissue ingrowth, scarring, granulation, or other mechanisms serve to prevent these objects from presenting risks or hazards to patients or individuals with respect to movement or dislodgement associated with magnetic field interactions (i.e., force and torque).</para>
    <para>Of course, the information above pertains to magnetic field interactions (i.e., force and torque) and further consideration must be given to MRI-related heating for the implant or device.</para>
    <para>If there is any concern regarding the integrity of the tissue with respect to its ability to retain the implant or object in place or the implant cannot be properly identified, the patient or individual should not be exposed to the MRI environment unless a radiologist gives careful consideration to the risk versus benefit aspects of the specific implant and the intended MRI conditions.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">MANAGING PATIENTS WITH UNLABELED IMPLANTS</emphasis>In the event that a patient referred for an MRI exam has a <emphasis role="italics">passive implant</emphasis> that does not have MRI labeling, the supervising physician may elect to clear the patient for MRI after a careful consideration of the risks versus the benefit, with attention to the factors that potentially pose a hazard for the particular implant (1, 4-12). These factors include magnetic field interactions (i.e, force and torque), MRI-related heating, and if the implant has a functional component, such as a programmable cerebral spinal fluid shunt valve, the impact of MRI on the operational aspects of the device must also be considered. It should be duly noted that the above information specifically pertains to scanning patients with <emphasis role="italics">passive implants</emphasis> and not to active implants because the inherent risks of AIMDs are particularly complicated and challenging to assess.

With the continued advances in MRI technology and the development of more sophisticated implants and devices, there is an increased potential for hazardous situations to occur in the MRI environment. To ensure safety for individual and patients, MRI healthcare professionals should follow the guideline whereby an MRI examination should only be performed in a patient with a medical product that has been previously tested and demonstrated to be safe. For implants and devices with MR Conditional labeling, the specific information must be carefully followed to prevent patient injuries.</para>
