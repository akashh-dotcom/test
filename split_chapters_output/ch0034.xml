      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>In the period from 2003 to 2013, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) community in Europe was engaged in a campaign related to a portion of the European Union (EU) occupational health and safety legislation, the Physical Agents (Electromagnetic Fields, EMF) Directive (1), which appeared to pose a substantial threat to the use of MRI in clinical practice and research (2, 3, 4). This contentious debate served to highlight the question of how MRI safety issues are currently regulated in Europe. Although there is no single piece of European legislation concerned expressly with MRI safety, there are a number of sets of regulations and official guidance that are relevant in this area and which staff members working with MRI should be aware of to ensure they remain legally compliant and, importantly, to promote a safe environment for both patients and staff members.</para>
      <para>In this chapter, the body of the EU safety legislation, international standards and guidelines that impact the use of MRI in Europe are discussed. Although Europe and the European Union are neither synonymous nor coterminous, this chapter will be concerned mainly with the situation in the EU. Notably, in some policy areas, including occupational health and safety, EU legislation also applies in the wider European Economic Area (EEA) (encompassing Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), often also in Switzerland, and in some in-</para>

      <sect2 id="ch0034s0000s0002s0001">
        <title>NATIONAL AND SUPRANATIONAL LEGISLATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION</title>
        <para>Currently, the EU is a partnership of 27 sovereign countries¹, each with its own independent government, legislature, and body of law. However, under the treaties establishing the EU, these "member states" have conferred certain powers on the EU collectively, including the power to make laws that are binding on all of them in order to advance the objectives of the treaties. The mechanism by which EU law is made varies between different policy areas but, in general, it involves the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of the EU. The Commission is composed of permanent officials and provides the EU's "civil service". It is headed by the College of Commissioners, a group of politicians forming the "cabinet" of the EU. There is one Commissioner from each member state, each having different policy responsibilities. Only the Commission has the power to propose new legislation, which is then passed to the Parliament and Council for amendment and approval. The European Parliament is composed of members (MEPs) directly elected by citizens of EU member states for terms of five years. Like most national legislatures, it contains a variety of political groupings and carries out much of its work through a system of committees focusing on different policy areas. The Council of the EU is made up of government ministers from each member state, with the attending minister changing depending on the area of policy under discussion. In practice, much of its work is carried out in committees and working parties made up of civil servants and diplomats. The overall political direction of the EU is set by a separate body, rather confusingly called the European Council, made up of member state heads of government. (Even more confusingly, there is also an international organization called the Council of Europe, which is entirely distinct from the EU.)</para>
        <para>Most EU legislation (for our purposes) takes the form of<emphasis role="italics">directives</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">regulations</emphasis>, which become law in member states in different ways. Once the Parliament and Council have adopted a directive, all member state governments are required to implement its provisions in their domestic law (a process known as "transposition") by a fixed date. If a member state fails to meet the transposition deadline, the Commission may take "infraction proceedings" against that country in the Court of Justice of the EU. A regulation, by contrast, is legally binding in all member states as soon as it comes into force, without the need for transposition. EU law takes priority over individual national law, although member states are able to introduce more stringent laws in some policy areas, including worker protection.</para>
        <para>Several EU directives have implications for MRI safety. The most significant of these are discussed below, but others that may need to be taken into account in the context of MRI include the Physical Agents (Noise) Directive (2003/10/EC) and the Pressure Equipment Directive (97/23/EC), as well as more general legislation dealing with issues such as electrical and mechanical safety, manual handling, use of display screens, and others. Most of these issues will not be discussed further in this chapter, where the focus is primarily on</para>

        <title>THE PURPOSE OF STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES: DIRECT AND INDIRECT HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH MRI</title>
        <para>The hazards of MRI are discussed in detail elsewhere in this textbook. Briefly, MRI safety discussions often focus on direct and indirect hazards of EMF.<emphasis role="italics">Direct hazards</emphasis> are those arising directly from exposure of the human body to EMF (the static magnetic field, time-varying magnetic fields and radiofrequency radiation), primarily peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) and radiofrequency (RF) heating. There are also transient sensory effects such as magnetic field-induced vertigo and (rarely in MRI) magnetophosphenes. There has been some debate as to whether or not these phenomena should be regarded as adverse health effects. Most in the MRI community would take the view that they should not, but some commentators argue that the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health as "complete physical, mental and social well-being..." (5) implies that transient disturbances of this kind do constitute adverse effects. Direct hazards are often addressed by setting exposure limits in order to avoid or to minimize the effect in question. These limits may be specific to MRI, or may apply to all sources of EMF exposure.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="italics">Indirect hazards</emphasis> arise when electromagnetic fields interact with an object or device in such a way that it then poses a hazard to patients or workers. Examples are ferromagnetic projectiles attracted by the strong static magnetic field and effects on biomedical implants. By far, these are the more serious type of hazards associated with MRI that are best prevented through the adoption of rules for safe working, worker training, and by other means rather than by imposing exposure limits. This may be an entirely local matter, but in some countries there are national guidelines on MRI safety to provide more effective and uniform protection. Both types of hazard may also be minimized through proper equipment and facility design.</para>

        <title>THE EU HEALTH AND SAFETY FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE: RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</title>
        <para>Most European countries do not have specific laws addressing MRI safety. However, generic legislation to protect worker health and safety exists in each EU member state, based on the health and safety framework directive (89/391/EEC) (6). Under this legislation, employers (which in this context would encompass hospitals, private clinics and universities) have a duty to ensure the safety and health of workers in every aspect related to the work. For example, they must conduct risk assessments of each work process, adopt appropriate protective measures, and provide workers with adequate training. There are also requirements placed on workers to take care of their own health and safety, and that of other persons, and to make correct use of work equipment. However, this is explicitly dependent on the training and instructions received so, again, the primary responsibility rests with the employer. These provisions apply to MRI just as much as to any other occupational setting.</para>

        <para>Risk assessment is an important aspect of compliance with the framework directive. A variety of approaches exist for assessing and quantifying risk and the impact of risk mitigation, often taking the form of a matrix in which the risk of an event is categorized (and sometimes quantified) according to its likelihood and the potential severity of its outcome (Table 1). In the case of MRI, a projectile incident, for example, might be categorized as an "extreme risk" event in the absence of appropriate safety procedures and training, but with that mitigation in place might then be downgraded to a "moderate risk".</para>

      <title>THE MEDICAL DEVICES REGULATION</title>
      <para>EU legislation relating to "medical devices" (a broad term that encompasses everything from bandages to MR systems) also creates health and safety responsibilities for both manufacturers and users of MR scanners. Many classes of product require a "CE mark" before they can be placed on the market in the EU. These include products as diverse as gas appliances, refrigerators, weighing instruments, fireworks, and toys. The process of obtaining a CE mark requires the manufacturer to ensure that the product conforms to the requirements of applicable EU regulations and directives. In the case of medical devices, regulation has hitherto taken the form of a series of medical device directives, requiring transposition in each member state and hence providing scope for a degree of nuancing to meet local circumstances. However, in 2017 the EU adopted the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 2017/745) (MDR) (7) in order to create a more robust and uniform regulatory environment across the Union. This regulation was due to come fully into force in May 2020, but has now been delayed until May 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</para>
      <para>One of the most important of the "general safety and performance requirements" set out in the MDR is that "Devices…shall not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patients, or the safety and health of users or, where applicable, other persons". Demonstrating safety is therefore a key aspect of the CE marking process and, hence, a prerequisite for marketing a medical device in Europe.</para>
      <sect2 id="ch0034s0000s0004s0001">
        <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management    915</title>
        <para>Previous medical device directives contained a provision whereby manufacture or modification of devices within the same health institution in which they were to be used was exempt from all requirements of the directive (known as the health institution exemption, HIE). The term "health institution" in this context includes research laboratories "that support the healthcare system" (e.g., university laboratories). This situation has changed under the new MDR, and such devices will now be required to comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the MDR. In practice, this should not be a major issue, since quite apart from medical device legislation there is already a more general legal requirement for institutions to ensure that devices they manufacture are safe and fit for purpose. However, the MDR also creates a requirement for manufacture<emphasis role="italics">and use</emphasis> of such devices to take place within "appropriate quality management systems". At the time of writing, regulators in member states are still drawing up guidelines as to how this should be interpreted. The new HIE requirements clearly apply to development of new MR systems or components (e.g., RF coils) in research laboratories, but they also affect modification of commercial systems, potentially including pulse programming if this takes the system outside the scope of its original CE mark.</para>

      <title>THE IEC/EN 60601 STANDARD SERIES</title>
      <para>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60601 standard series provides the usual means whereby medical device manufacturers demonstrate compliance with preexisting medical device directives and with the new MDR. The European Commission recognizes these standards as harmonized standards for this purpose, so that satisfying their requirements gives a "presumption of conformity" with relevant legislative requirements. These are global standards, not specific to Europe. They underpin the design and manufacture of MR systems sold throughout the world and are recognized by many national medical device regulatory agencies, including the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, they have a particular importance in Europe because of their close relationship to the MDR and, therefore, are discussed in some detail here. Strictly speaking, it is the version of the IEC standard adopted by the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), known as an EN standard, that is harmonized to the MDD but this is practically identical to the IEC original.</para>
      <para>The IEC/EN 60601 series consists of a general medical device safety standard (60601-1) (8), "collateral standards" covering specific aspects of device performance, some of which are relevant to MRI such as electromagnetic compatibility (60601-1-2) and usability (60601-1-6), and "particular standards" in the 60601-2 series dealing with specific device types. Standard 60601-2-33 is the particular standard for MR systems (9) and is maintained by a group of MRI experts drawn from industry, clinical users, regulators and the academic community.</para>
      <para>IEC/EC 60601-2-33 sets out criteria for equipment safety and details of measurement procedures for manufacturers to demonstrate compliance. Importantly, it also describes the "Instructions for Use" that manufacturers must provide to purchasers of scanners. These include mandatory safety information and create obligations for the end user in areas such as safe system operation, worker training, control of access to the scanner, and patient handling. Much of this material is intended to manage indirect hazards.</para>

        <para>**Various specific absorption rate (SAR) limits are also defined to ensure compliance with these temperature limits.</para>
        <para>Unusually for a standard of this type, 60601-2-33 also contains EMF exposure limit values, addressing direct hazards. These limits are summarized in<emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis>. They apply equally to patients and to MRI workers, with the rationale that the intention to avoid adverse effects in patients ensures that workers are also protected. The standard adopts a tiered approach to EMF exposure limitation, with three operating modes defined by exposure thresholds. In the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis>, there is considered to be no risk of "physiological stress" to patients. In the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>, the threshold for physiological effects may be approached, and medical supervision is recommended. In the <emphasis role="italics">Second Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>, there may be significant risk and local regulatory approval is required (e.g., from a research ethics committee or institutional review board, IRB), which should explicitly state the permitted levels of exposure. The instructions for use passed to the end user must refer to the hazards associated with EMF and to these exposure limits. They must also give advice on worker training to mitigate transient effects, such as vertigo, that may occur at higher exposure levels, and explain that national laws may set lower exposure limits for workers in some countries, as is discussed later in this chapter.</para>
        <para>One point worthy of particular note is that the main approach to limiting exposures to time-varying magnetic fields focuses on direct determination of the physiological threshold for peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) (which is merely a tactile sensation at the onset level) in a group of healthy volunteers, with the<emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> limit set at 80% of this threshold. This differs from most other guidelines in avoiding the unwanted physiological</para>
        <para>effect directly, rather than by means of an exposure limit expressed in terms of physical quantities that is inevitably a conservative proxy. There are also default limits on induced electric field and gradient switching rates for use when direct determination has not been employed, but these are also derived from an empirical equation describing PNS thresholds.</para>

      <title>ICNIRP GUIDELINES ON EMF EXPOSURE</title>
      <para>The EMF exposure limits contained in IEC/EN standard 60601-2-33 are designed specifically for use in MRI and, as far as possible, they are incorporated into MR scanners in the form of hardware and software interlocks and other safety features. There are also international guidelines on EMF exposure of more generally applicability. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is the main organization active in this area and its guidelines have significant influence in Europe.</para>
      <para>The ICNIRP develops guidelines and exposure limits to address adverse health effects of exposure to all forms of non-ionizing radiation, including EMF. The ICNIRP issued guidance on static magnetic field exposure in 1994 (10), which was updated in 2009 (11). Guidance on time-varying magnetic fields in the frequency range up to 300-GHz was published in 1998 (12), and updated in 2010 for the frequency range 1-Hz to 100-kHz (13), and in 2020 for the frequency range 100-kHz to 300-GHz (14). In 2014 ICNIRP issued new guidance on exposure to time-varying magnetic fields with frequencies below 1-Hz (primarily to prevent sensory effects associated with movement in and around static magnetic fields associated with MRI) (15). With the exception of (15), all of these guidelines contain exposure limits for workers, and also lower limits for members of the general public, which do not concern us directly here. There is also a specific statement from the ICNIRP on protection of patients in MRI, published in 2004 (16) and revised in 2009 (17).</para>
      <para>The ICNIRP bases its exposure limits, known as "basic restrictions", on the thresholds for "established adverse effects", determined by critical review of the literature (18). The biological effects of EMF on the human body vary dramatically with frequency. In the low frequency range relevant to the switched gradients in MRI (around 1-kHz), the relevant effect is stimulation of nervous tissue. The obvious manifestation of this is PNS, but historically there has been a tendency to regard magnetophosphenes (which only occur over a narrow frequency range around 10- to 50-Hz) as a possible indication of EMF interactions with the central nervous system over a much wider frequency range (19), resulting in much lower exposure limits than are justified by the desire to avoid PNS alone. This is more of an issue with the 1998 guidelines than with those issued in 2010, where a helpful distinction has been drawn between adverse effects (PNS) and transient disturbances (magnetophosphenes). In the radiofrequency range the critical effect is tissue heating and setting a limit is simply a matter of deciding how much heating is acceptable. Basic restrictions are often expressed in terms of quantities that cannot be readily determined, such as the electric field or current density induced in the body by a time-varying magnetic field, so the ICNIRP also defines "reference levels" in terms of quantities that are easier to measure, such as static magnetic field strength. These are derived from the basic restrictions using conservative models, so that complying with the reference level ensures that the relevant basic restriction is satisfied.</para>

      <para>The ICNIRP's basic restrictions on occupational exposure are often more restrictive than the exposure limits contained in the IEC standard. This is mainly because the ICNIRP applies reduction factors to adverse effect thresholds in order to arrive at the basic restrictions. The rationale is that this reflects uncertainties in scientific knowledge about adverse effects and their thresholds, and also accounts for biological variations in effect thresholds that may exist between individuals. Also, the ICNIRP adopts a broad definition of health, based on that of the WHO (17), so that effects resulting in annoyance or discomfort, affecting a person's wellbeing but otherwise harmless, may be regarded as potential health hazards (18). To add to this, because it is often impractical to demonstrate compliance with the basic restrictions, there is a tendency to treat the more conservative reference levels as default exposure limits.</para>
      <para>Table 3 summarizes the ICNIRP basic restrictions for workers, insofar as they are relevant to MRI. For clarity, reference levels, general public limits and the complexities of frequency dependence have been omitted. Where guidelines allow, it has been assumed that MRI is a "controlled environment" in which workers have been adequately trained. In some instances higher limits apply in such circumstances. In the case of switched gradients, which have complex non-sinusoidal waveforms, the ICNIRP limits at a representative frequency of 1-kHz have been used. Values from the superseded 1994 and 1998 guidelines are included, for reasons that will become clear later.</para>
      <para>Table 4 summarizes the ICNIRP guidance on exposure limits for MRI patients. In its MRI statements, the ICNIRP takes a similar approach to that adopted in IEC 60601-2-33. Three tiers of exposure are defined:<emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italics">Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> (requiring medical supervision) and <emphasis role="italics">Experimental Operating Mode</emphasis> (requiring institutional review board, IRB, approval). The gradient exposure limits are based on PNS perception</para>

      <title>THE EU EMF DIRECTIVE</title>
      <para>Article 16 (1) of the framework directive (6) envisages adoption of additional individual directives to address specific health and safety hazards. In this context, the Physical Agents (EMF) Directive (2004/40/EC) (1) was adopted by the European Parliament and Council on 29<superscript>th</superscript> April 2004, with a deadline of 30<superscript>th</superscript> April 2008 for member state transposition. Its objective was to protect workers from the "known short-term adverse effects in the human body" of exposure to EMF. This document was concerned only with occupational exposure, not exposure of MRI patients or of the general public.</para>
      <para>The directive incorporated the 1998 ICNIRP exposure limits for time-varying magnetic fields, with the intention of making the ICNIRP basic restrictions into legally binding limits throughout the EU.</para>
      <para>Members of the European MRI community became aware of the directive shortly before it was adopted. It was quickly realized that the proposed exposure limits are exceeded in a number of situations in MRI and that the directive would have serious consequences for both clinical and research activity. A lengthy lobbying campaign followed, led by the European Society of Radiology (ESR). There were also campaigns in individual member states and a parliamentary inquiry in the United Kingdom (UK) (20). After considerable effort and the publication of research showing that the limits are indeed exceeded by MRI workers (21, 22), the community's argument about the impact of the directive was accepted. Specifically, research showed that the limit for frequencies below 1-Hz was exceeded by a factor of up to 10 for workers moving through the static magnetic field near the MR system (21), and the ELV in the gradient frequency range by a factor of 20 or more for workers standing close to the scanner during imaging (22) (note, RF exposure is rarely, if ever, a problem). Thus, providing clinical care to a patient during MRI, all forms of interventional MRI, certain research activities, or even walking at a normal speed close to an MR system, would have become illegal throughout the EU following transposition of the directive.</para>
      <para>Of course, this does not mean that workers in these situations are placing themselves at risk of direct EMF effects: IEC 60601-2-33 ensures that this is not the case. The problem is the large safety factors built into the ICNIRP basic restrictions, particularly in the gradient frequency range. These may have a place in industrial settings with highly variable EMF outputs, but are unnecessary and highly problematic in the context of MRI, where EMF outputs are precisely controlled and adverse effects are already addressed under the more specific IEC standard.</para>
      <para>The deadline for transposition of the directive was delayed in 2007 and again in 2012. In 2011, the European Commission proposed a new directive, based on the new 2009 and 2010 ICNIRP Recommendations but also incorporating a "derogation" to exclude MRI workers from the exposure limits, subject to certain conditions. After further lengthy negotiations, this proposal was adopted, and the 2004 directive was repealed (23).</para>
      <para>The MRI derogation in the 2013 directive allows workers to exceed the exposure limit values, when this can be justified, during work related to "installation, testing, use, development, maintenance of or research related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment for patients in the health sector". This rather cumbersome wording was arrived at during negotiation in order to encompass as wide a range of activities as possible. There is a requirement for a risk assessment (already necessary under the framework directive), and for a range of other factors to be taken into account. It must be shown that workers' health and safety is still protected by other means (such as the IEC standards, safe working practices and appropriate training). There is also a provision for member state governments to introduce additional derogations on a time-limited (but renewable) basis where this can be justified.</para>
      <para>Even in this modified form the directive remains controversial. A report produced for the European Commission in 2015 (prior to the 2016 deadline for national transposition)</para>
      <para>recommended that the rationale for retaining the directive should be reconsidered, and that it might be repealed in its entirety (24).</para>

      <title>EXPOSURE LIMITS AND GUIDELINES IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES</title>
      <para>The transposition deadline for the 2013 EMF directive was July 2016. The aim of the directive was that from that date onwards there should be a uniform approach to EMF exposure limitation across the EU. However, historically individual European countries have taken a variety of approaches to EMF exposure limitations. In some cases, 1994 and/or 1998 ICNIRP limits were enforced legally, or there were even more restrictive limits. Whilst no definitive summary of current legislation exists, there was no requirement for those countries to relax their more stringent regulations following adoption of the new directive. To add to the confusion, some EU member states transposed the 2004 directive before it was repealed, although by 2015 some had reversed this process or were simply not enforcing the legislation (24). Other countries had introduced additional requirements in relation to risk assessment or health surveillance, going beyond the requirements of the directive (24). On the other hand, in the UK the HSE adopted as flexible and helpful an approach as possible, with the MRI derogation and associated conditions re-worded in a simplified way in national legislation (25), and the power of derogation at national level exercised to include any MRI activities that were not already encompassed. A commentary on implementation of the UK regulations in the context of MRI has been published (26), and at the time of writing more extensive professional body guidance is awaited.</para>
      <para>In addition to implementing the new EU legislation, some countries have adopted specific guidance on MRI safety. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance covers issues such as safety infrastructure, safe working practices, worker training, and control of access to MRI facilities (27). In the Netherlands, safe working guidance was issued in 2008 with the support of the relevant professional bodies and government agencies (28). The prospect of harmonized EU-wide MRI safety guidelines in the wake of the amended EMF directive has triggered initiatives such as development of standards on the role and training of MRI safety officers in Austria (29, 30).</para>

      <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>Protection of patients and workers from hazards associated with EMF related to MRI requires both appropriate equipment design and use to ensure that the thresholds for direct effects are not exceeded and appropriate working practices and training to minimize the probability of indirect effects. The combination of the Medical Devices Regulation, supported by the IEC 60601 series standards, and the framework health and safety directive should be sufficient to ensure that these conditions are met in Europe. In practice, however, it is unclear how uniformly the obligations created by the framework directive are applied in MRI facilities. The ICNIRP occupational exposure guidelines are a blunt instrument in our context, designed to apply across very wide frequency ranges and incorporating safety factors that are both unnecessary and problematic. A critical difference between the IEC and ICNIRP approaches is that the IEC standard recognizes that MR systems designed to ensure patient safety are also safe for workers at the same exposure levels, whereas the IC-</para>

The government decided to implement this and Brexit took place on 31st January 2020. EU laws remain in place during a 'transition period' lasting until the end of 2020.
