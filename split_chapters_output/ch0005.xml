          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
          <para>During magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the patient is exposed to the static magnetic field, which produces the nuclear magnetization in tissues, radiofrequency (RF) pulses, which manipulate the magnetization in order to detect an MRI signal, and low frequency pulsed magnetic field gradients, which are used for localization of the signal in image formation. This chapter concerns the physiological effects of exposure to time-varying magnetic fields from the imaging gradients, hereafter simply referred to as the "gradients" or "gradient magnetic fields".</para>
          <para>The principal known biological effect from exposure to gradient magnetic fields is peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). Other types of magnetically-induced stimulation (e.g., of the heart, retina or brain) do not occur at exposure levels currently encountered during MRI but will be considered briefly. Another important effect of the gradients is the generation of acoustic noise resulting from the Lorentz force. This is considered elsewhere in this textbook. In this chapter, the basic physical and physiological processes of magnetic stimulation, the properties of magnetic stimulation, human PNS associated with MRI, models of induced electric fields, and the relevant patient exposure limits will be considered.</para>

            <para>The imaging gradients are defined as linear spatial variations in the z-component of the static magnetic field B<subscript>z</subscript>, that is, along the axis of the MR system's bore, as follows:</para>

            <para>and are specified in millitesla per meter (mT/m). Within the imaging field-of-view (FOV), the gradients produce static magnetic fields whose z-axis components are additive to B<subscript>0</subscript>:</para>
            <para>B<subscript>z</subscript>(x,y,z) = B<subscript>0</subscript> + x G<subscript>x</subscript> + y G<subscript>y</subscript> + z G<subscript>z</subscript>    (2)</para>
            <para>The gradients alter the Larmor frequency of the MR signal depending upon its source location. For example, with G<subscript>x</subscript> = 10-mT/m at 0.2-m along the x-axis from the isocenter, the additional field from the x-gradient is 2-mT. The maximum field experienced by the patient will depend upon the patient's size and the linearity of the gradients. Figure 1 illustrates how the magnitude of the gradient fields varies across the patient in the scanner's field-of-view (FOV). Note that the gradient field will be negative over half the FOV.</para>
            <para>Gradient pulses are commonly applied as trapezoidal waveforms with durations of a few milliseconds, ramp times of typically 0.1- to 1.0-ms and amplitudes of up to, and in excess of, 50-mT/m (Figure 2). The gradient slew rate (SR), defined in T/m/s, is given by</para>

In modern scanners SR may reach 200-T/m/s. In the example above, if the slew rate is 100-T/m/s, the minimum ramp time for one gradient lobe is 0.1-ms and the rate of change of field (dB/dt) is 20-T/s. The rate of change of field dB/dt, for example, at any point along the z-axis from G<subscript>z</subscript> is given by</para>

          <para>where Δt is the duration of the change in B or the rise (or fall) time of the gradient waveform. However, the peak exposure may exceed the maximum specified value within the imaging FOV, or the specification volume because only the most linear portion of the gradient field is utilized during MRI (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 3</emphasis>).</para>
          <para>In order to acquire an image, the gradient and RF pulses are arranged as a pulse sequence that is repeated with the repetition time TR (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). In the pulse sequence, the gradient pulses are denoted by their function in the image formation process (i.e., slice selection, phase or frequency encoding). Depending on the anatomical orientation of the image section location, these may or may not correspond to the magnet axes x, y, and z, and thus, frequently the patient may be exposed to the simultaneous action of all three physical gradients G<subscript>x</subscript>, G<subscript>y</subscript>, G<subscript>z</subscript>.</para>

The nerve fiber consists of the long axon surrounded by a myelin sheath that has periodic breaks, or Nodes of Ranvier.

          <title>Strength-Duration Curve</title>
          <para>The physiology of electrical stimulation of nerves has been known for a long time and is characterized by the strength-duration (SD) curve. Two basic forms of SD curves have been used: the earliest is the hyperbolic form of Weiss (5):</para>
          <para>I<subscript>thresh</subscript>(t) = I<subscript>Rb</subscript>[1 + c/t]                                    (12)</para>
          <para>where I<subscript>thresh</subscript> is the threshold generator current (applied via electrodes) to cause stimulation and t is the stimulus duration (for a rectangular pulse). The constant c is the chronaxie and is the stimulus duration required to double the threshold from its minimum value. This minimum value I<subscript>Rb</subscript> is known as the rheobase and is asymptotic for long stimulus durations. The SD curve may also be described in terms of the more physiologically relevant electric field E in tissue or, in magnetic stimulation, by dB/dt/dt (see dashed line in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>).</para>
          <para>The other common form of the SD curve is the exponential or Lapicque form (6):</para>
          <para>I<subscript>thresh</subscript>(t) = I<subscript>Rb</subscript>/(1 - e<superscript>-t/τ</superscript>)                                    (13)</para>
          <para>where τ is the tissue time constant, shown for dB/dt as the solid line in<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>.</para>
          <para>Electrophysiologists currently do not agree on the more appropriate form of the SD curve and magnetic stimulation studies provide evidence for both forms. One theoretical advantage of the exponential form is that it produces the predicted response of a simple equivalent circuit of the nerve under the action of a rectangular current stimulus (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>). Moreover, the tissue time constants can be theoretically derived from the fiber diameters (7). Time constants vary according to tissue type. Peripheral motor nerves have time constants of the order of 0.1-ms, while cardiac muscle has τ in the region 2- to 3-ms and synapses up to 25-ms. Based upon this equivalent circuit, the Spatially Extended Non-linear Node (SENN) model has been used extensively in electro-stimulation studies, and forms the theoretical basis for some patient exposure limits during MRI (8).</para>
          <para>The specific agent of stimulation is usually considered to be the spatial gradient of the induced electric field. Nerve discontinuities such as bends or synaptic terminations (e.g., in muscle) effectively produce E-field spatial gradients, rendering them common stimulation sites. In magnetic stimulation, the stimulus is usually considered to be dB/dt, which is directly proportional to the induced E in tissue. However, just as for electrical stimulation where the SD curve can be derived in terms of electrical charge Q (I = dQ/dt), one can con-</para>

          <title>MAGNETIC STIMULATION</title>
          <para>One of the most sensitive and earliest observed forms of magnetic stimulation was that of magnetophosphenes, as reported in 1896 by d'Arsonval (11) (Figure 9), perceived by the subject as faint flashes of light, and which are thought to originate from stimulation of the retina or the optic nerve. Kavet, et al. (12) provided a review of the magnetophosphene literature, but from these only two or three publications present sufficient dosimetric information to deduce accurate thresholds and frequency response. Losvund (13) conducted the most extensive of these studies, reporting a minimum threshold of 12-mT root mean square (RMS) in the frequency range 20- to 45-Hz, depending upon the ambient light conditions and dark-adaption of the subjects. Figure 10 summarizes the available quantitative data on magnetophosphenes.</para>
          <para>Direct magnetic stimulation of nerves was first demonstrated in vitro by Oberg (14) in 1973, resulting in a measurable twitch of the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog suspended in Ringer's solution. In 1982, Polson, et al. (15) were the first to demonstrate human peripheral nerve stimulation in vivo using a small diameter topical solenoidal coil powered by a capacitance discharge system. They estimated an induced current density of 20-A/m<superscript>2</superscript> and demonstrated the stimulus-response curve from threshold to supra-maximal (when all the fibers in the bundle have been recruited). The topical magnetic stimulation technique was subsequently applied by Barker, et al. (16) to the motor cortex of the brain, and forms the basis of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is a common tool in neuroscience research and therapy used in the treatment of depression and psychiatric conditions (17,18).</para>

            <para>In the SENN model, a 20-um nerve fiber is predicted to have a theoretical time constant of 0.12-ms (7). Despite SENN apologists' appeal to magnetic stimulation for validation of the theory (8), most magnetic stimulation results contradict the predictions of the SENN model. In carefully devised experiments, Rescoskie, et al. (23, 24) demonstrated large discrepancies in chronaxies from electrical and topical magnetic stimulation of the ulnar nerve for both perception and EMG thresholds. Perception chronaxies were 0.024 ± 0.02-ms for electrical stimulation, against 0.67 ± 0.18-ms for magnetic stimulation. A confounding factor is the huge variation (i.e., thirty times) in reported electrical stimulation chronaxies. This raises issues about the validity of applying electrical stimulation data to formulate limits for time-varying magnetic fields.</para>
            <para>Weinberg, et al. (22) investigated ultra-high dB/dt, high frequency (&gt; 100 kHz) pulses, using a topical coil, and reported a significantly reduced probability for stimulation at these frequencies (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 12</emphasis>). They concluded that ultra-short pulses (were the technology available) in whole-body gradient systems are unlikely to cause PNS despite very high dB/dt. Using results from Magnetic Particle Imaging (25) and MRI studies (26), a modified SD curve has been proposed (27). Shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>, the threshold is seen to rise for very short (&lt;20 μs) stimuli above 25 kHz. Also shown are SENN predictions.</para>

          <para>Direct cardiac stimulation is more difficult to achieve due to the longer time constants of cardiac muscle and the smaller induction paths around the organ. Early attempts with small coil systems produced violent muscular contractions and estimated current densities in the range 5 to 20-A/m<superscript>2</superscript> but without any detected cardiac arrhythmias in rats (29, 30). Nevertheless, Bourland, et al. (31) achieved trans-chest magnetic stimulation of the dog heart, producing ectopic beats but not ventricular fibrillation, with an estimated induced electric field of 50-V/m and a median threshold dB/dt of 2,700-T/s. for a 0.53-ms pulse. Using a tissue time constant of 3-ms, a rheobase of 400-T/s can be extrapolated. Yamaguchi, et al. (32) showed similar results with an estimated E<subscript>Rh</subscript> of 55- to 340-V/m. Cohen, et al. (33) did not detect any changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) of canines exposed to up to 66-T/s. using a human whole-body gradient system. The cardiac stimulation dB/dt rheobase for the most sensitive percentile of the population has been theoretically estimated as 62-T/s. (34). It is thought that at least 50 times the electrical stimulus for cardiac stimulation is required to cause ventricular fibrillation (35).</para>
          <para>Interestingly, exposure of pregnant mice to dB/dt of up to 3,600-T/sec. at 2.2-kHz caused significant muscular contractions but showed no effect on the litter size or teratogenicity (3).</para>

          </para>
          <para>PNS associated with MRI-related gradient magnetic fields was first reported by Cohen, et al. (33) and Budinger, et al. (36). Initially, the possibility of PNS was limited to high slew rate specialist gradient systems, based upon capacitance discharge technology, for echo planar imaging (EPI). The advent of improved linear amplifiers for the MRI-related gradients has resulted in a much greater likelihood of patients experiencing stimulation. For example, Vogt, et al. (37) exposed 210 patients to gradient slew rates of 120% of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) limit for PNS (38) using a rapid gradient echo (FLASH) sequence. For this study group, 16.7% reported PNS with 2.9% reporting very uncomfortable stimulation.</para>
          <para>The Purdue University group (39, 40) has published extensive studies of MRI-related gradient stimulation using y- (anatomically aligned anterior-posterior) and z-gradient coil systems external to the bore of the MR system.<emphasis role="bold">Figure 14</emphasis> shows SD curves for an individual subject's subjective reporting of three levels of stimulation (1 = threshold, 5 = uncomfortable, 10 = intolerable) fitted to the hyperbolic form. The subjects (n = 84) reported uncomfortable stimulation at about 50% higher exposure than for the threshold, and about 100% higher than threshold for intolerable. Pooling these data, one can calculate a stimulus or dose response curve and a population SD curve (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 15</emphasis>). For perception, the median dB/dt rheobases were 15-T/s for the y-gradient and 26-T/s for x with similar chronaxies (0.37-ms, 0.38-ms). The stimulus was a train of 64 trapezoidal gradient lobes, resulting in 128 rectangular dB/dt pulses of duration 0.05 to 1.0-ms. Using dB/dt pulse lengths of 0.2- and 0.5-ms, there was no correlation between subject height, sex or age on stimulation</para>

            <para>Many other authors have investigated PNS perception thresholds for various combinations of axes on whole-body, MRI-related gradient systems (9, 39, 42-44). Rheobases and chronaxies from these studies are shown in Table 1. Given the range of combinations of waveforms, axes and coil designs, there is a striking consistency across these results. Taking the weighted mean from these studies, we arrive at an average dB/dt rheobase of 19.4-T/s. and a chronaxie of 0.42-ms - in agreement with topical stimulation studies (19, 22-24). Using Equations (9), (10) and (14) with a=0.4-m, b=0.2-m and σ=0.2-S/m one can deduce the rheobase for E, and J to be in the region of 3.1-V/m and 0.62-A/m<superscript>2</superscript> with a ΔB<subscript>min</subscript> of 8.1-mT.</para>

          <para>Table 2 shows a summary of PNS studies using this alternative gradient formulation of the SD curve (44, 46-50). Excluding the results from Feldman, et al. (49) who used planar coils, the weighted average minimum stimulating slew rate was 59.3-T/m/s, the minimum gradient amplitude (at infinite slew rate) for stimulation was 35.4-mT/m with a mean chronaxie of 0.69-ms. A notable observation is that there appears to be a dependence of the chronaxie on the coil dimension (44). The results from Feldman, et al. (49) show that significant increases in gradient coil performance without causing PNS are achievable, and secondly, that the chronaxie appears to have some dependence upon the coil design, and not just physiologic factors. As with earlier experiments, the linear SD formulation found no convincing correlation with anatomical measurements, including weight, height, girth, and average body fat percentage (48) although a weak correlation between ΔG<subscript>min</subscript> and the effective radius was reported (Figure 17).</para>

          <para>The simple expressions [Equations (8) to (11)] for the induced E field and current are only useful in idealized, but unrealistic geometries, or to provide an understanding of the basic principles of induction. Computational modeling of the field interactions using realistic anatomical models and gradient coil specifications have shown that the induced E-field and current densities are highly inhomogeneous for various body geometries. Both quasi-static finite difference or finite integration numerical techniques have been applied (51-54).<emphasis role="bold">Figure 18</emphasis> shows the pattern of induced E-field arising from a planar y-gradient coil with dB/dt of 100-T/m/s. So, et al. (53) used actual PNS experimental data from y- and z-gradient coils with theoretical calculation of induced electric fields in subcutaneous fat and skin, estimating the stimulation thresholds in the range 3.6 to 5.8-V/m, close the SENN model predicted value of 6.2-V/m. Strong correlations between peak induced electric field in a human model in a head/neck gradient coil and subjects' reported stimulation sites, predominantly in the front of the head, in the vicinity of the sinuses, forehead, and teeth, has been demonstrated (55). Peak induced E-fields were estimated as 40-V/m.</para>
          <para>There are a number of technical limitations to electromagnetic field modeling such as the proprietary details of commercially available gradient coil geometries, the use of a single sinusoidal gradient waveform, the requirement for computation time-saving strategies such as frequency scaling, the spatial resolution of the model, and partial volume effects where tissues are mixed within a voxel. Notwithstanding these issues, computational modeling has provided various insights into the induced electric fields and current densities and their role in peripheral nerve stimulation.</para>

The Normal Operating Mode for the MR system's gradient magnetic field is defined as 80% of the median perception threshold for PNS. The First Level Controlled Operating Mode is defined as 100% of the median perception threshold. Where MR system-specific experimental data is unavailable, theoretical data may be used.

            <title>AVOIDING PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATION (PNS) DURING MRI</title>
            <para>Although PNS is not harmful, and rarely intolerable, its avoidance is desirable for maximum patient cooperation and comfort. The strength duration behaviour in MR systems is well categorized and hence the scanner's software is able to predict the likely onset of stimulation. This is related to the type of pulse sequence. Sequences with high dB/dt include echo planar imaging (EPI) and balanced steady state free precession (SSFP) gradient echo (e.g., TruFISP, b-FFE, FIESTA). Echo planar imaging has the additional feature of the rapid train of opposed polarity readout lobes, resulting in a longer stimulus duration and greater ΔB, which is more likely to cause PNS. Notably, PNS is more likely to occur in the following instances:</para>

The y-gradient (anterior-posterior) is the most effective for stimulation with a rheobase in the range 15 to 19-T/s, and measured chronaxies are remarkably similar across many different experiments. The threshold for discomfort or pain from PNS is approximately 50 to 100% higher than the perception threshold, and not generally achievable using clinical MR systems. The longer time constant for cardiac muscle and the smaller conduction loops around the heart make direct cardiac stimulation extremely unlikely.</para>
