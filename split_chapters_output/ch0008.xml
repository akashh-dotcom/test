        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Radiofrequency (RF) energy is nonionizing, electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range of 20-kHz to 3,000-GHz (1-7). The RF spectrum includes radar, ultra high frequency (UHF), and very high frequency (VHF) television, AM and FM radio, and microwave communication frequencies. During magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), most of the transmitted radiofrequency (RF) power is transformed into heat within the patient's tissue as a result the induction of eddy currents due to the nonzero conductivity of tissue via Faraday's law. Not surprisingly, the primary health effects and safety concerns associated with RF energy-induced heating are directly related to the thermogenic qualities of this electromagnetic field (1-58). The deposition of thermalizing energy in the human body by exposure to RF fields provides a unique exception to the energy flows normally encountered by human subjects.</para>
    <para>Research investigations conducted over the last several decades have indicated that exposure to RF radiation may produce a variety of physiologic effects including those associated with alterations in visual, auditory, endocrine, neural, cardiovascular, immune, reproductive, and developmental function (1-50). In general, these biological changes occur due to RF-induced heating. Exposure to RF energy may also cause athermal, field-specific changes in biological systems that are produced without an increase in temperature (59-62). However, athermal effects associated with RF radiation are not well understood and, to date, have not been systematically studied with respect to MRI.</para>

        <title>Radiofrequency-Energy Induced Heating During MRI</title>
    <para>Prior to 1985, there were no published reports pertaining to the effects of exposing human subjects to RF energy during MRI examinations. In fact, there was a general paucity of quantitative data on thermal and other physiological responses of human subjects exposed to RF radiation from any source. The previous investigations that were conducted on this topic typically examined responses to therapeutic applications of diathermy or thermal sensations related to exposure to RF radiation (38-45). Because localized or limited exposures to RF energy were unlike the conditions that occur during MRI, the information gained from the prior studies could not be used to derive an understanding or prediction of what to expect with respect to the use of MRI technology. Therefore, to properly characterize the thermophysiological aspects of RF energy, investigations were conducted using laboratory animals, volunteer subjects, and patients (8, 9, 12-19, 24, 25, 27-37, 51-54). The resulting research yielded extremely useful and important data with regard to thermoregulatory responses to RF radiation-induced heating associated with MRI.</para>
    <para>This chapter will review and discuss the various aspects of RF energy-induced heating during MRI with an emphasis on the studies performed in human subjects to assess thermal and other physiologic responses. For additional information on this important topic, readers are referred to the chapter in this textbook by Johan van den Brink, Ph.D., <emphasis role="bold">Thermal Effects Associated with RF Exposures During Clinical MRI</emphasis>.</para>

          <title>MRI PROCEDURES AND SPECIFIC ABSORPTION RATE</title>
    <para>The thermoregulatory and other physiologic changes that a laboratory animal or human subject exhibits in response to exposure to RF radiation are directly dependent on the amount of energy that is absorbed (1-7, 22-26, 29, 31, 37, 49). The basic dosimetric term used to describe the absorption of RF radiation is the specific absorption rate, or SAR. The SAR is the mass normalized rate at which RF power is coupled to biological tissue and is typically indicated in units of watts per kilogram (W/kg).</para>
    <para>The relative amount of RF radiation that an organism encounters during an MRI examination is usually characterized with respect to the whole-body averaged and peak SAR levels (i.e., the SAR averaged in one-gram of tissue). In some instances, other values may also be reported by the MR system, including the "local" body SAR. Importantly, SAR information is used by regulatory agencies with regard to safety guidelines for the exposure to RF energy during MRI and has particular relevance with respect to scanning patients with medical implants.</para>
    <para>Notably, measurements or estimates of SAR are not trivial, particularly in human subjects (1-3, 6, 10, 49, 63). Several methods exist to determine this parameter for the purpose of RF energy dosimetry in association with the use of MRI. The SAR that is produced during MRI is a complex function of numerous variables including the frequency (i.e., determined by the strength of the static magnetic field, with resonant frequencies producing the greatest effects), the type of RF pulse used (e.g., 90° vs. 180° pulse), the repetition time, the type of transmit RF coil used (e.g., linear vs. circularly-polarized or quadrature transmission, transmit whole body vs. local RF coil, etc.), the volume of tissue contained within the RF coil, the shape of the anatomical region exposed, the orientation of the body to the field vectors, as well as other factors (1-3, 6, 10, 49, 63). Therefore, SAR, being a critical parameter that</para>

    <para>is used to ensure the safety aspects of exposure to RF energy, is difficult to calculate or estimate precisely for MRI examinations. Interestingly, MR system manufacturers appear to apply various safety or modeling factors to the SAR values reported by their scanners. Thus, manufacturers err on the side of safety when estimating SAR values for clinical MRI (10, 49).</para>

        <title>RF ENERGY-INDUCED HEATING AND MRI: EVALUATION OF LABORATORY ANIMALS</title>
    <para>Although there have been several studies performed using laboratory animals to assess thermoregulatory reactions to tissue heating associated with exposure to RF radiation, these experiments do not directly apply to the specific conditions that occur with MRI. Furthermore, the results of these investigations cannot be easily extrapolated to provide useful information for human subjects (1-5, 38, 47, 64). For example, the pattern of RF coupling and resulting absorption of RF energy to biological tissues is primarily dependent on the organism's size, anatomical features, the duration of exposure, the sensitivity of the involved tissues, and a myriad of other variables (1-5, 38, 47, 64).</para>
    <para>Importantly, it is well known that there is no laboratory animal that sufficiently mimics or simulates the thermoregulatory responses with respect to the dimensions, anatomical features, and specific responses that occur in human subjects. Therefore, experimental results obtained in laboratory animals cannot be simply "scaled" or extrapolated to predict thermoregulatory or other physiologic changes in human subjects exposed to RF radiation-induced heating during MRI. Nevertheless, experiments have been conducted in the MRI environment using laboratory animals as an initial step to determine the effects of RF energy-induced heating associated with exposures to high SAR levels (19, 27, 51-54).</para>
    <para>Shuman, et al. (19) studied laboratory dogs undergoing MRI at relatively high levels of RF energy. Superficial- and deep-tissue temperatures were measured in five animals before, during, and after exposure to RF energy determine whether significant temperature changes could be produced in association with operation of a 1.5-T/64-MHz MR system (19). The RF power output that was applied in this investigation was 6.3 times that required for routine MRI exams, with calculated SARs that averaged 7.9-W/kg (19). Shuman, et al. (19) reported that there was a linear temperature increase of several degrees, with a maximal average temperature rise of 4.6°C that was measured in the urinary bladder (i.e., a "deep" body site). Overall, the temperature elevations were slightly greater in deeper tissues compared to those recorded in superficial tissues. Shuman, et al. (19) stated that these findings suggested continued caution in the design and operation of MR systems that were capable of depositing high SAR levels, particularly when the scanners were used to image infants or patients with altered thermoregulatory capabilities.</para>
    <para>While the results of Shuman, et al. (19) are intriguing, it should be noted that this study was conducted in anesthetized laboratory animals. As such, the findings do not pertain to conscious, adult human subjects because of the previously discussed factors related to the physical dimensions of the animals and the fact that anesthetic agents substantially impact thermoregulation (65, 66). Additionally, the thermoregulatory systems of these two species are quite dissimilar (e.g., the dog pants to dissipate heat while human subjects sweat). Nev-</para>
    <para>ertheless, data obtained by Shuman, et al. (19) may have implications for the use of MRI in pediatric patients because this patient population is typically sedated or anesthetized and the physical dimensions of the laboratory dog are somewhat comparable to a pediatric patient.</para>
    <para>Barber, et al. (27) also conducted a study to determine the effects of heating related to MRI. The objective of their investigation was to provide a worst-case estimate of the thermal effects of MRI by subjecting anesthetized, unshorn sheep to RF power deposition at SAR levels well above approved standards for periods of time in excess of normal clinical imaging protocols (27). The sheep underwent MRI using a 1.5-Tesla, 64-MHz MR system. A control period with no RF power was followed by experiments using 20- to 105-minutes of RF power applications. Afterward, there was a 20-minute or longer recovery period with no RF energy applied to the sheep. Eight sheep were scanned at whole-body averaged SARs that ranged from 1.5- to 4.0-W/kg while rectal and skin temperatures were monitored. In addition to the whole-body RF exposures, Barber, et al. (27) subjected four sheep to MRI exams involving the head to determine the effects of RF energy-induced heating of the brain. The average scan time was 75-minutes and temperatures of the cornea, vitreous humor, scalp skin, jugular vein, and rectum were measured during the experiment.</para>
    <para>In the whole-body exposure experiments, elevation of rectal temperature was correlated with RF energy deposition. Deep body temperature rises in excess of 2°C were attained for the whole-body averaged SAR level of 4.0-W/kg during exposure periods greater than 82-minutes. In the head scanning experiments, skin and eye temperatures increased approximately 1.5°C. Additionally, jugular vein temperature increased a maximum of 0.4°C after an average exposure time of 75-minutes. Sheep exposed for 40-minutes to an SAR of 4.0-W/kg in either the transmit body RF coil (three sheep) or transmit head RF coil (two sheep) were recovered and observed to be in good health after 10 weeks. Importantly, no cataracts were found in the sheep (27). Thus, using this animal model, Barber, et al. (27) concluded that RF power deposition at SAR levels well above typical clinical MRI protocols caused various tissue temperatures to increase. Furthermore, for exposure periods in excess of standard clinical MRI protocols, the temperature increases were insufficient to cause adverse thermal effects (27).</para>
    <para>Shrivastava, et al. (51) investigated RF field-induced heating of the head at 9.4-Tesla in anesthetized swine. Temperatures were measured at three depths: inside the brain, in the rectum, and at the scalp skin of the swine. A 400-MHz, continuous wave RF power was deposited to the head using a volume coil. The whole-head averaged SAR values were varied between 2.7- to 5.8-W/kg. The RF power exposure durations were varied between 1.4 to 3.7 hours. In order to differentiate the temperature response caused by the RF energy from that associated with the anesthesia, temperatures were recorded in four "unheated" swine. The findings demonstrated that in vivo brain temperatures correlated well with the average SAR values. Furthermore, the skin temperature changes were not the maximum temperature alterations that were recorded, the RF energy heating caused an inhomogeneous brain temperature distribution, and the maximum temperature occurred inside the brain (51). While interesting, these findings only have relevance to MRI-related heating at 9.4-Tesla/400-MHz.</para>
    <para>In another study by Shrivastava, et al. (52) that was also conducted in swine at 9.4-Tesla/400-MHz, temperatures were measured in the scalp skin, brain, and rectum. "Sham RF" was delivered to three swine to understand the thermal effects of anesthesia. Continuous wave RF energy was delivered to six animals for 2.5 to 3.4 hours. The whole-head averaged SAR varied between 2.71-W/kg and 3.20-W/kg. Anesthesia caused the brain and rectal temperatures to decrease in a linear manner. Altered thermoregulatory responses were detected by comparing the differences in the temperature slopes before and after the delivery of RF energy. RF-induced heating significantly altered the rate of cooling down of the animal. The temperature slope changes correlated well with the RF energy per unit head weight and the duration of heating, as well as the maximum rectal temperature change during heating. Again, these results apply only to MRI-related heating at 9.4-Tesla/400-MHz.</para>
    <para>Shrivastava, et al. (53) also investigated RF heating in a porcine model at 7-Tesla/298-MHz. Temperatures were measured in the scalp skin, brain, and rectum in four pigs exposed to continuous wave RF. The RF power was delivered to the pig's head for approximately 3 hours at a whole-head averaged SAR of approximately 3-W/kg. Simple bioheat transfer models were used to simulate the RF power induced temperature changes. The results indicated that the RF power produced uniform temperature changes in the heads of the pigs with no plateau achieved during heating. The researchers concluded that validated bioheat models may predict accurate temperature changes related to RF energy-induced heating of the head. Since 7-Tesla MR systems are presently used in research and clinical settings, this information is of interest to the MRI community.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CHARACTERISTICS OF RF ENERGY-INDUCED HEATING: IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN SUBJECTS</emphasis>The physical dimensions and anatomic configurations of biologic tissues in relation to the incident wavelength are important factors that determine the relative amount and pattern of RF energy that is absorbed by the human body (1-5, 38, 47, 64). For example, if the size of the tissue is large in relation to the incident wavelength, RF energy is predominantly absorbed on the surface. If it is small relative to the wavelength, there is little absorption of RF power and, thus, the effects of heating are minimized (1-5, 38, 47, 64).</para>
    <para>As previously mentioned, tissue heating that results from the RF energy used during MRI is primarily caused by magnetic induction, with a negligible contribution from the electric fields (10, 49). Because of the RF frequencies used for MRI, this ohmic tissue heating is greatest at the surface or periphery and minimal at the center of a human subject's body. Predictive calculations and measurements obtained in phantoms, laboratory animals, and human subjects exposed to various MRI conditions support this pattern of temperature distribution (14-36, 50, 51).</para>
    <para>The actual increase in tissue temperature caused by exposure to RF energy is dependent on a variety of factors related to the thermoregulatory system of the individual and the surrounding environment (1-5, 8-38, 44-55). In regards to the thermoregulatory system, when subjected to a thermal challenge, the human body loses heat by means of convection, conduction, radiation, and evaporation (38, 67-70). Each mechanism is responsible to a varying degree for heat dissipation, as the body attempts to maintain thermal homeostasis. If the</para>
    <para>thermoregulatory effectors are not capable of totally dissipating the heat load, heat accumulates and is stored, resulting in an elevation in local and/or overall tissue temperatures (38, 67-70).</para>
    <para>Underlying health conditions may seriously impact an individual's ability to tolerate a thermal challenge. These conditions include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, fever, old age, and obesity (71-78). Various medications (e.g., diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium blockers, vasodilators, amphetamines, muscle relaxers, sedatives, anesthetic agents, etc.) can also greatly alter thermoregulatory responses to a heat load (65, 66). In fact, certain medications may have a synergistic effect with respect to tissue heating if the thermal load is specifically caused by exposure to RF radiation (65).</para>
    <para>The environmental conditions that exist in and around the MR system will also affect temperature elevations associated with RF energy-induced heating. Thus, during MRI, the amount of tissue heating that occurs is dependent upon environmental factors that include the ambient temperature, relative humidity, and airflow within and through the bore of the scanner.</para>
    <para>With further regard to the environmental conditions of the MR system, it has been proposed that, in order to counterbalance excessive tissue heating that may occur during exposure to high levels of RF energy, patients should be "pre-cooled" before their MRI exams. However, the subjective perception to the environmental temperature depends on the gradient of temperature that is sensed by the individual's peripheral thermoreceptors such as those located throughout the skin and superficial tissues. Therefore, a patient going from a cooler (i.e., using a "pre-cooled" room) to a warmer environment (i.e., the MR system) would very likely be uncomfortable.</para>

        <title>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE EVALUATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES DURING RF ENERGY-INDUCED HEATING</title>
    <para>Acquiring measurements of temperature and other physiologic parameters in human subjects within the harsh electromagnetic environment of the MR system is not a simple task. The static magnetic field of the MR system can easily create missiles out of conventional monitoring devices because they usually contain ferromagnetic components (79-82). Furthermore, the static, time-varying gradient, and RF electromagnetic fields may adversely interfere with the proper operation of monitoring equipment. In turn, the measurement devices may produce subtle or substantial artifacts by generating electromagnetic interference that can impact the quality of the MR images. Therefore, temperature recording devices and physiologic monitors must be specially designed or modified and then rigorously tested prior to use in the MRI setting. Otherwise, the data pertaining to thermal and other physiologic responses may be erroneous and misleading. Another solution to this important matter is to simply use MR Conditional monitoring equipment that has been thoroughly tested and demonstrated to work appropriately in the MR system room.</para>
    <para>Currently, MR Conditional temperature recording devices and physiologic monitors, as well as other patient support devices are commercially available for use in the MRI environment. Every physiologic parameter that is typically recorded in the critical care area</para>

    <para>or operating room setting may be obtained during MRI, including heart rate, oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, respiratory rate, blood pressure, cutaneous blood flow and, most importantly, body and skin temperatures (79-83).</para>
    <para>For the assessment of thermal responses during MRI, volunteer subjects and patients have been monitored throughout the experimental procedures using several different types of devices (9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 24-36, 79-84). For example, sublingual pocket or tympanic membrane temperatures have been obtained immediately before and after MRI using sensitive electronic thermometry or infrared devices. Notably, there is a good relationship between temperatures measured in the sublingual pocket or tympanic membrane and esophageal temperature, which is an indicator of core or "deep" temperature.</para>
    <para>Skin temperatures have been measured immediately before and after MRI examinations using highly sensitive and accurate infrared thermometry or digital thermographic equipment (9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 24, 25, 31). Body and skin temperatures measured at multiple sites have been recorded before, during, and after MRI using a fluoroptic (i.e., fiber-optic) thermometry system that is unperturbed by electromagnetic radiation of all types, including static magnetic fields of up to 9.0-Tesla (9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 24, 25, 31, 83). Heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and cutaneous blood flow, which are important physiological variables that change in human subjects in response to a thermal load, have been monitored before, during, and after MRI to assess the reaction of the thermoregulatory system to exposures to RF energy-induced heating. All of these parameters may be assessed using devices that have been extensively tested and demonstrated to provide sensitive and accurate data in the MRI environment.</para>

          <title>RF ENERGY-INDUCED HEATING AND MRI: ASSESSMENT OF VOLUNTEER SUBJECTS AND PATIENTS</title>
    <para>As previously described in this chapter, the increase in tissue temperature caused by exposure to RF energy during MRI depends on multiple physical, physiological, and environmental factors. These include the rate at which RF energy is deposited, the status of the patient's thermoregulatory system, the presence of an underlying health condition or medications, and the ambient conditions within the MR system.</para>
    <para>Although the main cause of tissue heating associated with MRI is attributed to RF radiation, reports have suggested that exposure to powerful static magnetic fields may also cause temperature changes (85, 86). However, the mechanism responsible for such an effect remains unclear. Nevertheless, the results of these previously published studies warranted investigations in human subjects to determine the possible contribution of the static magnetic field to temperature changes that may be observed during MRI (87-89).</para>
    <para>Studies have been performed in human subjects exposed to a 1.5-Tesla static magnetic field to evaluate thermal alterations produced in body and/or skin temperatures (87, 88). The data revealed that there were no statistically significant alterations in any of the recorded tissue temperature or other physiologic parameter. Chakeres, et al. (89) evaluated human subjects exposed to an 8-Tesla static magnetic field and reported no significant change in body temperature. Furthermore, Tenforde (90) examined this phenomenon in laboratory ro-</para>

    <para>dents exposed to static magnetic fields of as high as 7.55-Tesla and also reported no thermal effect. Accordingly, static magnetic fields used for clinical and research applications do not cause an elevation in body temperature. As far as the potential for the production of heat by time-varying gradient magnetic fields is concerned, an elevation in tissue temperature is not believed to occur due to MRI (15, 19, 20, 22).</para>
    <para>With respect to the effects of RF energy-induced heating, Schaefer, et al. (8) conducted the first study of human thermal responses associated with MRI in 1985. It should be realized that, during this time, the whole-body averaged SAR recommended by the United Kingdom, National Radiological Protection Board and the United States, Food and Drug Administration for clinical MRI was 0.4-W/kg (91, 92), which is an order of magnitude lower than what it is today (93, 94). Temperature changes and other physiologic parameters were assessed in volunteer subjects exposed to relatively high, whole-body averaged SAR levels (approximately 4.0-W/kg). The findings indicated that there were no excessive temperature elevations or other deleterious physiologic consequences related to exposure to RF radiation (8).</para>
    <para>Several studies were subsequently conducted involving volunteer subjects and patients undergoing MRI at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz with the intent of obtaining information that would be applicable to the patient population typically encountered in the MRI setting (12, 13, 15-18, 24, 25, 28, 30-36). The whole-body averaged SAR levels ranged from approximately 0.05-W/kg (e.g., for MRI exams involving the use of a transmit/receive head RF coil) to 6.0-W/kg (e.g., for MRI exams involving the spine or abdomen with a transmit/receive body RF coil), which greatly exceeds the limit for the whole-body averaged SAR of 4.0-W/kg (12, 13, 15-18, 24, 25, 28, 30-36, 93, 94). By way of example, Figure 1 shows the body and skin temperature changes related to MRI performed at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz and a whole-body averaged SAR of 2.8-W/kg.</para>
    <para>Boss, et al. (32) conducted one of the few investigations that addressed heating at 3-Tesla/128-MHz in human subjects. Eighteen volunteers were divided into three groups: those that underwent MRI of the (1) head, (2) pelvis, or (3) knee. MRI was performed up to the First Level Controlled Operating Mode, allowing RF radiation up to the legal limit for the whole-body averaged SAR (i.e., 4.0-W/kg). Temperature changes were measured using a fiber-optic thermometer and an infrared camera. Temperature rises were highest for the scans involving the pelvis compared to the head and knee. There were no significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure. The authors concluded that MRI at 3-Tesla/128-MHz resulted in measurable and perceptible thermal energy deposition. However, under the conditions of the study, the physiological changes were regarded as safe concerning thermoregulatory and cardiovascular stress.</para>
    <para>Isaacson, et al. (33) determined core body temperature (i.e., temporal artery temperature) variations in a large group of pediatric patients (N = 400) that underwent MRI on 1.5-Tesla or 3-Tesla scanners, with and without propofol sedation. For patients with complete pre- and post-MRI temperature data, mean temperatures did not significantly change. However, temperature changes differed significantly between propofol-sedated and non-sedated patients (i.e., non-sedated patients had slightly higher temperatures). Patients scanned at 3-Tesla had statistically higher temperature changes compared to those scanned at 1.5-Tesla.</para>

Note that there were little or no changes in body temperature, whereas there were slight to moderate changes in skin temperatures depending on the site of measurement during MRI. After MRI, some skin temperatures returned to the baseline level, whereas others remained elevated during the 20-min post-MRI evaluation period.</para>
  <para>In another investigation involving pediatric patients imaged at 3-Tesla, Cawley, et al. (34) recorded rectal temperatures in 25 neonates that underwent MRI of the brain and reported no significant "hyperthermic threat".</para>
    <para>Fumagalli, et al. (36) evaluated the effects of MRI of the brain at 3-Tesla in 49 newborns (i.e., born preterm and at term). Rectal and skin temperatures, oxygen saturation and heart rate were recorded before, during, and after the scans. There was a statistically significant increase in skin temperature, while there was no significant change in rectal temperature, heart rate or oxygen saturation. The investigators concluded that core temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation in newborns were not affected by 3-T MRI of the brain.</para>
    <para>Kim, et al. (35) investigated the relationship between the increase in body temperature and the RF power deposited during routine clinical MRI exams of the head at 1.5-Tesla and 3-Tesla. Tympanic membrane temperature was recorded in 69 patients immediately before and after MRI. The findings indicated a link between increasing age and body temperature, as well as an influence of the field strength of the MRI exam. Thus, a higher increase in body temperature was observed in older patients after a 3-Tesla MRI procedure compared to a 1.5-Tesla scan.</para>
    <para>To date, the studies performed in human subjects demonstrated that changes in body temperatures were physiologically inconsequential (i.e., less than 1.0°C). While there was a tendency for statistically significant increases in skin temperatures to occur, these were not physiologically deleterious or otherwise problematic. Furthermore, there were no sub-</para>
    <para>stantial alterations in the hemodynamic parameters that were assessed during these investigations (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, and cutaneous blood flow).</para>
    <para>Interestingly, research has indicated that there is a poor correlation between changes in body and skin temperatures versus whole-body averaged SARs for clinical MRI exams <emphasis role="bold">(Figure 2)</emphasis>. This finding is not surprising considering the previously mentioned myriad of variables that may alter thermal responses in a patient population. Therefore, the thermal responses to a given whole-body averaged SAR may be extremely variable depending on the individual's thermoregulatory system and the presence of one or more underlying condition(s) that can alter or impair the ability to dissipate heat, as well as the environmental conditions of the MR system room.</para>
    <para>Presently, the highest level of exposure to RF energy that has been reported for human subjects undergoing MRI is a whole-body averaged SAR of 6.0-W/kg (31). In this investigation, Shellock, et al. (31) conducted experiments involving volunteer subjects to characterize thermal and other physiologic responses to this high level of RF energy. The motivation for this study coincided with the advent of pulse sequences that had relatively high SAR levels associated with their use.</para>
    <para>The temperature of the tympanic membrane (i.e., an index of deep body temperature) and seven different skin temperatures were monitored along with blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and cutaneous blood flow <emphasis role="bold">(Figure 3)</emphasis>(31). Measurements were obtained immediately before, during, and after exposure to RF energy. Statistically significant increases in the temperatures of the tympanic membrane and the skin of the chest, abdomen, upper arm, hand, and thigh occurred. In addition, there were statistically significant increases in heart rate and cutaneous blood flow associated with exposure to the high SAR level. Importantly, the tissue temperature increases were within acceptable, safe levels and none of the other physiological changes were considered to be deleterious to human subjects. Of particular note is that these data indicated that an MRI exam performed at a whole-body averaged SAR of 6.0-W/kg can be tolerated by an individual with normal thermoregulatory function (31).</para>
    <para>While the data obtained so far are encouraging regarding the lack of substantial health effects from exposure to high SAR levels associated with MRI, it must be remembered that patients may have compromised thermoregulatory systems that could substantially alter their ability to handle a heat load (65, 66, 72-78).

Therefore, additional investigations are warranted to specifically address this important safety issue.</para>

          <title>The Testes</title>
    <para>Laboratory investigations have demonstrated that RF energy-induced heating may have detrimental effects on testicular function. The temperature of the testes correlates directly with the temperature of the scrotal skin (96). This temperature level exists because the scrotum has little or no subcutaneous fat or connective tissue and, as such, there is no tissue mediated temperature gradient present. If the exposure level to RF energy increases scrotal and/or testicular temperatures to between 38°C to 42°C (41), this heating can cause a reduction or cessation of spermatogenesis, impaired sperm motility, degeneration of seminiferous tubules, as well as other abnormal conditions (41, 96). Notably, there is a direct relationship between temperature and sperm motility and viability.</para>
    <para>In 1990, Shellock, et al. (28) conducted an investigation to examine the thermal effects of MRI performed at 1.5-Tesla on the scrotum to determine if excessive heating of this body part occurred. A non-contact infrared thermometer was used to measure scrotal skin tem-</para>
    <para>perature (i.e., an indicator of testicular temperature) immediately before and after MRI performed at relatively high SAR levels (28). A statistically significant increase in scrotal skin temperature was associated with MRI. The highest temperature that was recorded was 34.2°C (28), which is well below the threshold known to alter or adversely affect the function of the testes (41, 96).</para>
    <para>Excessive heating of the scrotum associated with MRI could exacerbate a pre-existing disorder associated with increased testicular temperature (e.g., febrile illnesses, varicocele, etc.) in patients who are already oligospermic, leading to temporary or permanent sterility. Therefore, additional investigations designed to investigate this issue with regard to the testes are warranted, particularly if patients are subjected to MRI using RF energy levels that are greater than those previously evaluated. This scenario is entirely possible considering the widespread use of pulse sequences that utilize high levels of RF energy (e.g., fast or turbo spin echo sequences) and MR systems operating at higher static magnetic field strengths, including clinical 3-Tesla and 7-Tesla scanners that inherently use higher whole-body averaged specific absorption rates.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The Eye</emphasis></para>
    <para>Dissipation of heat from the eye is a slow and inefficient process due to its relative lack of vascularization (39, 95). Exposure to RF energy has been reported to cause a variety of ocular effects, primarily cataracts but also effects on the retina, cornea, and other ocular systems (39, 94). Cataracts have been observed in experimental animals when one eye was exposed to a localized, very high RF field and the other eye was the unexposed control. In the rabbit eye, cataracts developed secondary to RF exposures that generated temperatures greater than or equal to 41°C (39, 95). However, cataracts were not observed in the monkey eye subjected to similar exposure conditions, reflecting the different patterns of energy absorption due to anatomical differences (39, 95). Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that an SAR level that would induce temperatures of 41°C or higher in or near the lens in the human eye could produce cataracts by the same mechanism (i.e., heating) that caused cataracts in the rabbit lens (39, 95).</para>
    <para>Other ocular effects including corneal lesions, retinal effects, and changes in vascular permeability have been observed after localized exposure of the eyes of laboratory animals to both continuous wave and pulsed wave exposures of RF energy, but the inconsistencies in these results, the failure to independently confirm corneal lesions after continuous wave exposure, the failure to independently confirm retinal effects after pulsed wave exposure, and the absence of functional changes in vision are reasons why these ocular effects are not useful in defining a particular adverse effect level for RF energy (95). The results from long term studies involving nonhuman primates support the conclusion that clinically significant ocular effects, including cataracts, have not been confirmed in human subjects exposed to low level RF energy (95).</para>
    <para>An investigation conducted by Sacks, et al. (14) in 1986 which utilized a spectrometer operating at 2.7-Tesla/29-MHz revealed that there were no discernible effects on the eyes of laboratory rats at RF energy and exposure levels (6 hours) that far exceeded levels used in the clinical MRI setting. However, as previously indicated, when it comes to the effects of RF radiation, it is unacceptable to extrapolate data from laboratory animals to human</para>

    <para>subjects because, in this case, the coupling of RF radiation to the eye of a rat is markedly different compared to a human subject (i.e., with respect to size, shape, and anatomic position).</para>
    <para>Shellock, et al. (17, 30) performed two clinical studies to evaluate the thermal effects of RF energy-induced heating of the eye associated with MRI. In both investigations, corneal temperatures were measured using a non-contact infrared thermometer immediately before and after MRI. Notably, corneal temperature is a representative site of the average temperature of the human eye (97).</para>
    <para>In the first study, corneal temperatures were measured in patients undergoing MRI of the brain using a transmit/receive head RF coil at peak SARs ranged from 2.5- to 3.1-W/kg (17). The greatest change in corneal temperature change was 1.8°C and the highest temperature measured was 34.4°C. The second study examined corneal temperatures in patients with suspected ocular pathology who underwent MRI using the transmit body RF coil and a special eye coil for RF reception (30). Fast spin echo pulse sequences were used to examine the eye. The peak SARs for these sequences ranged from 3.3- to 8.4-W/kg. The greatest temperature change was 1.8°C and the highest corneal temperature measured was 35.1°C (30).</para>
    <para>Therefore, the findings from these two clinical investigations indicated that corneal temperatures did not exceed the upper limit of normal for the human cornea, which is 36°C (95, 97). Thus, it does not appear that clinical MRI under the conditions studied has the potential to cause thermal damage to ocular tissue. However, with higher RF energy used for research and clinical MRI applications, such as those involving ultra-high-field scanners, the thermal effects on ocular tissue requires further assessment.</para>

          <title>MRI AND "HOT SPOTS"</title>
    <para>Theoretically, during exposure to RF energy, "hot spots" (i.e., an excessive concentration of RF energy) may develop due to an uneven distribution of RF power in human subjects in association with restrictive conductive patterns (3, 5, 8, 9). Obviously, an unwanted result of RF energy-induced hot spots would be thermal hot spots, or localized elevations in tissue temperature.</para>
    <para>Because RF radiation is mainly absorbed by peripheral tissues during MRI, surface thermography was used to study the heating pattern in volunteer subjects exposed to relatively high whole-body averaged SARs at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz (8, 9). The findings of this research demonstrated that there was no evidence of surface thermal "hot spots" (8, 9). Apparently, the thermoregulatory system responds to any RF radiation-related "hot spot" by evenly distributing the thermal load via cutaneous circulation.</para>
    <para>There is the possibility that thermal "hot spots" may develop internally during MRI. For example, Shuman, et al. (19) reported that significant temperature increases occurred in the internal organs of laboratory dogs as a result of MRI performed at high SAR levels. These findings suggested that internal thermal "hot spots" may occur in association with MRI. Therefore, the presence of possible internal "hot spots" needs to be thoroughly examined in human subjects undergoing MRI, with the addition of investigations performed</para>
    <para>using higher field strengths, clinical scanners operating 3-Tesla/128-MHz and 7-Tesla/298-MHz. This could be accomplished noninvasively using MRI thermometry, which is based on temperature-sensitive MRI parameters such as the proton resonance frequency, the diffusion coefficient, T1 and T2 relaxation times, magnetization transfer, as well as temperature-sensitive contrast agents (98, 99).</para>

          <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <para>The characteristics of RF energy-induced heating associated with MRI have been presented with an emphasis on research pertaining to laboratory animals and human subjects. These investigations began in the mid-1980s and continue to the present day. Of note is that the majority of the studies were conducted at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz. Many of the investigations performed after the mid-1990s involved attempts to predict or study the heating aspects of RF energy by using modeling-based investigations, temperatures obtained in phantoms or, in a few instances, temperatures recorded in laboratory animals (40-54, 100-121). Without validation in human subjects, including patient populations, the safety of exposures to high levels of RF energy remains unknown.</para>
    <para>Because MR systems operating at higher field strengths and frequencies are used for research and clinical applications (3-, 4-, 7-, 9.4-, 10.5-Tesla) (51-55, 100, 101, 122, 123), and there are new clinical applications (e.g., advanced pulse sequences, specialized transmit RF coils, etc.) with associated greater levels of RF radiation, additional investigations are necessary to assess the effects of heating. Importantly, studies are particularly needed to evaluate patients with conditions that impair heat dissipation.</para>
