        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Active implants may pose hazards to patients referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures. An active implant is defined as one that relies on its function from a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity (1). In contrast, a passive implant, such as a coronary artery stent, hemostatic clip, or hip prosthesis, does not require electrical power or other external energy in its operation or during its intended use. Some active implants have external leads and electrodes for delivery of electric current for therapy and/or for physiologic sensing. Examples of active implants include cardiac pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), neurostimulation systems, bone growth stimulators, and cochlear implants. Other types of active implants, such as implantable drug infusion pumps, use electrical power for operation but may not have attached metallic leads and electrodes.</para>

        <title>IN-VITRO TESTS OF HEATING</title>
    <para>Implants with conducting leads have been referred to as "MR Critical" with respect to radiofrequency (RF) heating because of the length of the metallic materials (2). Testing in phantoms has demonstrated the potential for significant temperature rises at the electrodes of leads that are part of an active implant system (3). For example, Rezai, et al. (4) measured a temperature rise of 25.3°C on the tip of a deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead in a phantom</para>

(5) reported a temperature increase of 63.1°C at the electrode tip for a cardiac pacing lead not connected to a pulse generator (PG) under 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz conditions. Luechinger (6) measured an RF-induced temperature rise in laboratory animals (pigs). A maximum temperature increase of 15°C was measured for a passive fixation lead and a temperature rise in excess of 30°C was measured for a "cork-screw" fixation lead (6). No significant threshold or impedance changes of the cardiac pacing leads were measured nor did pathology indicate any heat-related damage under the conditions used in this investigation.</para>

        <title>CLINICAL RELEVANCE</title>
    <para>An understanding of heating behavior for active implant-related leads is crucial to establishing patient safety in association with the use of MRI. Excessive heating at the electrode could damage the surrounding tissue, which may be particularly serious for neurological or cardiac tissue. Active implants with lead wires are mostly contraindicated for MRI primarily because of the large temperature rises that have been reported in laboratory testing. Before an implant manufacturer can receive regulatory approval for a given product relative to the use of MRI, tests and analyses must be undertaken to document that a patient with the implant can safely undergo an MRI procedure. This is particularly important for active implants.</para>
    <para>Several active implants have labeling approved for patients needing MRI examinations including cardiac devices, neurostimulation systems, cochlear implants, and others. For example, the first cardiac pacemaker approved in the United States (U.S.) for MRI was the Revo MRI SureScan Pacing System (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) (7). Patients with the Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) System (Cyberonics, Inc. and LivaNova) and the Activa Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) may safely undergo MRI by following highly specific conditions (8, 9).</para>
    <para>MRI-related heating of active implants without external leads is expected to be similar for a passive implant with similar geometry and materials (10). However, interactions of the electromagnetic fields with the device circuitry could result in heating or other issues. For example, magnetic saturation of a transformer core by the static magnetic field of the scanner may result in additional power delivery by a battery.</para>

        <title>MECHANISM OF RADIOFREQUENCY FIELD-RELATED HEATING</title>
    <para>The radiofrequency (RF) field used during MRI induces an electric field in the patient or the phantom (i.e., in the case of evaluating heating for implants and devices). The frequency of the RF electric field is the same as that of the RF magnetic field, 64-MHz for 1.5-T and 128-MHz for 3-T. The electric field results in power deposition from the ohmic heating of tissues. The specific absorption rate (SAR) with units of W/kg is the metric for the RF power.</para>
    <para>The mechanism for heating of an implant during MRI is coupling of the metal with the electric fields. The tangential component of the electric field along the length of the lead</para>
    <para>induces waves of electric current on the lead (11). These waves produce an electric field in the vicinity of the electrode, which produces heating of the tissue. There may also be measurable temperature rises due to ohmic heating by the induced RF current through the conducting wires in a lead.</para>
    <para>Thus, the temperature rise at an electrode is due to the tangential electric field along the entire length of the lead. This concept was quantified by Park, et al. (12) using a transfer function (TF) method. The temperature rise may be expressed as</para>
    <para>ΔT = A[∫<subscript>0</subscript><superscript>L</superscript> E<subscript>tan</subscript>(τ)S(τ)dτ]<superscript>2</superscript>                    (1)</para>
    <para>In Equation (1), A is a constant with units of °C/(V/m)<superscript>2</superscript>, E<subscript>tan</subscript> is the tangential electric field, distance τ = 0 at the electrode and τ = L at the generator, and S is the transfer function (i.e., the lead model) between the incident E<subscript>tan</subscript> and the scattered electric field near the electrode. The dimensions of S are inverse length. Both S and E<subscript>tan</subscript> are complex, that is, they have magnitude and phase.</para>
    <para>Due to phase effects, it is possible to have a high or low temperature rise for different lead paths in the phantom with similar magnitude of E<subscript>tan</subscript>. This phenomenon was demonstrated by Mattei, et al. (13) who measured temperature rises for leads in a phantom for 374 different configurations. This group reported that the observed temperature rise at the tip of a pacemaker lead depended on the path in the phantom and whether or not the pulse generator was attached to the lead. In tests conducted in a circular phantom, Langman, et al. (14) also found that heating depended on the termination conditions at the generator end of the lead. Importantly, heating of a lead will also depend on how it is constructed. Nordbeck, et al. (15) measured RF heating of unipolar and bipolar pacing lead assemblies in a rectangular phantom. It was concluded that heating could be reduced by changes in the configuration of the lead. Mattei, et al. (16) tested the role of lead structure by in vitro measurements on 30 commercial cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads in a rectangular phantom. At a whole-body averaged exposure SAR of 1-W/kg, the recorded temperature rises ranged from 2.4°C to 15°C. These tests were conducted for straight-line placement of the lead in the phantom and, thus, it is possible that greater rises would be measured for other lead paths.</para>

        <title>CALCULATION OF RADIOFREQUENCY FIELD-RELATED HEATING</title>
    <para>The temperature rise of a passive implant in a phantom, such as a spine prosthesis or fixation device can be accurately calculated (17) and these types of simulations are described elsewhere in this textbook. Calculation of the transfer function and consequent temperature rise for an implanted lead is difficult because of the intricate and complicated geometry of the lead. The lead conductors have a minimum feature of the order of tens of microns, which is of the order of 10<superscript>5</superscript> greater than the length of the lead. Park, et al. (12) calculated S and RF-induced temperature rises for bare and insulated wires using method of moments. Neufeld, et al. (18) calculated heating for a straight insulated wire and for a helical wire</para>
    <para>using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. Both groups reported agreement between calculations and measurements with a 17% uncertainty determined by Neufeld, et al. (18).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION ISO/TS 10974 FOR MRI AND ACTIVE IMPLANTS</emphasis></para>
    <para>A joint working group commissioned by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) developed a draft International Technical Specification ISO/TS 10974:2018 that provides test methods for MRI-related hazards associated with an active implantable medical device (AIMD) including RF-induced heating (1). The technical specification (TS) presents an approach with four tiers for assessment of RF heating of active implants. Tier 1 has the simplest test and computation requirements, but also requires the most conservative assumptions on incident RF energy. Tiers 2 and 3 progressively require more measurements and simulations, but are able to use successively less overestimation of test field magnitudes. Tier 4 requires the most stringent computational analysis and utilizes the least overestimation of test field magnitudes.</para>
    <para>Cabot, et al. (19) evaluated RF heating of a generic deep brain stimulator in 1.5-T/64-MHz as a vehicle to test the four tiers of ISO/TSO 10974. The model implant consisted of a stainless steel "can", a dielectric header, and leads consisting of either an insulating helical copper lead or an insulated straight copper lead. Lead lengths of 50-, 100-, 150-, and 200-mm were evaluated. Simulations for this implant, which is much simpler than an actual DBS device, required as many as 500 x 10<superscript>6</superscript> mesh cells. Simulations were run on an accelerated cluster and it was projected that carrying out the estimated 12,000 simulations for a Tier 4 analysis would take several decades. Cabot, et al. (19) concluded with a suggestion for a procedure that follows a test strategy between Tier 3 and Tier 4.</para>
    <para>In consideration of the above, the following information should be considered regarding MRI-related heating and active implants: (1) Heating at the electrode of an implanted lead used for a cardiac pacemaker, neurostimulation system, or other similar device that has an active lead may be significantly greater than the threshold risk of approximately 6 to 7°C for tissue injury (20). (2) Heating at the electrode is a complicated function of the magnitude and phase of the incident E<subscript>tan</subscript> over the entire length of the lead. If only phantom tests are used to characterize lead heating behavior, a significant number of these tests may be required. (3) Current computational methods are not capable of accurately calculating the temperature rise for a clinically relevant lead wire. (4) A combined approach of innovative measurements and complementary computations will improve the accuracy and efficiency of determining the temperature rise of the lead over the clinically relevant range of incident E<subscript>tan</subscript>.</para>
    <para>A primary purpose of this chapter is to describe test methods and analyses to predict the heating that an active implant would undergo during MRI. The test case is a commercial neurostimulation system used for vagus nerve stimulation (Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) System (Cyberonics, Inc. and LivaNova). First, the transfer function, S, is developed from electrical measurements of the response of the lead</para>
