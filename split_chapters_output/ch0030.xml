      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <para>Maintaining safety in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment is a never-ending challenge, whether it is part of a clinical facility or one that is restricted to research studies. There are, however, specific concerns that may only be encountered in a research facility due to the variety of individuals allowed to access the MRI environment, including those present for the development of software, hardware, and ancillary equipment. This calls for specific policies and procedures that are vigilantly maintained by those managing and supporting MRI laboratories in the research setting.</para>
      <para>Over the years, there appears that the number of reported MRI safety incidents is increasing. There are many theories as to why this is happening including an increase in the number of MR systems worldwide, the increase in the number of scanners with higher static magnetic fields being installed especially at research facilities, the improvement in the reporting of such incidents, the increase in the number of MR systems being installed in departments and facilities outside of the traditional radiology department, an increase in the overall number of MRI examinations performed, or possibly more incidents are actually occurring.</para>
      <para>In consideration of the above, an investment is required to ensure that the utmost is being done to maintain safety for patients and volunteer subjects, researchers, faculty and staff members. Understanding this investment requires both time and money, paving the way for a successful MRI safety program. Importantly, it takes only one mistake for the freedom that an MRI research facility currently enjoys to be revoked. Therefore, we must act responsibly and out of concern for study subjects, patients, and staff members.</para>

      <title>DESIGN AND ACCESS OF THE MRI ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <sect2 id="ch0030s0000s0002s0001">
        <title>Zones of the MRI Environment</title>
        <para>Since the early developments of interventional or intra-operative MR systems, the areas associated with the MRI department have been divided into specific sections as a method to clearly identify which individuals and equipment are given access, and under which conditions. This was further reinforced by the American College of Radiology (ACR) document on MRI safety, first published in 2002 and updated in later years, thus, identifying and demarcating the four "zones" of an MRI department (1-6).</para>
        <para>Basically, the four zones described by the ACR include as follows, the area typically accessed by the general public (Zone 1); the dressing room, bathroom and patient preparation room (Zone 2); control room used for MR system operation (Zone 3); and the scanner room (Zone 4). The MRI suite of rooms should include specific areas separated by locked doors using card key access or other means to control access, but not combination locks. The codes for combination locks can be easily communicated to many individuals, requiring multiple changes to maintain security.</para>
        <para>The initial design of the MRI suite includes critical details, as follows: card key locked access from the hallway, lobby, or reception area into the MRI suite; easy visual access from the control room of the MR system room door and the path leading from the dressing room and patient preparation room towards the scanner room door; visual access from the control room into the MR system room; emergency exhaust fan controls located inside and outside of the scanner room; quench button for a superconducting magnet located immediately inside or outside of the scanner room door; and video observation of the inside of the bore of the MR system.</para>
        <para>It may be problematic to move walls due to cost and space issues when planning to renovate an MRI suite for enhanced safety. Therefore, it is critical to focus on what can be done to ensure maximum safety through reduced and controlled access to the various areas of the MRI environment (1-6). Doors with locked access should be in place between general access areas such as main hallways, waiting rooms and reception areas (i.e., Zone 1) and Zones 2, 3, and 4. Only individuals appropriately screened and accompanied by trained MRI staff members are allowed to access the dressing room and patient preparation room (Zone 2) and the MR system room (Zone 4). Patients and volunteer subjects should never be allowed unaccompanied access past Zone 1 into Zones 2, 3 or 4, and should never be left unattended in Zones 2, 3 or 4 at any time.</para>

        <title>Access</title>
        <para>Policies and procedures must be in place that clearly identify which kind of access is given to each of the MRI staff members as well as MRI physicians, other healthcare professionals supporting patients or volunteers undergoing the MRI examination, clinicians, and family members. For example, technologist aides may be allowed to initially review the completed screening form with patients or volunteer subjects, and accompany them to the dressing room and give initial preparation instructions. The MRI technologist or radiographer conducts the final review of the completed screening form and accompanies the</para>

          <para>Current and appropriate signage, especially immediately before entering the MR system room (Zone 4) is an absolute requirement (1-4). Other forms of warning to individuals entering the area of the dangers of the MRI environment are also recommended. These include MRI warning rugs, stanchions, placards, or gates placed in front of the door leading into the scanner room (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>). Frequently, something more three-dimensional or that provides a tactile experience is extremely helpful in reminding all individuals about the potential danger of entering the MR system room.</para>

          <emphasis role="bold">Assigned Responsibilities, Education, and Training</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Depending upon the number and type of scanners present in the research facility, an adequate number of appropriate staff should be present to support the various research stud-</para>
        <para>ies and patient examinations (1-5). This includes but is not limited to: MRI technologists/radiographers, nurses, receptionists, assistants and/or technologist aides, radiologists and/or clinicians, administrative support, and/or research associates (e.g., doctoral, Ph.D., scientists). Current policies and procedures must include the assigned level of responsibility for each staff member. This will determine the level of education and hands-on training required for each. In addition to the staff previously listed, limited but appropriate training will also need to be provided to other individuals including: housekeeping and maintenance personnel, ancillary staff (nursing, respiratory therapy, etc.), physicians, firefighters, police and security officers, and first responders. Of particular importance is for firefighting personnel that may respond to a fire or other emergency at the facility to undergo MRI safety training in order to acquaint them with the dangers of the MRI environment.</para>
        <para>In order to properly support scientific research studies, the MRI technologists/radiographers must possess a thorough working knowledge of MRI. Using research software, hardware, radiofrequency (RF) coils, and prototype accessory devices can result in a variety of artifacts and other imaging challenges including safety. Possessing a clear understanding of the principles and physics of MRI allows the technologists/radiographers to quickly address MR system difficulties resulting in the successful completion of research studies. Competency lists are excellent tools to determine the educational needs of each staff member. At a minimum, these lists should include: anatomy and physiology; MRI physics and principles; scan parameters and imaging options; safe and appropriate use of RF coils and other ancillary equipment including physiologic monitoring systems; patient and volunteer subject preparation, instruction and communication; positioning and immobilization; sterile technique; and emergency procedures.</para>
        <para>Ongoing education is a must in the rapidly changing world of MRI especially in the research facility. Time and financial support must be provided to ensure that all staff members maintain a comprehensive knowledge in order to competently support the research MRI studies being conducted. Continuing education can be obtained through attendance at educational seminars, completion of online webinars, and video training. Subscription to the MRI technologist society, the Section for Magnetic Resonance Radiographers and Technologists (www.ismrm.org/smrt/) provides educational support with current knowledge shared by peers and other experts in the field. The investment in continuing education for MRI technologists/radiographers results in knowledgeable, productive healthcare professionals. Understanding MRI physics and principles are necessary to comprehend the issues in MRI safety and screening. It also clearly communicates to the staff that they are a valued part of the team resulting in responsible, interested individuals. In addition, enlisting the faculty at the research facility to use their specific expertise to provide training to the MRI technologists/radiographers provide the foundation for successful teamwork. This results in the successful completion of research studies because the staff comprehends the facility's priorities. Both didactic and hands-on training are equally valuable in this comprehensive training program.</para>

      <title>MRI Safety Committee</title>
      <para>A most critical asset for a research MRI facility is that of a Safety Committee (1-5). The safety officers who sit on this committee are responsible for setting MRI safety and</para>

        <para>screening policies and procedures. They must be afforded time and resources to maintain their MRI safety and screening expertise. The safety officers are selected from those with an advanced knowledge in MRI and MRI safety. To ensure comprehensive safety support, the committee should include an MRI technologist/radiographer, a radiologist or MRI clinician, and an MRI scientist (e.g., typically a doctoral level person, Ph.D.). The MRI technologist/radiographer and radiologist/MRI clinician are primarily responsible for making all decisions concerning MRI pre-procedure screening of patients, volunteer subjects and researchers. The MRI scientist provides the expert understanding of hardware and software necessary for comprehensive decision-making.</para>

    <sect1 id="ch0030s0000s0004">
      <title>Research MRI Procedures Conducted by MRI Technologists</title>
      <para>MRI research examinations that involve the administration of contrast agents, interventional procedures, the introduction of intra-cavitary coils, and patients or volunteer subjects with special concerns such as paralysis require the presence of an MRI research technologist/radiographer (2, 3, 5). Proficiency in sterile technique and intravenous (IV) set up procedures is part of the competency required by the MRI technologist/radiographer. As healthcare professionals are trained in the skills of medical procedures and patient communication, this background is extremely valuable to ensure patient comfort and safety during IV placement, positioning of the patient or volunteer subject with the IV line in place, resuscitation procedures in the event of a reaction to the IV placement or injection, extravasation issues, and/or insertion of an endo-rectal RF coil.</para>
      <para>The IV administration of contrast media requires the presence of a minimum of two healthcare professionals. In addition to the MRI technologist, either a nurse, physician or tech aide is required to ensure safety for the patient or volunteer subject during IV placement. If the patient should suddenly lose consciousness, it will require two trained healthcare professionals to safely and successfully address the situation (i.e., to slowly lower the subject's head to the same level as the body while maintaining control over the IV site). A physician trained in emergency care is required to be present in the MRI suite during the injection of the contrast media and for a short period thereafter (approximately 15 minutes) to ensure there are no resulting reactions or complications (1, 2).</para>
      <para>It is also extremely beneficial that an MRI technologist/radiographer be present for more complex animal model research studies. In addition to the operation of the MR system, this individual's responsibility includes maintaining a safe environment for people and equipment. Research studies commonly involve multiple individuals (researchers, clinicians, surgeons, veterinarians, and veterinary technicians) who are present in the MRI environment but engaged in their specific roles, focusing on their particular research needs and outcomes of the research study. In addition to protecting the many individuals working in the research study, the MRI technologist/radiographer is responsible for preventing expensive damage to the MR system and maintaining cleanliness standards required for human MRI examinations (patients and volunteer subjects) following the animal model study.</para>

    <sect1 id="ch0030s0000s0005">
      <title>MRI Procedures Conducted by Researchers</title>
      <para>Researchers may be allowed to conduct research studies on phantoms and human subjects without an MRI technologist/radiographer present. The researchers must first complete</para>
      <para>their requirements for MR system access and use, including MRI safety and policy and procedure training, hands-on scanner training, RF coil training, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training (3, 4, 7). In addition, it is policy that any scanner equipment or accessory issues, or human subject screening question issues be reported immediately to the appropriate support staff or the MRI Safety Committee for resolution.</para>
      <para>During weekdays (e.g., 7:00 am to 6:00 pm), a minimum of two safety-trained researchers should be present for all scans on human subjects including normal, healthy volunteers, as well as patients. To ensure safety and fulfill the ability to manage any emergent situation involving a human subject such as a loss of consciousness, seizure, or other serious event, a minimum of two safety-trained researchers should be required to be present for all evening, night and weekend scans being conducted (5). This is further discussed below in emergent cradle/table operation.</para>
      <para>All new MRI accessories, equipment, devices, RF coils, furniture, and patient support equipment are required to be reviewed by the MRI Manager (MRI technologist/radiographer on the Safety Committee) before being taken into the MR system room. If the device has an electronic component, then it must undergo comprehensive testing to ensure that it does not contribute noise (i.e., electromagnetic interference) to the images or other data being acquired (8).</para>
      <para>Imaging accessories, devices, and RF coils are often designed and developed as a prototype for use during research MRI examinations. In addition, these same prototype components may be purchased from third party vendors. If an investigational device is a "non-significant risk device", an investigator does not need to submit an investigational device exemption (IDE), the IDE will be "considered approved" under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Such devices do not have to comply with FDA premarket approval and performance standards prior to use in research studies (9). To ensure safety for the patients and volunteer subjects as well as the MR system, and to ensure that it will function properly with the scanner in use, early contact with the members of the MRI Safety Committee is recommended to prevent inappropriate designs that could result in costly mistakes, wasted resources, and/or potential safety issues.</para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Other Personnel Responsibilities</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>It is recommended that an MRI technologist/radiographer or technologist aide complete stocking responsibilities in the MR system suite to ensure the medical supplies present are not only correct, but also not expired when they are needed. This is not something that should be delegated to an individual (e.g., student, etc.) who is not a health care professional. Along with sterile technique, the importance of cleanliness in the medical imaging environment is stressed during didactic and hands-on training to ensure human subject safety as long-term consequences can prevail without this. Maintenance and stocking of the crash cart located in the MRI suite is required to be conducted by a healthcare professional, either MRI technologist/radiographer or nurse due to the presence of drugs.</para>
      <para>An important part in maintaining patient and volunteer subject safety is routine monthly preventative maintenance conducted by the MR system manufacturer field service engineer. In addition to poor image quality, poorly maintained scanners can result in serious patient</para>

        <para>In addition, routine preventative maintenance of all ancillary equipment directly involved with human MRI examinations must be performed annually, at a minimum. This includes automatic injectors, infusion devices, and physiologic monitoring equipment to ensure that compromised function of any equipment does not affect the patient or volunteer subject.</para>

      <title>MRI SAFETY: POLICY AND PROCEDURE TRAINING</title>
      <para>To access and/or use any of the research MR system, completion of an initial MRI Safety Policy and Procedure Training conducted by the MRI Manager (e.g., MRI technologist/radiographer member of Safety Committee) is required. All researchers are required to complete this training despite any previous experience working on or around scanners at other facilities, either clinical or research. Typically, this review is a 90-minute comprehensive yet interactive presentation that includes all aspects of MRI safety and human subject screening, in addition to covering the research facility's policies and procedures. Annually, each of the approved researchers is required to complete an online renewal that is similar to the initial training but includes quizzes spaced throughout the tutorial. It also includes completion of the MRI pre-procedure screening form. The results of each completed quiz are automatically emailed to the members of the MRI Safety Committee and registered in a database.</para>
      <para>A commitment for a minimum of six months use of the research MR system is required by researchers to attend the initial MRI Safety Policy and Procedure Training and to subsequently be given access to the scanners. If a researcher has completed this training and then is absent from conducting or participating in research scans for a period of three months or longer, completion of the online version of the MRI Safety and Policy and Procedure Training is required prior to accessing the MR systems. A database should be maintained with all of the trained researchers' names and contact information that allows automatic reminders to be sent instructing them to take the required annual training, and automatic removal from accessing the scanners if the training is not completed within a designated time period. Other databases are maintained for the purpose of distribution of information to researchers.</para>
      <para>The presence of a whole body 7 Tesla (T) scanner highlights the need for an additional and highly specific MRI safety training (6). This focuses on the challenges present in working around such a high static magnetic field and spatial gradient magnetic field (dB/dx) in Zone 4 (the scanner room), the fringe fields present in Zones 2 and 3, and increased specific absorption rate (SAR) associated with MRI-related heating for researchers, patients, and volunteer subjects. Currently, at most facilities housing high field strength MR systems such as 1.5 T or 3 T, the five-Gauss line is contained within the scanner room. However, the fringe field present in the control room, equipment room, or other nearby rooms of a research 7 T scanner may exceed 100 Gauss. Thus, careful thought must be given to the type of access allowed to each individual and specifically where the MRI pre-procedure screen-</para>

        <para>All researchers are provided cards to carry that contain the names and phone numbers of the individuals who support their research studies being conducted at the scanners. This includes the MRI Safety Committee members, MRI research technologists/radiographers, and the building manager. The cards also include the phone numbers for each of the MR system suite, security services, and the local law enforcement agencies.</para>

        <title>MR SYSTEM TRAINING</title>
        <para>After completion of the initial MRI Safety Policy and Procedure Training, each researcher undergoes additional required training at the scanner with an MRI research technologist/radiographer. This hands-on training includes methods emergent MR system cradle and table removal, location and operation of the quench button and exhaust fan, safe and appropriate use of RF coils, presence and operation of research devices, insulation and separation of the human subject using positioning pads and sponges (to prevent excessive heating and possible burns), room temperature and operation of the scanner's bore fan, research support equipment and accessories, scanner software, and support information (3, 5, 7). An important policy for all those accessing the MRI suites is to keep the scanner room (Zone 4) door closed at all times. A scanner room door should only be allowed to remain open if an MRI safety-trained individual is actively monitoring all equipment and persons attempting to pass through.</para>

      <sect2 id="ch0030s0000s0006s0003">
        <title>Emergent MR System Cradle and Table Removal</title>
        <para>In the event of a suddenly unconscious or unresponsive patient or volunteer subject, researchers must be fully trained in the safe removal of the individual from the MR system and the room (Zone 4), into the patient preparation room (Zone 2) prior to the arrival of paramedics or other resuscitation (code blue) team members. Emergent care of the patient or volunteer subject must never be conducted within the scanner room due to the unmonitored devices carried and used by first responders to revive the subject and the time required to properly complete screening procedures for those individuals (3, 5, 7). This requires the utmost preparation and speed to complete certain procedures prior to the arrival of the resuscitation team or first responders. Practice sessions should be conducted on a regular basis (e.g., bi-annually) by all MRI technologists/radiographers to ensure their proficiency in the procedures.</para>
        <para>The number of researchers required to be present for MRI examinations conducted on human subjects, whether patients or normal volunteers, is determined by the day and time of the examination. MRI studies conducted in the evening (after 6:00 pm), early morning (12:00 am to 7:00 am), and weekends require a minimum of two researchers to be present (5). This is to ensure the necessary emergent procedures can be completed successfully in the event of a safety issue with the patient or volunteer subject. Even if only "normal, healthy" volunteer subjects are being scanned, there is always a risk, albeit small, that these individuals could experience a stroke, heart attack or syncope. Being thoroughly prepared for this type of situation demonstrates to university officials that the researchers conducting</para>

        <title>Quench Button and Exhaust Fan</title>
        <para>The location and operation of the quench button and exhaust fans are also part of the comprehensive MR system training for researchers. In the event an individual would be pinned against the scanner requiring release of the magnetic field of a superconducting imagnet to prevent further injury or death, researchers must be fully trained as to when quenching is necessary and when it is not (5). In addition, all of the potential resulting issues from a quench should be addressed in proper training including the formation of a helium cloud in the MR system room, failure of an exhaust fan that may prevent the opening of the door to the scanner room, and liquid helium dripping from the cryogen exhaust pipe. Training in the operation of the quench button should only be given to appropriate researchers, never to housekeeping or maintenance personnel. Instructions that clearly and quickly direct researchers on quench procedures are posted in convenient locations in the MRI suite.</para>

        <title>Safe and Appropriate Use of RF Coils</title>
        <para>Instruction in the safe and appropriate use of RF coils specific to each research study is given to all researchers. This instruction in the prevention of potential risks associated with RF coils includes the operation and safe utilization of these devices, and correct RF coil selection in the MR system software. Basic knowledge is reviewed in the appropriate use for specific anatomy, positioning of the RF coil as well as the associated cable and connector box, and immobilization of the coil relative to the human subject. Additionally, training should encompass the prevention of cables coiling upon themselves and preventing the cables coming into contact with other cables, devices, human subjects and/or the bore of the scanner (1-3, 5-7, 10). First-time use of any RF coil at the research facility requires training by the MRI Manager (MRI technologist on Safety Committee), MRI research technologist/radiographer, or Scientific Center Director (Ph.D. on the MRI Safety Committee).</para>
        <para>All RF coils and devices should be thoroughly checked before use in any MRI examination for signs of damage including fraying cables, cracked housing and/or loose contents in the coils or connector boxes in order to prevent risk of burns to the patient or volunteer subject, or damage to the scanner. RF coils used to image anatomy other than its designated use must be referred to the MRI Manager or MRI research technologist/radiographer for approval. For example, wrapping a cardiac RF coil around an elbow and positioning it next to the MR system's bore is a mistake that could easily result in injury to the patient and/or hardware. Imaging pediatric brains using a knee coil may be an acceptable alternative to the indicated anatomy for that coil, and should not result in any potential dangers for the patient or scanners as long as proper padding (insulation) is provided to prevent contact between skin and the coil housing.</para>

        <para>functional MRI (fMRI) research studies, motion tracking studies, and focused ultrasound (FUS) treatments guided by MRI. Some of these devices include response boxes and cables, electroencephalography (EEG) cap and cables, transmagnetic stimulation (TMS) coils and cables, eye tracker video camera and cables, thermode (provides heat for pain stimulation) and cables, plethysmograph sensor (or pulse oximetry) and cable, galvanic skin response (GSR/EDA), and electrocardiography (ECG) electrodes and cables. Many of these items may not have been FDA approved for use within the confines of the scanner. All prototype designs must be used with equal care as product devices to prevent loops in their cables, prevent loops with other devices present and their cables, and prevent secondary interaction with the human subject and the MR system's bore (1-3, 5, 7, 10).</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Insulation and Separation using Positioning Pads and Sponges</emphasis>Positioning sponges and pads in multiple sizes and shapes should be available in the MR system room for immobilization and to provide comfort to the patient or volunteer subject. In addition, the sponges and pads provide the necessary separation and insulation for all cables and devices to prevent areas of excessive heating to the patient or volunteer subject and/or damage to the scanner (1-3, 5, 7, 10, 11). This includes critical insulation between human anatomy and the bore walls and ceiling of the MR system. The necessary insulation space between cables and devices, between cables, devices and the human subject, and between cables, devices and the MR system's bore must be a minimum of 1 cm (11).</para>
        <para>In any scan in which the RF is transmitted by the body coil that is housed within the cover (shroud) of the scanner, the risk for inducing a substantial current is greater as a larger area is exposed versus that of a much smaller transmit-receive head RF coil or knee RF coil (1-3, 5, 7, 10). Many RF coils in use are receive-only in which the body RF coil is used for the transmission part of the MRI scans. These receive-only RF coils are not only used to image large anatomical areas such as the chest, abdomen and pelvis, they may also be</para>

Therefore, it is critically important for the researchers to clearly understand how the RF coil they are using operates to ensure necessary insulation is provided for the human volunteer subject or patient, coils, cables and devices present in the bore of the MR system.</para>
        <para>If there is not 1 cm of insulation guaranteed and maintained using pads and sponges between the subject's arms, chest or abdomen and the bore of the scanner, the patient or volunteer should not be scanned because the risk of heating and subsequent burns is far too great due to the electrical fields present. Faulty RF coils including the body RF coil can also be the cause of burns. Positioning sponges or pads between the subject's arms and other body parts that come into close proximity to the bore walls is, therefore, a requirement for all imaging that utilizes the body coil to transmit the RF energy (Figure 2). The cost of positioning sponges and pads for use in the MRI environment is expensive, especially those that are durable, and maintain their position without slipping. However, the issues surrounding the burn of a patient or volunteer subject in the MRI environment results in a far greater financial liability.</para>

        </para>
        <para>Understanding the potential issues with ambient room temperature is another topic to be reviewed with all researchers. The MR system room temperature should not exceed 68°F (20°C) even the speed in which the temperature may increase in the MR system's bore and subsequently, the scanner room, due to rapid imaging sequences with multiple RF pulses.</para>
        <para>The operation of the scanner's fan is to be used to prevent an increase of temperature inside the bore and to maintain patient and volunteer subject comfort during the procedure (1-3, 5, 7, 10). It is recommended that patients and volunteer subjects not be exposed to extreme heat or any situation that challenges their innate ability to regulate their body temperature during MRI examinations. This is especially important for patients compromised by disease or those receiving medications known to impact thermoregulatory function.</para>

      <para>Hands-on training is provided to all researchers using the scanner to ensure maximum efficiency and ultimately successful studies. Training should be tailored specifically to the type of study each individual researcher will be conducting. This will include selection of imaging sequences (research and product), scan parameters and options, graphic scan prescription, high order shimming, advanced scan control variables, post-processing, monitoring of the raw data directory, accessing the service error log, trouble-shooting system errors and artifacts, transfer and/or archival of raw and image data, completion of the online scanner problem reports, and requests for immediate support.</para>

These modes typically control outputs including RF (SAR) and slew rates for time-varying, gradient magnetic fields. Other outputs may be included dependent upon the scanner's manufacturer. The Normal Operating Mode is the recommended selection for all human subject especially patients compromised by disease to ensure that none of the outputs would cause physiologic stress to the subject (5). The First Level Controlled Operating Mode should only be used in normal, healthy control subjects as the outputs may result in some physiologic stress. The Second Level Controlled Operating Mode may require a password to access and should only be using when scanning phantoms due to the potential for excess physiologic stress due to the level of outputs. Conducting MRI examinations in human subjects with the scanner operating in the Second Level Controlled Operating Mode requires approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).</para>

        <para>If the research facility is not licensed by the state, in-patients from any healthcare facility cannot undergo an MRI examination at that location.

        <title>MRI Pre-Procedure Screening</title>
        <para>Safety screening of patients and human subjects is conducted routinely before each and every MRI examination (1-5, 7). Screening is done to ensure safety upon entering the MR system room (Zone 4), entering the scanner and residing in the scanner during the examination. Potential dangers are due to the presence of the static main magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>), radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (B<subscript>1</subscript>), and the varying gradient magnetic fields (G<subscript>x,y,z</subscript>).</para>
        <para>Metals and conductors are the main concerns as well as the sound levels attributed to the time-varying magnetic fields. Metal can exhibit one or more behaviors when exposed to an MR system. It can exhibit translational attraction, becoming a projectile (missile) by being pulled into the magnet due to the change in static main magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>) over distance (dB/dz); exhibit torque or rotational alignment (attempt to align with the main static magnetic field lines; heat resulting in burns to the patient or damage to the scanner; and/or generate artifacts in the images and/or raw data (1-5, 7). Translational attraction is strongest at the ends of the MR system and zero at the center, whereas torque is strongest at the center of the scanner. Due to the additional magnetic shielding added to an MR system allowing it to have a reduced fringe field, the compressed field lines of the magnet result in projectiles experiencing attraction to the sides of the scanner's bore as well as to the center of the bore in the Z-direction.</para>
        <para>In 2005, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International published new terminology for use in describing and labeling biomedical implants and devices as well as equipment to determine under which specific conditions that they can safely enter the MR system room and be present in the scanner during the examination. The labeling terms are MR Unsafe, MR Safe, and MR Conditional (8).</para>
        <para>MR Unsafe describes an item that poses hazards in all MRI environments. MR Safe describes an item that poses no known hazards in all MRI environments. MR Conditional describes an item that has been demonstrated to pose no known hazards in a specified MRI environment with specified conditions of use. Field conditions that define the specified MRI environment include field strength, spatial magnetic field gradient (SFG, MSG), dB/dt or slew rate (time rate of change of the time varying gradient magnetic fields), radio frequency (RF) fields, specific absorption rate (SAR), and B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>. Additional conditions, including specific configurations of the implant or device, may be required (8). Implants, devices, and other items should be labeled with proper terminology and researchers engaged in performing investigations using MRI technology should carefully consider this information in the realm of MRI screening policies and procedures.</para>
        <para>Researchers are required to screen each patient and volunteer subject four times including: conducting a telephone interview or email screening, completing the screening form on site at the MRI facility on the day of the scheduled examination (followed by a review of the completed form by the researcher with the patient or volunteer subject), a visual and verbal screening at dressing room, and a visual and verbal screening immediately before entering the MR system room (Zone 4).</para>

    <sect1 id="ch0030s0000s0011">
      <title>MRI Pre-Procedure Screening Forms</title>
      <para>Two MRI screening forms should be available (Figures 3a and 3b). One form is completed by patients and volunteer subjects undergoing the MRI examination prior to entering the MR system room (1-5, 7). A shorter version is completed by individuals who wish to enter the MRI environment but that will not be scanned. This second form is used for family members when it is necessary or useful for them to be present in the MR system room with the patient or volunteer subject. This same form is also used for maintenance and housekeeping personnel, visiting researchers, clinicians, nurses, and others. It is important to routinely check with all researchers to ensure that they are using the most current MRI pre-procedure screening forms. This is especially important for researchers from departments other than the one in which the scanner is located.</para>
      <para>The screening process is an interactive one between the researcher and the patient or volunteer subject. The researcher conducting the screening must be trained and, therefore, qualified to perform the required screening procedures (1-5, 7). They must have completed the required MRI Safety Policy and Procedure Training and be current with their online safety training. All screening questions regarding biomedical devices and implants, and/or any other condition which may prevent the patient or volunteer subject from undergoing the MRI examination is forwarded to the MRI Manager or radiologist/MRI clinician from the MRI Safety Committee. A good rule to always follow in MRI safety is that "a previous MRI procedure does not guarantee safety" for any subsequent MRI examination. In addition, researchers are required to consult with the MRI Manager, or radiologist/MRI clinician from the MRI Safety Committee if the patient or volunteer subject mentions any previous surgeries. Further investigation is necessary to obtain additional information in order to make the decision for the patient or volunteer subject to undergo the research MRI examination. This includes the date of the surgery, city, state and country in which surgery was conducted, the physician's and/or surgeon's name, name of hospital, anatomical location, surgical procedures conducted, reason for surgery, and devices or implants present (1-5, 7).</para>
      <para>Researchers are required to complete the patient and volunteer subject MRI pre-procedure screening form once a year when they complete their MRI Safety Policy and Procedure Training tutorial online. If a researcher undergoes surgical procedures or acquires a biomedical device or implant then they are required to report to the MRI Manager to determine if it is safe for them to enter the MR system room, to work around the scanner and/or be scanned as a volunteer subject. Pregnant patients and volunteer subjects may undergo research MRI examinations if approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the MRI Safety Committee. The decision to allow pregnant researchers to enter the MR system room is made by the MRI Safety Committee for that particular research facility.</para>
      <para>In research studies, more than one MRI examination may take place during the course of the investigation. The participant undergoes the informed consent process typically once and signs the consent form. However, the MRI pre-procedure screening form should be completed each and every time the participant is scanned, even if the scans are only one day apart (1-5, 7). Much can happen in twenty-four hours that might not be noticeable to the researcher conducting the study (e.g., having a pacemaker implanted). Importantly, the screening form should be completed on-site at the research facility on the day of the MRI</para>

      <para>examination. Researchers are required to conduct an earlier telephone interview or email pre-screening for major issues such as the presence of biomedical devices or implants, pregnancy, presence of acupuncture needles, body piercing, etc. These are issues that would need to be resolved by those responsible on the MRI Safety Committee before the patient or volunteer subject would be allowed to undergo the MRI examination.</para>
      <para>It is critical that the researcher conveys to the patient or volunteer subject the seriousness of the screening form and how important it is to provide accurate, complete answers to ensure their safety. After the patient or volunteer subject completes the MRI pre-procedure screening form, the researcher sits down with the individual to review their responses on the form. This is to ensure that the patient or volunteer subject has not misunderstood or forgotten any information, surgeries, or conditions that might prevent them from undergoing the MRI examination. After the review is complete, the researcher prints his or her first and last name at the bottom of the completed form. This ensures that a record is kept of which individual reviewed the completed screening form with the patient or volunteer subject before taking this individual into the MR system room. The completed screening form goes in a second file with the completed consent form in the office of the principal investigator (PI) as evidence that everything was done to ensure safety for the patient or volunteer subject during the MRI examination.</para>
      <para>As with a clinical MRI department, it should be clearly documented in the research facility's policies and procedures, to which the responsibility falls to make the decision for the patient or volunteer subject to undergo the MRI examination if there is a potential safety issue present such as a biomedical device or implant. As the patients and volunteer subjects undergoing MRI research scans are enrolled in a research study, there is typically no benefit versus risk evaluation conducted as is done in a clinical facility. In addition, frequently there is not a formal image or data interpretation by a board-certified radiologist with a report entered into the radiology department database (Radiology Information System or RIS). Research studies are conducted on groups of people (to prove a hypothesis), typically not done to provide diagnoses on individual patients. Because of this, pre-procedure screening becomes much more conservative than what is practiced in the clinical MRI department. Pregnant women and volunteer subjects with pacemakers, even MR Conditional pacemakers, are not scanned unless approved by the IRB and the MRI Safety Committee. If there is any risk at all, the radiologist/MRI clinician makes the final decision (1-5, 7, 12). If neither the MRI Manager nor the radiologist/MRI clinician can be contacted for approval, the patient or volunteer subject is not to enter the MR system room nor undergo the research MRI examination.</para>
      <para>Most biomedical devices and implants are considered "MR Conditional" unless they are made completely from nonmetallic and non-conducting components such as plastic or nylon (1, 3-5, 7). Each manufacturer of a biomedical device or implant determines the specific conditions under which their product can safely undergo an MRI examination. In research studies, the scan parameters are selected and typically maintained across all scans of all individuals participating in that particular research study. Therefore modification of scan parameters in order to adhere to safety conditions may not be acceptable for the aim of the research study. Any alterations to previously set scan parameters may result in the exclusion of certain participants' data in the study.</para>

All metals and potential projectiles including jewelry, watches, hair accessories, external hearing aids, and other related items are removed and secured in a locker. If the family member is going to remain in the MR system room with the patient or volunteer subject, then hearing protection is required.</para>
          <para>MRI pre-procedure screening forms should be comprehensive but the information contained should be easily understood, therefore, not too technical nor should it contain too much medical jargon. The MRI Safety Committee reviews and updates these forms on a regular basis, typically every six months.

        <title>Static Magnetic Field</title>
        <para>Metallic items that are attracted to a magnet are referred to as ferromagnetic (1-9, 15). Examples of ferromagnetic materials include iron and certain types of steel. Some examples of nonferromagnetic materials include aluminum, copper, brass, lead, nickel, titanium, cobalt, mercury, chromium, platinum, and gold. It is important to remember that often metals are a mixture (alloy) that makes it difficult to easily determine if a given item is ferromagnetic even if the percentage of each element present is known. Testing by very strong handheld magnet is typically the only way to determine if a specific item will be attracted to the magnet of the MR system, remembering that handheld magnets are generally never as strong as the MRI, such as 1.5 T or 3 T (1-5).</para>
        <para>Every precaution must be taken to ensure that ferromagnetic items are not taken into the MR system room. Given the shielding present in most scanners, the spatial magnetic field gradient of the static magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>) can be quite short and steep. Therefore, the distance traversed between a ferromagnetic item feeling no attraction, to quickly being pulled into the MR system can be quite small. This translational attraction is dependent upon several conditions including the strength and spatial gradient of the static magnetic field, magnet design (e.g., long-bore versus short-bore), the degree of attraction due to mass and geometry of the object, the type of retention, location, orientation, time in place (i.e., for implants), and other factors.</para>
        <para>Items in the patient preparation room or any rooms located close (Zones 2 and 3) to the MR system room (Zone 4) must be clearly identified with labels indicating that they may not be taken into the scanner room at any time for any reason (1-4, 6, 7). Some of these items may include emergency (i.e., crash) carts, laundry carts, storage cabinets, and chairs. Recommended items that reside in the patient preparation room should be identified and labeled as MR Safe, MR Conditional, or MR Unsafe. In a MRI research facility, it is realistic to expect that some items that reside in the control room as well as the volunteer subject/patient preparation room will be MR Unsafe. This is especially true because in the research setting there is often hardware and devices that are under development (prototypes). Therefore, labels indicating MR Unsafe are absolutely necessary for such items. The labels used for this purpose should be those defined by the ASTM International (1-4, 6, 9). Figure 4 shows the proper labels for marking purposes related to MR Safe, MR Conditional, and MR Unsafe.</para>

          <emphasis role="bold">RF Electromagnetic Fields</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Heating of the patient and potential subsequent burns are serious concerns in the MRI examination. Because patients are not well, it is imperative that everything is done to ensure that precautions are put into place prior to scans beginning, and also that communication with the patient is ongoing during the examination. Concerns range from an increased sensation of overall warmth adding to the already present feeling of discomfort due to their condition to local (focal) thermal injury. Three different values are currently reported in the scanner's software to the operators including SAR, B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>, and SAE (specific absorbed energy) or SED (specific energy dose).</para>
        <para>The specific absorption rate (SAR) is a means of characterizing the absorption of radiofrequency (RF) energy in human tissue and is typically reported in watts per kilogram (W/kg) (1-6, 10, 16). SAR is primarily dependent on the following parameters: imaging frequency, type and number per repetition time (TR) of RF pulses, type of transmit RF coil, anatomy exposed to the transmitting RF coil, and patient weight (and height on some MR systems). The measurement of SAR is typically reported on MR systems as whole body averaged and peak values. In general, as SAR increases, the number of slices available in a given imaging sequence is reduced in order to decrease the whole body averaged SAR level. Realistically, the only modifiable parameters available to the MRI operator to reduce SAR are the repetition time, degree of flip angle(s), number of flip angles per TR (echo train or turbo factor) including presaturation bands and chemical presaturation, and/or number of slices, unless the researcher can change the transmit RF coil or move to a lower static</para>
        <para>magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>) MR system. Entering the incorrect weight of the patient or volunteer subject is risky and could result in increased RF energy being deposited into the patient, potentially resulting in a burn (10).</para>
        <para>B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> values have recently been added to the RF and heating parameters being reported in the MR system software and also to the list of conditions for biomedical implants and devices. "B<subscript>1+</subscript>" (B<subscript>1</subscript> plus) is the part of the applied RF that is used in imaging as opposed to "B<subscript>1-</subscript>" (B<subscript>1</subscript> negative) that is not used in imaging but contributes to heating. "RMS" (root mean squared) is an averaging technique. B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is part of the equation determining the SAR for a given scan but it is also a potentially more accurate means of reporting the RF power that is being transferred by the RF transmit coil. For that reason, it may be more important as an indicator of heating in the presence of biomedical devices and implants. SAR, however, should always be monitored to minimize discomfort for patients especially in those individuals who cannot properly regulate their heating due to disease conditions present and any pharmaceutical therapies they may be undergoing (4).</para>
        <para>SAE (specific absorbed dose) or SED (specific energy dose) have historically been set to a limit of 60 minutes for a maximum of 14.4 kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg). These RF limitations are in place due to longer MRI examination times. The maximum is calculated by 4 watts per kilogram (W/kg) multiplied by one hour (3600 seconds) (6).</para>
        <para>Risks surrounding the RF electromagnetic fields (B<subscript>1</subscript>) include the heating of metallic objects or devices, associated components, and/or the surrounding tissues. The increased heating can result in burns to the patient or volunteer subject, and/or damage to the MR system and RF coils. Burn scenarios include the exposure (close proximity) to a transmit RF coil, focus of RF energy in a specific area (i.e., the antenna effect), currents being induced in conductors (e.g., cables, metallic devices of certain lengths and human beings), reflected power (using RF shields, mylar/space blankets or aluminum foil), and an inappropriate use of an RF coil (1-7, 10).</para>
        <para>Procedures to prevent currents being induced in conductors, and the proper positioning and insulation of cables, RF coils, devices and human subjects must be utilized for all MRI examinations especially those using the RF body coil to transmit RF energy (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>). In addition, all loop formations must be prevented including cables forming loops, cables forming loops with other cables, and cables forming loops with human subjects (1-7, 10). Loops can be defined as crossing and/or touching, or changing direction within the scanner (e.g., a cable runs through the bore, then turns and runs back through the bore a second time) (1-7, 10, 11). Loops in cables present in the MR system bore become a greater risk as the loop becomes larger. For example, if an ECG cable is attached to a patient or volunteer subject via electrodes, the cable runs then out the back of the magnet, turns and returns through the scanner bore to its electrical connection at the front of the scanner. This forms a very large and potentially dangerous loop. Cables on RF coils are sometimes too long. Placing a sponge or pad to separate the smaller unpreventable loops of the cable should prevent induced currents.</para>
        <para>Attention must be given to the potential for patient burns occurring due to the human body acting as a conductor. A gap 1-cm of air must be guaranteed between anatomy within the confines of the transmitting RF coil using sponges and pads to separate and insulate (1-</para>
        <para>7, 10, 11). For example, during any scan in which the RF body coil is used as the transmit RF coil, hands should not be clasped together, hands should not rest on forehead during breast MRI examinations, hands should not rest against hips, and calves (lower leg) should not touch. Pads or sponges may need to be positioned between the legs from upper thigh to feet to ensure no loops are formed. In addition to the potential for peripheral nerve stimulation due to time-varying gradient magnetic fields, these types of contact or any other combinations should be avoided due to the risk of providing a route for induced currents to flow.</para>
        <para>In the research environment, many prototype devices are designed and constructed to be used while imaging patients and volunteer subjects. These are either used alone or simultaneously with other product or prototype devices. Individuals possessing the appropriate expertise must complete extensive testing to ensure these prototype devices can be used safely within the magnetic environment. The device design and safety risks, if present, are described in the human study protocol to be approved by the IRB prior to use. In addition, consultation with the MRI Manager is required before use in the scanner room.</para>
        <para>Utilizing different static magnetic field strengths within the same research facility necessitates the possession of knowledge regarding RF bandwidth, its dependence upon the static magnetic field, and interaction with certain lead lengths (as applicable) as well as the human body. This is critical in the prevention of not only image artifacts but also potential risks for burns. For example, imaging the brain at 3-T versus that of 1.5-T means the RF frequency is 128-MHz versus 64-MHz. The brain then encounters more "half wavelengths" at 3-T resulting in a B<subscript>1</subscript> inhomogeneity (dielectric resonance) that is seen as brightness in the center of the axial brain images (1-10, 17, 18). While SAR (RF energy deposited into the human body) increases by the square root of 2 at 3-T versus that at 1.5-T resulting in increased patient heating. However, increased SAR is not always present in the event of a patient burn due to induced currents. For example, dependent upon a given lead length, there may be less resultant heating due to standing waves at 3-T (128-MHz) versus 1.5-T (64-MHz), as reported by Shellock, et al. (19).</para>
        <para>Due to the many different designs of RF coils from major MR system manufacturers and third-party vendors, it is critical that specific instructions be followed when utilizing these coils. This is especially true of the so-called "array" coils available as product versions since the early 1990s. Various designs of RF array coils include coupled, isolated, or phased. Some of these designed to image large areas of the body (e.g., cardiac, torso and abdomen) are manufactured as two parts, one to be positioned anteriorly and the other, posteriorly. Preventing these particular RF coils from overlapping at the sides of the patient or volunteer subject may be a requirement to prevent interactions resulting in excessive heating and possible burns. Sponges or pads must always be present or placed between the RF coil and the anatomy being imaged, some of which are provided by the manufacturer. This is to prevent inappropriate loading that can potentially result in malfunction of the RF coil and subsequent disproportionate heating.</para>
        <para>Positioning one RF coil inside of another for MR imaging is generally something that should never be done unless the coils are specifically designed by the manufacturer to do so safely. For example, an earlier version of the endorectal coil was used to image the prostate in conjunction with a pelvic phased array coil. To proceed safely, researchers must</para>
        <para>first consult the MRI Manager, MRI research technologist, or lab director (MRI scientist or Ph.D.) of the research facility. Finally, an RF coil should never be left unplugged and in the bore of the scanner during an MRI examination which may result in heating of the unplugged RF coil and resulting in a burn to the subject or patient and/or damage to the hardware and scanner.</para>

      <title>Time-Varying Gradient Magnetic Fields</title>
      <para>Risks associated with the time-varying gradient magnetic fields are due to the rapid switching to spatially localize during MR imaging (1-5, 7, 19, 20). This rapid switching is made up of two parts, the size [maximum amplitude measured in milliTesla per meter (mT/m)] and the speed [slew rate measured in milliTesla per meter per millisecond (mT/m/msec)]. As a current is made to flow in a conductor moving through a static magnetic field, a flowing current can also be induced in a static conductor when exposed to a rapidly changing magnetic field.</para>
      <para>Other risks include peripheral nerve stimulation and auditory effects that are associated with the time-varying gradient magnetic fields (1-5, 7, 19, 20). While peripheral nerve stimulation due to the slew rate is a reality, it is subjective and, therefore, difficult to determine exactly which patients and volunteer subjects will experience this sensation. While it can be perceived as painful or extreme pressure, it has not been reported to result in residual effects. Some of the MR systems offer options to image under reduced slew rates, thereby minimizing the risk.</para>
      <para>Manufacturers of MR systems continue to devise methods to reduce the acoustic noise generated by gradient magnetic fields and this topic is covered in detail in another chapter in this textbook. New imaging sequences, especially those being designed in research facilities are often rapid, increasing the noise level. Therefore, it is essential to use earplugs or other hearing protection accessories and devices rated appropriately by the noise reduction ratings (NRR). In addition, it is of equal importance that the earplugs be placed correctly within the ear canal. Researchers are to check the placement of the earplugs before moving the patient or volunteer into the scanner's bore. Headphones (earmuffs) are recommended for use in conjunction with earplugs to provide maximum protection during scans of the body and extremities. Researchers are required to instruct their patients and volunteer subjects to notify them using the squeeze bulb or verbally through the intercom system if the earplugs become loose, fall out, or if the noise of the scanner is bothersome or painful so that the examination can be immediately stopped. Posters demonstrating the procedure for correct placement of earplugs should be posted within each of the research MR system rooms for easy referral for researchers and their patients and volunteer subjects. If earplugs cannot be positioned appropriately, the patient or volunteer subject should not be scanned. If headphones are used alone, the NRR should be at least 30-dB of protection that is provided including any earplugs that fit inside of the headphones, some of which deliver audio instructions during research studies.</para>

Note that ECG (EKG) cables should not be looped and must exit the bore of the MR system directly away from the patient.</para>
      <para>undergo an MRI examination include the objects being moved or dislodged, induction of a current in the device or associated lead wires, excessive heating and subsequent burns, altered function of the device, de-magnetization of the device, temporary or permanent damage to the device, and other problems (1-4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21-23).</para>
      <para>Having general policies for managing individuals with biomedical devices and implants are never a good idea because testing has not been conducted on all implants, there tend to be exceptions, new devices are being developed on an ongoing basis, and implants and devices are approved for safe scanning under different MR conditions (4, 5).</para>
      <para>Risks are dependent upon many criteria including the static magnetic field strength, spatial gradient of the static magnetic field, ferromagnetic properties of the implant or device [composition, mass and geometry, passive versus active, and method of activation (electrically, magnetically, or mechanically)], and/or location and orientation of the implant or device [type of tissue, retention means (scarring, sutures, cement, etc.)], adjacent vital anatomic structures, and other factors (1-4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21-23).</para>
      <para>To accurately evaluate the conditions under which a patient or volunteer subject with an implant or device can safely undergo an MRI examination, specific information must be</para>
      <para>obtained including the name of the manufacturer of the device or implant, composition of the material, date surgically placed, anatomical location, name of surgeon and hospital, and/or reason for placement of implant or device (1-4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21-23). The more information that can be obtained about the implant or device, the easier it will be to make a knowledgeable and accurate decision. Patients are sometimes given cards to carry with information from the manufacturer about the implant or device. In addition, contacting manufacturers or reviewing their website can provide the necessary information. The decision to undergo the MRI examination, however, should never be made from a verbal reply only (e.g., "The surgeon said it was ok to scan."). Dependent upon the type of implant or device, the MRI Manager or the radiologist/MRI clinician from the MRI Safety Committee should make the decision for the patient or volunteer subject to undergo the MRI procedure. For more complex devices such as cardiac pacemakers and neurostimulation systems, it is the radiologist/MRI clinician who must make the final decision not the MRI Manager or MRI facility manager (1-4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 19, 21-23). As stated earlier, the patients and volunteer subjects undergoing MRI procedures are enrolled in a research study, therefore, they are considered "volunteers" for the research study. Thus, there is typically no benefit versus risk evaluation conducted as is done in a clinical facility.</para>
      <para>If the implant or device is identified to be MR Conditional, then the set of MRI scan parameters as set down in the research protocol must be reviewed to ensure it is capable of being modified to ensure that the specific conditions are met for safe scanning without affecting the outcome of the research study. These modifications to the scan parameters and protocol must be accepted and approved by the principal investigator (PI) of the research study.</para>
      <para>Body piercing jewelry and cosmetic jewelry may pose a hazard to a study subject or patient undergoing MRI (24-26). Therefore, in general, all individuals must remove metallic body piercing and cosmetic jewelry before being involved in research MRI examinations (24-26). Because there is no benefit versus risk evaluation conducted for research scans, even the smallest amount of risk must be removed. Patients and volunteer subjects with body piercing jewelry and cosmetic jewelry that cannot be removed are not permitted to undergo research MRI examinations.</para>

      <title>Screening Tools</title>
      <para>A list of common projectiles that have made their way into MR systems should be provided to researchers to ensure that they remember what items could be problematic. For example, paper clips, staples, hairpins, barrettes and other hair accessories, jewelry and watches, keys, hearing aids, scissors, pocketknives, tools, flashlights, metal pens, clipboards, notebooks, money clips, cell phones, and other similar objects.</para>
      <para>Quality handheld magnets are another valuable investment to be made for checking equipment, imaging accessories, and hair accessories and jewelry (worn by researchers) (1-4, 7). To check any of these items, they must be removed from the body and placed on a hard surface over which the handheld magnet is placed. Handheld magnets should never be used to detect the presence of ferrous metal in or on the body (1-4, 7). Strong handheld magnets are available in several forms. The most valuable is a neodymium magnet (1200-Gauss or higher). The use of a handheld magnet of a lower strength is discouraged.</para>
      <para>Reference materials including books and websites can be very helpful in the gathering of current information concerning many aspects of MRI safety and screening. Publications from the American College of Radiology (ACR) are comprehensive documents that should be carefully reviewed by the MRI Safety Committee members (1). Utilizing reference materials and websites are especially helpful for the evaluation of biomedical devices and implants. It should be remembered, however, that these are for reference only and should never be used as the sole piece of evidence to decide whether the patient or volunteer subject should undergo the MRI examination. This decision is made by the radiologist or MRI clinician.</para>
      <para>Websites to consult are those from the manufacturer of the biomedical device or implant which provide information and conditions under which a particular device can safely be exposed to all parts of the MRI examination involving the respective electromagnetic fields. Websites such as www.mrisafety.com (created and maintained by Frank G. Shellock, Ph.D.) provide educational documents and testing results for thousands of biomedical devices and implants (13). In addition, other websites such as www.imrser.org, provide a wealth of information about safety and pre-procedure screening in the MRI environment that can be used by those on the MRI Safety Committee to keep their knowledge of MRI safety current (14). A textbook entitled, "Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices," is an information resource that is fully updated on an annual basis (3). This is an extremely valuable yet inexpensive investment for all MRI departments, both research and clinical.</para>
      <para>Participation in a worldwide MRI technologist automatic email list server is also helpful in adding to one's arsenal of knowledge in MRI safety and screening (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). Questions are answered, suggestions made, and issues discussed on a daily basis. In this manner, a wealth of information is being shared freely without cost to the participants. However, time is required to triage the emails and read the ones particularly valuable to a given research facility.</para>
      <para>Ferromagnetic detections systems (FMDS), devices that identify ferromagnetic materials, have recently replaced the metal detectors initially thought to be an important part of the fully equipped MRI department in the 1980s. Conventional metal detectors quickly became viewed as a waste of funds given the many issues surrounding them including overdependence by users, the generation of false-positives and false-negatives, the function-related dependence upon size and mass of the metallic object, the sensitivity setting of the device, and other issues. Currently there are several different companies manufacturing a variety of designs for FMDS and a chapter is devoted to this topic in this textbook. These devices can be very helpful in preventing injuries from larger ferromagnetic objects such as oxygen tanks, IV poles, infusion machines, gurneys, hospital beds, and many other items that have found their way into MRI environments over the years. Most of these situations resulted in expensive damage to the MR systems and RF coils. Others resulted in injuries to healthcare workers and patients and at least one death involving a patient. A report by Shellock and Karacozoff (27) indicated that a FMDS may also be used to identify ferromagnetic implants and foreign bodies.</para>

      <title>Visitors, Tours, Classes, and Videotaping</title>
      <para>Visitors to the MRI suite are allowed if an individual who has completed the required MRI Safety Policy and Procedure Training accompanies them. Visitors are not allowed to enter the MR system room (Zone 4) except when absolutely necessary and then approval must be obtained from the MRI Manager (the MRI technologist from the MRI Safety Committee). If approved to enter the scanner room, the visitor completes the appropriate screening form that is then reviewed by an MRI safety-trained individual. The visitor then checks all pockets by placing their hands inside of each and removes all potential projectiles in addition to jewelry, watches, hair accessories and hearing aids.</para>
      <para>Due to the extremely high fringe field associated with a 7-Tesla MR system, the control and scanner room are treated the same with regards to screening visitors and other individuals. Thus, the screening form is completed in the lobby or in the patient preparation room, reviewed, and approved before the visitor may enter the control and/or scanner room of the 7-Tesla scanner.</para>
      <para>To conduct tours, classes, and videotaping sessions in the MRI suite must be approved by the MRI Manager prior to scheduling. Classes and videotaping sessions are scheduled through the MRI Manager to ensure the availability of an MRI research technologist. This has proven to be valuable as the technologist scans while the faculty member (i.e., scientist or physician) delivers instruction to the class. Having an MRI technologist present not only ensures safety for individuals present and the MR systems, it prevents modifications from being made to the MRI suite and its contained equipment. It also ensures that the MRI suite that appears in a video shown on TV or in media pictures will be represented appropriately and that any scanning of human subjects that are participating are filmed according to departmental policy.</para>

Housekeeping and maintenance staff are never to enter the MR system rooms (Zone 4) at any time. Dependent upon the location of the fringe field in the scanner control room (Zone 3), housekeeping and maintenance may not be given automatic access to that area.

      <title>PREPARATION OF PATIENTS AND VOLUNTEER SUBJECTS</title>
      <para>During the scheduling process for patients and volunteer subjects, it should be communicated clearly that specific items should be left at home including all jewelry, body piercing jewelry, hair accessories, and undergarments with metallic fibers or components. Facial</para>
      <para>makeup should not be worn because some can result in an irritation to the skin from tiny metallic particles and/or cause an imaging artifact. Hair products can also contain components of metallic glitter or other compounds that pose a problem for MRI (e.g., hair concealment spray). Artificial hair extensions have proven to be problematic for imaging of the brain due to the resulting lack of homogeneity and failure of magnetic field shimming due to the presence of the synthetic material that is present. Wigs and hairpieces should be removed or closely checked underneath for any hairpins that may be in place.</para>
      <para>Having all patients and volunteer subjects change out of street clothes into scrubs or gowns that do not have pockets is required for all MR examinations (1-6). This policy takes pockets out of the equation and allows easier visual access to ensure that items that may be problematic have been removed. Street clothing that contains antimicrobial solutions can act as a conductor in the bore of the MR system resulting in patient heating and subsequent burns. It is also a way to remind the patients and volunteer subjects that preparation for entering the MRI environment is a serious issue and that their safety is considered paramount by the researchers conducting the MRI examinations. Compare the costs associated with the purchase of disposable scrubs and those provided by a laundry service. It can be the case that disposable scrubs are less expensive over time. Disposable foot covers are also a requirement for patients and volunteer subjects. Whether placed over bare feet or socks, it ensures some additional cleanliness in the MRI area but, more importantly, the dots on the bottom of the foot covers assist in the prevention of slipping and possible injuries.</para>

This can lead to a patient or volunteer subject making a claim that "something is missing". Glasses can be worn into the scanner room but should never be worn by the patient or volunteer subject into the bore of the MR system due to the metallic components (e.g. small screws) that will result in artifacts in images and data acquired. Pillows or toys from home should never be allowed in the scanner room nor scanner bore unless fully checked with a strong handheld magnet first. Items such as these can easily hide the presence of a piece of ferromagnetic material.</para>
      <para>It is valuable to have a checklist present and a "stop, look, and feel" policy and procedure before entering the MR system room with the patient or volunteer subject (1-4, 6). This is especially important in research facilities that may have patients and volunteer subjects arriving by wheelchair or gurney, and/or with IV poles and/or infusion devices. If the MR system table does not undock to be moved to the patient preparation room for transfer of the patient or volunteer subject, an acceptable (i.e., MR Safe or MR Conditional) wheelchair and/or gurney should also be available. All of these items should be included on the checklist to ensure no unsafe items from the outside make their way into the scanner room and that all conditions are mets. In addition, checking under sheets and blankets is also a requirement before entering the scanner room.</para>
      <para>Policies and procedures must also be in place for patient and volunteer subject transfers from wheelchairs and gurneys to the MR system table. Only those individuals trained in the proper techniques should perform lifts and transfer of human subjects in order to prevent injuries. Depending on the number of patient/volunteer transfers necessary, purchasing a patient lift sling may prove to be indispensable.</para>
      <para>Patients and volunteer subjects participating in a research study that requires the administration of a contrast media intravenously undergoes the intra-catheter placement in the patient preparation room immediately prior to the MRI examination. This prevents using valuable MR system time for this type of preparation that can be time consuming in the event that veins are not easily accessed. It also allows for safe intervention in the event the patient experiences syncope (fainting) or other difficulties with the placement of the intra-catheter or needle.</para>
      <para>As previously mentioned, specific instruction for the preparation and placement of earplugs or other hearing protection must be given as well as checking to ensure necessary hearing protection is positioned effectively (1-5). If the MRI examination includes audio delivery via headphones (e.g., fMRI), sanitary covers are required. As hearing damage from exposure to loud noise is cumulative and typically irreversible, this procedure should be given adequate time to complete successfully.</para>
      <para>Research MRI studies may involve more than one individual in a family. There may be times when an entire family is present for the MRI examination. If there are small children being imaged, the entire family may be waiting in the patient preparation room or control room in the MRI suite. Therefore, researchers must be on constant alert, monitoring the whereabouts of each of the family members, especially the children. It is helpful to point out to each family member the areas they can and cannot access. For example, "that is the door into the MR system room, so no one enters that room without one of the researchers</para>
      <para>taking you in." Additionally, it is a good idea to remind parents and spouses who are not going into the scanner room that they cannot enter the area without being properly screened and prepared even if their child or spouse calls out for them. Keeping the scanner room door closed during these studies is always important to ensure that family members are not accidentally "lured" in by the sight of their child or spouse on the table of the MR system. They should be reminded they are to wait in the patient preparation room or in the control room and not wander about the MRI suite.</para>

      <title>POSITIONING AND IMMOBILIZING OF PATIENTS AND VOLUNTEER SUBJECTS</title>
      <para>An explanation pertaining to the MR system and the planned examination is highly recommended for all patients and volunteer subjects. This is the critical first step in securing their trust and compliance. This should include a brief explanation describing the scanner, the room, lighting, fan control, intercom system, and use of the emergency squeeze ball.</para>
      <para>Instructions should also include the value of maintaining position of the anatomy plus control of breathing and swallowing, if pertinent to the anatomy being imaged. Patients and volunteer subjects should be reminded not to rearrange any of the devices or accessories placed in the MR system (Figure 7). If modifications are necessary, the researchers should be immediately notified via the intercom system or squeeze ball to make the requested changes for the patient or volunteer subject. This is especially important for many items including cables and RF coils, mirrors and/or screens used in fMRI studies, GSR (galvanic skin response) or EDA (electrodermal activity) cables, eye trackers, EEG caps and cables, and TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) coils.</para>
      <para>Pads and sponges are strategically placed to immobilize and comfort the patient or volunteer subject. They are also used to provide safety and prevent burns as previously described (1-6).

        <para>The researchers are instructed in the proper evacuation techniques to follow if the patient or volunteer subject should become unresponsive. This includes removing the cradle (table top) from the scanner using the emergency handle that releases it from the "trolley unit" that pulls and pushes the cradle in and out of the scanner. Importantly, for some MR systems</para>
        <para>with detachable tables, the cradle must be in the "home" position (moved out of the bore to the end of the table) before the table can be undocked from the front of the MR system and moved out of the room. If the research scanner does not have a patient table that undocks and rolls away from the scanner, an appropriate gurney (i.e., MR Safe or MR Conditional) must be readily available in the MRI suite as well as an appropriate transport board or roller system. The transport board or roller system allows the researchers to safely and quickly move the patient or volunteer subject from the table onto the gurney without experiencing possible injuries.</para>
        <para>Selecting the appropriate pedal at the foot end of the table undocks the MRI patient table. On some MR systems, there exists a backup release handle typically located under or near the docking unit at the housing of the scanner. Arm rails should be raised to prevent the patient or volunteer subject from falling off of the table during the transport out of the room to the patient preparation room.</para>
        <para>In the case of a serious emergency, one researcher is responsible for calling first responders (e.g., 911) if the MRI research facility is a stand-alone building and not attached to a hospital. This researcher then promptly goes to the front door of the MRI research facility to receive the paramedics and quickly direct them to the appropriate MRI area. The second researcher is responsible for moving the patient or volunteer subject out of the MR system, undocking the table and moving the table into the patient preparation room, closing the scanner room door, and monitoring the individual until the paramedics arrive. Emergent care must never be conducted in the scanner room due to the increased risk of metal objects being brought into the MRI environment, as previously stated. The MRI pre-procedure screening form that was completed by the subject should be made available to the paramedics when they arrive as they will need information regarding current conditions and medications.</para>
        <para>For a quench, the procedures include information for a deliberate (controlled) quench (e.g., in a 'life or death' situation) and a spontaneous quench (e.g., in the event of an earthquake or substantial problem with the magnet of the MR system) (1-5). Researchers would be responsible to deliberately activate a quench if an individual, for example, is pinned to the magnet by a large metal object and is unable to get loose, and/or has experienced life-threatening injuries. A comprehensive set of instructions with easy-to-follow bullets is posted in the MRI suites for a quench. During hands-on training, the location and function of the quench button is reviewed with researchers. In the event of a spontaneous quench, researchers are instructed to quickly remove the patient or volunteer subject from the scanner and turn on the emergency exhaust fan in the room to remove any collection of helium gas that may form.</para>

      <para>to follow in the event of an incidental finding (possible abnormality). Anything that is observed in the images that is suspected of being an incidental finding is reported to the MRI research technologists. A medical record number and accession number are generated, the exam modified, and forwarded to PACS. Results are forwarded to the PI and researcher who conducted the scan. The PI or representative then discusses the report with the patient or volunteer subject and forwards the results to the individual's physician.</para>
      <para>The researchers are also required to report to the MRI Manager, MRI research technologists, or lab director any suspicious artifacts present in the images. It is then determined if these fall under potential abnormalities, presence of metal in the body or biomedical implants, system software or hardware issues, or subject-generated (motion) artifacts.</para>

      <title>EXIT FORM</title>
      <para>All patients and volunteer subjects are required to complete an Exit Form immediately after the MRI examination concludes and before leaving the MRI research facility (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>). This form is designed so that the researcher completes the top half of the form while the subject is being scanned, and then the patient or volunteer completes the bottom half. The top half of the form includes the MR system at which they were scanned, RF coil used and anatomy scanned, date, researcher and PI name, and patient/study subject information. The bottom half includes questions regarding medical conditions, medications and treatments, a comfort scale for before, during, and after the MRI examination, and questions regarding nervousness, muscle stimulation, vision changes, unusual taste, dizziness, headache, nausea and pain.</para>
      <para>The Exit Form provides the patient and volunteer subject with a conduit to provide feedback to the researchers and those individuals managing the MRI research facility. Importantly, this is valuable information concerning many aspects of the research examinations and the respective scanners. All completed forms are entered into a secure database. This database also provides evidence to the level of safety that is being maintained at a specific MRI research facility.</para>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <para>Potential risks exist in the MRI environment for, not only the patient or volunteer subject, but also for MRI technologists, healthcare professionals, physicians, and others who only intermittently access the MR system room. This becomes a more complex issue in the research setting because there is often more freedom for a wide variety of individuals present in the facility including researchers and scientists, research assistants, students and postdocs, physicians, visiting scholars, and research and administrative staff. Intermittent but routine visitors to the research MRI facility include manufacturer representatives and scientists from various companies developing products, camera and photography personnel taping for television programs and documentaries, and other specialized healthcare professionals from nursing, anesthesia and respiratory therapy. Insofar as many of these individuals may not be healthcare professionals but investigators engaging in a systematic activity to acquire knowledge, it is often difficult to successfully manage all MRI safety policies and procedures that are set down by the MRI Safety Committee. This requires ongoing moni-</para>
      <para>toring of all those using the research scanners including regular verbal and written reminders. This continued one-on-one communication should convey to the researchers a genuine interest in their safety, as well as the patients and volunteer subjects, and the MR system, ancillary equipment, and ultimately, an interest in the successful completion of the research study.</para>
      <para>Continuing communication, both facilitated and offered, is a critical tool in maintaining safety in the MRI environment. In addition, any and all assumptions must be entirely removed, as they are certainly the beginning of a dangerous and risky path for all present. As George Bernard Shaw (Irish playwright and a co-founder of the London School of Economics, 1856 to 1950) said, "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place".</para>
