      <para><emphasis role="bold">INTRODUCTION</emphasis>Among the three different electromagnetic fields associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the static magnetic field has always been a primary focus of safety considerations. The need for intermittent exposure to the powerful static magnetic field of the MR system is at the base of safety concerns, from the pioneers working on developing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to the diagnostic imaging technique that is currently used today, as MRI. Since the early 1970s, when Raymond Damadian's pioneering work on animal tumor imaging and Paul Lauterbur's application of gradient magnetic fields in combination with a strong magnetic field to generate images marked the birth of MRI (1, 2), the safety implications for human subjects have been a constant preoccupation of practitioners (1, 2). This is the case even though there have been no unpreventable safety incidents for patients and others in the MRI environment (3). The safety record of scanning hundreds of millions of human subjects imaged in MR systems worldwide indicates a relative lack of inherent risk associated with MRI.</para>
      <para>Although the static magnetic field (B<subscript>0</subscript>) is not the only source of safety concern, the other two, that is, the gradient magnetic fields (dB/dt) and the radiofrequency (RF) fields (B<subscript>1</subscript>), warrant their own safety evaluations. Considering that all three of these electromagnetic fields act simultaneously on the human body during MRI, understanding their interactions constitutes the first order of business in quantifying safety implications. In so doing, in the present chapter, there will be an exclusive focus on the task of understanding the interactions of static magnetic fields with the human body. The other two, radiofrequency fields and gradient magnetic fields, are easier to quantify since a large part of their interactions is a manifestation of Faraday's Law of Induction. These effects are functions of easily controlled characteristics of transmit RF coils and the gradient magnetic fields, such as amplitude and frequency. It is inherently easier to build a transmit RF coil operating at high frequencies greater than 300-MHz and gradients operating at greater than 50-mT/m with slew rates of higher than 200-T/m/s than to build a whole-body magnet operating at greater</para>

          <para>than 7-Tesla (T). Furthermore, computations of specific absorption rate (SAR) and concomitant RF-induced tissue heating or gradient field-induced voltage and associated neurostimulation are readily carried out. By comparison, the limiting physiological effects of static magnetic fields on biological tissues have not been sufficiently quantified because the observable effects on tissues are relatively small and it is difficult to estimate the static magnetic field strengths at which these may become substantial hazards (Table 1) (3).</para>
          <para>However, since the development and manufacturing of powerful magnets, scientists have begun to understand the mechanisms of interactions with biological tissues at different levels. To date, the strongest of these effects is the attractive force on ferromagnetic materials which demonstrates the most ominous of all safety risks to the life and wellbeing of patients and other individuals (4, 5). Notably, this effect, also known as the projectile or missile effect, is a secondary effect meaning that it is easily avoidable and is not inherent to the interaction of the static magnetic field with the human body. As far as the hazards associated with intrinsic interactions, the scientific community has yet to establish an upper limit for the static magnetic field designed for exposure of human subjects. Considering the difficulty of building whole-body magnets operating at field strengths much higher than currently recommended by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), presently standing at 8-Tesla (5), it is conceivable that there would be many opportunities and available hardware to characterize such effects. Proliferation of 7-T whole-body magnets (subsequent to the success of the 8-T scanner, designed by the team at the Ohio State University in 1998) has offered a fertile ground to study the interactions of static magnetic fields with biological tissues using all available techniques, in addition to the imaging capabilities that such scanners afford the scientists and clinicians. The safe operation of the more than eighty 7-T research and clinical MR systems around the world has encouraged scientists to dream of even higher field strengths. NeuroSpin in Orsay, France, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) now have 11.7-T, whole-body MR systems. The successful move to the ultra-high field (UHF), 11.7-T scanner was undoubtedly the result of the invaluable information that was gained from the exposure of thousands of human subjects to 7-, 8-, 9.4-, and 10.5-T static magnetic fields since 1998. To date, numerous safety investigations have been conducted on UHF MR systems (5-10). Importantly, as the number of high-field (HF) scanners (i.e., less than 3-T) increases in clinical settings and the number of UHF MR systems (higher than 4-T) increases in research and clinical facilities, the opportunity is created for more</para>

            <title>HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</title>
            <para>Over more than a century of recorded research on the effect of static magnetic fields on human subjects, there have been many publications (11-98). These works have shown that no verifiable harmful effect can be attributed to exposure to strong static magnetic fields. This is predominantly attributed to the diamagnetic nature of human tissues and the small number of paramagnetic elements present in the human body. Nevertheless, the fact that, following the introduction of MRI as a dominant medical imaging device, an even larger segment of the human population is being exposed to powerful magnetic fields each year, warranting additional research in this field. It is conceivable that, as MRI becomes available to more developing countries, there will come a time that most human beings will be exposed to strong magnetic fields at some point in their lives.</para>
            <para>There have been few reports of deaths associated with the MRI environment (99-101). A close examination of these fatalities reveals that they were all caused by controllable factors and involved implanted or other extraneous devices that interacted strongly with the MR system's static magnetic field. Knowing that life on our planet is formed in the magnetic field of about 0.5-Gauss indicates that the probable interaction of molecules building life with the magnetic field at this field strength is incorporated into the structure and function of biological tissues. Although the earth's magnetic field is relatively weak, it is sufficient to put a proton of hydrogen into a precession of approximately 2-kHz. Thus, the Larmor precession that takes into account the torque imparted on nuclear spins and formulates their rotational motion will allow the use of the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) of a hydrogen proton to yield its frequency of rotation. This magnetic effect is the basis of the mechanism of signal generation in MRI.</para>
            <para>Attraction by natural magnets had been discovered and cited in many ancient treatises (11). Chinese, Greek, and Persian scientists discovered the unique properties of magnets and offered various treatments for diseases more than a thousand years ago (102, 103). However, since natural ores can produce magnets with a field strength of less than 0.5-T, these materials do not have very high magnetic polarization. Furthermore, the field distributions of natural magnets are inhomogeneous, producing a strong field in small regions unsuitable for observation of any effects that would otherwise require establishing strong fields in larger areas. This is why magnets were not used in many tools before the 19<superscript>th</superscript> century. Electromagnets provided the opportunity of manufacturing magnets stronger than 1-T, but the resistive heat in these magnets placed an upper limit on their applications.</para>
            <para>At the present time, the most powerful electromagnet in the world generates a continuous magnetic field of 35-T, which is a Bitter magnet located at the U.S. National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. Such magnets allow scientists to study exotic effects exhibited by matter only under extreme conditions. The possibility that metallic hydrogen may be a superconductor at room temperature was put forward in 1968, and its potential technological applications initiated interest in even stronger magnets. Because compact high field magnets made of high temperature superconductors may offer highly</para>

            <para>efficient transportation systems and quantum leaps in the computational power of computers, research on the health implications of strong magnets go well beyond their application to MR scanners. Today, the strongest magnets used for MR systems utilize special Niobium-Titanium alloys, which are capable of producing magnetic fields up to approximately 10-Tesla at liquid helium temperatures (104). These so-called type II superconductors are only one class of alloys that reveal superconductivity at cryogenic temperatures. Other materials, such as bismuth alloys, have been used to construct test coils that can achieve 32-Tesla. While strong magnets have been built for research in charged particle accelerators and in electromagnetic ore extraction, their use has not produced a widespread exposure of human subjects to such magnetic fields. The introduction of MRI as the standard of medical diagnosis started the era of pervasive human exposure to strong magnetic fields in the early 1980s.</para>
            <para>From the time of magnetotherapy, when magnets were used for therapeutic purposes, some scientists believed in the treatment capability of magnetic effects on the body. Centuries ago, magnets were used for their presumed effectiveness in remedying headache, pain, and other conditions (105). However, in consideration of the diamagnetic property of human tissues, the interaction with magnetic fields is negligible for most tissues. Because of its iron content and different susceptibility state between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, there is a slight magnetic interaction with hemoglobin. However, this effect has not been large enough for bulk measurement other than its effect on functional MR images, or fMRI. The need for a high static magnetic field and high homogeneity in MR systems requires that these magnets be much larger to simply produce a given field strength. MR scanner magnets are designed to produce a field homogeneity on the order of 10 parts per million (ppm) over the diameter of spherical volumes (DSV) of 50-cm. Producing a highly homogeneous DSV50 with a solenoid magnet is the primary requirement of MR systems.</para>
            <para>Cylindrical superconducting geometries are the most abundant form of "closed" scanners, while permanent and hybrid magnets are often used for "open" MR systems. An account of the dates when MR systems with various magnetic fields were debuted is listed in<emphasis role="bold">Table 2</emphasis> (106-115). In this table, the timing of major increases in field strength has been presented but it is not meant to be a catalogue of improvement in all aspects of magnet technology.</para>
            <para>In assimilation of new MRI technology, three factors have dominated the introduction of new scanners: engineering innovation, safety, and an advantage in clinical diagnostics. The complexity of scientific, financial, and technical factors involved in justifying, funding, and manufacturing whole-body scanners with ever higher field strengths is indicated by the eleven years that were required from the installation of the first 4-T human scanners to the introduction of the first 8-T whole-body MR system (98).</para>
            <para>Currently, a 9.4-T whole-body MR system is located at the University of Illinois and a 10.5-T whole-body scanner exists at the University of Minnesota. The most powerful MR systems in the world, which operate at 11.7-T, have been installed at the National Institutes of Health and at NeuroSpin in Orsay, France. Thus, the increasing the range of proton frequency for the use of MR scanners in human subjects has moved towards 500-MHz. The economics of magnet technology and the scientific capabilities and image resolution of MR systems are on the opposite sides of the trend toward higher field strengths. In one analysis</para>

            <para>At this point, it is worth remembering the prediction of early MRI pioneers that declared MRI a safe modality for scanning humans. That no major, unavoidable incidents have occurred in association with MRI is a testimony to the sound basis of analyzing the interactions of static magnetic fields with human subjects (35-37). Similar studies have been conducted at UHF ranges, indicating that the magnetic interactions with biological tissues are safe up to and including 8-T (98). However, it should be noted that the consequence of taking ferromagnetic materials into the fringe fields of a UHF MR system will create more serious problems than predicted by many authors (57, 62, 63, 66, 83). Similar facts are at work regarding medical implants in patients within fringe fields of MR scanners.</para>

          <para>The mechanisms of interactions between static magnetic fields and biological tissues can be used as the basis for assessing the potential damage in human subjects. Understanding these mechanisms will allow the use of the benefits of MRI while avoiding the possible hazards of exposure to strong magnetic fields.

            <title>Magnetic Forces</title>
            <para>High magnetic fields will exert an attractive force on tissues with permanent magnetic dipoles. Tissues with higher magnetic susceptibilities than water will repel diamagnetic materials (116-117). High field regions are centers of attraction and this is a way for separating tissues with higher paramagnetic susceptibilities. But, this effect is too weak for practical use in living tissues even in high static magnetic fields. The absence of permanently magnetized tissues in the human body makes this force of lesser concern in assessing the safety of these fields, except where materials with permanent magnetic properties are present (e.g., ferromagnetic foreign bodies), because they may experience displacement forces in regions of the spatial gradient magnetic fields.</para>
            <para>Magnetic forces can produce torque on permanently magnetized materials with an elongated shape that will tend to rotate them to align their magnetic moment with the direction of the magnetic field. As such, magnetic torque will rotate magnetic materials to make the long axis of the object parallel to the applied field. Foreign bodies that are ferromagnetic may experience sizable torque, posing even a greater potential hazard than the translational forces on such materials. For materials with different paramagnetic susceptibilities in different directions with respect to the magnetizing field, the anisotropic susceptibility will lead to torque on the axis of the most positive susceptibility, tending to align it with the magnetic field. Diamagnetic susceptibility anisotropy (DSA) observed in some materials has the effect of rotating them to align the axis of least negative susceptibility with the field. Observation of DSA can only be made in vitro because the effect is too weak in vivo for quantitative measurement.</para>

          <title>Flow and Its Consequences</title>
          <para>In the human body, electric fields are normally produced by processes such as the depolarization of the heart tissue that produces current flow, which is the basis of the electrocardiogram (ECG). In addition to the normal static field currents producing the ECG, any motion by the tissue will produce an additional term in the expression for the current density,<emphasis role="bold">J</emphasis> = σ(<emphasis role="bold">E</emphasis> + <emphasis role="bold">v</emphasis> × <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>) where <emphasis role="bold">v</emphasis> is the velocity of the moving tissue relative to the static magnetic field. The term, <emphasis role="bold">v</emphasis> × <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>, is the consequence of motion and can be viewed as a motion-induced electric field.</para>
          <para>Motion of conductive tissues within a magnetic field will produce a force perpendicular to the direction of motion. There are many different types of motions by internal organs in the human body, including those associated with the respiration, peristalsis, the beating heart, and blood flow. The currents produced by blood flow in the presence of powerful magnetic fields are large enough that their effects on body surface potentials have been proposed to be used for a flow meter (118-119).</para>
          <para>The electromotive force (emf) induced as a result of blood flow in the heart produces a large signal during the T-wave phase of the cardiac cycle. In the 1960s, it was shown that electrocardiograms of monkey hearts in strong magnetic fields displayed a field-induced amplified T-wave (44). Subsequent studies have shown this T-wave amplification is the result of blood flow and not from a direct magnetic field effect on cardiac muscle (120-121). This effect is easily demonstrated in patients in clinical, high-field MR systems and contributes to the difficulty in obtaining acceptable electrocardiograms during MRI procedures.</para>
          <para>Dependence of the induced emf on the velocity of blood flow and the strength of the static magnetic has been visualized in humans at field strengths as high as 8-Tesla (98). Importantly, there is no evidence of flow-induced nerve or muscle stimulation for fields as high as 9.4-T because the induced emf is below the threshold levels required for such stimulations to occur (122). As the magnetic field strengths of MR scanners increase, the flow-induced currents near blood vessels could eventually reach levels capable of inducing nerve stimulation, and this may determine the upper limit of human tolerance for exposure to extremely high static magnetic fields (87-88). However, all currently planned research and clinical MR systems operate well below these levels.</para>

          <para>Chemical reactions are at the core of the metabolic function of tissues. The massive number of chemical reactions required for normal function indicates that any external factor, such as an applied static magnetic field capable of altering the rate of these reactions, could affect their equilibrium positions (123-130). This condition prevails, for example, in those chemical reactions in which the products are more paramagnetic than the reactants. Such reactions will respond to the presence of a magnetic field by shifting the reaction equilibrium towards an increase in the concentration of the products, thus, displacing the equilibrium position of the reaction.</para>

However, although the applied field will lower the energy barrier for the dissociation of diamagnetic molecules to paramagnetic molecules, calculations show that the free energy barrier to dissociation of oxyhemoglobin (approximately 64,000-J/mol) will only be changed by about 1-J/mol at a field strength of 4-T. Such disturbances of oxygen dissociation are comparable to a temperature change of only 0.01°C, making it unable to significantly modify the reaction equilibrium (87).</para>
          <para>Another possible magnetic field effect on a chemical reaction involves the dissociation of a binary molecule, AB (124-130). If the bond between A and B is nonmagnetic (electron-pair bond) but the dissociated radicals A and B have unpaired electrons, then the magnetic field will favor dissociation of the bound state, as the two electrons in the bond will have opposite spins and a total spin of zero, while the free spins of individual radicals will be nonzero. Precession of the A and B spins subsequent to dissociation will limit to some extent the tendency toward re-bonding. However, no significant effects on reactions of biochemical significance have been reported from this effect.</para>

          <para>The magnitude of interaction of materials with magnetic fields is directly proportional to their magnetic susceptibility (35). The human body is diamagnetic which makes its interaction with external magnetic fields inherently weak. However, there are small amounts of tissue components that are paramagnetic, which allows them to couple more strongly with magnetic fields (131-136). There is about 3.7-grams of iron in the body of a 70-kg adult human. Fortunately, the iron in the human body is in weak paramagnetic form incorporated in various chemical compounds such as hemoglobin, ferritin and hemosiderin that are spread throughout the body, preventing strong interactions with applied fields. The small concentration of these paramagnetic substances is insufficient to make the overall susceptibility of the tissues, including blood, paramagnetic (90). Obviously, exogenous paramagnetic materials can enter the human body, causing interaction with a magnetic field. For example, studies involving coal miners exposed to rock dust have detected small amounts of particulate magnetite in their lungs (132). Other forms of the deliberate addition of iron oxide-based compounds applied to the body, such as in tattooing involving iron oxide-based pigments, will similarly increase the possibility of magnetic interactions.</para>
          <para>The presence of particles of iron oxides less than 500-angstroms in diameter has been reported in the human brain and other tissues using electron microscopy in autopsy studies (136). The source and function of such particles are unclear and determination of their origin requires further investigations. The small size of these particles makes their artifacts on MR images small to be detected at the range of field strengths used for human MR imaging. Perhaps at higher field strengths, susceptibility enhanced pulse sequences would permit visualization of these particles. However, such "artifacts" will most likely induce sub-voxel signal dropout and require rigorous quantification methods to measure their interactions with magnetic fields.</para>

However, it may be possible that irregularly shaped, iron oxide particles in the implanted pigments experience torque in the magnetic field that rotates them, making their long axis move parallel to the direction of the static magnetic field. The image artifact is caused by the magnetic fields of these particles resulting in signal losses or voids, while the torque that forces their alignment with that static magnetic field may be the cause of tissue irritation, resulting in localized edema. Such tissue irritation could be exacerbated by patient movement inside the static magnetic field of the MR system (i.e., if the patient moves his/her head side-to-side).</para>

            <para>The magnitude of electrical resistance of a material will change when it is placed in an external magnetic field. This phenomenon, called magnetoresistance, is caused by the forces exerted on ions in solutions moving through strong magnetic fields. Depolarizing currents associated with the propagation of nerve and muscle action potentials could be modified by such a field-dependent effect. However, since electrical resistance is a function of dynamics of current-carrying particles, the mean free path (MFP) of these carriers and the time between their collisions plays an important role in determining the size of the magnetoresistance effect.</para>
            <para>For a sufficiently long MFP, an electric field perpendicular to the direction of current will be established, increasing the effective resistivity of the conductors when they are placed in a magnetic field. This phenomenon is called the Hall Effect and, in nerve and muscle tissues, could modify the transmission of currents. However, ions whose flow determines the action potentials of nerve and muscle tissue have an extremely short mean MFP (~ 1-angstrom) and collision times (10<superscript>-12</superscript>-seconds), drastically reducing the effect of magnetoresistance on the associated action potentials (60).

These forces can be substantial in flowing liquid metals such as mercury.

Therefore, contrary to early speculations, there is no requirement for increased heart activity to maintain the cardiac output in the presence of a strong static magnetic field. On the other hand, it may be that very small MHD forces operating on the endolymphatic tissues of the inner ear are the source of sensations of nausea and vertigo sometimes reported by human subjects in the presence of higher static magnetic fields (86, 87).

          <para>Magnetic susceptibility is the term used to define the quantification of the effect of static magnetic fields on matter. Analysis of the magnetic response of tissues through the concept of magnetic susceptibility is a simple method that will be discussed in this section. This analysis will show that the large differences between the magnetic properties of biological tissues and those of ferromagnetic materials govern their different responses to magnetic fields. This difference is so profound that, in many cases, it makes their response to applied magnetic fields qualitatively different. This is why extrapolation of our daily experience with ferromagnetic materials has been the source of the many concerns with the safety of powerful static magnetic fields in predicting the response of tissues to such fields. In this section, the concept of magnetic susceptibility is discussed and the calculations of magnetic forces and torque are presented. The quantitative response of tissues to applied magnetic fields will then be formulated in these terms.</para>

          <title>Magnetic Susceptibility</title>
          <para>Magnetic susceptibility is a quantity that describes the response of materials that are not permanently magnetized to applied magnetic fields (90). The discussion will not consider permanent magnets, such as bar magnets, because their strong interaction with magnetic fields makes them extremely hazardous in the MRI environment. Thus, except in rare situations, permanent magnets are not allowed in the MR system room. Biological tissues have very small magnetic susceptibilities, so they do not interact strongly with applied magnetic fields. This fact is supported by noting the high quality of MR images due to the highly uniform magnetic field inside the human body, as it is situated within the MR scanner (i.e., due to the slight variation in susceptibility in biological tissues).</para>
          <para>Polarization of materials in an applied magnetic field is measured by a quantity called the magnetization, defined as the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume. To provide a quantitative account of the response to magnetic fields in terms of magnetization, System International (SI) units are used along with the standard mathematical convention of using bold face symbols to designate vector quantities. If matter of susceptibility, χ, is placed in magnetic field<emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>, it will develop a magnetization <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis> given by the equation <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis> = χ <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>.

          <para>In an isotropic material, χ is a scalar quantity, meaning that it has the same value in all directions. This is the case in most materials. In isotropic materials, the induced magnetization<emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis> is parallel to <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>, which makes <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis> all parallel to each other. If matter has a preferred direction in which it magnetizes more easily than in other directions, the resultant magnetization is not necessarily parallel to the magnetic field. Such materials are represented by an anisotropic χ in the form of a symmetric tensor.</para>
          <para>Aside from discussing the weak torque formed in certain biological crystals, the analysis is limited to isotropic materials. For materials with large susceptibilities, magnetization is found by taking into account the induced and applied field effects in a self-consistent way. This is due to the fact that in the definition of χ,<emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis> is the sum of the applied and induced fields. The example of ellipsoidal objects using demagnetizing coefficients is worked out in this section to demonstrate such calculations. For biological tissues with very low susceptibility, however, the fields induced by the magnetization are much smaller than the applied field, which makes them negligible. For such material, the magnetization is determined entirely by the applied field, and the more complex self-consistent method is not necessary for their calculations.</para>
          <para>In isotropic material,<emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> are parallel and, as shown in the following discussion, no torque will be formed to align the object with local fields. In reality, the negligible magnitude of torque due to the applied field compared to other biological forces acting on the tissue component allows us to ignore it in our calculations.</para>
          <para>The magnitude and sign of χ determines the extent of the interaction with the applied field. In this regard, materials are classified into three large groups: diamagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. Conservation of energy requires that only χ with values &gt; -1 are possible (140). Diamagnetic materials have negative susceptibilities (i.e., -1.0 &lt; χ &lt; 0). This property causes them to be magnetized in the opposite direction of the applied magnetic field, causing them to be repelled from regions of strong magnetic fields. All materials have diamagnetic properties if they do not possess components, such as the magnetic ions in transition elements, which make a larger positive contribution to χ. Paramagnetic materials have positive χ that makes them attracted to regions of strong magnetic fields. Materials with |χ| &lt; 0.01 do not respond to weak sources of magnetic fields such as handheld magnets and are therefore classified as nonmagnetic. Most common materials including all living beings, with the exception of magnetotactic bacteria, are in this group.</para>
          <para>Ferromagnetic materials with |χ| ≥ 0.01 constitute the third group of materials to which we will refer as ferromagnetic or magnetic. These materials exhibit a strong response to an applied magnetic field, and the large attractive force induced on them poses the biggest danger if taken into the vicinity of an MR system. Some ferromagnetic materials do not appear magnetic until they are exposed to an external field. They are called "soft magnets" to distinguish them from permanent magnets or "hard" magnetic materials.</para>

In fact, χ of most biological tissues differs from that of water by about ± 20%. This narrow range of variation of χ is the primary reason why exquisite MR images are acquired from biological tissues.

            <para>The force of the magnetic field on matter could cause two types of motion, translational and rotational. An object, like a ferromagnetic aneurysm clip with a long blade, if placed in a strong magnetic field, experiences a magnetic force that could cause measurable translational and rotational motions. In the human body, depending on its shape, the object could experience translational attraction and torque that could cause it to move and rotate with respect to the direction of the static magnetic field. The size of the translational forces and/or torque depends on the applied field strength, the susceptibility, and the shape of the material. This could vary from no observable effect to forces large enough to produce serious injury or even lethal consequences. Typically, to understand whether these translational forces and torque will be at a level to significantly alter the structure or function of tissues, we need to develop rigorous mathematical expressions based on the physical properties of the material.</para>
            <para>The work required to move magnetic dipoles within a magnetic field is independent of its path. Therefore, a magnetic potential energy function, U, can be defined that depends on the field strength (position), magnetic dipole moment of the object, the relative angle between the direction of the field and the dipole orientation, and the magnetic properties of the medium (139-142). For magnetization, M, the total dipole moment of a volume, V, for a uniformly magnetized object is<emphasis role="bold">m</emphasis> = <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis> V.

To assess the energy of a non-permanently magnetized object, as is the case for the human body in an MR system, we have to take into account the fact that biological tissues within a static magnetic field acquire a magnetic moment that is proportional to the applied field.

This result can be extended to cases where <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript> is not along a principal axis by resolving it into components along these axes to find the resulting field, which is the sum of the fields along each axis. These expressions for the magnetic response of the object to an applied field work well because they take into account the interaction of <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript> with both the shape of an object, as is represented by D, and the magnetic properties, as is represented by χ.</para>
          <para>Ellipsoids of revolution, with two equivalent axes and two identical demagnetization factors, are a simpler form of the more general ellipsoids that have three independent principal axes and three different demagnetizing factors. For most cases, it is adequate to consider only ellipsoids of revolution. Deduction of important trends for the behavior of non-isotropic objects in a magnetic field is evidence to the utility of the above results. For example, it can be stated that for strongly magnetic materials with χ &gt; 1, to the first order, the internal field<emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis> and the magnetization are independent of the susceptibility and only depend on the shape of the object, D. However, for materials with |χ| &lt;&lt; 1, magnetization <emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis>=χ<emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis><subscript>0</subscript>/μ<subscript>0</subscript>, which makes it parallel to the applied field and independent of the shape of the ellipsoid. Thus, translational forcesand torque acting on ferromagnetic objects in a magnetic field critically depend on the object's shape. For biological tissues with tiny susceptibilities, these same equations predict that the force and torque associated with the magnetic field will be independent of the shape of the tissues.</para>

          <para>provide an insight in the behavior of biological tissues in magnetic fields. Expressions for demagnetization factors for a broad range of ellipsoids of revolution are available in the published literature (90).</para>
          <para>Certain metallic implants have magnetic properties that could put the patient at risk from translational force and torque in association with exposure to the powerful static magnetic field of an MR system. If the combination of the geometrical and magnetic properties produces substantial translational force, then the object could move in the presence of a strong static magnetic field. If the same combination results in torque, then the object could be rotated into alignment with the direction of the static magnetic field. The factors determining the relative strength of these two effects are magnetic susceptibility and the shape of the object as well as its position in the magnetic field that determines the magnitude and the field's spatial gradient magnetic field. Notice that the force does not just depend on the field strength but the product of field's spatial gradient by field strength, B∂B / ∂dz. Therefore, in the regions of a homogeneous magnetic field where ∂B/∂dz ≈ 0, the translational forces are negligible. This does not mean that such metallic devices are safe, because the patient has to pass through the entry region of the MR system where B∂B/∂dz is large and the object could experience a large translational force during this time. As expressions for torque reveal, even for metallic devices with low translational force, torque could pose a greater hazard than the translational force in some cases. A discussion of such cases is warranted here.</para>
          <para>A cylindrical magnet, such as that often used in a high-field MR scanner, offers an opportunity to look in more detail at the analysis of magnetic forces because regions near its central axis have a uniform magnetic field and small field spatial gradients. For spherically symmetrical objects, there is no torque acting on the object. So, the translational forces are caused by the induced magnetization, which is parallel to the applied magnetic field. In the cases of non-isotropic objects like long, thin needles or thin and flat plates, large torque may be formed on these objects. The forces will rotate elongated objects, to make the long axis of the object parallel to the direction of the magnetic field. On a flat object, however, the magnetic field will exert torque, turning it parallel to the field lines of the magnet. The following quantitative analysis is meant to support these predictions.</para>
          <para>The large disparity between demagnetizing factors along axial (a) and radial (r) axes of a needle-like object (D<subscript>a</subscript> &gt;&gt;D<subscript>a</subscript>) when placed in the magnet, with the long axis of the object parallel to the z-axis of the magnet, produces the maximum translational force when the needle is aligned with the field (θ = 0) and at a location where the product B<subscript>z</subscript> ∂B<subscript>z</subscript>/∂z is maximum. Regions at the isocenter of MR system's magnet (i.e., where MR imaging occurs) have a very homogenous magnetic field (∂B<subscript>z</subscript>/∂z≈0), although the magnitude of the magnetic field in these regions is highest.

          <para>for this magnet was 1.5/m, while for most superconducting cylindrical magnets, regardless of their field strengths, this ratio will be comparable to that of the 8-T scanner. For an ellipsoid of length L = 1-cm in this magnet the F<subscript>torque</subscript><superscript>max</superscript>/F<subscript>trans</subscript><superscript>max</superscript> = 75. Since the 8-T magnet was unshielded, for shielded magnets, the ratio, R, would be smaller because the value [B<subscript>z</subscript> ∂B<subscript>z</subscript>/∂x]<subscript>max</subscript> is larger for such magnets. The large ratio of rotational and translational force indicates that elongated ferromagnetic implants must be tightly anchored to or retained in the patient's tissues because a much larger force is required to prevent rotation as opposed to translational attraction. This is particularly true for implants such as a ferromagnetic aneurysm clip with one dimension longer than the other (i.e., an aneurysm clip with a long blade). These calculations indicate that the possibility of patient injury from aneurysm clips in magnetic fields is much higher due to rotational force than by translational motion. This is notable, because estimations of the effect of magnetic fields have traditionally been focused on translational forces.</para>
          <para>Hairpins or paper clips are occasionally lodged inside the MR system. Since the clip is being pulled out of the magnet, the small attractive translational force is at a maximum near the opening of the magnet (i.e., the opening of the bore the scanner) where the patient is inserted for the MRI exam. Torque, however, has a different positional dependence and a maximum value occurs near the center of the magnet, where the axis of the paper clip is at a direction of 45-degrees with respect to the z-axis of the magnetic field.</para>
          <para>A close examination of the behavior of biological tissues, with |χ| &lt;&lt; 1 by using the expressions listed in Table 3, demonstrates that the magnitude of the torque acting on these tissues is proportional to χ<superscript>2</superscript>. Due to the opposite signs of the susceptibilities of diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials, they are expected to point in opposite directions when lined</para>
          <para>up in a uniform magnetic field. However, the χ<superscript>2</superscript>-dependence of torque means that the direction of alignment would be the same for both types of materials. A more important consequence of the χ<superscript>2</superscript>-dependence of torque is that, for very small values of χ, the alignment torque that is caused by the shape-dependence is negligible. As shown by the above analysis, materials with high susceptibility and those of very low susceptibilities show qualitatively different responses to magnetic fields. Thus, powerful magnetic fields apply strong forces on flat ferromagnetic objects, such as magnetic washers, that could align their "face" parallel to the field. Since red blood cells basically have the same geometry as washers, they were expected to experience torque large enough to align them with their flat side parallel to the magnetic field. But, due to the small magnitude of their susceptibility, χ ≈ 10<superscript>-10</superscript>, the torque acting on red blood cells is exceedingly low and unable to cause any measurable, shape-dependent effect.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Diamagnetic Susceptibility Anisotropy</emphasis>The shape-dependence of torque due to field inhomogeneity and demagnetizing factors has been demonstrated to be negligible for biological materials due to χ<superscript>2</superscript>-dependence of the torque expression. However, another mechanism through which magnetic fields can interact with biological tissues is referred to as diamagnetic susceptibility anisotropy (DSA). This effect has been observed in the assembly of large numbers of macromolecules when they are bound together in a crystalline structure. This effect is present when all the molecules in a crystal are twisted in the same orientation by the applied magnetic field. Such conditions allow the torque on individual elements in all the molecules or cells in a volume V to add up to a measurable level. If susceptibility is anisotropic in a tissue, then we can designate its magnitude in one direction of this tissue as χ<subscript>1</subscript> and the angle between this direction and the applied field as θ. For tissues in which susceptibility in both orthogonal directions is the same and equal to χ<subscript>2</subscript>, we can assume that for diamagnetic tissues |χ<subscript>1</subscript>|, |χ<subscript>2</subscript>| &lt;&lt; 1. For such</para>
          <para>tissues, the magnetic energy is given by U = (1/2)VM • B<subscript>o</subscript> = (VB<subscript>o</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>)/(2μ<subscript>o</subscript>)[χ<subscript>1</subscript> cos<superscript>2</superscript> θ + χ<subscript>2</subscript> sin<superscript>2</superscript> θ]</para>

          <para>Biological materials usually have negative χ<subscript>1</subscript> and χ<subscript>2</subscript> of the order of -10<superscript>-5</superscript> that in magnetic fields will experience torque that tends to rotate the object in a direction that aligns the axis with the least negative value of χ with the field. The difference of susceptibility between the two axes is Δχ = χ<subscript>1</subscript> - χ<subscript>2</subscript> that is approximately 1% to 10% of the average susceptibility, (χ<subscript>1</subscript> + 2 χ<subscript>2</subscript>)/3. For biological tissues, Δχ is of the range of 10<superscript>-7</superscript> to 10<superscript>-6</superscript>, which is much larger than the shape-dependent torque that has an order of magnitude of 10<superscript>-10</superscript>. Prediction of the analysis presented here (i.e., the four order of magnitude larger value of anisotropy-dependent torque than shape-dependent torque) is confirmed by observation in biological materials (143). Another important factor governing the size of torque in the expressions derived in this chapter is the volume, V, of the tissue, which indicates that aggregation of anisotropic molecules to form larger assemblies will increase the torque that can, in turn, enhance the effect of the magnetic field on these tissues.</para>

However, the hemoglobin S molecules in sickle cell red blood cells have a tendency to "stick" together. This binding tendency makes them aggregate, polymerize, form fibers and gel-like structures that are made up of similarly oriented hemoglobin molecules that are bound together. The anisotropic molecules in these structures and their binding in an aligned formation increase the anisotropy of the overall structure that have revealed anisotropy-dependent orientation in these studies (45, 46). However, this effect has only been reported based on laboratory studies. Unlike the conditions <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis>, where there is no force competing with magnetic force, the forces experienced by red blood cells in flowing blood are much larger than the magnetic forces of orientation (61, 74, 77, 85). Experiments allowing the observation of magnetic orientation in the presence of flow, however slow, would shed light on the necessary conditions for red blood cell orientation, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>.</para>
          <para>Other structures, such as retinal rod cells, nucleic acid solutions, and fibrin gels have revealed similar orientation effects,<emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> (144-149). Similar to red blood cells, we are unaware of a report of magnetic orientation effects by these structures, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>, for the same reason that flow forces overwhelm the magnetic orientation forces preventing alignment. The size of the magnetic torque, however, as is shown by our equations, depends on B<subscript>0</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>. This fact points to a rapidly growing orientation torque as the magnetic field strength increases. Since the trend in MRI is relentlessly pushing for higher static magnetic fields, studies of orientation effects at these higher field strengths are warranted to reveal them, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>, and to incorporate them into plans for safe exposure of human subjects to such high static magnetic fields. In fact, experiments have already been performed in which 16-T magnets were used to demonstrate that cleavage planes of developing frog embryos orient in powerful magnetic fields (150). Anisotropy-dependent alignment of tubulin molecules has been presented as the cause of this observation (151). Independent confirmation of these effects would validate the effect and the explanation, because many magnetic field effects on biological tissues have proven difficult to reproduce.</para>

            <title>Alignment of Water Molecules</title>
            <para>We need to be aware of the magnetic field strength required to align water molecules,<emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>. Although not reported, the far-reaching consequence of such effect on life justifies the vigilance. The possibility of aligning of water molecules in magnetic fields and its ability to alter the biological and physiological processes in tissues are already proposed as a rationale for magnetotherapy, a commercial venture with some success in convincing its followers of its therapeutic efficacy. This is in consideration of the fact that physics allows us to estimate the extent of alignment of water molecules inside magnetic fields. The random orientation of water molecules is the cause of its small magnetic susceptibility of χ = -9.05 × 10<superscript>-6</superscript>. A variation of about one-percent in χ along the principal axes of the molecule is caused by the asymmetry of the water molecule (152). As previously discussed, susceptibility anisotropy is the basis of the development of magnetic torque. Therefore, we need to calculate the magnetic alignment energy of a water molecule. Here, we will present such calculations for an applied field of 10-Tesla as is presently close to the upper range of</para>

            <para>yields M = χH = χ/μ<subscript>o</subscript> B = -72 A/m. This is the magnetization, which is the sum of magnetic dipole moments of 3.34 x 10<superscript>7</superscript> water molecules per cubic meter. The average dipole moment per water molecule in a field of 10-Tesla is calculated to be m = -2.16 x 10<superscript>-27</superscript> J/T. The implication of 1% anisotropy of the molecular magnetization is that a maximum magnetic energy change due to change in molecular orientation is calculated to be ΔE = 2.16 x 10<superscript>-29</superscript> J. To compare this magnetic energy with thermal energy of the human body at 38°C</para>
            <para>yields kT = 4.28 x 10<superscript>-21</superscript> J and a ratio of ΔE/kT = 5.0 x 10<superscript>-9</superscript> for a 10-T magnet. This indicates that the magnetic energy is 200 million times smaller than thermal energy at 10-Tesla. Such minimal energy is unlikely to cause significant biological or physiological changes in water molecules, in vivo.</para>
            <para>These results indicate that for a 0.01% deviation from random orientation of water molecules, a static magnetic field strength of 450-Tesla is needed. This is in spite of the B<superscript>2</superscript>-dependence of the magnetic energy. By comparison, the expected alignment within the fields of even ultra-high-field-strength MR systems is negligible. To our knowledge, to date, no observation of magnetic field-induced alignment of water molecules has been reported at the static magnetic field strengths used for research or clinical scanners. This is in agreement with the model presented above for magnetic alignment of diamagnetic molecules in strong magnetic fields.</para>

            <para>Injury can be caused by the application of forces on tissues. For tissue components with large differences in magnetic properties, such forces could develop in nonuniform magnetic fields. As it was shown earlier, diamagnetic tissue components tend to move toward lower fields and paramagnetic tissue components will be forced to higher field regions. The formation of such opposing forces on components of the same tissue could interfere with the physiological function of the tissue and lead to injury. It is conceivable that under normal circumstances, biological structures have greater internal forces, such as electric forces involved in chemical reactions, than magnetic forces due to susceptibility variations (34, 87). Furthermore, gravitational forces and forces produced by acceleration and other motions during routine activities produce considerable forces on tissue components. The evolution of life under the gravitational action of Earth and routine life activities must have resulted in development of the "means" to incorporate these forces in the inner workings of living beings. These "means" will be unable to identify the source of the force and end up preventing tissue function from being substantially affected by magnetic forces.</para>

Behavior of red blood cells in the blood is affected by its higher density than plasma, making them sink in the blood in the absence of larger hemodynamic forces. This effect, called erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), is used in the laboratory to test for abnormalities of blood proteins. While gravitational forces are useful for separation of blood ingredients in test tubes, they are too small to make red blood cells sink, in vivo.</para>
          <para>The molecule, hemoglobin, has four iron atoms in each molecule that reduce the diamagnetic properties of red blood cells, making it slightly less than that of surrounding plasma. This pushes red blood cells toward regions of strong magnetic fields relative to the plasma. Using the expression for magnetic force from Table 3, the magnitude of this differential force is given by (χ<subscript>rbc</subscript> - χ<subscript>plasma</subscript>)V<subscript>rbc</subscript>/μ<subscript>o</subscript> B<subscript>o</subscript> ∂B<subscript>o</subscript>/∂z.

          <para>g = 9.8-m/s<superscript>2</superscript>. As is seen from these calculations, even at the highest static magnetic field strength available for MRI research, the maximum magnetic force capable of separating the red blood cells from the plasma is about 13 percent of the gravitational forces. Considering that gravitational forces have negligible effects, in vivo, the effect of magnetic forces is even smaller by almost an order of magnitude for static magnetic fields of up to 8-T.</para>
          <para>Discussions and calculations in this section show that, while finite magnetic effects act on tissues in magnetic fields, their magnitude for field strengths available for MRI examinations in human subjects is relatively small when compared to other known forces, such as gravitational and routine physical activities, and these forces are clearly incapable of causing injury to biological tissues. Importantly, forces maintaining the integrity of molecular and cellular structures of biological tissues appear to be orders of magnitude larger than the forces that magnetic fields can exert on living beings.</para>

Research in this area has revealed that motion in strong magnetic fields could induce mild sensory effects that are transient and not harmful (44, 48, 80, 86). These reports rely on a subjective description of sensory stimulations and, as such, their effects have to be interpreted with great</para>

          <para>caution because the number of studies of these effects is limited. On the issue of subjectivity of this effect, reports have documented static magnetic field-induced sensory effects experienced by staff members working around superconducting magnets, even during the time when the magnets were "off" (89). Nevertheless, comparisons of incidents at different field strengths show that human subjects exposed to higher fields (e.g., 9.4-Tesla) reported higher rates of sensory stimulation than those subjected to a 0.5-Tesla field (5, 86, 153). Field-dependence of sensory effects has been both expected and reported by workers on high field strength scanners. Particularly, sensations of nausea, vertigo, and metallic taste related to exposures to static magnetic fields operating at 4-, 8-, and 9.4-Tesla have been reported (5, 86, 153). However, effects such as headache, tinnitus, vomiting, hiccups, and numbness that have sometimes been attributed to static magnetic field exposures have not been consistently observed for the same field strengths.</para>
          <para>Magnetophosphenes, sensations of light flashing when the eyes are moved rapidly while inside the magnetic field in a dark room, have been reported at static magnetic field strengths of up to 9.4-Tesla. Computational results have confirmed the factors involved in the observation of magnetophosphenes and have provided quantitative models for this phenomenon (154).</para>
          <para>Sensory experiences in static magnetic fields from 0.5- to 9.4-Tesla have been reported and shown that avoiding rapid body movements inside these magnetic fields may reduce these sensations. In addition, lower field strengths are associated with reduced sensations of peripheral nerve stimulation. However, there is substantial evidence that magnetic field-induced sensory effects are caused by activation of highly excitable sensory systems by weak electrical currents that can be induced by moving certain body parts inside magnetic fields (154-156). Sensations such as nausea have been reported, which are probably caused by magnetic forces exciting motion sensors in the semicircular canals of the inner ear (98). This specific effect may be created due to a conflict in the position information supplied by the visual systems and vestibular position-sensing system. A possible source of vertigo could be magnetic forces caused by diamagnetic anisotropy of the inner ear receptors. Small amounts of torque acting on these receptors could induce a small level of sensory effects. Notably, the slow movement of the patient inside or around a very strong magnetic field drastically reduces sensory stimulations and provides comfort in association with the performance of an MRI examination using a UHF MR system. For this reason, the 7-Tesla MR system that is approved for clinical use (Terra, Siemens Healthineers) has a table that moves the patient slowly into the scanner, thus, avoiding the afore-mentioned issues related to rapid movements in a powerful static magnetic field.</para>

          <para>Various investigations performed using laboratory animals and human subjects exposed to high static magnetic fields have reported that there are no changes in skin or body temperatures (6, 158-160). Utilizing a fluoroptic thermometry system known to be impervious to strong magnetic fields to record temperatures in laboratory animals and human studies ensures that accurate temperature readings are achieved inside the bore of the MR system. In consideration of the above, to date, exposure to static magnetic fields is not believed to alter human body temperatures.</para>

            <para>The safety of human exposure to MR systems is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States (U.S.) and other similar agencies outside of the U.S. The FDA provides guidelines for the limits of safe exposures to static magnetic fields as well as the other electromagnetic fields used for MRI (i.e., gradient magnetic fields and radiofrequency power deposition). The FDA's assessment of the health risks associated with exposure to static magnetic fields was last updated in 2014, with the upper limit set at 8-Tesla (4). The World Health Organization (WHO) also established health criteria for static magnetic fields within the Environmental Health Criteria Program (163). The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) reports, along with other similar documents, offers insight and regulatory guidelines pertaining to the biological effects of exposure to static magnetic fields (163-176). The regulatory body in the United Kingdom for medical device safety is the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and in the European Union, this task is carried out by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). All of these regulatory bodies evaluate the available scientific databases and develop the rationale for updated guidelines as new data and technology become available (169-179).</para>
            <para>The Medical Devices Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 1977 required MRI to demonstrate its viability as an imaging modality and safety for the first time. Subsequent to the discovery of MRI as an important medical imaging device, major manufacturers introduced their products and applied for FDA approval. Rapid success in demonstrating its safe operation led to the 1987 FDA designation of a static magnetic field strength of 2-T as the limit below which MR systems will pose a non-significant risk to human subjects. Proliferation of MR scanners and research systems helped to support an increase in the non-significant field strength risk to 4-T in 1996 and 8-T in 2003 (note, this document was updated in 2014)(4).

            <para>Exposure to strong magnetic fields is often greater from a time consideration for workers involved with manufacturing and testing magnet-based instruments and devices than it is for patients. In addition to workers involved in the manufacturing process for MR systems, MRI researchers, MRI technologists/radiographers working in research, medical center, and out-patient settings, as well as experimental high-energy physicists are among the populations with chronic exposures to strong static magnetic fields. To regulate chronic exposures, guidelines have been developed by certain countries. Proposed in Europe, a time-weighted average field exposure of 0.20-T/8-hour would limit the workers to 0.2-T field for an eight-hour day or 8-T for 12-minutes. A higher limit of 2-T/8-hour limit was proposed for the extremities by these guidelines. The lack of confirmed evidence for harmful cumulative effects of exposures to static magnetic fields has made these limits less consequential than the limit on the highest static magnetic field strength applied to human subjects. This is especially true as the fields outside the magnets are highly inhomogeneous. The strong spatial variation of the magnetic fields is not usually specified for MR systems, and because of this (i.e., the fringe field), workers are not constantly exposed to the magnetic field, making it difficult to measure the effect over a workday period. For these workers, the most ominous potential hazard remains to be the inadvertent introduction of ferromagnetic tools or other objects into areas with high fringe fields.</para>

            <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
            <para>According to health data published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2009, the average number of MRI examinations performed per 1,000-population per year for the thirty countries of the OECD was forty-one. Considering the population of the OECD to be 1.2 billion means that approximately 54 million MRI exams were performed in the thirty OECD countries each year (180). In the United States, 91.2 MRI procedures per 1,000-population equates to about 28 million examinations annually. Nevertheless, no unpreventable harm to the patients from exposure to the static magnetic field has been reported. As previously indicated, all serious accidents associated with MR systems, to date, have been caused by the involuntary introduction of ferromagnetic materials or medical devices into the magnetic field. In addition to clinical scanners, research scanners operating at fields of up to 11.7-Tesla for human subjects and over 20-T for animals have shown no major safety incidents, which has laid the foundation for clinical scanners to be designed for operation at higher field strengths. There is still considerable fertile</para>
            <para>ground for research in studying the interaction of biological tissues with stronger magnetic fields, regardless of how safe the record of operation at high static magnetic fields is at the present time.</para>
            <para>Keeping in mind that the spatial gradient magnetic field will be larger for higher field strength magnets, more stringent measures to exclude the presence of ferromagnetic objects from MRI suites will be needed. In spite of the existence of more than eighty 7-T research and clinical MR systems around the world, a number of technological issues such as RF inhomogeneity, susceptibility artifacts, and RF power deposition (i.e., SAR) issues will continue to present challenges (178). Nevertheless, the relentless drive for higher fields is achieving new milestones, such as the 21.1-T, 105-mm magnet located at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida (which currently is the strongest MR system in the world used for small animal imaging). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) devices operating at 23.5-T with a hydrogen proton Larmor frequency of 1-GHz and a bore size of 54-mm are now commercially available. This trend will continue and the safety investigations involving small animals will add valuable information for our understanding of the interactions of these fields with living beings.</para>
            <para>Research on the effect of strong magnetic fields on tissues, cells, and molecules has not produced evidence for its harm to human life. The magnetic forces analyzed in many publications have proven to be insignificant compared to the natural forces that maintain the structural integrity of the tissues and the routine forces to which the human body is exposed to during everyday activities.</para>
            <para>Regulatory bodies have justifiably taken the attitude of requiring verification of any claim of adverse effects to static magnetic fields before limits are incorporated into safety guidelines. This is a reasonable approach that has demonstrated attention to scientific findings, while preventing unnecessary impediments to research and exploration of benefits of magnetic fields for the good of society.</para>
            <para>Fortunately, the physics of such interactions are straightforward and simple calculations provide insight into the order of magnitude of magnetic field effects. To date, such calculations have indicated that forces exerted on diamagnetic materials, of which biological tissue are overwhelmingly made, are insignificant compared to other forces involved in maintaining their structure and function. It seems that all of the major revisions in the FDA guidelines for assessing non-significant risk involved in the exposure of human subjects to static magnetic fields have followed this course of action. The present FDA guidelines recommend 8-T as the strongest magnetic field with non-significant risk. As the field strengths are increasing for whole body scanners, it is conceivable that sensory effects such as vertigo, metallic taste, magnetophosphenes, and possibly other responses may become more prevalent. However, no permanent harm from these effects has been presented. Transient effects caused by movement inside the magnetic field can be minimized through MRI operator training. Notably, the long-term, cumulative effect of exposures to static magnetic fields is a topic requiring additional research.</para>
            <para>As the field strength of MR systems increases, it is conceivable that eventually, one of the forces of interaction will become large enough to require limiting its effect on human life. Diamagnetic susceptibility is unlikely to be the limiting factor. However, the effect of</para>
            <para>field inhomogeneity and the magnetic effect on blood flow could limit the persistent drive towards higher fields. For now, even research magnets seem to be far from that limit and we are fortunate to be able to safely explore the benefits of higher static magnetic fields in order to visualize the structure and function of the human body. If more complex safety studies continue to confirm that there are no substantial adverse effects, then much higher magnetic fields could become available for human MR imaging to continuously enhance our ability to observe otherwise opaque biological structures and functions. Such observations may lead to better healthcare for future generations and offer an understanding of the mysteries of life.</para>
