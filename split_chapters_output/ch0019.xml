        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>The number of active implanted medical devices available for treatment of medical conditions continues to increase rapidly. These devices are implanted frequently to address significant clinical conditions, and it is this group of patients that typically has need for clinical imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since these implants contain metallic components, by definition they cannot be considered MR Safe; they can be considered only MR Conditional or MR Unsafe. An active implantable medical device (AIMD) is a "medical device relying for its function on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity". In contrast, a passive medical device is one that serves its function without any source of power other than that generated by the human body or gravity (1). Notably, manufacturers are increasingly engineering their AIMDs to be MR Conditional, recognizing the commercial competitive advantage this can offer by permitting patients the ability to avail themselves of the diagnostic power of MRI.</para>

    <para>Performing MRI examinations safely demands accurate identification of the precise make and model of any AIMD. Failure to identify an AIMD in a patient undergoing MRI can lead to severe risks. There is a well-known case in which a patient with a deep brain stimulation system suffered a severe radiofrequency (RF)-related burn to the thalami, resulting in a permanent neurological deficit (2). Undisclosed cardiac pacemakers have been associated with patient deaths in associating with the use of MRI. In 2020, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) foundation declared incomplete AIMD information in MRI patients as one of the top ten patient safety risks (3). Also in 2020, a panel of ten radiologists with expertise in MRI safety from nine high-volume academic centers was formed, with the objective of providing clarity on safety issues for the ten most frequently questioned devices (4). This panel reviewed the relevant peer-reviewed literature that was focused on key MRI-related issues regarding screening and adverse event reports, in addition to the manufacturer's Instructions For Use for various products. Using a Delphi-inspired method, 36 practical recommendations were generated with 100% consensus that should aid the clinical MRI community with respect to screening patients with biomedical implants (4).</para>
    <para>Sound, comprehensive screening processes are essential (5), and patients and/or their medical providers should be questioned at the time of ordering MRI exams about the presence of implanted devices. As an adjunct, electronic medical records are increasingly incorporating "implanted devices" modules that maintain important device-specific information (6). By identifying any device-specific MRI-related conditions prior to the patient's arrival at the facility, this can enhance efficiency by scheduling the patient on the proper 1.5-T or 3-T MR system, ensure timely availability of proper equipment such as transmit/receive RF head coils, and appropriate personnel (e.g., MR Safety Officers or MRSOs, specially-trained MRI technologists, MRI physicians, AIMD programming staff, etc.). This device-specific information should be reconciled when the patient reports to the MRI facility. Frequently, the patient will have an implant identification card from the device manufacturer that identifies the particular device. If the device was implanted at another institution, surgical records should be provided by written means, frequently by fax or similar alternative, to obtain the relevant information including the particular type of AIMD that is present and its component parts (e.g., the models of the implantable pulse generator and leads). It should be noted that verbal relaying of important device-specific information should not be permitted due to potential errors in accurately conveying the information. As an example, three different types of Yasargil aneurysm clips (Aesculap, www.aesculap.com) exist. The model FD, FE, and FT - all of which rhyme, and if the information for the clip model were conveyed only by telephone, and it was misinterpreted, there could be severe safety consequences insofar as the FE and FT models are MR Conditional, while the FD is MR Unsafe. Similarly, blanket statements from an outside facility purporting to claim that all their implants are "MRI compatible" or "MRI Safe" is unacceptable. As part of the screening process at the MRI facility, a ferromagnetic detection system can assist in disclosing the presence of certain implanted devices (7, 8).</para>
    <para>With positive identification of the device-specific make and model of the AIMD, several sources exist to identify whether a device is MR Unsafe or MR Conditional, with associated conditions. These include MRISafety.com, MagResource, Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID), and the specific device manufacturer's websites. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the GUDID, which is a compilation of every device</para>
    <para>that has a unique device identifier (UDI). With the UDI number, the GUDID website provides the manufacturer, name of the device and, in some cases, the MRI safety information as to whether the device is MR Conditional, MR Unsafe, or MR Safe. Other possible sources can then be consulted regarding the necessary conditions for safe scanning. For example, the MagnetVision app is a tool that is designed to help MRI healthcare professionals assess anticipated risks for patients with implants prior to performing MRI examinations (9).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Implant Movement</emphasis></para>
    <para>The MRI environment poses multiple challenges to safe scanning in a patient with an AIMD (Table 1). First, ferromagnetic content in the device is subject to translational attraction and torque from magnetic field interactions. Of note is that, typically, only limited ferromagnetic material remains in today's AIMDs, primarily associated with the power source (e.g., batteries). As the patient enters the MR system and moves through the spatial gradient magnetic field, nonferromagnetic metals are subjected to Lorentz forces that can produce slight displacement and vibration of the implanted metallic object. As such, it can be helpful for MRI staff members to alert the patient with an AIMD of this non-harmful possibility prior to entering the MR scanner to allay any concerns or fears if such minor movement is perceived. The potential mobility of the device is related to the degree to which it is encased by fibrous scar tissue or surgically fixed in place. Particularly for devices that are implanted off the central axis of the body, there is increasing tendency for these to be</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Heating of Device Components</emphasis></para>
    <para>Heating of device components primarily from the RF field is a major concern with respect to the leads associated with AIMDs. Conductive materials may act as resonant antennae, locally amplifying the RF energy used for MR image formation. Particularly in the context of neurostimulation systems, RF-related heating of leads in close proximity to sensitive tissues can potentially produce severe damage (2). In insulated leads where induced current is not dissipated over the length of the lead, heating is concentrated at the tip. Temperatures below 43°C are not associated with the long-term damage. However, at 60°C, there is instant protein denaturation and tissue coagulation. At temperatures between 44° and 60°C, tissue death is time-dependent.</para>
    <para>Particularly in insulated leads, the lead length exposed to the RF field is an important variable because heating is associated with the resonant frequency, with maximal heating related to the one-half wavelength. MR systems operating at 1.5-T and 3-T detect the nuclear magnetic resonance signal of <superscript>1</superscript>H nuclei at 64-MHz (wavelength 52 cm, one-half wavelength - 26 cm) and 128-MHz (wavelength 26 cm, one-half wavelength - 13 cm) resonance frequency, respectively. It should be noted that in body tissue, the effective wavelength is affected also by tissue permittivity as well as other factors (10).</para>
    <para>The physical length of the lead specified by the manufacturer may not correspond to the total length of the conductive material within the lead, making it difficult to predict which leads may create resonant conditions. Importantly, the attachment of a lead to an implantable pulse generator (IPG) can have a large influence on heating at the lead tip, with the possibility for temperatures being greatly elevated if the lead is unattached or abandoned. As result, there may be an increased risk of heating when scanning in the presence of abandoned leads, or when leads are unattached to an IPG (11).</para>
    <para>Other factors that can influence RF energy-related current deposition and heat production include the type of transmit RF coil employed for imaging and the position of the metallic implant, as well as its "path" or configuration, relative to the transmitted RF. The majority of clinically utilized receive-only RF coils rely on an integrated body transmit RF coil for RF excitation, exposing the majority of the patient's body to RF energy. Smaller transmit/receive (T/R) RF coils (e.g., the T/R head RF coil, T/R knee RF coil, etc.) that both broadcast RF and detect the emitted signals, are readily available on MR systems for head or extremity imaging. The smaller head or extremity transmit/receive RF coils typically deposit the majority of RF within the volume of the coil, only. Notably, the MRI-related conditions for AIMDs may specify eligible types of transmit RF coils and/or acceptable distances of the AIMD away from the transmit RF coil in order to limit or prevent exposure to RF energy during MRI.</para>
    <para>It is important to emphasize that MRI-related conditions, particularly related to RF-induced heating, cannot be presumed at different static magnetic field strengths or for multinuclear (i.e., non-proton) imaging, because the frequency and the frequency and wavelengths of the RF pulses are field strength dependent. For example, conditional safety</para>
    <para>for an AIMD at 3-T/128-MHz at a specific SAR level does not imply conditional safety at 1.5-T/64-MHz (10). Induced currents, particularly within AIMDs, is also a possibility due to exposure to the rapidly switching gradient magnetic fields associated with MRI.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Device Malfunction</emphasis></para>
    <para>Time-varying gradient magnetic fields and RF can induce currents within the AIMD, which may interfere with the control electronics. Thus, when exposed to the RF and gradient fields, AIMDs may improperly function or "reset". The static magnetic field can also interact with certain devices, especially those with moving metallic components. For example, implantable infusion pumps with rotor mechanisms can slow down or stop as a result of exposure to the static magnetic field of the MR system (see section on <emphasis role="bold">Implantable Infusion Pumps</emphasis>).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">PERFORMING MRI IN PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICES</emphasis></para>
    <para>Active implanted medical devices include cardiac devices (cardiac pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, loop recorders and others) and neurostimulation systems (deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation systems, vagus nerve stimulation systems, sacral nerve stimulation systems, hypoglossal nerve stimulation systems, peripheral nerve stimulation systems, auditory brainstem implants, cochlear implants, and others), implantable infusion pumps, ingestible video endoscopy capsules, and others devices. An exhaustive discussion of each of these is well beyond the scope of this chapter, however, other chapters in this textbook provide relevant information for AIMDs.</para>
    <para>Because conditions for scanning frequently change and new devices are constantly becoming available, it is essential that MRI healthcare workers ensure that they are using the most up-to-date information that is available. As always, it is essential to not fall prey to "siloed search" recognizing that patients may present with multiple implanted devices, any of which could be dangerous if not scanned with the appropriate MRI-related conditions.</para>
    <para>It is also important to understand that, within a particular model of AIMD, there may be multiple configurations using various components or lead models. In general, the evaluation of an AIMD for MRI-related issues is highly specific to the complete system and particular to a given IPG and leads. As such, the MRI-related conditions to perform an MRI exam safely may have different limits, depending on which components are present in the patient. Each component of the AIMD must be carefully identified to ensure that the complete system is MR Conditional. In some cases, an AIMD may involve MR Conditional components from different manufacturers and, as a result, the safety of scanning the patient is unknown because that scenario was never tested.</para>

A patient undergoing an MRI of the lumbar spine using a body transmit system suffered a significant lesion in the thalamus on the side ipsilateral to the relatively long lead connected to an IPG implanted in the abdomen area, resulting in a hemiparesis (2)(Figure 2). Whereas cardiac tissue is highly perfused and difficult to thermally injure in relation to MRI, neural tissues are extremely sensitive to even modest temperature elevations.</para>
    <para>MRI safety conditions for scanning patients with certain DBS systems are generally associated with a strictly limited, whole-body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 0.1 W/kg or a B<subscript>1+Root Mean Squared</subscript> (B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>) value of 2.0 μT (13, 14). It is essential that, when performing MRI in patients with DBS systems, that the MRI safety conditions are followed in their entirety without deviations, and are considered with the entire system recognized (13, 14). Limiting the assessment of conditions for safe scanning only to those related, for example, to the IPG, without appreciating conditions associated with the implanted leads could pose substantial hazards for the patient. By way of example, for certain DBS systems from Medtronic, the presence of a pocket adapter associated with the IPG precludes the use of the transmit body RF coil, limiting the MRI exam to transmit/receive RF coils because pocket adaptors permit older style leads with low impedance (i.e., unsuitable for use of the</para>
