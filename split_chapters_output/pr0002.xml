<preface id="pr0002"><title>Preface</title><para>Since its introduction into clinical practice in the early 1980s, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has exhibited exceptional growth and created a paradigm shift in medicine. Not only has this imaging modality markedly expanded the roles of imaging in medical diagnoses, opening up vistas in neurological, musculoskeletal, oncological, cardiovascular and a variety of other diseases not accessible to prior imaging techniques, but it has also had a profound impact on our basic understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of abnormal conditions and disease processes.</para>
    <para>The continuous growth of MRI has led to an explosion in the number of patients, healthcare professionals, and other individuals exposed to the powerful static magnetic field, rapidly changing magnetic fields, and intense radiofrequency fields used during the procedures. Numerous investigations have been performed during the past 35+ years in an effort to characterize the bioeffects and safety aspects of MRI. However, the interactions of the MRI-related electromagnetic fields with biologic tissues are still incompletely understood and safety issues persist despite best efforts to implement preventive practices. Unfortunately, this has led to many adverse consequences, including injuries to patients and healthcare workers, as well as several patient deaths.</para>
    <para>The transformative impact of MRI on medicine continues to progress and advances in technology continue unabated. Whereas the highest magnetic field used in routine clinical imaging was 1.5-Tesla during most of the 1990s, 3-Tesla is currently the standard. Presently, a 7-Tesla scanner is approved for clinical use and research is routinely performed at 9.4-Tesla, 10.5- and an 11.7-Tesla MR system recently came on line to scan human subjects. In addition to the high static magnetic fields, both the speed of magnetic field gradient switching and the levels of radiofrequency field exposures are pushing limits well beyond what was possible just a few years before. Therefore, we strongly believe that, for progress to continue in this field, appropriate safeguards must be in place to protect all human subjects exposed to MRI, which includes both patients and healthcare workers, alike. This is best accomplished by conducting careful research directed towards studying the effects of the electromagnetic fields used in clinical and research MRI settings and implementing cautionary measures based on the knowledge acquired during the last three and a half decades.</para>
    <para>Ultimately, MRI safety must begin with understanding the interactions of the electromagnetic fields used in MRI with biologic tissues. The issues concerning human safety in the MRI environment led us to enlist leading physicians and scientists around the world to collaborate on the first edition of this textbook, published in 2014, which organized and reviewed the scientific literature on the safety aspects of MRI. Since then, there have been thousands of new articles published in the scientific literature detailing MRI safety issues from every conceivable approach. Thus, the first edition of this textbook rapidly became outdated. Accordingly, we once again brought together an internationally respected group</para>
    <para>v</para>
    <para>of experts who are directly involved in all areas of MRI bioeffects, safety, and patient management to update this important book. Notably, several new chapters were added to this second edition, with the intent of covering advanced or emerging topics for the MRI community. The unique collective expertise of these physicians (radiologists, cardiologists, internists, etc.), scientists, engineers, and other professionals has once again resulted in vital contributions to this resource of essential scientific knowledge that covers all of the critical topics of interest to physicians, MRI technologists and radiographers, physicists, scientists, healthcare professionals, imaging center managers, bioengineers, regulatory affairs professionals, and laypersons. The ambitious purpose of this textbook is to provide actionable information that will be used to ensure that the MRI environment is as safe as possible under all circumstances. We hope that we have accomplished this important goal and that the MRI community will benefit from the indispensable contents of this textbook.</para>
