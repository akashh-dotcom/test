        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Radiofrequency (RF) energy is defined as nonionizing electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range of 3-kHz to 300-GHz, as distinguished from the very high photon energies and frequencies associated with ionizing electromagnetic radiation (e.g., gamma and X-rays). The RF spectrum includes radar, ultra-high frequency (UHF), and very high frequency (VHF) television, AM and FM radio, and microwave communication frequencies. Resonant radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields are used in magnetic resonance (MR) for imaging and spectroscopy procedures (1).</para>
    <para>This chapter will present and discuss various important aspects of RF power deposition associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures with an emphasis on nonclinical, physical factors, calculations, and measurements used to characterize this electromagnetic field.</para>

        <title>RADIO FREQUENCY MAGNETIC FIELDS AND MRI PROCEDURES</title>
    <para>During an MRI procedure, the patient absorbs a portion of the transmitted RF energy, which may result in tissue heating (2-16). Thus, whole-body and localized heating are the primary safety concerns associated with the absorption of RF energy. Notably, the elevation of core body temperatures to sufficiently high levels may be life-threatening (2, 17, 18). With local transmit RF coils, the primary safety concern is to prevent burns by limiting localized heating.</para>
    <para>The specific absorption rate, or SAR, is the RF power absorbed per unit mass of tissue and is the metric for RF power deposition typically reported in W/kg. SAR is believed to serve as a crude measure of heating potential. It is essential for patient safety to limit whole-</para>
    <para>body-averaged and localized temperatures to appropriate SAR levels (2, 18-23). Therefore, national and international safety standards (2, 19-21) appropriately limit or recommend SAR levels for clinical MRI examinations. Heating experienced by the patient during an MRI examination depends on the RF power deposited per unit mass (or SAR), ambient temperature, relative humidity, airflow rate, blood flow, sweating rate, and patient insulation.</para>
    <para>Resonant frequency scales with the static magnetic field strength and nuclei of interest. For hydrogen protons, the resonant RF frequency is 42-MHz/Tesla (1). The tip angle is proportional to the area under the envelope of the RF waveform. Typically, the amplitude of the RF pulse (i.e., the tip angle) is adjusted to maximize the received signal. For a given waveform, RF energy is proportional to the square of the tip angle. Only the magnetic component of the RF field is useful in MRI. Designs usually reduce electric field coupling to patients. Since RF power deposition is mostly through magnetic induction, the distribution of the RF power deposition associated with an MRI procedure tends to be mostly peripheral or on the surface of the subject's body (9-11). Plane wave exposures (in non-MRI applications) may lead to higher heating at greater depths (18, 24).</para>
    <para>The average RF power (and SAR) is proportional to the number of images per unit time and peak RF power. Peak RF power depends on patient dimensions, the RF waveform, flip angle, and whether the MR system's transmit RF coil is operating in a linear or quadrature (i.e., has a circularly polarized magnetic field vector) mode during the transmission of RF energy. Notably, quadrature excitation lowers RF peak power requirements and SAR by a factor of two and "stirs" any field inhomogeneities (10). For a given static magnetic field strength and RF waveform, SAR is independent of the type of nucleus.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">MR SAFETY STANDARDS</emphasis>The United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published "Non-Significant Risk Criteria" for MR systems (22). These criteria state that clinical MRI examinations need Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) if the SAR exceeds the following levels:</para>

    <para>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) developed the international MRI safety standard IEC 60601-2-33 (23). The IEC MRI safety standard is three-tiered. The first tier is referred to as the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis> and is for routine scanning of patients. The second tier is designated as the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>. The MR system operator must take a deliberate action (usually using an "accept" button on the MR system console) to enter the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>. This mode provides higher MR system performance, but requires the MRI healthcare worker to closely monitor the patient during the MRI examination. Finally, the third tier is the <emphasis role="italics">Second Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis>, which is used only for research purposes under limits controlled by an Investigational Review Board (IRB).</para>

    <para>Note that the third edition of IEC 60601-2-33 is current as this is written. Work is continuing on improving the scientific basis for local SAR limits or some equivalent criterion.</para>
    <para>The IEC 60601-2-33 does not require local SAR limits for volume transmit RF coils, but does require local SAR limits for local transmit RF coils that may produce inhomogeneous RF electromagnetic fields. For 3-Tesla MR systems and higher, MR image "shading" can be a concern. This issue is apparently associated with the standing waves interfering at field strengths where electrical lengths in the body that approach, or are less than, the dimensions of the body. There are now efforts (known as dual drive, parallel transmit, elliptical drive, or RF shimming; parallel transmit will be used here to represent these techniques) to minimize shading by adjusting excitations on two or more RF channels to improve the quadrature uniformity in the body (not necessarily in air) for a particular field of view. These techniques are intended to improve quadrature uniformity in the body and reduce or</para>
    <para>at least not increase the local SAR over that caused by conventional quadrature (in air) excitation. The local SAR level could increase if the excitation is not properly controlled. Since there is a long safety record associated with conventional quadrature excitation, there is generally no concern provided that parallel transmit does not generate a local SAR higher than conventional quadrature imaging for similar tissues. However, the scientific basis for local SAR limits (i.e., RF power averaged over the worst case 10 grams) is currently unclear.</para>
    <para>Moritz and Henriques (25, 26) found that the thresholds for local thermal damage to skin depended non-linearly on local tissue temperature and its duration. Comparisons of the effectiveness of microwave hyperthermia protocols for cancer therapy with various temperature-time courses have been modeled in terms of the equivalent cumulative exposure minutes at 43 degrees C (27). These values are known as CEM43. A proposal has been made to use CEM43-derived limits to replace existing SAR safety limits (28). The proposed CEM43 estimates tissue viability through Arrhenius equations based on temperature due to local SAR from numerical simulations, duration, mass blood flow, and most sensitive exposed tissue type (29, 30). It is not yet certain whether approximations made in deriving CEM43 limits to determine thermal safety for MRI and spectroscopy are accurate. Safety based on whole-body, head, and local SAR limits has been effective for the approximately 35-year history of MRI (30, 31). In addition, a vast array of implants and devices potentially used in patients undergoing MRI examinations are classified as "MR Conditional" meaning that they are safe for patients as long as certain specified conditions are followed, which typically include a particular whole-body-averaged SAR level (32). It is of interest that in 2011 the Health Council of the Netherlands decided there was no need to change their electromagnetic field exposure limits from SAR to time-temperature (33). Perhaps CEM43 or something similar might find at least indirect use in studying appropriate RF safety limits for local SAR values.</para>
    <para>Another IEC safety standard, IEC 60601-1, establishes additional safety criteria for medical devices including electrical, mechanical, and thermal safety (34). Surface contact temperatures are limited to 41.0°C (34). Note that during an MRI examination using a high SAR, the average skin temperature of a human subject approaches 37.0°C (for a 4.0°C margin for temperature rise). During an MRI examination using very low SAR, the average skin temperature is typically 33.0°C (for a temperature rise margin of 8.0°C).</para>
    <para>In 2013, the American College of Radiology published a useful paper for MRI safety guidance (35). This paper is not a regulatory document but, instead, it has various recommendations and suggestions for safety procedures for MRI facilities, some of which pertain to the topic of this chapter.</para>
    <para>The Technical Specification, ISO/TS 10974:2011 (36), is a trial standard available for active medical implants to aid in determining whether they are MR Conditional devices. MR Conditional devices are acceptable for patients undergoing MRI examinations only if certain conditions apply. There are also several American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International test standards used to determine safe conditions for use for MR Conditional implants and devices (32, 37-41). Note that the ASTM International heating test implicitly assumes quadrature excitation for the RF energy. Importantly, parallel transmit excitation might produce different heating results.</para>

    <para>The patient's RF power absorption during an MRI procedure can be approximated from quasi static analysis for homogeneous objects, assuming that electric field coupling to the patient can be neglected as well as the RF phase (42, 43). In practice, quasi-static approximations for whole-body SAR in homogeneous spheres appear to be adequate for MR systems operating up to 1.5-T/64-MHz. Calculation of actual SAR levels at 3-T/128-MHz and above, and for local SAR at all static magnetic field strengths and frequencies, requires numerical techniques. Many commercially available software packages exist at this time. Quasi-static methods will usually overestimate whole-body and local SARs (under homogeneous conditions and for certain shapes) when conductor dimensions approach a wavelength.</para>
    <para>Assume a line segment of length, dl, carries current, I, and is located a vector, r', from the origin, O, (Figure 1). The magnetic vector potential, A, at a point located a vector r (x2 ,y2, z2) from the origin may be expressed as (24, 43, 44):</para>

    <para>power absorption during an MRI examination can be approximated from quasi static analysis assuming electric field coupling to patients can be neglected (15, 43, 44). Consider a homogeneous, tissue sphere of radius R. Assume that this sphere is placed in a uniform RF electromagnetic field of strength B<subscript>1</subscript>. The total average RF power, P<subscript>total</subscript>, deposited in the sphere may be expressed as:</para>
    <para>P<subscript>total</subscript> = (σDCπω<superscript>2</superscript>B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>R<superscript>5</superscript>)/15                                                    (6)</para>
    <para>The average Specific Absorption Rate, SAR<subscript>ave</subscript>, may be expressed as:</para>
    <para>SAR = P<subscript>total</subscript>/(ρ(4/3)πR<superscript>3</superscript>) = (σDCω<superscript>2</superscript>B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>R<superscript>2</superscript>)/(20ρ)                                    (7)</para>
    <para>The highest spatial peak SAR, SAR<subscript>peak</subscript>, for a homogeneous sphere may be found, as follows:</para>
    <para>SAR<subscript>peak</subscript> = (σDCω<superscript>2</superscript>B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>R<superscript>2</superscript>)/(8ρ) = 2.5 SAR<subscript>ave</subscript>                                    (8)</para>
    <para>RF energy-induced heating during an MRI procedure is by magnetic induction. Power deposition in homogeneous spheres immersed in uniform RF electromagnetic fields, increases with the fifth power of the radius, R [see Equation (6)]. Because heating is largely peripheral and little deep body heating occurs in a human subject, the body may more easily dissipate the additional heat load. The RF power, P, deposited between a smaller radius, r = α * R (where α&lt;1), and the outer radius, R, normalized to the total power deposited is n:</para>
    <para>n = (P(R) - P(r))/P(R) = (R<superscript>5</superscript> - r<superscript>5</superscript>)/R<superscript>5</superscript> = 1 - α<superscript>5</superscript>                                    (9)</para>
    <para>Equation (8) shows that peak power deposition for homogeneous spheres is 2.5 times the average (15), consistent with the peripheral nature of RF deposition during the MRI examination. From Equation (9) it is clear that, at least for homogeneous spheres, 87% of the total RF power deposition is in the outer third of the sphere.</para>
    <para>RF pulses are used in MRI examinations to flip the macroscopic magnetization vectors through desired angles. Recall that nuclei with magnetic moments precess about the static magnetic field vector in accordance with the right hand rule. Linearly polarized waves may</para>

  <para>be treated as the superposition of left and right handed circularly polarized waves. Only that portion of the RF that is circularly polarized in the same sense as the nuclear precession influences the nuclei (Figure 2). The other RF component contributes noise and increases RF power requirements. During the MRI examination, transmit RF coils may be driven linearly (linearly polarized RF electromagnetic vector) or they may be driven in quadrature (circularly polarized RF electromagnetic vector). Quadrature RF transmit systems reduce patient heating during the MRI procedure by a factor of two, and spatially stir any RF "hotspots" (9).</para>
    <para>Let γ be the magnetogyric ratio for a given type of nucleus. Note that the energy, W, deposited per pulse depends on the square of the RF tip angle, θ, the square of the static field strength, B<subscript>0</subscript>, and inversely on RF pulse width, τ, and a waveform factor, η:</para>

          <title>SAR "HOT-SPOTS"</title>
    <para>Next, consider localized regions of RF power deposition that might lead to heating, commonly referred to as SAR "hot spots". Inhomogeneities in the electrical properties of tissue may result in high local SAR levels. RF-induced biological effects appear to depend upon temperature rather than on RF power deposition. A region of high local SAR may not be a region of high temperature due to blood flow or diffusion or other cooling mechanisms. The distinction between temperature hot spots and SAR hot spots is often ignored or misunderstood.</para>
    <para>What effect do inhomogeneities have on the distribution of RF power deposition? Using spherical models, Schenck and Hussain (45) demonstrated that production of power deposition "hot spots" depends upon both the dielectric constants and the conductivities of the media. The model was later reformulated and used to investigate several problems involving worst-case conditions and magnitudes of local power deposition (10). Assume that there is a small, homogeneous sphere (sphere 1) with permittivity ε<subscript>1</subscript> and conductivity σ<subscript>1</subscript> (Figure 3). Let sphere 2 be a much larger, homogeneous sphere of "standard tissue" representing the body. Sphere 2 has a permittivity ε<subscript>2</subscript> and conductivity σ<subscript>2</subscript>. Sphere 1 may be placed outside sphere 2 at the pole (tangential electric field location) or at the equator (normal electric field location). In addition, sphere 1 may be placed inside sphere 2. When sphere 1 is placed near the pole of sphere 2, the local power deposition is amplified by a factor, A<subscript>p</subscript>, which may be expressed as:</para>
    <para>A<subscript>p</subscript> = 9(σ<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>ε<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>) / (σ<subscript>1</subscript> + 2σ<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>(ε<subscript>1</subscript> + 2ε<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript>     (11)</para>
    <para>When sphere 1 is placed near the equator of sphere 2, the local power deposition amplification factor, A<subscript>e</subscript>, may be expressed as:</para>
    <para>A<subscript>e</subscript> = 9(σ<subscript>2</subscript><superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>ε<subscript>2</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>) / (σ<subscript>1</subscript> + 2σ<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>(ε<subscript>1</subscript> + 2ε<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript>.     (12)</para>
    <para>Finally, if sphere 1 is placed inside sphere 2, the local power deposition amplification factor, A<subscript>s</subscript>, may be represented as:</para>
    <para>A<subscript>s</subscript> = 9σ<subscript>1</subscript>(σ<subscript>2</subscript><superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>ε<subscript>2</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>) / σ<subscript>2</subscript>((σ<subscript>1</subscript> + 2σ<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript> + ω<superscript>2</superscript>(ε<subscript>1</subscript> + 2ε<subscript>2</subscript>)<superscript>2</superscript>) = (σ<subscript>1</subscript>/σ<subscript>2</subscript>)A<subscript>e</subscript>     (13)</para>
    <para>All the terms in equations (11), (12), and (13) are positive. The electrical properties of sphere 1 are treated as variables so conditions for maximum amplification of local power deposition may be determined.</para>
    <para>When sphere 1 is near the pole, amplification of local power deposition, A<subscript>p</subscript>, is greatest when sphere 1 is a perfect conductor (σ<subscript>1</subscript> ≈ ∞). A perfectly conducting small sphere at the pole will result in a local amplification factor of A<subscript>p</subscript> = 9. Recall that the spatial peak SAR in a homogeneous sphere is already 2.5 times average SAR for the sphere. Combining these results, the peak SAR at the pole is 22.5 times the SAR averaged over sphere 2. Conductive leads (e.g., used with electrocardiogram monitoring equipment) placed in contact with the skin of patients may simulate this situation. Note that there is almost no amplification of local power deposition if sphere 1 is a radius or more from sphere 2. Spacing conductors well away from patients can dramatically reduce the local heating potential.</para>
    <para>Assume sphere 1 is placed near the equator of sphere 2. Then the greatest amplification of local power deposition takes place when sphere 1 electrical properties are minimal; i.e., σ<subscript>1</subscript> = 0 and ε<subscript>1</subscript> = ε<subscript>0</subscript> (free space value). So for a void, such as an air bubble, A<subscript>e</subscript> = 2.25. Fat or bone at the equator produces slightly smaller amplifications (10, 37). When a low conductivity sphere is located near the outer edge of the equator of a large (conductive) sphere, the local SAR is highest and is limited to 5.625 times the average SAR.</para>
    <para>Finally, assume sphere 1 is placed inside the large sphere. This situation may simulate an implanted prostheses. While local SAR is amplified the most when σ<subscript>1</subscript> = 2σ<subscript>2</subscript> and ε<subscript>1</subscript> = 2ε<subscript>2</subscript> (not a likely situation), the amplification factor is only A<subscript>s</subscript> = 1.125. The highest local SAR works out to 2.8125 times the local average SAR.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 4.</emphasis> Electric fields inside a low-pass, RF birdcage coil. Note that the electric fields reach their maximum magnitude at the coil and fall to zero along the coil axis. Capacitors along the coil wall also give rise to high electric fields, locally. Any conductors should be routed along regions of the low electric field or orthogonal to the electric field to prevent problems or issues.</para>
  <para>The analyses above assume linearly polarized RF magnetic fields. Notably, if the transmit RF coil produces quadrature excitation, then the amplification of local power deposition is reduced. The reduction in local power deposition results from rotating eddy current loops during quadrature excitation. Sphere 1 alternates between the equator and the pole of the larger sphere during quadrature excitation. So, worst-case quadrature local SAR amplification (assuming inhomogeneous biology) is 0.5 * (2.5 + 2.8125) = 2.66. For maximum SAR amplification at the equator, the electrical properties of sphere 1 approach those of a void.</para>
    <para>Similarly, for an infinitely conducting sphere 1, during quadrature RF excitation, the worst-case local power deposition amplification would be 0.5 * (2.5 + 22.5) = 12.5. However, the presence of a conductor may complicate the production of a perfect quadrature RF field by setting up difficult boundary conditions.</para>
    <para>Currently, many useful electromagnetic simulation packages are commercially available that can calculate whole-body average, head average, partial body average, and local SAR (averaged over the worst-case contiguous 10-grams). As mentioned under the MRI safety standards section above, it turns out that, in the transmit body RF coil, the ratio of peak local SAR to the whole-body average SAR may be high (as high as about 13 times) (38).</para>

However, if these RF coils were resonant during transmission of RF energy, then large currents may be produced in the receive-only coils. These large currents would, by Lenz's law, induce opposing RF magnetic fields. Flip angle profiles could be altered by the opposing RF magnetic fields, degrading image quality. The opposing RF magnetic fields may induce large electric fields in the body leading to large local SAR levels. Manufacturers use high impedance blocking networks to detune surface coils and limit surface coil current during body coil transmit (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 5</emphasis>).</para>

        <title>TRANSMIT/RECEIVE SURFACE COILS AND LOCAL SAR</title>
    <para>Planar, surface transmit RF coils are often used in MR spectroscopy studies. The primary safety concern with transmit/receive surface coils involves local SAR issues. While it is straightforward to calculate local RF power deposition in volume transmit RF coils, estimation of spatial peak specific absorption rate (SAR) for planar transmit surface coils is complex. To prevent excessive local RF power deposition, it is imperative to at least estimate an upper bound for the local SAR. The local SAR is highest near the coil conductors. For such cases, simplifying assumptions may be made to calculate appropriate design limits (55). Assume there is an anti-parallel pair of infinitely long conductors of width, d, with a return a distance 2 * a<subscript>1</subscript> apart. Schenck, et al. (56) showed that the in-plane magnetic vector potential at a distance r from one conductor for the case where d &lt;&lt; a<subscript>1</subscript> (and where quasi-static conditions apply) may be expressed as:</para>

        <title>SAFETY CONSIDERATION OF RECEIVE-ONLY RF SURFACE COILS</title>
    <para>Exceptionally large surface coil currents may flow if receive-only RF surface coils were resonant while RF excitation pulses are played out on the transmit body RF coil (59-61). These currents may result in extremely high local SAR levels near the surface coil. In addition, the surface coil reaction currents would destroy B<subscript>1</subscript> homogeneity, by generating opposing magnetic fields. To prevent such problems, a blocking network in the surface coil presents a high impedance to limit surface coil currents during RF excitation (Figure 5). The blocking impedance required depends on the area of the RF coil, frequency, and how large an opposing field is to be allowed. Typical blocking impedances are a few hundred ohms. Note that in the case of phased array receive coils, special care must be exercised to avoid the development of high local electric fields from differential voltages on adjacent conductors.</para>
    <para>Unfortunately, surface coil blocking networks may become warm. IEC 60601-1 sets a surface temperature limit (T<subscript>limit</subscript> = 41°C) for objects that may touch human subjects (34). Skin temperature under normal, non-MRI or low SAR conditions is approximately 33.0°C. However, during an MRI procedure involving a high SAR level, skin blood vessels dilate, the cutaneous circulation increases, and skin temperatures may approach the level of the core temperature. In tests with phantoms initially at ambient temperature, a 4.0°C rise should be the limit for systems capable of high SAR. For low SAR systems, the surface coil temperature rise may be limited to 8.0°C above ambient temperature.</para>

During an MRI examination, while only the body parts inside of the transmit RF coil are exposed to RF power deposition, the entire body may be affected by thermal reactions.</para>

The highest safe core temperature for workers is considered to be 39.4°C (24, 66, 67). The threshold core temperature for teratogenic effects in pregnant women is 38.9°C (60). During the day, core temperature fluctuates approximately 1°C or more (17, 68). Skin temperature fluctuates over a range of 15°C (17). The skin pain threshold is 43°C (69).

For the plot, it was assumed that clothing = 0.2 clo, relative humidity was 50%, blood flow impairment was 40%, and the scan duration was 60 minutes. A 40% reduction in cardiac output is life threatening (73). From the plot, it is evident that an exposure to 4-W/kg for an hour should result in only a 1°C core temperature rise when T<subscript>a</subscript> = 19°C. However, if T<subscript>a</subscript> = 25°C, then 3-W/kg is needed. A one hour exposure to 1 W/kg even at T<subscript>a</subscript> = 27°C should result in no temperature rise. Of course, ambient temperature plays an important role in core temperature rise.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</emphasis>A variety of physical factors affect the manner in which the RF fields used for MRI examinations impact patients. Both whole body and localized depositions of RF energy may result in tissue heating. In consideration of this primary safety concern, regulatory agencies have provided guidelines based on whole-body-averaged and/or peak SARs to ensure the safe operation of MR systems. In this chapter, various techniques of calculating and estimating SARs associated with MRI procedures have been described. Additionally, there has been a discussion of the possible mechanisms responsible for observed RF bioeffects and a review of the thermal physics and mathematical models used to predict human thermal responses to absorption of RF energy. This work served as the basis for characterizing the RF fields used during MRI examinations and helps to estimate the thermophysiologic alterations in patients.</para>
