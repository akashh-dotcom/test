          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>The clinical applications of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have expanded rapidly in recent years, resulting in a greater percentage of the patient population undergoing diagnostic imaging using this modality. In addition, the number of patients and individuals possessing implantable devices continues to grow, as does the variation and complexity of these devices. Non-medical implants and materials such as body piercings, tattoos, and permanent cosmetics (e.g., eyeliner) have also increased in popularity. This progressive array of implanted patients and individuals, combined with the implementation of scanners with higher static magnetic fields (i.e., 3- and 7-Tesla) presents particular challenges for screening in the MRI environment. Indeed, accidents and injuries have increased over the years along with the increased use of MRI. Accordingly, this has captured the attention of various organizations and entities including the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Joint Commission, and the American College of Radiology (ACR). Public awareness of MRI-related hazards has heightened as well, particularly due to the fatality of a young boy in 2001. The majority of accidents and injuries that have occurred in the MRI setting have been the result of insufficient or no screening procedures. Unfortunately, considerable subjectivity remains among the policies and procedures implemented by MRI fa-</para>

    <para>This chapter presents the purpose of comprehensive MRI screening concepts and discusses proper procedures. The recommended written screening forms to be used for individuals and patients are displayed and reviewed. Each section of these forms is explained, and justifications are given for the questions asked. Verbal MRI screening procedures are also reviewed, and the use of ferromagnetic detection systems as part of the screening process is discussed. Finally, secondary purposes and advantages of MRI screening are presented.</para>

            <title>MRI SCREENING PROCEDURES</title>
    <para>All patients undergoing MRI examinations must be screened prior to entering the MRI environment. Any other individual that needs to enter the MRI environment for any reason, even if just momentarily, must also be screened. This would include family members, friends, staff, visitors, field engineers, and emergency or security personnel such as firemen, police, and first responders. The screening process must include the completion of an MRI screening form by the patient or individual, followed by verbal MRI screening procedure conducted by the MRI technologist or other MRI safety-trained healthcare worker. Currently, many healthcare facilities have moved to electronic records that include MRI screening forms, while others still use paper forms. All MRI facilities (clinical or research) should embrace a specific MRI screening process that is both consistent and thorough. This should be part of the MRI center's formal written policy, to be followed without exception. To stay current, MRI facilities need to revise and update the screening protocol, on an ongoing and consistent basis.</para>

            <title>SCREENING FORM AND PROCEDURES FOR PATIENTS</title>
    <para>A variety of MRI screening forms are available from different sources, however, all variations of screening forms strive to achieve the same goal of 100% safety. A standard, two-page MRI screening form for patients developed by Frank G. Shellock, Ph.D. and available on www.MRIsafety.com is presented in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis> (the Spanish and Arabic language versions are shown in <emphasis role="bold">Figures 3 to 6</emphasis>). The ACR (American College of Radiology, www.ACR.org) also offers an MRI screening form (13, 15, 23). Before each MRI examination, proper MRI screening must be conducted for each patient. By way of example, this chapter will focus on the written screening forms provided on www.MRIsafety.com, which are in widespread use.</para>

          <sect3 id="ch0015s0000s0001s0002s0003">
            <title>SAFETY QUESTIONS AND INFORMATION</title>
    <para>The upper section on the first page of the screening form (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>) asks for patient identification (ID) and demographics. This section must be completed and double checked for correct patient ID and MRI order or request. An incorrect patient or examination problem can easily occur during the fervor of an over-booked clinical schedule. The referring physician's name and telephone number should also be filled out, but this information may</para>
    <para>also be available at different information systems and may be different than the "ordering" physician. The rest of the first page of the screening form lists various medical and surgical history questions for the patient (note: certain questions pertain to female patients, only). Explanations of the questions and their importance to MRI screening are provided below.</para>
    <para>Question #1 asks about previous surgeries or procedures. Many patient safety concerns in MRI are impacted by the response to this question, so it cannot be left unanswered. If the answer to Question #1 is "yes", additional information must be given on types and dates of all surgeries and/or related procedures. Accuracy is paramount here, since information on potential implants, devices, and materials can be discovered. If the patient is a minor or is not fully aware of this information, a parent, guardian or other knowledgeable caregiver must assist in providing and verifying this information. Further review of the patient's chart or medical records may be necessary. If previous surgery or other procedural information is not available at the time of the MRI examination, as with an outpatient who has arrived with a limited history, MRI must be postponed or rescheduled until this information can be captured and verified.</para>
    <para>Question #2 asks about previous diagnostic imaging studies (MRI, computed tomography or CT, X-ray, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, etc.). The results of these examinations can help verify the patient's surgical or other procedural history and assist in identifying the presence of an implant, device, or foreign body that may be of concern.</para>
    <para>Question #3 asks the patient about problems related to a prior MRI examination. If the answer to this question is "yes", the patient is asked to describe the problem, prompting the MRI technologist to investigate and otherwise consider this matter further. Notably, if the answer to this question is "no", the patient cannot simply bypass the MRI screening process. A written screening form must still be completed, in case the patient that had a previous MRI exam performed had the placement of an implant, device, material, or encountered a foreign body. Assumptions should not be made that non-incidental; previous MRI examinations permit subsequent incident-free MRI procedures. Factors related to the MRI examination such as the orientation (i.e., vertical versus horizontal) and strength of the static magnetic field, maximum spatial gradient magnetic field, time-varying gradient magnetic fields, type of RF coil used, amount of RF power (specific absorption rate, SAR) and pulse sequence parameters can vary significantly among different MR systems. Careful investigation is required for implants or devices assumed to be "MR Safe" for a previous scanner, because this can change to "MR Conditional" or even "MR Unsafe" based on the MR system-related factors indicated above (15). The MRI technologist or radiologist can refer to the latest version of the <emphasis role="italics">Reference Manual for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Implants, and Devices</emphasis> (16), or visit the website, www.MRIsafety.com, for specific information pertaining to information for implants and devices. Notably, it may be necessary to consult the manufacturer of the implant or device for more information, especially if an electronically-activated implant is encountered (16).</para>
    <para>Questions #4 and #5 ask the patient about personal injury involving a metallic object or foreign body. If the answer to either question is "yes", further questioning must be conducted as to whether the object was removed entirely, and if not, the location and composition of the object must be investigated further. In the case of injuries involving the eyes,</para>

  <para>it is important to negate the presence of any remaining metal. If the patient answers that an orbital metal foreign body (e.g., fragment, sliver, bullet, BB, shrapnel, welding slag, etc.) does remain or is unsure, the MRI exam must be postponed or rescheduled, and the patient is not allowed to enter the MRI environment. If the patient cannot recount with confidence that all metallic foreign bodies within the orbit(s) have been removed, an X-ray is indicated to determine the presence of metal. If the X-ray is unremarkable, and MRI screening is otherwise complete, the examination can be performed. If the X-ray identifies the presence of any non-surgical orbital metal, the MRI examination must be cancelled. Under certain circumstances, the radiologist may allow the MRI procedure to proceed if the X-rays show the metal is of relatively low mass, located in an extra-orbital, non-threatening position, or it has been determined that the metal is non-ferrous.</para>
    <para>Questions #6 and #7 ask the patient about current medications and allergies to medications. These questions may not be directly related to MRI safety, but if the patient needs to receive emergency medical attention, such information could be vital. Some patients may complain of problems such as vertigo, headache, or memory loss immediately following MRI, or days after the exam. In such cases, it can be helpful to the radiologist or clinician to check the written screening form for medications the patient listed, as these may help explain the patient's symptoms. Many radiologists can attest to incidents where patients mistakenly associated medical problems with an MRI procedure or other imaging modality.</para>
    <para>Question #8 asks about asthma, allergic reaction, or respiratory disease, but also specifically asks about prior reaction to contrast medium used in MRI, CT, or X-ray. It is not uncommon for patients to cite previous episodes of transient flushing, metallic taste, or nausea immediately following an injection. Unpleasant as it is for the patients, such transient symptoms are usually harmless. Notably, adverse reactions to MRI contrast agents can occur, although serious reactions such as anaphylactic responses to a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) are extremely rare. If the patient indicates a previous reaction to what they perceive as "dye", further questioning will be needed to clarify this matter. The patient may not make the distinction between CT and MRI, nor between GBCAs and iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray and CT. A polite but thorough interview with the patient should be able to determine the severity of a previous adverse event and which contrast agent was administered. If available, a review of the patient's chart or medical records should be done for clarification.</para>
    <para>Question #9 asks about anemia or other blood diseases, renal or hepatic disease, diabetes, and seizures. Importantly, MRI contrast agents may be contraindicated for some of these conditions. For example, the use of GBCAs has emerged as an MRI safety concern in patients with renal insufficiency because certain GBCAs have been implicated in causing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) and some gadolinium may be retained in the patient's body (16). Hence, the results of a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test must be obtained prior to a GBCA administration in patients with suspected renal insufficiency. This important topic is discussed in considerable detail in another chapter of this textbook.</para>
    <para>Questions #10 through #14 pertain to female patients, asking about possible pregnancy, menstrual cycle, and breastfeeding. Prior to entering the MRI environment, any patient who is unsure about pregnancy must undergo a pregnancy test. If the patient is pregnant, a con-</para>

    <para>sultation between the patient, radiologist and referring clinician is required in assessing the risk versus benefit of performing the MRI examination. The ACR recommends the use of MRI in pregnant patients if other non-ionizing imaging modalities are diagnostically inadequate, or ionizing procedures would otherwise have to be performed to answer critical clinical questions about the patient or fetus (15, 23). Furthermore, MRI may be performed without written or verbal informed consent in pregnant patients (15, 23).</para>
    <para>Non-pregnant patients should still answer questions #10 through #14 to the best of their ability, especially if they are scheduled for a breast or pelvic MRI. This information can aid the radiologist to interpret the results of the MRI procedure since hormonal changes induced by menstrual cycle, fertility treatments, and breastfeeding can alter tissue contrast on MR images. In particular, hormonal changes directly impact the timing and rate of breast tissue enhancement following the administration of a GBCA. Also, breastfeeding patients (Question #14) will be instructed to refrain from breastfeeding for 24-hours following administration of a GBCA (while continuing to express and discard the breast milk). This will help ensure that suckling infants ingest negligible amounts of gadolinium chelates.</para>
    <para>The top of the second page of the screening form for patients is intended to capture the attention of the patient or individual filling out the form (Figure 2). A "bold" warning statement is issued that certain implants, devices, or objects may be hazardous, and/or interfere with the MRI procedure. Thus, the patient is instructed not to enter the MRI environment if he or she has any question concerning an implant, device or object, and to consult the radiologist or MRI technologist before entering the MR system room. The patient or individual is also reminded that the "MR system magnet is ALWAYS on!" This warning statement is not intended to frighten patients or individuals who may already be anxious about their ensuing exam, but rather to discourage those who otherwise might wander into restricted areas in the MRI environment.</para>
    <para>The middle section of the second page, the screening form lists thirty-five implant or device categories of potential concern. The patient or individual filling out the form is asked to indicate whether he or she possesses any implant or device by checking a "Yes" or "No" box. By doing so, the patient or individual may recall previous forgotten surgeries or procedures that involved the implants or devices listed. If the patient has an implant or device not listed, the patient is asked to write it down at the bottom of the list. If the patient or individual does possess an implant, device, object, or metal on or in the body, he or she is instructed to indicate the location(s) on the diagrams of the human body (anterior and posterior views) provided on the form.</para>
    <para>Below the body sketch diagrams, the patient or individual is reminded to remove all metal objects such as hearing aids, dentures, jewelry, eyeglasses, keys, cell phones, belts, and other objects before entering the MR system room. Articles of clothing containing metal such as buttons, zippers and wires should also be removed. Some clothing manufacturers have recently been incorporating anti-microbial silver, copper microfibers, or other metallic components in sportswear and undergarments. These metallic fibers are often not detectable in the fabric and product labeling is often unreliable. The metal in the clothing may be nonferromagnetic but can still degrade image quality if located proximal to the region being scanned. More importantly, the metallic components found in fabric are conductive and,</para>
    <para>thus, may excessively heat during certain MRI conditions, causing burn injuries in patients. As a critical policy, MRI facilities should require patients to remove all clothing and change into a gown or scrubs that have no pockets as part of the screening process. Lockers must be provided to secure the belongings of patients and other individuals. Without harsh interrogation or inappropriate searching, the MRI technologist must always check the patient or individual to verify that all metal of concern has been removed prior to entering the MR system room. Some facilities refer to this second check as the "Full Stop and Final Check" (22, 23).</para>
    <para>During the screening process, questions may be asked about breathing problems, movement disorders, or claustrophobia. These questions are used to assess the patient's general ability to hold still and tolerate the MRI procedure. These issues are not too critical for safety, but may determine whether the patient needs extra attention or sedation, which will dictate scheduling times and different MRI facility staffing needs.</para>
    <para>Hearing protection for the patient or individual is also recommended on the MRI screening form, which reflects many early guidelines pertaining to this matter as well as current ACR recommendations (15, 23). In the distribution of hearing protection such as disposable earplugs, the MRI technologist or trained healthcare worker should assist the patient or individual in placement of the disposable earplugs. Some individuals will have difficulty in properly positioning the earplugs, especially if the ear canal is curved. At times, it may be necessary to immobilize the earplugs in place by using hypoallergenic tape to prevent them from loosening during the exam. The ear canals of small infants often will not accommodate conventional foam earplugs, but the earplugs can easily be cut to fit (any cutting with tools such as scissors or knives must of course be done outside the MRI environment) or alternative hearing protection devices can be used in these cases.</para>
    <para>The last section on the second page of the MRI screening form provides a place for the person completing the form to sign, print name, and date the form. When signing, the patient attests that the information provided on the form is correct. For a minor, a parent or legal guardian should print their name and sign the form. If the patient is unable to sign the form, an authorized relative or knowledgeable healthcare professional may need to sign (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 8</emphasis>). The MRI technologist, or other appropriately trained staff who reviewed the form and conducted the verbal interview must also print their name and sign this document (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). If the completed form is handed off to another MRI technologist to perform the MRI examination, care must be taken that the scanning MRI technologist checks the form to be sure that it was reviewed and signed. This final step must be done prior to escorting the patient or individual into the MR system room (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>In the event that the patient is comatose or for whatever reason unable to verbally communicate, the written screening form should be completed by the most qualified individual (e.g., physician, family member, etc.) that has knowledge about the patient's medical history and present condition. If the screening information is inadequate, it is advisable to look for surgical scars on the patient and/or to obtain plain films of the skull and/or chest to search for implants that may be particularly hazardous in the MRI environment (e.g., aneurysm clips, cardiac pacemakers, neuromodulation systems, etc.) (15, 16, 23).</para>

            <title>WRITTEN SCREENING FORM AND PROCEDURES FOR INDIVIDUALS</title>
    <para>As stated previously, any individual other than the patient that needs to enter the MRI environment for any reason must also complete a written screening form (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 7</emphasis>). This form is basically an abbreviated version of the patient MRI screening form. Whether the MRI facility is in a hospital, clinic, or free-standing imaging center, a certain amount of employee turnover is inevitable. New physicians or house staff, MRI technologists, nurses, anesthesia staff, medical assistants, students, and other staff members will rotate through the MRI center, some of which will need to enter the MRI environment. MRI screening is also required for caregivers, security personnel, fire fighters, and others. No one is exempt from completing the screening form and going through the screening process prior to entering the MRI environment. For individuals that must frequently enter the MRI environment as part of their duty, such as an MRI technologist, the screening form can be completed initially and kept on file. Any subsequent changes to an individual's medical or physical history such as a surgical procedure with placement of an implant, pregnancy, exposure to shrapnel or other similar matter will void the prior MRI clearance on file. It is the individual's responsibility to make this known so that the re-screening and/or updating of screening history can take place.</para>
    <para>Importantly, if for any reason the individual other than the patient, need to enter the MR system itself (e.g., moving partially into the bore of the scanner to help manage the patient) and, thus, become exposed to the electromagnetic fields used for the MRI procedure, this person must be screened prior to entry using the detailed form for patient screening.</para>

          <title>VERBAL SCREENING PROCEDURES</title>
    <para>Equally important to the completion of the MRI screening forms for both patients and other individuals is the verbal screening procedure or interview (Figure 9). Additional information or clarification of information about prior surgeries, procedures, or incidents is often obtained during this time. The interview provides a mechanism for clarification or confirmation of the answers to the questions posed to the patient so that there is no miscommunication regarding important MRI safety issues. In addition, because the patient may not be fully aware of the medical terminology used for a particular implant or device, it is imperative that this particular information on the form be discussed during the verbal interview. Additionally, a patient might be reluctant to indicate a pregnancy or foreign body on the written form in the presence of family or friends, but honesty might prevail in a private interview with the MRI technologist or MRI safety-trained healthcare worker. Due to cultural or religious reasons, some patients may ask for a male or female MRI technologist to conduct the interview. Questions, misconceptions, and fears that the patient might harbor can also be discussed and answered. Both the stress of the patient and the difficulty of the MRI examination can be reduced as a result of a satisfactorily performed, verbal screening procedure.</para>
    <para>With the use of any type of written questionnaire, limitations exist related to incomplete or incorrect answers provided by the patient or individual. For example, there may be difficulties associated with patients that are impaired with respect to their vision, language flu-</para>

Therefore, an appropriate accompanying family member or other individual (e.g., referring physician) should be involved in the screening process to verify information that may impact patient safety.

          <title>THE USE OF FERROMAGNETIC DETECTION SYSTEMS IN MRI SCREENING</title>
    <para>The use of conventional metal detectors as a MRI screening tool has not been recommended in the past mainly as a result of false positive and false negative alarms, resulting in "alarm fatigue". Such detectors have exhibited inconsistent sensitivities, operator error, and the inability to distinguish between ferrous and non-ferrous metals. In recent years, many new designs of ferromagnetic detection systems have emerged that have proven helpful in the screening process. These ferromagnetic detection systems are typically installed prior to the entrance into the scanner room (or Zone III, according to the zone scheme described by the ACR) (Figure 11).</para>
    <para>Ferromagnetic detection systems may be utilized immediate area outside of the scanner room (i.e., the patient dressing room) to facilitate screening. Notably, the ACR recommends the use of ferromagnetic detection systems, but only as an adjunct to a thorough and competent MRI screening process (15, 23). At least one type of ferromagnetic detection system has been used to identify ferromagnetic implants or foreign bodies (e.g., armor-piercing bullets)(18-20).</para>

    <para>In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first 7-Tesla MR system for clinical imaging. The 7-Tesla MRI environment warrants attention for MRI screening and exposing patients and others to this ultra-high-field setting (21, 23). Some concerns and considerations are, as follows:</para>

            <title>Untested Implants and Devices at 7-Tesla</title>
    <para>To-date, over 6,500 metallic implant or devices undergone testing for MRI-issues at 1.5- and 3-Tesla static magnetic field strengths. At the writing of this chapter, little more than 300 of implants and devices have been tested under 7-Tesla conditions. Because of this limited information, scanning patients with implants and devices at 7-Tesla is far more challenging. As always, the decision to scan a patient with an untested device or implant should be based on a careful assessment of risk verses benefit which is conducted by the supervising physician.</para>

    <para>Implants or devices that may be scanned at 1.5- or 3-Tesla may heat excessively at 7-Tesla (298-MHz). Due to the decreased wavelength of the transmitted RF at 7-T (λ=c/ν), implants 5 to 7 cm in length may be unsafe for patients undergoing MRI due to high temperature increases (21).</para>

    <para>noting. A brief explanation is, as follows: when an electrical conductor moves through a changing magnetic field such as the spatial gradient magnetic field at the entrance of the scanner, an electrical current will be generated that induces an additional magnetic field that opposes the spatial gradient magnetic field and the static magnetic field. Thus, the motion of any metallic implant, device, or object (made from ferromagnetic or nonferromagnetic material), will be opposed. This phenomenon may be manifested as a "tugging" sensation that patients with large metallic implants or devices may experience as they move into the bore of the MR system. Although this sensation is transient and harmless, it can be unsettling to patients, compelling them to bring it to the attention of the MRI technologist. Fortunately, Lenz's forces can be markedly reduced by slowly moving the patient into a 7-T scanner. With further regard to Lenz's forces at 7-T, it is a good practice to explain to a patient with a larger metallic implant that there is the possibility of a tugging sensation prior to the MRI exam to avoid undue issues (21-23).</para>

    <para>Obviously, the primary purpose of MRI screening is safety, but screening serves secondary purposes and advantages, as presented below.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Optimizing the Diagnostic Value of the MRI Examination</emphasis></para>
    <para>Many implants and devices do not pose safety issues, but some can significantly degrade image quality, especially when in or near to the anatomical region of interest. Information gathered during MRI screening regarding the type and location of a metallic implant or foreign body can allow for strategies and/or adjustments in the MRI protocol to minimize signal loss and/or distortion. For example, an adolescent with extensive orthodontic work who is scheduled for a pituitary study might be scanned on a 1.5-Tesla MR system rather than a 3-Tesla or 7-Tesla scanner in an effort to reduce susceptibility artifacts. Alternatively, the optimization of imaging parameters that are known to reduce artifacts related to metallic objects may be necessary in order to maintain the diagnostic aspects of the MRI examination.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Appropriate Patient Management Aided by MRI Screening</emphasis></para>
    <para>A physician ordering a clinical MRI examination must state a "reason for exam". Based on this information, the attending MRI-trained physician will then select an appropriate protocol (i.e., with consideration given to the type of transmit/receive RF coil to be used, pulse sequences, etc.), which is unique for the desired outcome for that specific patient. Additional communication between the ordering/referring physician and the radiologist may be necessary if this information and justification for the MRI procedure is vague.</para>
    <para>If the patient arrives for the MRI appointment with a limited history, and the ordering physician is not available for consultation, the screening information that is obtained may be helpful to the radiologist. For instance, if the reason for the examination simply indicates "headache", and the screening procedure reveals that the patient has not had a prior MRI procedure, the radiologist may optimize the scan protocol with more diagnostic emphasis. Conversely, if MRI screening reveals previous MRI studies, and the present MRI exam is for surgical planning, the radiologist may optimize the scan protocol with this in mind. Oth-</para>

          <title>INITIAL MRI SCREENING</title>
    <para>In the current age of faxing, email, and the use of other electronic media, MRI facilities can readily distribute electronic versions of the written MRI screening forms to referring physician's offices, clinics, or any service that may order an MRI. Once the physician has seen the patient and has decided that an MRI procedure is indicated, the patient can be given the MRI screening form to fill out, or at a minimum, answer key MRI screening questions. This information can then be returned to the MRI facility prior to the appointment date. Such a practice has multiple purposes and advantages, including:</para>

            <title>Early Discovery of Implants, Devices, or Other Objects</title>
    <para>Initial MRI screening of a patient can reveal MR Conditional or MR Unsafe implants, devices, or other objects. The MRI facility can then investigate the item ahead of time and decide, under what conditions, the patient can be scanned, if at all. Patients with non-medical objects such as piercings or excessive jewelry can be instructed to remove these items prior to their MRI appointments.</para>

    <para>If the MRI facility receives early notification that a patient suffers from severe anxiety or claustrophobia, then the patient may be scheduled on an "open" or wide-bore MR system, or the facility staff can prepare to coach or sedate the patient for the MRI exam (16-23).</para>

            <title>Patient Body Habitus Management</title>
    <para>MR systems typically have weight and/or dimensional limits for patients. If an MRI examination has been ordered on an excessively large patient, the weight and dimensions of the patient should be recorded and relayed to the MRI facility during the initial MRI screening procedure to ensure that the scanner can accommodate the patient. This can save time and embarrassment for all involved.</para>

            <title>Anticipation and Preparation of the MRI Facility's Staffing Needs</title>
    <para>Patients who need special assistance, sedation, or high-risk patients who may need general anesthesia require specific and additional staff at the time of the MRI examinations. Furthermore, additional time will likely be needed to complete the MRI procedure and, possibly, to manage the patient after the exam (e.g., in the case of needing to recover a patient after general anesthesia). Initial MRI screening information is particularly beneficial for managing the afore-mentioned patients, because the MRI facility will need to prepare and schedule these patients, accordingly.</para>

          <title>"No Show" Rate Reduction</title>
    <para>Initial MRI screening (i.e., using verbal or written methods) can help reduce the "no show" rate of an MRI facility. During the initial screening process, certain patients may refuse the MRI examination, despite the physician's recommendation. Common MRI contraindications are limitations are also exposed during this time. Thus, it may not be possible to schedule such patients right away. Frequently, MRI facilities dedicate a staff member to review the MRI screening information while placing "reminder" telephone calls to patients a few days before their appointments. At the time of the call, the patient may indicate that he or she is unable to honor the appointment, and the appointment will need to be re-scheduled or canceled. In either case, a likely "no show" can be averted by following simple tasks involved in initial MRI screening.</para>

          <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <para>The process of MRI screening is absolutely critical to avoid MRI-related accidents and injuries, as well as to ensure safety for staff members and others. MRI screening must never be performed in haste, but rather, in a consistent and thorough manner. If a reduction in MRI incidents is to be realized, adhering to comprehensive MRI screening protocols and revising screening criteria must be an integral part of MRI policies and procedures. As emphasized throughout this chapter, MRI screening of patients and individuals must, at a minimum, include completion of an MRI screening form and a subsequent verbal interview, and have the form signed-off by the MRI technologist or other MRI safety-trained healthcare worker. The MRI screening process may start in advance, but only safety-trained personnel should perform the final screening procedure and just before exposing patients or other individuals to the strong electromagnetic fields of the MR system. Beyond MRI safety, screening proves efficacious by providing information that allows proper scheduling of the patient and preparation of the MRI facility to accommodate the patient's needs for effective customer service standards, improved business, and optimal patient-care outcomes.</para>
