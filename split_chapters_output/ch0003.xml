      <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most flexible tools in diagnostic imaging as well as a highly active field of medical and methodological research (1). In 2015, approximately 37.8 million MRI examinations were performed in the United States (U.S.) alone, with an annual growth rate of around 4% since 2011 (2). However, despite many advances in technology in recent decades, the low sensitivity of MRI remains a limiting factor. Noise in the MRI measurement is not only determined by the underlying hardware, but predominantly by the body to be examined. Consequently, a stronger spin polarization of the body is pursued by using stronger static magnetic fields (B<subscript>0</subscript>). While early work demonstrated that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases linearly with B<subscript>0</subscript>, at ultra-high fields (UHF above 3 T the complete Maxwell equations must be considered, which leads to a more than linear increase in SNR with field strength. Pohmann, et al. (3) experimentally described a supralinear increase (SNR ~ B<subscript>0</subscript><superscript>1.65</superscript>) between 3 and 9.4 T. In a numerical simulation study, Guerin, et al. (4) found a field-strength dependence that varies with the position within the sample. For voxels near the surface of the sample, the SNR increases roughly linearly, while for deeper-lying voxels, the increase can even be quadratic. Since the relationship between SNR and B<subscript>0</subscript> applies not only to the hydrogen nuclei, but also to all "MR-</para>
