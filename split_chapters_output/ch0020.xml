        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Magnetic resonance (MR) scanners utilize static magnetic, time-varying gradient magnetic, and radiofrequency (RF) fields to image human subjects. Even when interacting with purely biological tissues, these electromagnetic fields can pose a hazard for the patient by excessive tissue heating due to the transmitted RF field.

    <para>cated when a patient has a metallic biomedical implant, especially if that device contains electrically conductive parts.</para>
    <para>By the physical nature of their interactions, patient hazards related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that are due to the presence of metallic implants can be grouped into four categories: (1) forces and torques acting on ferromagnetic objects due to the static magnetic field, B<subscript>0</subscript>; (2) forces, sometimes referred to as Lenz forces, and related torques exerted by the static magnetic field on moving metallic objects, even if nonferromagnetic; (3) malfunction of an active implanted medical device (AIMD, i.e., an implant relying on an embedded energy source to function such as a cardiac pacemaker or a neuromodulation system) because of the strong electromagnetic fields used during MRI, which may impact the vital functions of the device or even damage it; and (4) localized heating and resulting tissue damage due to currents in the implant induced by the RF fields and the time-varying gradient magnetic fields (1-3).</para>
    <para>Today's MR systems are built to image biological tissues but not to deal with implanted metallic objects and, thus, they have no means to automatically detect and adjust to them even though implemented safety measures are no longer adequate in the presence of metals (4). Ultimately, appropriate safety concepts for scanning patients with implants must be carried out at a <emphasis role="italics">system level</emphasis>. That is, MR scanners must be designed to detect an implant in the patient and respond accordingly by adjusting scan parameters or, in extreme cases, by rejecting the MRI exam if it cannot be conducted safely. However, this technology is not yet available and, until then, it will remain the responsibility of the MR system operators (i.e., the MRI technologists and radiographers) to ensure the safe scanning of patients with metallic implants.</para>
    <para>Severe injuries and fatalities have occurred in patients with implants that underwent MRI (5-10). Most of these incidents were related to dislodgement of a ferromagnetic implant (e.g., an aneurysm clip) or the malfunction of a device, such as a cardiac pacemaker. Severe injuries solely because of excessive implant heating have been documented (8-12). In these instances, RF-induced heating of deep brain stimulation leads was believed to be responsible for the greatest risk during MRI (8-12). Of note is that, in phantom experiments, the temperature at the tip of a long wire may increase by as much as 75°C under certain RF exposure conditions (13).</para>
    <para>The present chapter focuses on the state of knowledge on the important topic of MRI-related heating of implants and devices. This attention to this single subject is not because other MRI-related hazards would be less dangerous (the opposite is most certainly true) but because it is (1) omnipresent, and (2) scientifically and practically the most challenging case for a risk assessment (14). Within the limited space of this chapter, we will consider fully incorporated biomedical implants, while interventional and intraoperative devices will not be covered, despite plentiful conceptual similarities.</para>
    <para>In the following sections, the underlying physics of implant heating will be presented and summarized. Additionally, the most relevant standardization documents in this field will be recapitulated since they define how both MR systems and implants are designed, built, and tested. Importantly, such standards inform MRI users as to what they can, or rather should not, expect from a device.</para>

        <title>MRI-Related Heating of Implants and Devices</title>
    <para>While this first part aims to provide a conceptual background at a level suited also for general readership, the subsequent sections address mostly the active researchers in the field. Methods to assess and emerging concepts to actively mitigate implant-related hazards in association with MRI technology will be reviewed, with a focus on recent developments. An extensive evaluation of past developments that brought the field to where it stands today is not possible within the present format. MR system users and operators seeking practical advice about scanning or not scanning a patient with implants or devices are kindly referred to the literature, continuously updated websites on this important subject (15, 16), and other chapters in this textbook.</para>

          <title>PHYSICS OF IMPLANT HEATING</title>
    <para>MRI relies on two time-varying magnetic fields, that is, the RF field and gradient magnetic field, which differ in frequency and amplitude. The sinusoidal RF field, B<subscript>1</subscript>, is required to excite the spins to be imaged. Usually, it is generated by a volume transmit RF coil like the scanner's body RF coil or a dedicated transmit/receive head RF coil. The design target is a homogeneous B<subscript>1</subscript>-field over most of the RF coil's geometrical volume. Amplitudes are in the 10 μT range and frequencies are in the 100 MHz regime. The gradient magnetic field, B<subscript>G</subscript>, provides spatial encoding for image generation. The water-cooled gradient coils create B<subscript>(0, z)</subscript> gradients in three orthogonal directions. The design targets are linearly varying offset fields around the isocenter (where B<subscript>G</subscript>=0). Radially, B<subscript>G</subscript> fields are maximal at the MR system's bore; axially, they have maxima around the ends of the gradient coils (i.e., at |z|≈30 to 50 cm). In modern clinical MR scanners, amplitudes reach the 10 mT regime in those areas. Gradient magnetic fields have base frequencies in the kilohertz range, but higher harmonics up to several 10 kHz often exist.</para>
    <para>Faraday's law requires that all time-varying magnetic fields B(t) are accompanied by electric fields E(t), where E∝f·B for sinusoidal B(t) with frequency f. In an electrically conductive metallic implant with conductivity σ, those E-fields drive so-called eddy currents with current densities J = σE. This occurs also in biological tissue but is much more dramatic in metals (including "poorly conducting" alloys), which typically have ~ 10<superscript>6</superscript> times higher electrical conductivities. These induced currents have two effects: (1) due to ohmic losses, power P ∝ JE is locally deposited inside the implant, leading to a temperature increase with an initial slope of dT/dt=P/C, where C is the heat capacity of the exposed mass, and (2) secondary B- and E-fields are induced around the implant which superimpose the incident E-field and modify the power deposition. Both effects can lead to tissue heating but the mechanisms depend on frequency and, thus, are very different for gradients and RF fields.</para>

    <para>where the angular brackets denote temporal averaging. Electrical conductivity σ and mass density ρ are tissue parameters; E depends on MRI hardware and software, the transmit RF coil, and pulse sequence. SAR is a local quantity since all parameters are position dependent and Equation (1) holds with or without an implant being present.</para>
    <para>In a periodic MRI pulse sequence, ⟨P<subscript>RF</subscript>⟩<subscript>t</subscript> in Equation (1) is given by the sum of all pulse energies ∫ P<subscript>RF</subscript> dt divided by the repetition time, TR. Consequently, sequences with a short repetition time (TR) and a high density of high-power pulses have increased SAR values. The time-averaged SAR can be modified and limited to safe exposure levels, for example, by reducing the flip angle and, thus, the power per RF pulse, and/or by extending the TR and, thus, the mean time between RF pulses.</para>
    <para>RF currents at f ∼ 100 MHz in metallic objects are restricted to a thin surface layer of about ∼100 μm by the laws of electrodynamics (i.e., the skin effect). The mass of directly heated implant material remains too small, therefore, to affect the neighboring tissue noticeably. The current-induced secondary E-field (i.e., the "scattered field") around the implant becomes highly relevant, however, as it can vastly exceed the primary "background" E-field in critical locations. RF currents induced directly in tissue by the scattered E-field are the dominant effect for RF-induced implant heating <emphasis role="bold">(Figure 1)</emphasis>. In particular, a one-dimensional implant tends to exhibit the so-called "antenna effect" which is a pronounced maximum of the scattered E-field at the distal end, whose intensity peaks when the electrical length of the implant is in the range of one-quarter to one-half of the RF wavelength in tissue (17). The electromagnetic energy of the background field is then most effectively converted into implant current and corresponding scattered field.</para>

          <title>Gradient-Induced Power Deposition in Implants</title>
    <para>In contrast to the RF energy case, secondary E-fields and the direct induction of currents in tissue are both negligible for gradient switching at kilohertz frequencies. Switched gradients can heat-up the metallic implant, itself, however, via eddy currents. These currents and the associated power deposition are confined to the metal, but thermal energy diffuses into adjacent tissues, subsequently. Such confined eddy-current loops are intrinsically limited in small or approximately one-dimensional implants (e.g., screws or leads) but are possibly substantial in implants with a large cross-sectional area (e.g., orthopedic prostheses such as total hip or knee replacement implants), where large, low-resistance closed current paths exist (18, 19).</para>
    <para>Eddy currents inside a sphere (e.g., the femoral head of a total hip prosthesis) encircle the switched gradient field B<subscript>G</subscript>. Their density is (19):</para>
    <para>J = (B<subscript>G</subscript>)/(μ<subscript>0</subscript>) × (3k<superscript>2</superscript>R)/(2 sin(kR)) × [sin(kr)/(kr)<superscript>2</superscript> - cos(kr)/(kr)] sin θ     (2)</para>
    <para>in a generic radial position, r, with magnetic permeability of vacuum, μ<subscript>0</subscript>, colatitude θ with respect to the direction of B<subscript>G</subscript>, assumed to be uniform, and k<superscript>2</superscript> = -2 π i f / μ" σ, where i = √-1. Equation (2) considers the skin effect and that eddy currents produce a secondary magnetic field perturbing the applied one. In the equatorial plane and for low k (i.e., low f σ), Equation (2) simplifies to</para>
    <para>J = σ f B<subscript>G</subscript> π r .     (3a)</para>
    <para>Equations (2) and (3a) refer to the (complex) amplitudes of (rarely occurring) sinusoidal gradients with frequency f. For generic time-signals B<subscript>G</subscript> (t), Equation (3a) can be expressed as:</para>
    <para>J(t) = (1/2) σ r (dB<subscript>G</subscript>(t))/(dt) .     (3b)</para>
    <para>A broad variety of gradient waveforms exist but trapezoidal pulses with linear B<subscript>G</subscript> ramps and flat tops are most common. Only the ramps create eddy currents, then, and the flat sections do not contribute. Under the simplifying assumptions of Equation (3b), the induced current density scales with implant conductivity, the change rate of B<subscript>G</subscript>, and the radius, r, of the current loop. The total heating power of those currents depends on the square of the current density.</para>
    <para>For a given implant, gradient heating is maximal, when the implant is positioned in the aforementioned locations of highest B<subscript>G</subscript>, when the gradients are ramped at the highest available slew rate, and when pulse sequences are run with a high "slew percentage" (i.e., a high fraction of ramp time during the TR). The gradient strength itself is only indirectly a factor, insofar as higher gradients need longer ramp times to reach them.</para>
    <para>Few studies on MRI-related gradient magnetic field-induced implant heating exist. Earlier reports did not find significant temperature elevations (20, 21), yet did not systematically investigate critical scenarios, as described in the previous paragraph. More recent work demonstrated that gradient magnetic field-induced heating of a hip prostheses (namely, the acetabular cup component) can increase the temperature in adjacent tissue by several degrees using a manufacturer-provided, "gradient aggressive" pulse sequence, in the aforementioned sense, on a clinical MR system (18, 22–24) (Figure 2). Very close agreement between experimental findings and computational results indicated that the effects are well understood (24).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">From Power Deposition to Heating to Tissue Damage</emphasis></para>
    <para>So far, only implant-related changes in the power deposition were discussed, but the hazards are excessive tissue temperatures. As such, temperature is established by the balance between heating and cooling. Implant heating is a local phenomenon and the most widely used description in this context is Pennes Bioheat Equation (PBE) (25), as follows:</para>

    <para>Parameters are specific heat capacity, c (W s kg<superscript>-1</superscript> K<superscript>-1</superscript>), thermal conductivity, k (W m<superscript>-1</superscript> K<superscript>-1</superscript>), mass density, ρ (kg m<superscript>-3</superscript>), and blood perfusion, w (m<superscript>3</superscript> s<superscript>-1</superscript> kg<superscript>-1</superscript>). Subscripts t and b refer to tissue and (arterial) blood, respectively. Tissue temperature change on the left is expressed as the balance of heat diffusion, perfusion cooling, metabolic heat Q<subscript>m</subscript> (W kg<superscript>-1</superscript>) and external heat, Q<subscript>ext</subscript> (W kg<superscript>-1</superscript>), such as SAR. Equilibrium (d T<subscript>t</subscript>/dt = 0) is reached when the terms on the right-hand side compensate each other. PBE is not a fundamental law and makes a number of questionable assumptions (e.g., the blood pool as an infinite heat sink, isotropic thermal conduction, inadequate perfusion model, absence of thermoregulation, etc.). Still, it appears to work remarkably well in predicting tissue temperatures (see (26) for an extended discussion).</para>
    <para>Thermal modeling is indispensable to assess hazards related to implant heating by gradient switching since the deposited power reaches the tissues only via thermal diffusion. But also for RF energy-induced heating it is highly advisable even though the existing regulations only impose limits on SAR. The tissue parameters k<subscript>t</subscript>, w<subscript>t</subscript>, and Q<subscript>m</subscript> in Equation (4) can vary by orders of magnitude between tissue types (27). Therefore, even a uniform external power deposition would result in a non-uniform distribution of equilibrium temperatures in the human body. Equivalently, it can be said that for a non-uniform SAR distribution, the temperature hotspots will not normally coincide with the SAR hotspots (28). This discrepancy can be further enhanced by the high thermal conductivity of metallic implants. This reduces temperature differences along the implant and tends to "smear" out localized hotspots.</para>
    <para>For a conclusive safety assessment, however, even a realistic temperature distribution is not yet sufficient, because tissue types vary not only in cooling properties but also in temperature resilience. For example, 10 minutes at a temperature of 45°C is not much of a problem for skin but it is for brain matter (29). Thermal Dose safety concepts, considering the applied temperature over time individually for each tissue type, account for this variation and arguably represent the best that can be done today. The best known example is the "Cumulative Equivalent Minutes at 43°C" (CEM43) approach (29–32). This is beyond the scope of this chapter, however, the present standard is still the whole-body averaged SAR.</para>
    <para>RF-Induced vs. Gradient-Induced Heating. As previously mentioned, RF-induced currents in metals are confined to a thin surface layer by the skin effect, while the low-frequency gradient currents fill almost the whole implant volume. Compared to RF fields, gradient switching has a lower frequency content (&lt;10<superscript>5</superscript> Hz vs. ~10<superscript>8</superscript> Hz) but a higher magnitude (~10 mT vs. ~10 μT). The combined effect is that, in "bulky" (i.e., implants with a relatively larger surface area such as an implantable infusion pump or a total hip prosthesis) metallic objects, switched gradients can deposit much more power than RF energy (19). In a nonferromagnetic sphere (radius R = 2 cm, σ = 1 MS/m, similar to the femoral head of a total hip prosthesis made of cobalt chromium alloy), the power deposition by a gradient magnetic</para>

    <para>A set of international standards was established in recent decades covering implant safety in MRI (34), which was supplemented by recommendations from governmental agencies (35, 36). All refer to the international MRI safety standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 60601-2-33, first established in 1995 (37). Below, we summarize the three most relevant standards concerning implant-related heating in the MRI environment, namely ASTM F2182 (38), IEC 60601-2-33 (37), and International Organization for Standardization/Technical Specification, ISO/TS 10974 (39).

These instructions are legally relevant, because not following them constitutes "off-label" use with potentially severe liability implications for the physician supervisor as well as the MR system operator.</para>

It provides the implant manufacturer with well-defined procedures and materials for <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> heating tests of their devices. The standard itself defines no pass or fail criteria. The test results are sent to and evaluated by a competent authority, most notably the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for a decision on the conditionality of the implant for MRI. There are other related ASTM International standards (i.e., ASTM F2052, F2119, F2213, and F2503) that are outside the scope of this chapter.</para>
    <para>ASTM F2182 describes in detail a test procedure where the implant under test is embedded in gelled-saline filled phantom setup and exposed to a relatively high, whole-body averaged SAR value (i.e., 2 W/kg or higher) by using either a 1.5 T or 3 T MR scanner or a suitable benchtop system, reproducing the RF fields from a transmit body RF coil operating in a circularly-polarized (CP) mode. For 15 minutes, the temperature is monitored. By repeating the measurement with the implant removed, the background temperature rise is also measured, and the implant-related temperature rise can be determined.</para>
    <para>The scope of ASTM F2182 is limited to passive implants that are completely inside the human body. However, similar methods described in ASTM F2182 can be applied for devices penetrating the body's surface (e.g., external fixation systems, vascular catheters, etc.).

B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is typically calibrated by the MR system, and its values should be displayed by the MR scanner's software. However, it is important to note that implant heating is related to the total B<subscript>1</subscript> (i.e., all three vector components), not just B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>+</superscript>, and the standard gives some guidance to estimate the uncertainties when using B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>. This quantity is a much more consistent approach to assess RF-induced implant heating than the whole-body averaged SAR, which was previously the reference metric. In contrast to the whole-body averaged SAR, B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> is independent of the patient and calculated consistently by different MR system manufacturers.</para>
    <para>In the latest version of IEC 60601-2-33, the so-called Fixed-Parameter Option (FPO) was introduced for 1.5 T MR scanners (FPO:B), which specifically addresses scanning patients with implants.

Note that the FPO:B limits do not by themselves define "safe scan" conditions. The FPO rationale is that the MR system manufacturer guarantees that those field limits are kept, such that implant manufacturers can design and test their devices, accordingly. Only the combination, that is, a MR system operating in the FPO mode and an FPO-approved implant or device, would then establish a safe setting for the patient. The problem of the FPO is that a single set of field limits must suffice for a large variety of medical im-</para>

Lower levels are synonymous with lower accuracy and larger safety margins that need to be applied. Tier 1 does not require electromagnetic modeling. Tier 2 uses simulated human RF exposures to "determine the electric field in the implant volume of interest". Tiers 1 and 2 are restricted to "electrically short" AIMDs, since phase effects are not included. For Tier 3, an equivalent electromagnetic model of the AIMD is required to determine the transfer function (42).

          <title>Simplifications</title>
    <para>Long, one-dimensional shaped implants (e.g., cardiac pacemaker leads) collect RF energy over their entire length which makes them potentially hazardous and simultaneously defies simplifying assumptions like a constant E-field, in magnitude and phase, over the entire implant. Their structural detail, for example, a finely wound helix or multiple electrodes, and steep field gradients near the implant call for a high mesh resolution but the simulation space, defined by the transmit body RF coil, remains large. To aggravate the problem, the trajectories for long leads are not well defined and, thus, a variety of different clinically relevant pathways needs to be investigated. Numerical simplification approaches exist and are widely used, such as the Huygens box concept where a high-resolution simulation of the implant region is embedded in a lower-resolution simulation of the rest of the body (43). For a discussion of the pros and cons of such procedures, the reader is referred to specialized reviews on numerical techniques including the work by Li, et al. (44).</para>
    <para>To simplify the geometry, helices are often modeled as straight wires plus lumped elements to account for their inductance or stents as cylinders, ignoring their complex wire-mesh structure (45, 46). Despite these efforts, full Tier 4 simulations are not yet feasible with normal computational resources, and Tier 3 represents the actual state of the art. There, first the full-scale native problem, that is, a numerical body model without the implant in an MR scanner, is computed at an appropriate resolution providing the spatial distribution of the unperturbed background E-field. This part may be repeated for different body models, positions, postures, or transmit RF coils, resulting in a library of background fields. In a second step, the electrodynamic response of the metallic implant to that background field is computed. Frequently, this is expressed as the "scattered field," that is, the difference between the total E-field with the implant and background field.</para>
    <para>The critical spot of a wire-like implant is always at the distal tip and a frequent simplification, therefore, is to ignore all other locations. The scattered field at the tip can be derived from the background-field distribution along the implant trajectory. A first step in that di-</para>
    <para>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     527</para>
    <para>rection was the definition of a "safety index" as a metric to characterize one-dimensional implants (47). Later, this was succeeded by the introduction of the transfer function (TF) (42), the most widely-used approach to assess the MRI safety of one-dimensional implants today. To determine the scattered E-field at some reference r⃗ in tissue, close to the tip, one needs to know the response E<subscript>s</subscript>(r⃗) of the E-field at the reference point to a unit tangential E-field applied somewhere along the implant (Figure 5). The latter location is uniquely identified by a scalar coordinate, ẑ measuring its distance from the tip along the implant trajectory. This response can be expressed as a complex weight function S(ẑ, r⃗) and the desired 'scattered' field E<subscript>s</subscript>(r⃗) can then be obtained by integrating the weighted tangential background field E<subscript>tan</subscript>(ẑ) along the wire:</para>
    <para>E⃗<subscript>s</subscript>(r⃗) = F⃗<subscript>tip</subscript>(r⃗) ∫<subscript>0</subscript><superscript>L</superscript> S(ẑ)E<subscript>tan</subscript>(ẑ)dẑ .     (7)</para>
    <para>The normalized, dimensionless function F⃗<subscript>tip</subscript>(r⃗) describes the spatial distribution of the scattered E-field around the tip and is assumed to be independent of how the implant was excited. Thus, the problem is broken down into two independent steps, namely to determine (1) the background E-field without implant, and (2) the transfer function S(ẑ) of the implant. The former means a state-of-the-art EMF simulation, the latter can be achieved either by simulations or experimentally. TF is a normalized, complex function, determining how various elementary RF currents induced along the length of the implant superimpose at the tip.</para>
    <para>Figure 5. Graphical representation of the transfer function introduced by Park, et al. (42). A piece-wise excitation with an incident tangential electric field E<subscript>tan</subscript> induces a scattered electric field E⃗<subscript>s</subscript>(r⃗) at the tip of a one-dimensional implant. Adapted from color figure in Winter, et al. (1), original figure from Tokaya, et al. (48). The length coordinate q in this figure is denoted ẑ in the present chapter (Equation 7).</para>
  <para>In this instance, the TF phase describes the propagation and the TF magnitude the attenuation of an RF current along the implant. In the simplest case, the TF phase would be a linear function of the distance from the tip. The E-field "collected" within a certain distance from the tip would then increase the scattered field around the tip while contributions from beyond that point would decrease it again (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). For longer distances, attenuation dampens the interference pattern, but a critical "resonance length" of one quarter to one half the RF current wavelength persists. This wavelength, and hence the TF, depend on the dielectric parameters of the tissue and possibly an insulation surrounding the implant. The TF of an implant depends on its environment, therefore, but for simplicity this fact is often ignored. For unfavorable phase distributions of the background E-field the tip heating can significantly exceed even the values for the resonant length (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>The TF can be determined by measuring or calculating the scattered E-field at some reference point, r⃗ close to the tip when the implant is exposed to a piece-wise excitation by a unit tangential E-field. In simulations, this can be approximated artificially by a short boxcar function (42) or as the E-field between two parallel metallic plates in close proximity to one another (48). Experimentally, for example, short toroid coils or coaxial cables with a few millimeters of bare inner conductor can be used (49, 50).</para>
    <para>An important advancement to reduce the multitude of piece-wise excitations and measurements (and/or simulations) to a single excitation is based on the principle of reciprocity (51). Injecting a unit current at its tip, the TF is represented by the current distribution along the implant and several experimental strategies were proposed to determine this current (50, 52, 53).</para>

For a uniform phase distribution, the temperature increase (ΔT<subscript>1W/kg</subscript>) shows a maximum at a "resonance length" of roughly half the RF wavelength in the phantom medium. If the phase distribution is non-uniform over the implant (ΔT<subscript>worst</subscript> = temperature increase for a worst-case phase distribution), which is often the case for relatively long implants, the tip temperature can increase even above the resonant length of the wire.

Transmit RF and gradient coils are integral parts of the MR scanner and their actual design is more difficult to create. However, RF field measurements can be utilized to give a good estimate about the design, length, and diameter of commercial transmit body RF coils (55, 56). Regularly at 7 T but occasionally at lower field strengths, too, local transmit-receive RF coils are used (e.g., for head or knee MRI exams). In such a case, safety assessments of implants are only possible if the RF fields or the transmit RF coil model are known (57, 58). It is important to apply the correct transmit coil-driving conditions (e.g., circularly-polarized, CP, quadrature-driven). Transmit RF body coils of 1.5 T MR systems typically apply only the CP mode, whereas at 3 T and above, RF shimming is common to counteract B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>-</superscript> inhomogeneities (59-61).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="italics">Electromagnetic Simulation Techniques – RF Fields and Currents.</emphasis> There are several simulation techniques in computational electromagnetics, each with advantages and weaknesses. For birdcage coils, the method of moments (MOM) also called the Boundary Element Method (BEM), or the finite elements method (FEM) may be the best choices, because they can treat curved geometrical objects more accurately than other techniques. However, when complex anatomical models or structures are involved, the simulation space can easily reach dimensions of 100 million voxels (three-dimensional pixels) or more, which is most efficiently handled by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique.</para>
    <para>It has been shown that the common practice of simulating the metallic implant as a perfect electric conductor is sufficient for practical purposes (67). Thus, it is unnecessary to</para>
    <para>discretize the implant on the 10 μm scale of the RF penetration depth. Calculations can be parallelized on graphics processors, thus shortening simulation times by factors &gt;100. The simulation output contains the induced E-field distribution in the patient for a given exposure scenario and can be expressed as SAR maps, which are subjected to different averaging volumes. The most important of which are the whole-body averaged SAR and the local SAR averaged over 10 g of tissue (37). For implants, there is an ongoing discussion whether smaller averaging masses should be used to assess temperature and thermal dose more correctly (45, 68, 69).</para>
    <para>The exposure condition in the simulation model such as linearly-polarized, CP, or RF shimming, is important and needs to match reality since it determines the background E-field distribution responsible for the RF field-induced implant heating. With state-of-the-art electromagnetic modeling, satisfactory agreement (for the given purpose) with phantom measurements can be obtained and (standard) uncertainties in the range of 10 to 15% (70) should be achieved for local SAR values, because the dielectric properties of the tissues are only minimally affected by the physiological response.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Electromagnetic Simulation Techniques – Gradient Fields and Induced Currents.</emphasis> Most investigations dealing with the simulations of gradient-induced heating of bulky implants adopt the hybrid FEM/BEM frequency-domain formulation described by Zilberti, et al. (22). Such a formulation applies to non-magnetic metallic implants and, at the frequencies of interest, assumes that the current density induced inside bulky implants is much higher than in the surrounding tissues, thus limiting the electromagnetic problem to the implant volume. To simulate a gradient sequence realistically, the harmonic solutions are moved back to the time domain, where they are properly combined to follow the actual waveforms of the three gradient coils.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Electromagnetic Simulation Techniques – Thermal Simulations.</emphasis> The power-density distribution from electromagnetic simulations can be used as input for thermal simulations (Figure 7). For one-dimensional implants, RF power is absorbed along the whole length of the lead(s) but tissue heating occurs only around the tip or end and this fact can be exploited to reduce the total computational burden (71). Steady-state solvers can be used when only absolute equilibrium temperatures are of interest. To simulate temperature increase versus time, more complex transient time-domain solvers are required. As previously-stated, Pennes Bioheat Equation (PBE) (25) is presumably the most widely used formulation, and most commercial software to calculate tissue temperatures employs PBE or amended variants, for example, with thermoregulation included (i.e., temperature dependent tissue parameters). It performs well for the given exposure scenarios but is a heatsink model assuming stable core temperatures. If a patient's core temperature increase must be considered, the PBE can be enhanced by a variable blood temperature formulation. Other aspects remain neglected, however, such as anisotropic heat-flux or blood temperature variations along the vessel. For the latter, the impact of the thermal vasculature could be investigated based on a model which couples, one-dimensional convective vascular tree thermal simulations with 3D thermal modeling (72). While the PBE assumes that the arterial inflow to tissue is still at core temperature, such discrete vasculature (DIVA) models (73) acknowledge the flow directionality and the gradual thermalization of blood along the (arterial) vas-</para>

Personalized exposure evaluations might permit the reduction of the necessary safety margins for the majority of the patient population and, consequently, permit faster and safer MRI exams: for example, a dynamic adaptation of exposure limits based on the patient's body mass index (BMI) or body cross-section (70). We will briefly discuss two methods: a physics-based morphing and a three-dimensional image-registration approach.</para>
    <para>A physics-based morphing technique can be applied on existing anatomical models via constrained biomechanical FEM simulations, where the body is treated as a hyper-elastic material (75, 76). The tissue deformation is constrained by the proximity of rigid bones and</para>

This allows regional shrinkage or expansion of certain tissues (e.g., fat, muscle, etc.) to investigate the effect of different tissue distributions. A look-up table can be generated, where the actual patient would be matched to the closest morphing variant of an anatomical model. Pre-computed exposure data would serve as a coarse personalized estimate.</para>
    <para>If a certain target anatomy of the actual patient is aimed for in higher detail, a 3D image registration is better suited to capture the actual skeletal anatomy and posture. Sparse (e.g., cross-sectional) pilot-scan images of the patient could be used as input for the non-rigid registration approach to map the numerical phantom to the patient-specific anatomy (77-79). The resulting 3D-registered derivative can then be used to compute the exposure estimation on-the-fly. Unfortunately, as of today, personalized electromagnetic simulations are not yet in widespread use.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Measurements</emphasis></para>
    <para>Measurement procedures for <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> model validation are well described in ISO/TS 10974 (39). Assessments can be performed at points of interest near the implant, by measuring either (1) electromagnetic-field quantities using time-domain sensors, or (2) root-mean-square (RMS) quantities like voltage or temperature. Fiber-optic temperature probes are the most widely used sensors for safety assessments involving patients and metallic implants in MRI (11). They use a non-conducting transmission medium and are nonferromagnetic, preventing RF coupling and enable a precise and accurate application to record temperatures in the harsh electromagnetic environment associated with the MR system. Importantly, in order to obtain an accurate assessment of temperatures, probe positioning relative to the implant is crucial. For example, for a peak temperature of 10°C, a 1°C change can be observed over less than 250 μm (80).</para>
    <para>Time-domain probes yield information on amplitudes and phases of field quantities which is necessary, for example, for TF measurements (50, 81). For <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis> applications in the MR scanner, the field probes must be nonferromagnetic and must not generate static magnetic fields by internal DC currents. Examples of <emphasis role="italics">in situ</emphasis> RF current measurements on implanted wires using optical fibers for signal transfer have been reported by Zanchi, et al. (13) and Weidemann, et al. (82). Recently, fully optical <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field measurements based on electro-optic field sensing have been used to assess the RF safety of different stent configurations (83). While this technique is promising, it is too premature for a final judgment with respect to its validity.</para>

Still, they are not discussed here as they do little to quantify the patient hazard.</para>

The latter exploits the pressure waves that a sudden temperature increase inevitably generates and can be detected by sensitive acoustic receivers.

    <para>For elongated implants, tip heating is related to the induced RF currents in the implant (92), which then induce a new B<subscript>1,ind</subscript>-field altering the total B*<subscript>1</subscript>. Consequently, tip heating can be estimated by MR-based measurements of B*<subscript>1</subscript> around the implant (93, 94) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). If B<subscript>1,ind</subscript> has a z-component, it will also shift the RF phase (95).</para>
    <para>Implant-related image B<subscript>1</subscript> effects can also be translated to direct measurements of the induced RF current in the implant. This may appear as a detour because, ultimately, the quantity of interest is temperature, and implant current is only a surrogate. The advantage of current measurements is their sensitivity. In principle, relatively small and harmless implant currents are detectable <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis>, while a measurable temperature rise may be potentially hazardous for the patient. Frequently, model assumption like a perfect quadrature excitation or simplifications like a quasi-static treatment neglecting displacement currents are being used to facilitate direct current quantification without extensive numerical simulations. The measured B*<subscript>1</subscript> magnitude at a certain radius from the conductor can be converted into the magnitude of the current by applying a simplified Ampere's circuit law (96–98). The background signal around the lead, which <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> is often inhomogeneous, represents a source of error for magnitude-based methods. A way to suppress this background signal is by using reversed RF polarization on the transmitter and receiver (98) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 9</emphasis>). In this manner, ideally only the implant coupling is visualized in the MR image and can be used to determine the current amplitude. On the receiver side, reverse polarization reconstruction is intrinsic to the acquired dataset, while on the transmit side, parallel RF transmission (pTx) systems with ≥ 2 channels would allow for reversed polarization during transmission.</para>
    <para>Another method to quantify induced currents is based on analyzing the phase of an MR image around the implant (99). This way, RF field-induced implant currents can be detected with a low SAR, pre-scan sequence that poses no hazard in itself. Since the RMS-averaged RF current in the implant is proportional to B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript>, the result from the pre-scan can easily be scaled to subsequent MR imaging sequences at higher SAR levels. Compared to magnitude-based methods, phase-based current measurements are potentially faster, independent of proton-density weighting and have lower SNR requirements. A disadvantage of phase-based methods is their sensitivity to gradient nonlinearities and phase variations of other origin, such as frequency shifts due to temperature variations, susceptibility jumps at interfaces, or blood flow. To reduce these influences, short echo times combined with a fast readout using an ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequence was applied <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> and demonstrated the ability to characterize RF currents within an accuracy of ~10 mA/μT (100). Based on these measurements and some simplifying assumptions, the corresponding RF-induced implant heating could be predicted accurately. Another relatively simple method to assess not only the current magnitude but also its phase <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> is based on using multi-channel receive</para>

Typically, two null-locations can be identified in the signal intensity emerging from the transmitter and receiver separately. Since the location of the receiver-null is independent of the transmitter and different for each receiver element, the receiver-null and transmitter-null locations can be identified independently by inspecting the MR images from each receive-coil element separately. The phase of the current can then be calculated from the geometric null location and is an important parameter to allow mitigation of RF field-induced currents on the DBS lead using pTx systems (101).</para>
    <para>The MR-based determination of the transfer function represents another promising approach to measure implant currents (48, 102). This expands the TF approach beyond phantoms to more complex exposure scenarios with realistic tissue heterogeneity, implant geometry and location. The methodology uses the wire-like implant as a transceiver antenna. The implant is excited via a coaxial cable soldered to its tip and the resulting current distribution along its trajectory, reflecting the transfer function by virtue of the principle of reciprocity– can be measured by MRI (48, 51). The necessity to connect a cable to the implant modifies the TF, however, and prevents <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> applications. This restriction was overcome by the introduction of the transfer matrix. This approach measures the RF field-induced currents in the implant directly and without the need of any galvanic contact from MR measurements alone (102–104) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 10</emphasis>). The transfer matrix derived from this data contains</para>

This allows not only the ability to fully evaluate tip heating based on an incident background field but also to assess other locations of potential RF-induced heating along the implant. Like its "ancestor" TF, the transfer matrix describes how the implant responds to a pre-existing background E-field. Therefore, the latter must be known, that is, simulations are still required while the aforementioned sensor-based methods are, in principle, independent of such prior knowledge. The techniques applied for transfer-matrix acquisition have similarities with electric-properties tomography (EPT) (105, 106) and consequently share some of its problems as well, most notably the transceive-phase approximation and assumptions on the vector orientation of B<subscript>1</subscript><superscript>+</superscript> and E.</para>
    <para>Most of these described MR-based techniques to assess implant safety still need further investigations, in particular if more complex implant geometries or locations, multiple implants or complex lead trajectories come into play. Also, most of these MR-based current-measurement techniques assume a homogeneous or known B<subscript>1</subscript> transmit and/or receive field to work accurately (100, 101). These assumptions are increasingly difficult to attain at higher field strengths, which may limit the general applicability of such methods.</para>
    <para>Current measurements are only an indirect measure of implant heating because they rely on thermal models that might be incomplete (e.g., neglecting perfusion or thermoregulation). Measuring temperatures around the implant is a more direct assessment of implant safety and a variety of temperature-dependent MR contrasts exists that can be exploited for that purpose (107, 108). As of today, however, MR thermometry could not replace RF-power monitoring in conjunction with dedicated SAR models as an MRI-related safety</para>

One reason is its vulnerability to subject-specific error sources that may compromise temperature-reading accuracy <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> beyond acceptable levels.

Nevertheless, several studies have been performed showing the potential of MR thermometry around implants to assess heating with reasonable accuracies &lt;1°C compared to fiber-optic thermometry (45, 109).

    <para>Each transmit RF coil produces a characteristic <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field distribution inside the human body. If a second coil element with another characteristic <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field distribution is added, the overall incident <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field is a coherent superposition of both <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field vectors.

Most importantly, the relative pulse amplitudes and phases for different RF coil elements can be changed at the pulse sequence level without hardware modifications and, at least in principle, in real-time. A birdcage RF coil, the standard body RF coil design for many clinical MR systems, consists of two ports driven with a 90° phase difference to achieve the CP or quadrature-driven mode. However, if the two channels are driven individually as two independent linear polarization modes, the <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field distribution in the human body can change completely. Eryaman, et al. (122) have demonstrated that the linear mode has <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field null zones in which an implant would be exposed to highly reduced background <emphasis role="italics">E</emphasis>-field, hence strongly reduced RF field-induced heating. If the linear birdcage modes are combined, accordingly, to reduce the RF current on an implant such as a lead, this two-channel, pTx system effectively mitigates RF heating (101, 123–125) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 11</emphasis>).</para>

Adapted from color figure in Winter, et al. (1), original figure from Eryaman, et al. (101).</para>
    <para>Increasing the number of pTx channels increases the degrees of freedom to reduce the E-field near the implant and, hence, suppresses unwanted hotspots with minimal loss of diagnostic image quality (126–130) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 12</emphasis>). This is achieved in an optimization process that also reveals the worst-case and best-case RF heating scenario for a particular implant and transmit RF coil configuration, indicating the potential safety risk margins (131, 132). Investigators have demonstrated that an eight-channel pTx coil outperforms a four-channel pTx coil in suppressing unwanted SAR hotspots induced by DBS leads (130, 133, 134). Other constraints that can be embedded in the optimization of the RF pulse process are local SAR, whole-body averaged SAR, adaptive SAR (135), or the k-space trajectory for spokes pulses (127).</para>
    <para>Interestingly, these pTx techniques are not restricted to proof-of-concept studies in phantoms on simplified implant geometries under controlled conditions; they could be an actual game changer for patients with implants that have complex geometries. This was recently demonstrated by two independent simulation studies investigating pTx mitigation of RF-induced heating of DBS leads with realistic trajectories extracted from CT-based patient data (130, 134) (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 12</emphasis>). Those studies showed that the local SAR could be decreased by more than 94% compared to body RF coil excitation at comparable B<subscript>1</subscript> homogeneity and global SAR. These results suggest that pTx systems could be a viable strategy to deal with the increasing complexity and number of medical implants in patients undergoing MRI</para>

    <para>exams. However, more validation studies are needed to support this claim. Access to robust and flexible pTx system hardware is still very limited. Fortunately, efforts exist to attend to this need such as the ongoing development of an open-source, hardware-based pTx implant-safety testbed, which is adaptable to experiments with up to 32-channels at all relevant static magnetic field strengths (i.e., 1.5 to 7 Tesla) (136).</para>
    <para>An interesting approach is to combine sensor measurements from on or around implants and use this information for pTx based mitigation. This has been demonstrated by using time-domain current (129, 132) and E-field sensors (136). More recently, even simple RMS sensors such as thermistors or diodes were utilized in proof-of-concept studies for real-time mitigation of RF-induced heating. In addition to being real-time capable, these sensor measurements also contain imaging information that can be used to maintain image quality, while at the same time RF field-induced heating is reduced substantially (136, 137). While still in its infancy, it is imaginable that in the future, sensor equipped "smart" medical implants could be communicating with a pTx cable MRI device to guarantee safe scanning of implants even under varying conditions such as patient movement.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Other Techniques</emphasis></para>
    <para>If pTx hardware is not available, other methods can be applied to reduce implant heating by shaping the RF field. For example, the linear-polarization mode of the birdcage RF coil has regions of reduced E-field, and if these regions overlap with the implant, RF-induced currents are reduced (122). If a birdcage coil had multiple ports along its circumference, one could 'rotate' the linear-polarization mode by changing the feeding port. Similarly, a birdcage coil in the linear-polarization mode with a single transmit channel can be physically rotated to align the low E-field zone with the implant (138). This concept has been applied to DBS leads and showed significant improvement compared to the standard CP mode of the same birdcage coil (139). Another mitigation approach that does not rely on pTx technology or modified RF coil hardware is to put high-permittivity material pads on the subject at strategic locations. The high-permittivity dielectric modifies the background-field and it has been demonstrated that this can be efficiently used to reduce RF field-induced tip heating (140). A simple, but effective solution is using vertical MR scanners, where B<subscript>0</subscript> is directed perpendicular instead of parallel to the axis of the bore. Consequently, B*<subscript>1</subscript> and the E-field directions change, and the same implant experiences a different background E-field. Simulations have shown that more than a ten-fold tip SAR reduction could be achieved for realistic DBS implant and lead geometries if scanned in a vertical MR system versus a horizontal one (141).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis></para>
    <para>This chapter reviewed the existing literature on MRI-related heating of implants and devices. It should be noted that a number of topics had to be excluded because of space limitations (e.g., interventional tools and devices, low-power pulse sequences, etc.), but the crucial information for RF energy- and gradient field-induced heating of implants was presented.</para>
    <para>Implant safety is an important field in MRI and much has been accomplished, but further work is needed. Three international standards are most relevant in this field: the MRI standard IEC 60601-2-33 and the implant standards that include ASTM F2182 and ISO/TS 10974. The latter set their scopes either on "passive" (ASTM) or "active" (ISO) implants. From the implant manufacturer's point of view, this distinction is fundamental since active implants need electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and other tests, while passive implants do not. From an MRI perspective, however, this distinction appears less relevant. Passive implant-related hazards are a subset of active implant-related hazards and are comprehensively covered by the document, ISO/TS 10974, as well. The document from the ASTM International, ASTM F2182, was a significant milestone and many of its procedural developments will prevail for the testing of passive implants. But no reasons exist, in these authors' opinion, to maintain two implant standards in parallel. ISO/TS 10974 is in many respects more up-to-date and more general. Accordingly, all implants, active or passive, should be tested against it. Low-cost test procedures for low-risk implants would be on the wish list for future editions. For example, test strategies to easily translate an existing safety assessment from, say, a spinal fixation system to a similar one. The concept of an empirical parameterization of the implant-related hazard as demonstrated by Winter, et al. (45) may be helpful in this context (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 13</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>It is important to note that the assessments of implant safety that are based on the current standards are always limited to a single, functional implant. Modifying this test scenario in any electromagnetically relevant way such as having multiple MR Conditional implants close to each other (83), multiple AIMD leads in close distance (142), or broken or abandoned AIMD leads of a previously MR Conditional implant (143) may pose potential safety hazards to the patient.</para>
    <para>The paucity of peer-reviewed literature on gradient field-induced heating of implants suggests that excessive heating occurs only in unfavorable and potentially, unrecognized cases. Regardless, such cases are possible and, thus, it is unsatisfactory that presently, neither the manufacturer of the scanner nor the implant informs the MR system operator's when a critical situation may arise and how to avoid it.</para>
    <para>Accurate numerical simulations are the key to implant safety because they have reached a high level of maturity and can provide both insight and practical solutions. Future developments must be directed towards treating complex implants in realistic detail. To date, ISO/TS 10974's Tier 4 is mostly of conceptual but not yet of any practical value. Simulations need validation, however, and measurements are often restricted to phantoms. This is acceptable as long as phantom measurements are not misunderstood as predictive for the in vivo case. Phantom experiments are a testbed to validate the simulation methodology, transmit RF coil models, and other situations that are then identically applied to anatomical voxel models.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Ex ante</emphasis> simulations of certain numerical models remain surrogates, however. Ultimately, any safety assessment must be specific to the given subject or patient, implant, and scan conditions. This means, that the scanner and implant must somehow "communicate". For example, the implant must "inform" the MR system about its presence and condition, and the scanner must be able to "respond" to this input. The combination of real-time sensors</para>

    <para>In implant safety-related discussions, it is often taken for granted that lower static magnetic field strengths automatically reduce the risk. ISO/TS 10974 or the Fixed-Parameter Option were initially conceived for 1.5 T but not for 3 T MR systems and, recently, the idea of dedicated or niche, low field strength scanners with fields less than 0.6 T (and as low as 0.05 T) is gaining new attention (144-147). Conceptually, the translation of B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> into implant SAR, for example, at the tip of a cardiac pacemaker lead, is a two-step process, however. First, B<subscript>1+RMS</subscript> creates a background E-field. This effect scales with the frequency, hence B<subscript>0</subscript> and the lower field strength may have the safety edge. In the second step, background E-field creates the tip E-field, and this conversion scales linearly with the RF wavelength in tissue (as long as half this wavelength is shorter than the implant and the transmit body RF coil). This time, the higher field strength has the advantage. Qualitatively, this effect can be seen in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 14</emphasis> (148). There is no universal answer to the question of a safest field strength, therefore, the individual implant, transmit RF coil, and scan parameters must be considered.</para>
