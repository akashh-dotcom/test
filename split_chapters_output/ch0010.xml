        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>The increasing availability and capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve medical diagnosis and prognosis has dramatically increased the number of MRI procedures performed worldwide. Thus, many more first-time and repeat patients are undergoing these MRI examinations for an ever-widening spectrum of medical indications. Notably, increasing proportions of these procedures are performed on patients suffering from unstable medical and psychological illnesses. For many of the millions of patients who undergo MRI examinations every year, the experience may cause great emotional distress. The referring physicians, radiologists, and technologists are best prepared to manage affected patients if they understand the etiology of the problem and know the appropriate maneuver or intervention to implement for treatment of the condition (1).</para>
    <para>This chapter discusses the prevalence of claustrophobia in association with the use of MRI, how emotional distress affects outcomes for the MRI procedure, factors contributing to patient distress, and techniques to help minimize anxiety and distress in patients with claustrophobia while undergoing MR imaging. Recent investigations involving emerging MRI applications are also taken into consideration.</para>

        <title>INCIDENCE OF DISTRESS IN THE MRI ENVIRONMENT</title>
    <para>Psychological distress in the MRI environment includes all subjectively unpleasant experiences that are directly attributable to MRI. Distress for the patient undergoing an MRI procedure can range from mild anxiety that can be managed simply with minimal reassurance to a full-blown panic attack that requires psychiatric intervention. Severe psychological</para>

          <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management     285</title>
    <para>distress reactions to MRI examinations, namely severe anxiety and panic attacks, are typically characterized by the rapid onset of at least four of the following clinical signs: fear of losing control or dying, nausea, paresthesias, palpitations, chest pain, faintness, dyspnea, feeling of choking, sweating, trembling, vertigo, or depersonalization (2).</para>
    <para>Many symptoms of panic attack mimic over activity of the sympathetic nervous system (3), prompting concern that catecholamine responses may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias and/or ischemia in susceptible patients during the MRI examination (4). However, this has not been reported in a clinical MRI setting or any other similar situation. Nevertheless, it is advisable that, in a medically unstable patient, the use of physiologic monitoring be a routine component of the MRI examination. Pre-emptive efforts to minimize patient distress are the most important factors in preventing or containing a panic attack in susceptible patients.</para>
    <para>In the mildest form, distress is the normal amount of anxiety any reasonable person will experience when undergoing a diagnostic procedure. Moderate distress severe enough to be described as a dysphoric psychological reaction has been reported by as many as 65% of the patients examined by MRI (5-8). The most severe forms of psychological distress described by patients are claustrophobia, panic attacks, and anxiety (3, 5-12), the latter of which occurs in moderate to severe forms in up to 37% of patients undergoing MRI (13, 14).</para>
    <para>Claustrophobia is a disorder characterized by the marked, persistent and excessive fear of enclosed spaces (2). In such affected individuals, exposure to enclosed spaces such as the MR system, but no other situations or stimuli, almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response that in its most extreme form is indistinguishable from a panic attack as described above.</para>
    <para>The reported incidence of distress in the MRI setting is highly variable across studies in part reflecting differences in outcome measures used to characterize distress. Some studies indicated that as many as 20% of individuals attempting to undergo MRI can't complete it secondary to serious distress such as claustrophobia or other similar sensation (15, 16). In contrast, others have reported that as few as 0.7% of individuals have incomplete or failed MRI examinations due to distress (8, 17). In a study of over 55,000 patients undergoing MRI, claustrophobia was present in 1.8% of cases, and a review of previous literature indicated that 2.3% of patients experienced claustrophobia requiring sedation or termination of the procedure (18). A reasonable estimate of the number of patients that experience distress that compromises either their own well-being or the diagnostic utility MRI is 3 to 5% of all studies. For patients with pre-existing anxiety or claustrophobia, however, the termination rate can be as high as 39% (19, 20).</para>
    <para>Notably, there are no perfect predictors of distress in the MRI environment. In fact, different studies cite opposing results such as which gender has greater difficulty tolerating MRI (17, 18, 21). A cohort study of over 55,000 patients in an outpatient setting in Germany reported that females (2.3%) had a significantly higher rate of claustrophobia than males (1.3%) (18). This is in contrast to an earlier study conducted in Malaysia where the rate of MRI termination was found to be 0.54%, and of those, 67% of the patients who terminated their scans were male (17). Obviously, these differences may reflect cultural, socioeconomic or other influences.</para>

        <title>THE IMPACT OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS IN THE MRI ENVIRONMENT</title>
    <para>Patient distress can contribute to adverse outcomes for the MRI procedure. These adverse outcomes include unintentional exacerbation of patient distress, a compromise in the diagnostic power of the MRI examination due to poor image quality, and decreased efficiency of the imaging facility due to delayed, cancelled or prematurely terminated studies. Patient compliance during MRI, such as the ability to remain in the MR system and hold still long enough to complete the study is of paramount importance to achieving a high quality, diagnostic examination.</para>
    <para>If a good quality study can't be obtained, the patient may require an invasive diagnostic examination in place of the safer, less painful and risky MRI exam. Thus, for the distressed patient unable to undergo MRI, there are potential clinical, medico-legal, and economic related considerations implications.</para>
    <para>Patient distress due to MRI may also impact regional brain activity as indicated by functional neuroimaging measurements. Elevated endocrine levels have been observed in association with scanning procedures compared to baseline, particularly in stress hormones such as cortisol (22-24). Studies have indicated that elevated salivary cortisol levels are associated with MRI examinations in both adolescents and healthy adults (23, 24). In contrast, Muehlhan, et al. (25) found changes in salivary alpha amylase but not in cortisol prior to MRI. This evidence, while inconclusive, points towards increased activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and the sympatho-adrenal-medullary axes which are, in turn, associated with regionally specific neural activation and deactivation (26, 27). Fluctuating endocrine levels have been implicated in the modulation of regional brain activity, a suggestion that has broad implications for interpreting functional neuroimaging results. Functional MRI (fMRI) is at the forefront of neuroimaging research. Because fMRI is increasingly introduced into clinical practice a variety of critical applications the effects of hormone levels on brain activity related to anxiety and emotional distress could impact this procedure.</para>
    <para>Increasing pressure to use scanner time efficiently to cover the costs of this expensive diagnostic imaging equipment puts greater stress on both staff members and patients. The ability of referring physicians, radiologists, and MRI technologists to detect patient distress at the earliest possible time, to discover the source of the distress, and then provide appropriate intervention can greatly improve patient comfort, the quality of the imaging studies, and the efficiency of the MRI facility (1).</para>
    <para>Motion artifact disrupting image quality is frequently the result of patient distress. That is, the distressed patient becomes agitated and finds it difficult to remain motionless during MRI. Obviously, motion artifacts can compromise the diagnostic power of an MRI exam. One investigation in 297 first-time outpatients undergoing MRI indicated that approximately 13% of the MRI studies showed motion artifacts (i.e., unrelated to normal body pulsations) and about half of these impaired the diagnostic quality of the examination (8). Subsequent studies have confirmed these estimates (20, 28). One of these investigations reported an even higher proportion of scans with motion artifacts (18%) in a sample of patients with pre-existing anxiety conditions and non-anxious controls (20).</para>
        <sect2 id="ch0010s0000s0003s0001">
          <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management    287</title>
    <para>Excessive anxiety with accompanying tremors, trembling, jaw clenching and other related body movements have been presumed to contribute to motion artifacts in MR images. Dantendorfer, et al. (8) attempted to investigate this directly and found that, while specific measures of anxiety do not predict motion artifacts, reported concerns about the scanner did predict motion artifacts. Tournquist, et al. (28) designed an experiment to test whether increased awareness about the procedure prior to initiating the scan would reduce motion related artifacts. The investigators found nearly a three-fold reduction in the number of scans with artifacts in the intervention group (4%) compared to the control condition (15.4%). The patients in the intervention group received additional written information that included details about what the procedure would entail, as well as sensory and temporal information related to the procedure (28). These results support the interpretation that adequate patient education about the MRI procedure is one of the most important aspects of minimizing distress and the associated adverse outcomes.</para>
    <para>The emotional distress that comes with claustrophobia and anxiety may lead to a compromise in MR image quality due to motion artifacts related to the patient's inability to remain motionless. While this is undoubtedly crucial to achieving a diagnostically acceptable examination, Klaming L, et al. (66) reported that there was little evidence to support the assumption that anxiety increases patient motion and decreases image quality during MRI. However, the evidence supporting the benefits of patient education prior to MRI still remains relevant and critical to ensuring the best possible outcomes in patients with claustrophobia, anxiety, and emotional distress.</para>

        <sect2 id="ch0010s0000s0003s0002">
          <title>FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO DISTRESS IN THE MRI ENVIRONMENT</title>
    <para>Many factors contribute to distress experienced by certain patients undergoing MRI. Most commonly cited are concerns about the physical environment of the scanner. Also well documented are the anxieties associated with the underlying medical problem necessitating the MRI exam Notably, certain individuals, such as those with psychiatric illnesses, may be predisposed to suffer greater distress related to the MRI procedure.</para>
    <para>The physical environment of the scanner is clearly one important source of distress to patients. Sensations of apprehension, tension, worry, claustrophobia, anxiety, fear, and even panic attacks have been directly attributed to the confining dimensions of the interior of the MR system. For example, for certain types of scanners, the patient's face may be three to ten inches from the inner portion of the scanner, prompting feelings of uncontrolled confinement and detachment (3, 5-12, 15, 16, 29-34). In one study, confinement was reported by 22.9% of patients as the most unpleasant feature of the MRI experience (34). This factor, combined with other physical aspects of the MRI environment may contribute to the high levels of distress observed in patients undergoing MRI.</para>
    <para>Similar distressing sensations have been attributed to the other aspects of the MRI setting including the prolonged duration of the MRI examination, the gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise, the temperature and humidity within the MR system, and the distress related to the restriction of movement (3-12, 15, 16, 29-33, 35, 36). Other studies have reported stress related to the administration of an intravenous MRI contrast agent (3, 5-7, 9-</para>
    <para>12, 15, 16, 29-33, 35-37). Additionally, the scanner may produce feelings of sensory deprivation, restriction, and suffocation, which are also known to be precursors of severe anxiety states (10, 38). Investigations have indicated that phobias related to specific aspects of the MRI environment can predict claustrophobic fears and psychological outcomes in the scanner (14, 34, 39, 40). Using pre-scan questionnaires, clinicians may be able to identify patients who are at risk for terminating the scan due to claustrophobia (20, 34, 39, 40).</para>
    <para>One of the more overwhelming features of the MRI procedure is the acoustic noise generated by the MR system. Gradient magnetic field-induced noise may be sufficiently intense to cause transient hearing threshold shifts in as many as 43% of patients undergoing MRI (41). Obviously, acoustic noise in and of itself can be a source of stress and, thus, particularly troublesome to certain patients in association with MRI. In one study, noise alone was considered the most unpleasant feature of MRI by 19.5% of patients (34). This information suggests that the noise reduction achieved in the new generation of scanners may be an important factor in reducing distress. The use of newer scanners demonstrated up to a 97% reduction in acoustic noise compared to older scanners. Dewey, et al. (18) observed a threefold reduction in reports of claustrophobia using the newer short- and wide-bore scanners that have noise emission levels below 99-dB compared to conventional, older scanners.</para>
    <para>MR systems that have an architecture that utilizes a vertical magnetic field offer a more open design that is presumed to reduce the frequency of distress associated with MRI. The latest versions of these so-called "open" scanners, despite having static magnetic field strengths of 0.35-Tesla or lower have improved technology (i.e., faster gradient fields, optimized surface coils, etc.) that permit acceptable image quality for virtually all types of standard, diagnostic imaging procedures. Also, the latest generation of high-field-strength (1.5-Tesla and 3-Tesla) MR systems have shorter and wider bore configurations such that these newer scanners tend to be more acceptable to patients with feelings of distress related to close confinement.</para>
    <para>After the release of the first commercially available open MR systems, Datendorfer, et al. (8) designed a study to compare an open system to a standard scanner. This report indicated that there was no difference between a conventional 1.5-T MR system (Siemens Magnetom SP-65, Siemens Medical Solutions) and a more open 0.5-Tesla scanner (Philips Gyroscan P-5, Philips Medical Systems) with regard to the incidence of adverse reactions (i.e., pre- or post-scan anxiety, claustrophobia, motion artifacts, or aborted exams).</para>
    <para>MRI scanner design has been postulated to be a key factor that contributes to patient distress, and it's known that "open" configured scanners with shorter and wider bore configurations have increased examination success rate. However, Enders, et al. (19) reported that there wasn't a substantial difference in claustrophobia experienced by patients undergoing MRI in an open versus a short-bore MR system. A subsequent study by Enders, et al. (75), further examined the use of a high-field open scanner (1.0-Tesla) and a short-bore, high field MR system (1.5-T) used for MRI of the spine. In this randomized controlled comparison of spinal MR imaging with an open versus a short-bore scanner, short-bore MR imaging revealed considerably higher image quality with shorter scanning times. Interestingly, patients reported claustrophobia in both types of MR scanners.</para>
    <para>In contrast to the aforementioned investigations, two non-randomized studies of claustrophobic patients demonstrated a decreased rate of claustrophobic events in open MR systems compared to closed scanners (42, 43). Decreases of similar magnitude have been observed in newer generations of short- and wide-bore scanners compared to conventional MR systems (44). In one study of claustrophobic patients who previously failed completing an MRI procedure, Hunt, et al. (44) observed an 89% success rate for patients scanned in a short- and wide-bore 1.5-Tesla MR system compared to their previously unsuccessful procedure in a conventional 1.5-Tesla scanner.</para>
    <para>In another study, Dewey, et al. (18) compared the rate of claustrophobia between short- and wide-bore configured 1.5-Tesla MR systems (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions) and conventional 1.0-Tesla scanners (Magnetom Impact Expert Plus, Siemens Medical Solutions) in an outpatient setting. Data from this study collected over the course of eight years demonstrated significantly lower rates of claustrophobic reactions among patients scanned on newer 1.5-Tesla scanners (0.7%) compared to conventional 1.0-Tesla MR systems (2.1%) (18). Considered together, these data suggest that although the patient-centered design of MR scanners has evolved in the past 20 or so years, even the most state-of-the-art systems do not prevent claustrophobia, indicating that there are other factors besides the physical aspects of the MR system that are related to claustrophobic events.</para>
    <para>In the early 1990s, a specially-designed, low-field-strength (0.2-Tesla) MR system (Artoscan, Lunar Corporation/General Electric Medical Systems and Esaote) first became commercially available for MR imaging of extremities. The use of dedicated extremity scanners such as these provides an accurate, reliable, and relatively inexpensive means (i.e., in comparison to the use of a whole-body MR system) of evaluating various types of musculoskeletal abnormalities. Therefore, utilization of the extremity scanner to assess musculoskeletal pathology is a viable and acceptable alternative to the use of whole-body scanners (45). This is particularly the case since the image quality and diagnostic capabilities for the evaluation of the knee and other extremities has been reported to be comparable to mid- or high-field strength MR systems for certain musculoskeletal applications (45).</para>
    <para>The architecture of the extremity MR system has no confining features or other aspects that would typically create patient-related problems. This is because only the body part that requires imaging is placed inside the magnet bore during the MR examination. One study reported that 100% of the MRI examinations that were initiated were completed without being interrupted or canceled for patient-related problems (Shellock FG, Unpublished Data, 2011). The unique design of the extremity scanner likely contributed to the totally successful completion of MRI examinations in the patients of this study. Furthermore, these findings represent a dramatic improvement compared with the published incidence of patient distress that tends to interrupt or prevent the completion of MRI examinations using whole-body MR systems.</para>
    <para>Currently, there are no reports available on the topic of "upright" or "standing" MR systems and patients with claustrophobia. Anecdotally, the ability to stand or sit for the MRI exam and, thus, avoid having the scanner in close proximity to the face often proves helpful for individuals who may otherwise experience claustrophobia (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 1a and 1b</emphasis>).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Figure 1.</emphasis> Examples of an "upright" or "standing" MR system. Anecdotally, the ability to stand (a) (G-Scan Brio, Esaote, www.esaote.com) or sit (b) (Upright MRI Fonar, www.fonar.com) during an MRI exam and avoid having the scanner in close proximity to the face often proves helpful for individuals who may experience claustrophobia.</para>
  <para>Adverse psychological reactions are sometimes associated with MRI simply because the examination may be perceived by the patient as a "dramatic" medical test that has an associated uncertainty of outcome, such that there may be a fear of the presence of disease or other abnormality (5, 10). In fact, any type of diagnostic imaging procedure may produce a certain amount of anxiety for the patient (30). For example, Thorp, et al. (16) found that, with the exception of the MR system environment issue (i.e., the confined space), patients undergoing computed tomography compared to those undergoing MRI had similar feelings that the procedure was unpleasant. Patients finding the experience difficult tended to be those with high initial levels of anxiety, little experience with diagnostic procedures, and those that believed they had cancer (16). This study underscores the need for direct professional interaction to prepare and educate the patient prior to any form of diagnostic imaging examination. Improved patient compliance was reported in a study that investigated the impact of more detailed patient education on adverse outcomes from MR mammography, a procedure known to have an atypically high rate of noncompliance (46). Likewise, in a study designed to test the noncompliance rate before and after hospital radiology staff were trained in nonpharmacological analgesia, one multi-site practice observed a significant decrease in noncompliance rates during the period of time following the training. This particular training program involved two components: advanced rapport training and self-hypnotic relaxation, both highlighting the importance of individualized care and interpersonal interactions in patient care (47).</para>
    <para>Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders may be at greater risk for experiencing distress in the MRI environment. One problem that arises more often in this population is the refusal of the prescribed MRI exam by the patient. Frequently, the cause for refusal is an inadequate understanding of why the procedure was ordered and what the actual procedure involves.</para>
    <para>For patients with pre-existing anxiety disorders who agree to undergo MRI, it is prudent for hospital radiology staff to use augmented methods to minimize additional anxiety or distress. Grey, et al. (48) reported the efficacy of an anxiety reduction protocol in patients with moderate to high trait anxiety. Prior to MRI, patients in the intervention group were given detailed information regarding scanning procedures including descriptions of the acoustic noise, equipment and the procedure room, the timing of scans and degree of interaction with the MRI technologist, as well as coping strategies for anxiety in the scanner such as increasing the audio volume and paying attention to a clock on the wall. Patients in the intervention group were significantly less anxious during the procedure and retrospectively when asked about the whole procedure compared to those patients in the control condition, indicating that the extra time and effort spent preparing the patients in the intervention group made a positive impact on patients with pre-existing anxiety (48).</para>
    <para>In a small study of older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) the rate of unsuccessful MRI examinations in patients with pre-existing anxiety was assessed and compared to a control group. In this study, an unsuccessful scan was defined as one in which there was excessive movement or premature termination of the scan. There was no significant difference in the rate of successful MRI outcome in this group of GAD patients and non-anxious controls (20). To date, this study is the only report of the differential frequency of distress or adverse outcomes for MRI exams in such patients compared to non-psychiatrically impaired patients. Although these findings fail to find a difference between cohorts, future studies are still warranted and specific inquiry should be made to identify patients with pre-existing anxiety disorders including claustrophobia, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in order to increase anxiety minimizing efforts in these patients.</para>
    <para>Patients with other psychiatric illnesses such as depression and any illness complicated by thought disorder such as schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder may also be at increased risk for distress in the MRI environment. Patients with psychiatric illnesses may, under normal circumstances, be able to tolerate the MRI setting without a problem, as is clear from the thousands who participate in clinical neuroimaging research studies each year (49). However, the increased stress due to their medical illness or fear of medical illness may exacerbate their psychiatric symptoms to such an extent that they may have difficulty complying with MRI procedures. At the very least, patients with psychiatric illnesses may require more time and patience to provide the appropriate level of preparatory information.</para>

    <para>aminations. A number of other measures will be required if the patient is experiencing significant distress due to factors as described above. Finally, other distress-alleviation techniques will only be necessary for patients with co-existing psychiatric illness or other special problems. Coordination of these efforts among the referring physician, the radiologist, the MRI technologist and the facility support staff is crucial. Most of these methods have been described in the peer-reviewed literature and are summarized in <emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis> (3-5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 21, 33, 35, 36, 46, 50-54, 67, 69, 72).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">For All Patients Undergoing MRI Procedures</emphasis></para>
    <para>Referring clinicians should take the time to explain the rationale for the MRI examination and what he/she expects to learn from the results with respect to the implications for treatment and prognosis. Importantly, the clinician should schedule time with the patient to communicate the results of the MRI procedure.</para>
    <para>The single most important step is to educate the patient about the specific aspects of the MRI examination that are known to be particularly difficult. This includes conveying in terms that are understandable to the patient the internal dimensions of the MR system, the level of gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise to expect, and the estimated time duration of the examination.</para>
    <para>Studies have documented a decrease in the incidence of premature termination of MRI when patients are provided with more detailed information regarding the examination (46-48, 67, 68, 72). This may be effectively accomplished by means of providing the patient time to view an educational videotape or written brochure supplemented by a question and</para>
    <para>answer session with an MRI-trained healthcare worker prior to MRI. An investigation by Tazegul G, et al. (72) also supports the use of information and communication as a method for preventing and reducing anxiety in patients, encouraging the continued use of this method by radiology technologists.</para>
    <para>Some authors have proposed adding a pre-scan "fear assessment" to help predict patients who will experience psychological problems related to MRI (15, 20, 29, 30, 34, 39, 40). Such a brief questionnaire could be used to help elicit questions and concerns from patients and to provide guidance to staff about which distress minimization strategies are most likely to be effective for the patient.</para>
    <para>One study on anxiety and MRI exams conducted by Van Minde, et al. (76) specifically looked at patients who were highly anxious before MRI. The study measured stress and anxiety throughout the exam by monitoring the patient's heart rate. The data showed that patient anxiety levels were highest at the very beginning of the procedure, particularly when the MRI table was moving into the scanner. However, anxiety and stress decreased over the course of the examination. This information not only proves helpful to radiology professionals working with patients but may also aid in the development of more effective anxiety-reduction strategies in the future.</para>
    <para>Upon entering the MRI facility, patients who are treated with respect and are welcomed into a calm environment will report less distress. Many details of patient positioning in the MR system can increase comfort and minimize distress. Taking time to ensure comfortable positioning with adequate padding and blankets to alleviate undue discomfort or pain from positioning is also important. Adequate hearing protection should be provided routinely to decrease acoustic noise generated by the MR system. Demonstration of the two-way intercom system to reassure to patients that the MRI staff members can hear them when they speak and can speak to them during the examination can also be reassuring.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">For Mildly to Moderately Distressed Patients</emphasis>If a patient that continues to experience distress after the afore-mentioned measures are implemented, additional interventions are required. Frequently, all that is necessary to successfully complete an MRI examination is to allow an appropriately-screened relative or friend to remain with the patient during the procedure. A familiar person in the MR system room often helps the patient who is anxious to develop an increased sense of security (12, 35). If a supportive companion is not present, then simply having an MRI staff member maintain verbal contact via the intercom system or physical contact by having a staff person remain in the MR system room with the patient during the examination will frequently decrease psychological distress (7, 12, 35).</para>
    <para>Placing the patient in a prone position inside the MR system so that the patient can visualize the opening of the bore provides a sensation of being inside a device that is more spacious and alleviates the "closed-in" feeling associated with the supine position (35, 55, 67). Prone positioning of the patient may not be a practical alternative if MRI requires the use of certain types of radiofrequency (RF) coils or if the patient has underlying medical conditions (e.g., shortness of breath, the presence of chest tubes, etc.) that preclude lying in</para>
    <para>this position. Another method of positioning the patient that may help is to place the individual feet-first instead of head-first into the scanner.</para>
    <para>An MR system, head-coil mounted mirror (Figure 2) or prism glasses (Figure 3) can be used to permit the patient to maintain a vertical view of the outside of the scanner in order to minimize claustrophobic responses. Using a blindfold so that the patient is not aware of the close surroundings has also been suggested to be an effective technique for enabling anxious patients to successfully undergo MRI (12, 35).</para>
    <para>The internal environment of the MR system may be changed to optimize the management of apprehensive patients (12). For example, the presence of higher lighting levels tends to make most individuals feel less anxious. Therefore, the use of bright lights at either end and inside of the MR system can produce a less imposing environment for the patient. In addition, using a fan inside of the scanner to provide more air movement will help reduce the sensation of confinement and lessen any tissue heating that may result when high levels of RF power absorption are used for MRI (12). Some MRI staff members have reported that placing a cotton pad moistened with a few drops of lemon, vanilla, cucumber oil or other similar form of aromatherapy in the MR system for the patient to receive olfactory stimulation can also reduce distress. Reports by Munn, et al. (67, 68) found that cognitive behavioral strategies, MRI design features, team training, fragrance administration, information, and prone positioning all have a positive impact on outcomes in reducing fear, anxiety, and claustrophobia. Not only do these measures increase patient comfort, but they also reduce the need for sedation.</para>

MR Conditional audio devices that transmit music and/or provide audio communication through headphones have been developed for use with scanners and are available from several vendors.</para>
  <para>Audio devices that transmit music and/or provide audio communication through headphones have been developed specifically for use with MR systems (51, 52, 56, 57). These MR Conditional music/audio systems may be acquired from commercial vendors. This equipment can be used to provide calming music to the patient and, with the proper design, help to minimize exposure to gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 4</emphasis>). Reports have indicated that the use of these devices has been successful in reducing symptoms of anxiety in patients during MRI (52, 56, 58). Furthermore, one study suggested that having a live musician play music that matches the rhythm of the gradient magnetic fields improves patient perceptions of the MRI examination (58). This improved perception may also be due in part to the perceived increase in the social interaction that the patient has during MRI. Obviously, that particular means of helping an anxious patient to get through a clinical MRI exam tends to be impractical.</para>
    <para>Another technique investigated for reducing anxiety during MRI exams is foot massage or touch therapy, both of which may be beneficial due to the increase in social interaction during the procedure. Not only was foot massage or touch therapy found acceptable and feasible by both patients and MRI technologists, Parmar, et al. (69) reported that these interventions were associated with lower levels of anxiety during MRI.</para>
    <para>It is also possible to provide visual stimulation to the patient via special goggles or a headset (57). Use of visual stimuli to distract patients may also reduce distress. Finally, a specialized system has been developed to provide a virtual reality environment for the patient that may likewise serve as an acceptable means of audio and visual distraction from the MRI exam (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 5a and 5b</emphasis>). A case study of two patients with claustrophobia demonstrated that virtual reality distraction decreased subjective anxiety ratings when compared to no distraction (59).</para>
    <para>The use of a virtual reality tool that simulates the MRI experience may also be effective at helping to prepare patients with claustrophobia and anxiety for MRI exams. Previous studies have shown that desensitization therapy via the use of virtual reality (VR) offers an effective method of treating anxiety (74, 77). A VR app has been developed that helps to educate the patient about the MRI exam by simulating the experience (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 6</emphasis>). The app incorporates both visual and auditory sensations normally encountered by patients during MRI. Developers believe that this tool has potential similar to desensitization therapy, reducing patient anxiety prior to MRI and lowering the incidence of claustrophobia-related issues. Importantly, when used in pediatric patients, this VR app reduces the need for the use of sedation or anesthesia (80).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">For Severely Distressed or Claustrophobic Patients</emphasis></para>
    <para>Patients who are at high risk for severe distress in the MRI setting and can be identified as such by their referring clinician or by the scheduling MRI staff could be offered the opportunity to have pre-MRI behavioral therapy. MRI examinations that were conducted in patients that previously refused or were unable to tolerate the MRI environment have been reported to be successful as a result of treatment with relaxation techniques (9, 54), systematic desensitization (11), and medical hypnosis (33, 36, 53). Quirk, et al. (9) reported that psychological preparation that included information about MRI and the use of relaxation strategies (i.e., breathing relaxation techniques, visualization of pleasant images, perform-</para>

    <para>Klonoff, et al. (11) provided a detailed example of one successful systematic desensitization protocol. This was conducted prior to MRI and involved having the patient lie on the floor at home with her head in a box. The size of the box was incrementally decreased until it approximated the internal dimensions of the MR system. Additionally, the patient was required to gradually increase the amount of time that she could tolerate spending with the box over her head, until it equaled 50 to 60 minutes, to approximate the maximum time needed for MRI. The patient also wore prism glasses that permitted her to have a direct view in the vertical plane during MRI. After four treatment sessions, the patient was able to successfully undergo MRI (11). Notably, because of the time involved with systematic desensitization, this technique of preparing the distressed patient for MRI is impractical for clinical MRI facilities.</para>
    <para>Medical hypnosis has been demonstrated to be a successful means of treating phobias (50) and, not surprisingly, has been used as an effective intervention to enable a claustrophobic or anxious patient to complete MRI (33, 36, 53). Successful hypnotherapy requires a trained medical hypnotist and a willing, trance-susceptible patient. Therefore, identifying the appropriate patient that would benefit from being hypnotized before and during MRI and having a hypnosis therapist available for treatment are prerequisites for instituting this technique of patient management. There is a secondary effect of using hypnosis for patients with psychological disorders undergoing MRI insofar as patients have reported feeling a general reduction in anxiety in their everyday lives after undergoing hypnosis (33).</para>
    <para>In the majority of MRI facilities, patients that are severely affected by claustrophobia, anxiety, or panic attacks in response to MRI are usually pharmacologically sedated when other attempts to counteract their distress fail. Using short-acting sedatives such as lorazepam, diazepam, alprazolam, or intranasal midazolam or one of the other anxiolytic medications may be the only means of managing patients with a high degree of anxiety related to MRI. Published reports of the rate of pharmacological sedation for patients undergoing MRI range from 2 to 14% (8, 21).</para>
    <para>A study conducted by Avrahami (3) in patients with panic attacks who were unable to undergo MRI reported that treatment with intravenous diazepam caused the symptoms to disappear rapidly and permitted completion of the examination in every case. However, the use of sedatives in patients prior to and during MRI may not be required in all instances nor is it always practical (1).</para>
    <para>Of special note is that anxious patients with a history of substance abuse who are in recovery programs may not be willing to take mind-altering medications because this is typically contraindicated during their treatment. These patients should be referred for behavioral therapy before MRI. In all cases, one or more of the recommended, non-medication-related techniques indicated in Table I should be attempted for these patients before electing to use a sedative.</para>

  <para>been reported in response to relatively modest doses of commonly employed sedatives (6, 9). If a sedative or other similar drug is used in a patient in preparation for MRI, it should be understood that the use of this medication involves several important patient management considerations (31). For example, the time when the patient should be administered the medication for optimal effect prior to the examination should be considered along with the possibility that there may be an adverse reaction to the drug (31). The use of proper physiologic monitoring equipment during the MRI examination is essential. Additionally, provisions should be available for an area to permit adequate recovery of the patient after MRI</para>
    <para>and the patient should have someone available to provide transportation from the MRI facility after receiving a sedative.</para>
    <para>According to Rotunda (70), patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and who may also have severe claustrophobia frequently are unable to successfully complete MRI exams, which may greatly affect their health outcomes. Research studies comparing the brains of patients with PTSD versus people who do not have PTSD have shown diffuse decreases in white and gray matter in patients who developed PTSD after various traumas. The areas in which these types of white and gray matter changes occur might provide some insight into the anatomical and physiological reasons for PTSD symptoms (71). For healthcare professionals, it is important to be aware of the potential differences in the brain of a patient with PTSD and the effects that these differences may have on behavior. Therefore, educated MRI technologists who can adapt to the specific needs of their patients, such as those with PTSD, are more likely to provide the best experiences which leads to better patient outcomes. This includes being proactive with respect to preparing and managing patients with PTSD for MRI exams.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">For Pediatric Patients</emphasis>Careful consideration of methods for reducing distress in pediatric patients is extremely important as the implications of imaging procedures have both short- and long-term effects in this population. In addition to the short-term effects of distress, anxiety and pain, resulting in crying and lack of cooperation, there may be long-term psychological effects into adulthood such as medical fears, less perceived control over health, and in some cases, post-traumatic stress responses and claustrophobic feelings (60, 61). Some of the methods for minimizing distress and discomfort in the scanner are similar to those used in adults, however, important differences should be highlighted. Similar to adults, pediatric patients can also benefit from preparation prior to the procedure, hypnosis, music and sedation. Other pediatric specific methods such as visual and audio distraction, positive reinforcement and parental involvement have also been shown to be effective (60).</para>
    <para>Parental involvement can be a particularly useful technique as it engages the parents, which in turn reduces the parents' own anxiety and ensures that the child is in close proximity to them. Techniques with parental involvement include comforting and distracting the child while holding the child in a comforting position, educating and preparing the child for the procedure, and providing positive reinforcement. Parents must be careful in these interactions with their children, as any anxiety or stress they express can induce anxiety and stress in the child (60).</para>
    <para>Educational materials and procedural preparation can be helpful for both the parents and the child. Parents and pediatric patients can watch educational videos together, practice positioning for the procedure, and observe other children modeling various coping skills. With the assistance of radiology staff members, parents can help their children practice breathing techniques and engage in positive imagery (60).</para>
    <para>Some radiology teams also employ child-life specialists who are specifically trained to teach pediatric patients and their parents various coping skills that they can employ during MRI. These skills include visual, auditory and tactile distraction and breathing exercises</para>
    <para>(60). In addition to reducing stress and anxiety in pediatric patients, child-life specialists have been shown to contribute to the reduction of sedation rates associated with pediatric MRI procedures (62).</para>
    <para>Just as there are risks associated with using sedatives in adult patients, there are risks for sedating pediatric patients. Unlike for adult patients, however, the process of inducing sedation can be equally as traumatizing to the child as the MRI exam, itself. Under certain circumstances, sedation is the only way to achieve the quality of scans required for diagnosis, particularly in young children under the age of eight (63). In this case, radiology teams should follow established sedation programs that are safe and effective (64).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</emphasis>With the increasing proportion of patients taking greater responsibility for their own health, there is a rise in the number of patients using these web-based portals for information on their own health as well as information about the procedures they will undergo. With more than 60% of patients using web-based systems (65) such as Medline Plus, WebMD, and other online sources to find healthcare information, it is important for hospital radiology teams to provide their patients with specific and up-to-date information regarding their procedures. An increased focus on patient-centered medicine and improved patient education has prompted hospitals and other medical imaging facilities to provide detailed information to patients and their families.</para>
    <para>From the referring physicians and radiologists to the technologists and support staff, each member of the team has a specific role in providing care for their patients. Primary care physicians and specialists who order the procedures have a responsibility to engage their patients in the medical process and explain the rationale for the MRI procedure. The healthcare support staff that schedule, greet, and provide the patients with pamphlets of information are an extremely valuable resource for the patients as they are the most visible members of the team.</para>
    <para>The radiology technologists who perform the diagnostic procedures have the most direct impact on the care of the patients during potentially distressing procedures. They are highly trained professionals who not only conduct a wide range of diagnostic tests but also provide educational information and prepare patients for the procedures prior to conducting tests. As always, the radiologists and physicians who interpret the results of the tests and discuss the diagnoses with their patients have the responsibility of establishing good lines of communication with the patients and understanding their mental state following potentially distressing procedures.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis>The advances in MRI technology combined with the advances in clinical applications to aid in the diagnosis and management of an ever-increasing number of medical conditions will ensure that the number of patients undergoing MRI will continue to increase every year.
