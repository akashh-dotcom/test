    </para>
    <para>Safety is paramount when considering that both demand and utilization rates for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have increased dramatically in the past decade. As such, effective safety training and education are essential, particularly because MRI has increasingly become the modality of choice for a number of medical indications and scanners with higher static magnetic fields, faster gradient magnetic fields, and more intense radiofrequency (RF) fields are frequently being used. Canadian MRI facilities strive to align with relevant standards and with guidelines developed by leading organizations and experts to ensure that policies and procedures function to protect patients, staff members, and others working in and around the MRI environment.</para>

    </para>
    <para>Canada has publicly funded healthcare where the federal government provides money to the ten provinces and three territories as described under the Canada Health Act. Each province and territory then manages and delivers healthcare to all citizens. The high cost of providing healthcare means that MRI programs receive a great deal of attention from politicians, senior administrators, and the media. In particular, the time that patients must wait for MRI scans is a politically sensitive issue. Consequently, the number of scanners installed across Canada has steadily increased.</para>
