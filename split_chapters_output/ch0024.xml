        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides unparalleled soft tissue resolution utilizing multiple pulse sequences, each optimized for the evaluation of particular tissue attributes. Therefore, MRI is the modality of choice for visualizing numerous soft tissue conditions including various neurologic, musculoskeletal, thoracic, and abdominal abnormalities. Additionally, due to the absence of ionizing radiation, MRI is optimal for sequential imaging for disease follow-up and surveillance as well as diagnostic imaging in children and women of childbearing age. In parallel to an increase in the use of MRI, the number of patients with permanent cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) continues to increase. As such, it is inevitable that healthcare providers will face the need to perform MRI in an implantable cardiac device recipient. The safety of using MRI in patients</para>

    <para>with selected non-MR Conditional, cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) has been successfully demonstrated in a number of studies utilizing standardized protocols while under appropriate supervision. However, catastrophic complications have also been reported for patients with older (i.e., prior to 2000) CIEDs. In this chapter, we review potential interactions of MRI with CIEDs, prior investigations to assess safety, our institutional protocol for imaging patients with non-MR Conditional devices, and the potential effects of susceptibility artifacts.</para>

        <title>Potential Interactions of MRI with Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Devices (CIEDs)</title>
    <para>The electromagnetic fields used with MRI are associated with several potential risks involving CIEDs. Therefore, prior to performing clinical studies of MRI in the setting of implanted cardiac devices, our group and others performed extensive in vitro and in vivo laboratory and animal studies to understand the extent of these interactions.</para>
        <sect2 id="ch0024s0000s0002s0001">
          <title>Magnetic Field Interactions: Force and Torque</title>
    <para>Ferromagnetic materials in or near the MR system are exposed to a powerful static magnetic field involving induced force (i.e., translational attraction) and torque. Therefore, a common concern among practitioners is the potential for movement of device components relative to the scanner. However, current designs contain little or no ferromagnetic materials and, thus, are unlikely to experience force and torque (1). Although the amount of ferromagnetic materials in CIED pulse generators has substantially decreased over time and is relatively minor for modern-day systems, some ferromagnetic components remain vital to device function. The potential for movement of a pacemaker or ICD pulse generator in the MRI setting depends upon the field strength of the static magnetic field, ferromagnetic components of the device, how it is retained in place, in situ), and the distance from the MR system (2). The maximal force acting upon modern permanent pacemakers (manufactured after 1996) and ICDs (manufactured after 2000) appears to be less than 0.98-Newtons (equivalent to 100-grams) in association with a 1.5-Tesla MR scanner. The maximum torque in our studies was not found to be substantial and, thus, is unlikely to dislodge a chronically implanted device that is anchored to the surrounding tissue (3). These results are consistent with those of Luechinger, et al. (4) regarding modern pacemakers. However, Luechinger, et al. reported that some modern-day ICDs may still pose possible problems due to strong magnetic field interactions (4).</para>

        <sect2 id="ch0024s0000s0002s0002">
          <title>Current Induction</title>
    <para>Current may be induced within wires that are present in patients undergoing MRI examinations. Therefore, the radiofrequency (RF) and time-varying gradient magnetic fields of the MR system may induce electrical currents in leads in association with an MRI exam. However, this is a possibility only if the lead is part of a current loop that is completed through the body (i.e., the pulse generator must complete the current path). For cardiac pacemakers, this condition is only satisfied during specific time points within the pacing cycle. Present-day designs have been developed to overcome this issue. The ratio of lead length versus the RF wavelength and lead configurations, such as loops of a certain diameter, are strongly associated with the extent of current induction (5-7).</para>

          <title>658    Patients with Conventional (Non-MR Conditional) Cardiac Devices</title>
    <para>We assessed the magnitude of MRI-induced current using a current recorder connected in series to single chamber permanent pacemakers programmed to sub-threshold asynchronous output during unipolar and bipolar pacing (8). Under conventional implant conditions (i.e., without additional lead loops), the magnitude of induced current was less than 0.5-milliampere (mA). Current induction at greater than 30-mA resulting in myocardial capture was possible with the addition of more than four lead loops that substantially increased the total circuit area. However, the presence of so many lead loops is never observed in the clinical setting (8). Bassen and Mendoza (9) have also investigated the possibility of current induction in association with MRI and reported that unintended stimulation may occur in the setting of abandoned leads as well as leads connected to a pulse generator with loss of the hermetic seal at the connector. Additionally, Bassen and Mendoza (9) noted that pacemaker-dependent patients could receive altered pacing pulses during MRI examinations.</para>
          <sect3 id="ch0024s0000s0002s0003s0001">
            <title>MRI-Related Heating</title>
    <para>Another potential MRI-related interaction with CIEDs is the possibility of heating and tissue damage where the lead tip contacts tissue. Metallic devices and leads can act as antennae, thus, amplifying local RF energy power deposition (10-12). In our studies utilizing clinical MRI protocols with whole body averaged, specific absorption rates (SAR) &lt; 2.0 W/kg, temperature changes were limited to 1.0 °C in an in vitro model and to 0.2 °C in an in vivo model (3). However, it is important to note that due to poor correlation of heating profiles at different SARs associated with different pulse sequences across different scanner platforms, even for the same manufacturer, the reported SAR limits from one given study should not be directly applied to other MR systems. Fractured leads or lead loop configurations of a certain diameter may increase the potential for heating even further. The extent of heating also varies as a function of lead length and configuration, proximity to the edge of the gradient coils, proximity to the transmit RF coil, lead insulation thickness, lead design, and other factors (9-17).</para>

            <title>Electromagnetic Interference and Other Issues</title>
    <para>CIEDs may deliver unintended therapies or fail to provide necessary therapies in patients undergoing MRI. Cardiac pacemakers and ICDs have the potential to receive electromagnetic interference (EMI) during MRI, resulting in radiofrequency noise tracking, asynchronous pacing, inhibition of demand pacing, delivery of unintentional ICD therapies, programming changes, or loss of function. The static magnetic field of the MR system can also alter device function by inducing unexpected reed switch opening or closure. Additionally, temporary programming changes made to avoid device interaction with the scanner (such as disabling of tachycardia therapies) may lead to catastrophic results if a spontaneous arrhythmia occurs and is not recognized.</para>
    <para>We implanted modern ICD systems (manufactured after 2000) from the three major manufacturers in the United States (U.S.) in 18 dogs, and after four weeks, performed 3- to 4-hour MRI examinations under worst-case scenario conditions (i.e., imaging over the region containing the pulse generator and using whole body averaged SARs that were greater than 3.5-W/kg) (3). No device dysfunction occurred. After eight weeks of follow up, pacing thresholds and intracardiac electrocardiogram amplitudes were unchanged, with the exception of one animal that experienced transient (less than 12 hours) capture failure. Due to</para>
    <para>this observation, we initially did not perform MRI exams on pacemaker-dependent ICD patients. ICD leads are generally longer than pacemaker leads and, thus, may be more prone to possible heating at the lead tip. Pathological data of the scanned animals revealed very limited necrosis or fibrosis in the area around the tip of the lead, which was not different from controls that were not subjected to MRI (3). Similarly, Luechinger, et al. (17) found no clear evidence of heat-induced damage on histology despite observing lead parameter changes in their <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> model. Recently, we relaxed the restriction on scanning pacemaker-dependent, ICD patients at our institution because of our experience with non-clinical scanning parameters that were used that did not result in problems, the lack of any histologic changes that were due to any potential heating, and observing no changes in pacing parameters in hundreds of patients with ICDs that underwent clinical MRI exams.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Clinical Studies of Safety</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Implantable Cardiac Monitors and Loop Recorders</emphasis></para>
    <para>Implantable cardiac monitors and loop recorders have been evaluated for MRI-related issues. Gimbel, et al. (18) demonstrated the safety of MRI in the setting of implantable loop recorders in ten patients that underwent eleven examinations. No abnormalities were observed. Sensations of tugging or warmth at the implant site were not reported. We have also performed thoracic and non-thoracic MRI examinations on numerous implantable loop recorder recipients with similar findings of safety. Patients with implantable loop recorders can be safely scanned under specific conditions. However, the device may record MRI-related electromagnetic interference artifacts as an arrhythmia. Therefore, care should be taken to clear episodes recorded during MRI to prevent future misinterpretation of such artifacts as clinically significant arrhythmias. The Reveal implantable cardiac monitor (Medtronic, www.medtronic.com) was the first such device to receive MR Conditional labeling from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (19). Other similar devices from Medtronic as well as from other companies now have labeling stating that these systems are also MR Conditional (see the manufacturer's website or www.MRIsafety.com for specific information pertaining to MRI labeling for implantable cardiac monitors and loop recorders).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italics">Temporary Cardiac Pacemakers</emphasis></para>
    <para>Temporary cardiac pacemakers (implanted outside of the electrophysiology laboratory) have leads that are longer and are potentially more susceptible to induction of lead currents and heating. An <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> study of temporary transvenous pacing leads showed that lead-tip heating that exceeds 15° C is common and temperature rises up to 63.1° C are possible based on laboratory evidence (20). Additionally, the electronic platform of external temporary pacemakers is less sophisticated and has less filtering compared to modern permanent cardiac pacemakers. Therefore, such devices tend to be more susceptible to EMI during MRI procedures and, therefore, imaging of patients with temporary pacemakers is inadvisable. However, we have safely performed MRI in the setting of temporary cardiac pacing utilizing an active fixation, permanent lead, an externalized permanent pacemaker in contact with the patient's skin, and a non-conductive covering adhered to the patient's body with a pressure dressing.</para>

          <title>Permanent Cardiac Pacemakers</title>
    <para>Previous clinical MRI studies of permanent cardiac pacemakers are presented in Table 1. At our institution, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, we began the process of performing MRI on patients with permanent pacemakers based on findings from our <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> studies, which led to the development of a protocol including (a) device selection based on previous testing, (b) device programming to minimize inappropriate activation or inhibition of brady/tachyarrhythmia therapies, and (c) limitation of the whole body averaged SAR for the applied pulse sequences (less than 2.0-W/Kg) (21). The protocol is discussed in detail below. Using this protocol, we have now safely performed MRI on greater than 4,000 patients with implantable cardiac devices. Our latest report of safety included 880 patients with permanent cardiac pacemakers, 125 of whom were pacemaker-dependent (22). Pacing mode was changed to an asynchronous mode for pacemaker-dependent patients, and to demand mode for others. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry, and symptoms were monitored. The primary clinically significant event attributable to MRI was the occurrence of power-on-reset events in up to 1.5% of device recipients. Aside from transient episodes of asynchronous pacing induced by reed switch activation in certain pacemakers, no episodes of inappropriate inhibition or activation of pacing were observed. Statistically, both right ventricular and atrial sensing and right and left ventricular lead impedances were reduced immediately after MRI. At long-term follow-up, decreased right ventricular sensing, decreased right ventricular lead impedance, increased right ventricular capture threshold, and decreased battery voltage were noted. The observed changes did not require device revision or reprogramming and there were no significant differences between baseline and immediate or long-term sensing amplitudes, lead impedances, or pacing thresholds (22).</para>

          <title>Leadless Cardiac Pacemakers</title>
    <para>Leadless cardiac pacemakers received FDA approval in 2016, nearly 50 years after they were first conceived (23, 24). These devices carry great clinical utility, particularly for patients with a history of device infections as well as patients prone to thrombosis. In order to assess safety of cardiac MRI <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> following leadless pacemaker implantation, a single-center, prospective non-randomized study was performed on 15 patients undergoing either a 1.5 T or 3.0 T cardiac MRI exam. Patients were followed at one and three months after the scan was completed. The study did not demonstrate any statistically significant changes in adverse clinical events and device parameters remained stable at both follow-up intervals (24). Furthermore, parameter changes were not statistically significant between patients undergoing imaging at 1.5 T or 3.0 T (24).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Retained Pacing Leads</emphasis>Retained (capped and/or cut, and abandoned) leads are susceptible to the previously described risks of heating and current induction. Depending upon the lead length and configuration, retained segments may be prone to significantly higher temperature rises than those attached to pulse generators (14). We have performed at least 40 MRI examinations in the setting of absolute clinical necessity and retained cardiac lead segments. All of these studies were completed without safety issues. To further investigate the risks of cardiac MRI on patients with abandoned leads, Golestanirad, et al. (30) used electromagnetic simulations and bio-heat modeling utilizing numerical models of retained cardiac leads built using CT and X-ray images from six patients with retained cardiac leads. These simulations were performed considering the use of a transmit/receive RF body and transmit/receive head RF coils operating at 64 MHz and 128 MHz. Nine different imaging landmarks from the head to the lower limbs were studied. Their findings suggested that the amount of heating appeared to increase both with the field strength and frequency of the MR system (1.5 T/64 MHz versus 3.0 T/128 MHz) and with pulse sequence duration. However, all scans led to lead heating that did not exceed 6° C in all simulated models, which was considered to be clinically insignificant (30). Despite these interesting findings, clinical experience remains limited and, thus, additional investigations on this topic are warranted to accurately delineate the risks and benefits of using MRI in patients with abandoned pacing leads.</para>
    <para>In 2021, Schaller, et al. (63) investigated the effect of MRI in 139 patients with CIEDs who also had abandoned leads (total, 243 leads). The findings indicated that there were no abnormal vital signs or sustained tachyarrhythmias in this patient group. Furthermore, there were no changes in battery voltage, power-on reset events, or changes of pacing rate. One patient with an abandoned subcutaneous array experienced sternal heating that subsided on premature cessation of the study. The investigators concluded that the risk of performing MRI in patients with abandoned CIED leads was low in their large observational study, including patients who underwent examinations involving the thorax (63). Thus, the growing aggregate of data challenge the absolute contraindication for performing MRI in patients with abandoned CIED leads.</para>

        <title>Our Institutional Safety Protocol for MRI of Patients with CIEDs</title>
    <para>With regard to performing MRI examinations in patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs, the safety protocol followed at our institution is based on selection of device pulse generators previously tested under worst-case scenario (e.g., prolonged imaging over the region containing the device using whole body averaged SAR levels greater than 3.5-W/kg) MRI conditions (3). This protocol is summarized as a checklist in <emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>To perform MRI on patients with CIEDs, we recommend that patients with device pulse generators prone to EMI (generally devices manufactured prior to 2000) be excluded. Reports of safe MRI immediately post-implantation exist in the literature (31), and the risk for lead and/or pulse generator movement is considered to be extremely low or nonexistent. However, we recommend conservative measures to exclude patients with leads that are susceptible to spontaneous (regardless of MRI) dislodgement or that do not have chronic stable lead parameters that would allow careful measurement of safety. Therefore, we advise avoiding MRI in patients with less than six weeks of time since the devices were implanted and those with acute parameter changes suggestive of lead malfunctions. In our experience, however, patients with mature active and passive fixation endocardial (and coronary sinus) leads of any diameter can safely undergo MRI exams. We recommend avoiding MRI when</para>

    <para>device leads are present that are prone to heating, such as non-transvenous, epicardial and abandoned (capped) leads. We do, however, relax these restrictions if there is a compelling clinical need for the MRI exam, but require a higher level of monitoring. To reduce the risk of inappropriate inhibition of pacing due to detection of radiofrequency pulses, we program devices to an asynchronous, dedicated pacing mode in pacemaker-dependent patients.</para>
    <para>To avoid inappropriate activation of pacing due to tracking of radiofrequency pulses, we suggest device programming in patients without pacemaker dependence to a non-tracking ventricular or dual chamber inhibited pacing mode. We also recommend deactivation of rate response, premature ventricular contraction response, ventricular sense response, and conducted atrial fibrillation response to ensure that sensing of vibrations or radiofrequency pulses does not lead to unwarranted pacing.</para>
    <para>Although asynchronous pacing for short time periods is typically well tolerated, we prefer to reduce the already minimal chance of inducing arrhythmia or causing atrioventricular (AV) dyssynchrony by minimizing asynchronous pacing in patients without pacemaker dependence through deactivation of the magnet mode when possible. We typically deactivate tachyarrhythmia monitoring to avoid battery drainage that results from recording of multiple MRI-related, radiofrequency pulse sequences as arrhythmic episodes. Reed switch activation in ICD systems disables tachyarrhythmia therapies. However, reed switch function in the periphery of the scanner versus the bore of the MR system is unpredictable (21, 32, 33). Therefore, therapies should be disabled to avoid unwarranted anti-tachycardia pacing or shocks. Finally, blood pressure, ECG, pulse oximetry, and symptoms should be monitored in the patient for the duration of the MRI exam. We also favor the presence of a radiologist and cardiac electrophysiologist, or advanced cardiac life support (ACLS)-trained individual familiar with device programming and troubleshooting during all MRI examinations (21, 25, 34). At the end of the MRI procedure, all device parameters should be checked and programming should be restored to pre-MRI settings.</para>

        <title>MRI-Related Susceptibility Artifacts in the Setting of Cardiac Pacemakers and ICD Systems</title>
    <para>The quality of the MR image is not affected when the pacemaker or ICD is located outside the field of view or the area of interest. However, when performing thoracic imaging, the presence of a pacemaker or ICD can cause variations in the surrounding (i.e., local) magnetic field and other issues that result in issues including signal voids, bright areas, image distortion, or poor fat suppression. Typically, the artifacts associated with pacing and ICD leads are minimal in size. However, pulse generator-related artifacts, particularly with ICD systems, can be substantial (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>) (35, 36). Such artifacts tend to be most pronounced on partial flip angle pulse sequences as well as others (e.g., inversion recovery and steady state sequences). Greater than 50% of cardiac sectors (primarily antero-apical segments) can be affected by pulse generator-related susceptibility artifacts in patients with left-sided ICD systems (37). Artifacts on inversion recovery images show high signal intensity and can mimic areas of delayed-enhancement, which would otherwise indicate myocardial scar. Correlation of artifact-related bright areas on different pulse sequences can help avoid misidentification of the artifact as pathology. Artifacts related to metal can be considerably reduced by using wideband pulse sequences (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 2</emphasis>) (35-37), even in pa-</para>

In addition, selecting imaging planes perpendicular to the plane of the device's pulse generator, shortening the echo time, and using spin echo and fast spin echo pulse sequences reduces the qualitative extent of the artifact (Figure 3).

However, there was no evidence of an association between MRI parameters that characterize patient exposure to radiofrequency energy and changes in device and lead parameters immediately after MRI.

        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <para>MRI is the preferred imaging modality in many clinical scenarios. The decision to perform an MRI exam on a patient with a legacy cardiac pacemaker or ICD system is frequently made by considering the probable benefit of MRI relative to the potential risks. Therefore, it is important to conduct a systematic review of the patient's condition as well as the specific cardiac device that is present prior to proceeding with MRI. Notably, peer-reviewed literature involving patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs continue to support the safe use of MRI (64, 65). As such, besides staying apprised of recently published information, the reader is encouraged to consult other resources such as the American Heart Association Scientific Statement (40), the practice guidelines from the American College of Radiology (66) and the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (67), and websites (e.g., www.MRIsafety.com and CIED manufacturers' websites) that provide specific information regarding individual devices. Although there is a growing body of literature on safety of MRI for patients with CIEDs, it is critical that there is real-time monitoring of all patients undergoing MRI with CIEDs because the possibility of an adverse event, while very small, is still present.</para>
