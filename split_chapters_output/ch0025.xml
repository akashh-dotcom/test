        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>The rapid technologic evolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to a broad spectrum of medical applications (1). In parallel, cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) technologies have been developed for arrhythmia diagnosis as well as treatment of bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, heart failure, and other conditions (2). The implementation of these two technologies has reached a crossroads, as increasingly, patients with CIEDs may require MRI exams, but are limited in performance by the presence of the cardiac device (3). The assessment of the potential interactions between CIEDs and the MRI</para>

    <para>environment are important to the current and future designs of CIEDs in order to increase accessibility to MRI technology. Because there are now non-MR Conditional as well as MR Conditional CIEDs, the decisions and management of patients with these devices depend on the specific system that is present.</para>

        <title>NON-MR CONDITIONAL CIEDS</title>
    <para>The study of MRI and CIED interactions stems from known theoretical physics concerns related to the ferromagnetic content of cardiac devices, the effects of time-varying, gradient magnetic fields, and the impact of radiofrequency (RF) energy on the structure and function of CIEDs. In the era prior to the development of MR Conditional CIEDs, these MRI-related issues were studied through multiple means including: <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> assessments, <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> animal models, case reports, small retrospective series of patients inadvertently or intentionally exposed to the MRI environment, and prospective series of patients intentionally exposed to MRI procedures under specified conditions. Each of these lines of research provided data regarding MRI and CIED interactions but had inherent limitations. <emphasis role="italics">In vitro</emphasis> studies permit an assessment of the physics of MRI and CIED interactions but are limited because phantoms do not adequately reproduce the three-dimensional anatomy or physiology of the patient or <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> device function. Animal models also have limited applicability to human subjects. Rare case reports of inadvertently scanned CIED patients with associated mortality lacked complete information on the patients, specific circumstances of the studies and, importantly, the fact that physiologic monitoring was not used (1-3). Notably, retrospective studies of patients with preexisting CIEDs do not serve as a true surrogate for properly performed MRI safety investigations.</para>
    <para>Data from the pre-MR Conditional cardiac device era demonstrated that a small number of adverse events of variable clinical significance occurred in patients with CIEDs who underwent MRI (<emphasis role="bold">Table 1</emphasis>). In regard to permanent cardiac pacemakers, case series and prospective studies of patients intentionally exposed to MRI exams under specified conditions demonstrated various findings including: heating or discomfort at the implantable pulse generator (IPG) site (4), elevated cardiac biomarkers (5), MRI-related ectopy (4, 6-8), short pauses (9), asystole (10), pulse generator changed to the asynchronous mode due to activation of the reed switch (11), decreased battery voltage with subsequent recovery (12), clinically unimportant changes in sensing, pacing capture threshold, battery voltage, and lead impedance which did not require an increase in pacing output (13-20), significant change in the pacing threshold requiring an increase in programmed output (21), transient change to the elective replacement indicator (ERI) (22), ventricular lead impedance rise necessitating lead replacement (23), temporary, sensing errors and safety signal generation (24), pacing at maximum voltage at a fixed rate of 100-beats/minute (25), rapid pacing (26), communication failure (24, 27), power-on reset (4, 6, 17, 27-31), elective replacement indices reached after scanning (27), and other issues.</para>
    <para>With respect to implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), reports of patients inadvertently subjected to MRI have shown inappropriate sensing, battery voltage transient or sustained change to End-of-Life (EOL) (32), inability to communicate with the device (33), noise detected as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, with no therapy presumably due to magnetic mode activation and asynchronous pacing as a result of a change</para>

Case series and prospective study of patients intentionally exposed to the MRI examinations under specified conditions have demonstrated various findings including: MRI-related ectopy (7, 8), sensing errors (24), decreases in battery voltage, pacing threshold increases, changes in pacing and high-voltage lead impedance changes that were statistically significant but clinically unimportant (17, 18, 30, 31, 36), transient anomalous battery life indication (28), inability to communicate with a devices (30, 37) and power-on reset (17, 28, 29, 31, 38-40). In addition to issues related to performing MRI in patients with ICDs, investigators have raised the issue as to whether non-MR Conditional ICD defibrillation threshold testing should be performed after exposure to an MRI exam (41). This important matter warrants further study.</para>
    <para>Prospective studies and registries have also been performed to assess for adverse effects associated with MRI in patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs. In a large prospective study using MRI in patients with CIEDs, a total of 438 patients with cardiac devices (54% pacemakers and 46% ICDs) were enrolled between 2003 and 2010 (17). Of these patients, 53 (12%) had biventricular pacing systems. Patients with new devices (less than six weeks), abandoned or epicardial leads, and pacemaker-dependent ICD patients were excluded from the study. In addition, pacemaker-dependent, ICD patients were excluded. Of a total of 555 MRI examinations performed at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz, 18% of the scans were thoracic and 82% were non-thoracic. Although changes in right ventricular sensing, lead impedances, increased capture threshold and decreased battery voltage were noted at the six month follow</para>

    <para>up interval, the observed changes did not require device revision or reprogramming. In three (1.5%) of the patients, transient reversions to back-up programming mode were noted (i.e., power-on reset) without long-term sequelae.</para>
    <para>The MagnaSafe Registry was a prospective multicenter site registry of patients with non-MR Conditional pacemakers and ICDs that underwent clinically indicated, 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz non-thoracic scanning under specified conditions (30). Data was collected before, immediately after, and at 6 months following 1,000 MRI exams in patients with cardiac pacemakers (n=818) and 500 MRI exams in patients with ICDs (n=428) between April 2009 and April 2014. The results demonstrated no deaths, lead failures, or capture losses during non-thoracic MRI examinations. There were six cases of self-terminating atrial fibrillation or flutter, as well as six cases of partial electrical reset. There were no cases of full electrical reset. Of the pacemaker patients, 28% of the registry patients were pacemaker-dependent. Pacemaker-dependent ICD cases were excluded from the study. One ICD required replacement after it could not be interrogated following the MRI exam, however, this device had not been reprogrammed according to the study protocol beforehand. Sub-analysis suggested performing subsequent MRI exams for patients with implanted cardiac devices did not increase the risks of clinical events compared to patients who underwent a single scan.</para>
    <para>A large prospective study reported safety data on 2,103 MRI exams (multiple 1,509 patients included 880 patients with cardiac pacemakers, 466 with ICDs, and 163 with cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, CRT-D, devices studied at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz at various anatomical positions) (31). Of this cohort, nine studies resulted in transient reset to a backup mode (seven pacemaker and one ICD). In one MRI exam, a pacemaker with less than one month left of battery life reset to ventricular inhibited pacing and could not be reprogrammed.</para>
    <para>Non-significant, acute decrease in P-wave amplitude was present in 1% of cases. In the 63% of cases in which long-term data were available, decreased P-wave amplitude was present in 4% of patients, increased in right ventricular capture threshold in 4% of patients and increased left ventricular capture threshold in 3% of patients. These changes were not clinically significant and did not necessitate cardiac device reprogramming or revision. Of note is that there were no long-term clinically significant adverse events reported.</para>
    <para>Meta-analysis of data related to performance of MRI in patients with non-MR Conditional devices has also been reported. The largest meta-analysis to date reviewed data from 5,099 patients with non-MR Conditional devices that underwent 5,908 scans between 1990-2017 (40). Of this group, 551 patients were pacemaker-dependent. There were no reported patient deaths and three lead failures. There were no clinically relevant changes in lead, battery, or pulse generator performance.</para>
    <para>The evolving medical literature has led to an expert consensus statement from the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) developed in collaboration with and endorsed by other multidisciplinary societies for the strategy to using MRI in patients with non-MR Conditional CIEDs (42).

        <title>MR CONDITIONAL CIEDS</title>
    <para>The initial body of data related to use of MRI in patients with CIEDs raised questions such as (1) whether patients with important clinical issues to be resolved and no other adequate imaging options had absolute contraindications to MRI, (2) whether scanning had been performed based on the risk:benefit ratio, or (3) would this require the engineering of cardiac devices with MR Conditional labeling status (45-56). The limitations inherent in investigating and scanning patients with previous era devices led to the development of CIEDs designed for the MRI setting under highly specified conditions. Notably, a variety of MR Conditional CIEDs from several different manufacturers (i.e., Abbott/St. Jude Medical, Biotronik, Boston Scientific, LivaNova/Sorin, and Medtronic) have been released for use in the clinical setting. Each commercially available device has specified device and programming requirements as well as MRI parameters and conditions defined in the labeling, approved by the specific regulatory agency of the country where the device has been clinically released.</para>
    <para>An expert consensus statement from the Heart Rhythm Society has been developed in collaboration with and endorsed by other multidisciplinary societies with recommendations and protocols for the management of patients with MR Conditional CIEDs undergoing MRI (42). The document states: "MR Conditional devices should be considered MR Conditional only when the product labeling is adhered to, which includes programming the appropriate "MR mode" and scanning with the prerequisites specified for the device" (Recommendation: Class I, Level of Evidence: A) (42).

    <para>The precise use of nomenclature is extremely important to understanding and implementing technologies as it pertains to specific patient and scanning conditions in the MRI environment (57). The American Society for Testing Materials (ATSM) International designates implants and devices as being MR Safe, MR Conditional, or MR Unsafe (58). An MR Safe designated device would require nonmetallic, non-conducting materials and systems with no known hazards in all MRI environments. Thus, the engineering of an MR Safe designated pacemaker or ICD is not feasible. An MR Conditional designated device refers to an item that has been demonstrated to pose no known hazard in a specified MRI environment under defined conditions of use. These defined conditions may include the strength of the static magnetic field, spatial gradient magnetic field, time-varying, magnetic fields, RF fields (i.e., the specific absorption rate, SAR), and other factors. CIEDs designated as MR Conditional must be used in a specified MRI environment under defined programming parameters and with close attention to the patient specific clinical factors, such as the presence of abandoned or fractured leads. MR Conditional designs have sought to take into account both the theoretical and investigational concerns related to CIEDs and to create technological designs to minimize the possibility for interactions when implanted in patients undergoing MRI exams. Notably, the design and engineering of devices extends to all components including the implantable pulse generator, leads, and, programming software.</para>

        <title>ELECTROMAGNETIC-RELATED ISSUES</title>
    <para>Because MRI involves the use of static, gradient, and RF electromagnetic fields, these elements must be carefully considered because they can lead to substantial MRI/CIED interactions. Physical forces acting on ferromagnetic objects due to static and gradient magnetic fields can cause movement and/or vibration of these objects. Factors affecting these forces include the quantity and shape of the ferromagnetic content, proximity to the MR system's magnet, and the strength of the static magnetic field (59). Studies of non-MR Conditional and MR Conditional pacemakers at 1.5-Tesla/64-MHz have not demonstrated significant clinical effects (60-62). Conduction of electromagnetic energy through the cardiac device can occur due to the time-varying, gradient magnetic fields and/or the pulsed RF energy, leading to heating or interference with sensing or pacing. This potential energy transfer is dependent on factors including: the features of the time-varying, gradient magnetic fields (e.g., the slew rate, etc.), the type of RF pulse used in the MRI sequences, the whole body averaged and local SARs, the spatial relationship and orientation of the CIED relative to the transmit RF coil, the composition, length, geometry, configuration and orientation of the lead(s), and other factorss (63-73).</para>

    <para>The reduction of ferromagnetic content of the pacemaker's or ICD's implantable pulse generator (IPG) can reduce magnetic field interactions.

The IPG's reed switch is susceptible to magnetic fields because this component allows the use of an external magnet to program continuous</para>
    <para>asynchronous pacing while in contact with the patient's skin overlying the IPG in order to avoid electromagnetic interactions with the use of electrocautery during surgical procedures (74). When present in the MR system, reed switch activity may be unpredictable, potentially varying with the orientation between the reed switch and direction of the magnetic field, as well as with the strength of the static magnetic field (3, 61, 75-77). One option is to replace the reed switch with a solid state, Hall sensor, which possesses a more predictable function in the presence of magnetic fields. Other design changes have been formulated such as a magnetic field detection sensor that prevents reed switch-related issues (78). Additional IPG design features include generator shielding and circuitry filters to inhibit or divert transference of particular electromagnetic frequencies. Importantly, IPGs used for ICDs tend to be larger and more complex than those used for cardiac pacemakers. The also have a greater ferromagnetic content, circuitry hardware related to arrhythmia detection and treatment, and capacitors for cardioversion and defibrillation (79-81). Therefore, MRI issues related to ICDs versus cardiac pacemakers tend to be more problematic. Device settings for an "MRI-mode" include pre-scan checklists, programming of pacing mode, disabling sensed activity, and inactivating tachycardia therapies during an MRI exam (42).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">CIED LEADS</emphasis>Pacemaker and ICD leads are composed of non-magnetic materials (e.g., platinum and iridium). With regard to MRI issues, leads may serve as antennas conducting electromagnetic energy impulses (26, 82). The effects of this energy transfer could potentially include pain, myocardial stimulation, heating with myocardial necrosis at the lead tip, and damage to the IPG. Adverse effects potentially include inappropriate sensing, increases in pacing threshold, and lead impedance changes. These factors could lead to inappropriate pacing function with associated bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias, as well as battery depletion (3, 7, 12, 14-16, 21, 22, 24-26, 83-89). These effects can be due to the transference of MRI-related electromagnetic energies at the resonant frequency of the lead. Importantly, a resonant lead length can be associated with a greater heating effect (90). Therefore, a focus of lead design and engineering is to avoid the resonant frequencies of the electromagnetic sources associated with MR systems through consideration of factors such a lead length, configuration, and morphology. In regard to heating, lead length, lead coiling, and the position of the lead in relation to the transmit RF coil can affect MRI-related heating (65, 69, 91, 92).</para>
    <para>In a large prospective study assessing the relationship between SAR and non-MR Conditional CIED function, a longer right ventricular lead length was association with decreased right ventricular sensing and capture threshold immediately after MRI (93). Lead wire coiling in a three-dimensional orientation is an important factor in transference or avoidance of the resonant frequency of electromagnetic energy (94). Decreasing the number of coiled filars, increasing the diameter of the filars and subsequent increases in the winding turns of the coils has resulted in a three-dimensional morphology for the lead that limits the conduction of MRI relevant frequencies in one design, while maintaining the strength of the lead (95). Furthermore, the use of a lead tip coating has decreased polarization. Because unipolar pacing is more susceptible to the environmental electromagnetic noise including that associated with the MR system, a bipolar lead configuration is also important in lead</para>

    <para>The presence of abandoned leads can lead to conduction of electromagnetic energy and, therefore, may pose hazards when scanning a patient with an MR Conditional cardiac device. <emphasis role="italics">In vitro</emphasis> studies have suggested that abandoned pacemaker leads (40 to 60 cm lengths) experienced greater lead tip heating compared to attached leads (97). Small, predominantly retrospective studies in patients with abandoned leads have not demonstrated adverse effects (Table 2) (98-101). Considering the differences between <emphasis role="italics">in vitro</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">in vivo</emphasis> data, there is now controversy regarding how to proceed with MRI scans in patients with abandoned pacing leads. Retained epicardial wires cut short at the skin level from previous cardiothoracic surgical procedures have not been associated with substantial issues during MRI (102, 103). Furthermore, a study of MRI in orthotopic heart transplant recipients with retained CIED fragments was not associated with adverse events (104).</para>

        <title>DEVICE PROGRAMMING</title>
    <para>The design of an MR Conditional device requires clearly demarcated MR Conditional programming modes for the time period when the patient undergoes MR imaging (42). If MRI is performed in patients with non-MR Conditional devices, specific decisions for programming must also be made (42). Programming of pacing in a sensing mode can lead to inappropriate inhibition of pacing due to lead noise caused by electromagnetic interference due to operation of the MR system (<emphasis role="bold">Figure 1</emphasis>). Programming decisions require knowledge of the patients underlying sinus rate, atrial-ventricular (AV) nodal conduction, ventricular rate and presence rate, and location of escape rhythms (<emphasis role="bold">Figures 2 and 3</emphasis>). These programming modes inactivate sensing and, therefore, the pacing function is either inactivated in a patient with a stable non-bradycardic rhythm or set to an asynchronous pacing mode in a pacemaker-dependent patient. Each mode possesses its own potential limitations. A patient</para>

If a patient programmed to asynchronous pacing mode has a ventricular rate competing with asynchronous pacing, paced beats could occur during the vulnerable period of ventricular repolarization (i.e., the R-on-T phenomenon), potentially triggering ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (3, 105, 106). In regard to ICDs, the same pacing function issues apply. In addition, antitachycardia therapies need to be inactivated during MRI. It remains unclear if ICD capacitors can properly charge in the MRI environment (107).</para>
    <para>Older MR Conditional systems with nearly depleted batteries may result in unintended parameter changes during MRI. In a series of 442 patients, nine patients underwent 13 scans with devices at or near elective replacement indicator (ERI) (27). Two of these scans resulted in power-on reset events. One device programmed to asynchronous A and V pacing (DOO) converted to ERI during the scan and automatically reprogrammed to V only antibradycardia pacing (VVI) mode without any significant consequence. Another device close to ERI experienced an unintended mode change from DOO to VVI without any patient harm. Both devices were implanted before 2005. At the present time, most patients undergoing MRI will likely have newer generations of MR Conditional systems, which are less likely to have power-on reset events. However, caution and close monitoring with electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximetry are recommended for patients that undergo MRI with devices close to ERI.</para>
    <para>Considering the possibilities of bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias while the patient is in an MR Conditional mode or programmed for scanning for non-MR Conditional CIEDs, continuous monitoring of the patient's heart rate and rhythm as well as the ability to respond to an arrhythmia is required while the patient is programmed in the appropriate mode (42). Because artifacts related to the scanning can make electrocardiograms particularly challenging to interpret, the use of pulse oximetry is a necessity. Because the CIED programmer</para>
