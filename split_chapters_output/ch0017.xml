          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>Conventional physiological monitoring equipment and patient support devices were not originally designed to be utilized in the harsh magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment where static, time-varying gradient, and radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields can adversely impact (e.g., as a result of missile effects), affect, or alter the operation or use of these devices (1). Fortunately, various monitors and other patient support devices have been specially modified or specifically developed to be utilized safely in the MRI setting (1-32). Thus, commercially available MR Conditional monitors and other devices (note, certain devices are MR Safe if made from nonconducting, non-metallic materials) are readily available and can be used routinely for patients in the MRI environment (1-32).</para>
    <para>MRI healthcare professionals must carefully consider the ethical and medicolegal ramifications of providing proper patient care that includes identifying patients who require monitoring in the MRI setting and following a protocol that ensures their safety by using appropriate equipment, devices, and accessories (1, 33-43). The early detection and immediate treatment of complications that may occur in high-risk, critically ill, or anesthetized patients undergoing MRI can prevent relatively minor problems from becoming life-threatening situations.</para>
