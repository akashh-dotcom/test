      </para>
      <para>The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology must deliver a practical level of protection for patients and staff by avoiding harm and balancing all risks against the benefits of the examination. While the technology and the potential hazards of the MRI environment are essentially common to the practice of MRI globally, there are jurisdictional and regional differences that impact local differences in practice. These stem from variations in regulatory structures, professional standards and education for radiologists and radiographers, levels of participation in international professional and scientific communities, the implants and devices found in the respective marketplace, legal structures, and local public expectations regarding medical risks. This chapter describes and reviews the relevant documented material underpinning the patterns of clinical MRI safety practices in Australia.</para>

      </para>
      <para>Australia is an island nation covering an area of land similar to that of the continental United States (U.S.) but with a population of approximately 25.4 million people. The population is predominately urban and residing mainly on the east coast. There are also population clusters in the middle of the southern coast (2 million), at the southern and northern extent of the west coast (4 million), as well as a small population center on the northern coast, and on a large island state (Tasmania). Capital cities and regional centers are well serviced by MRI facilities that operate within a modern western healthcare system. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that, in 2011, Australia had 14.1 MR systems per million people (377 scanners) performing approximately 1.2 million examinations per year (1).</para>
      <sect2 id="ch0001s01s01s01">
        <title>MRI Safety Standards and Guidelines in Australia</title>
        <para>The exact size of the Australian MRI installed base is difficult to determine because reporting is influenced by funding arrangements. An Australian Government 2019 report confirmed the OECD figures by listing 356 fully and partially funded scanners (2). Industry groups estimate that there are an additional 250 MR scanners providing medical examinations outside of the Australian universal health funding arrangements. By comparison, the OECD country average is 12.5 MR systems per million people, while the U.S. is equipped with approximately 39 scanners per million individuals (1).</para>
        <para>The majority of the installed scanners are less than 10 years old, generally operating with high-performance gradient systems, comprehensive phased-array radiofrequency (RF) coils, and advanced applications software. Medicare does not fund services performed on MR systems more than 20 years old. Most MRI examinations are performed for clinical indications in hospitals or stand-alone radiology practices using MR systems operating at 1.5-Tesla, but about 40% of scanners operate at 3-Tesla, a substantial increase in proportion since 2012. There are only a few lower field strength and/or vertical-field scanners, none of which are covered by the federal funding arrangements in Australia. There are three clinical and one research driven custom designed MR guided linear accelerators (MR-LINAC) operational, with more installations planned in the future by a private provider. Several clinical centers and research facilities operate human positron emission tomography (PET) MR systems and several have intra-operative MR scanners. Two research centers operate 7-Tesla, whole-body MR systems equipped with high order, parallel transmit RF systems, neither currently provides clinical imaging services.</para>
        <sect3 id="ch0001s01s01s01s01">
          <title>MRI Funding</title>
          <para>Australia operates a "fee for service" healthcare model supported by a universal health insurance system called Medicare. The Australian Federal Department of Health, through Medicare, is the major source of all medical service funding, including MRI examinations performed in public and privately owned facilities. Under the Commonwealth Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) scheme, a fixed fee is paid for a defined range of MRI procedures, carried out by specifically licensed sites, for specified clinical indications. Virtually all of the 345 Medicare funded sites also perform variable numbers of MRI examinations for indications that are not eligible for Medicare payments. Some of those examinations are billed to the patient while others are performed at no charge, depending on local contractual and commercial factors. Currently the MBS fees for MRI examinations are between $201.00 and $1,440.00 Australian dollars, with small additional rebates paid for the use of MR spectroscopy, contrast media, sedation, and general anesthesia support during MRI (3). Many private MRI facilities charge the patient more than the MBS fee and require so-called "gap" payments from the patient. Gap payments are not covered by any private insurance systems in Australia. At many sites, the terms of their Medicare contract prohibits gap billing. MRI exams certain motor vehicle, workers compensation or veterans affairs funded claims fall outside of the Medicare MBS arrangements, but there are similar administrative and legal limitations on examination fees charged for these situations and they generally approximate the MBS fees and typically do not involve gap payments by the patient.</para>

      <sect2 id="ch0001s01s01s02">
        <title>MRI Facility Ownership</title>
        <para>Clinical MRI facilities are almost exclusively operated within radiology departments and practices. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) has established accreditation of Radiologists performing MRI and operates the Quality Assurance Accreditation program. Each of these elements will be explored in detail later in this chapter. Independent cardiologist-owned MR systems are rare in Australia, although many sites offer time for cardiology-directed examinations on scanners owned by radiology practices. Thus, cardiologists may be the responsible healthcare group for MRI facility and patient safety at certain times. Radiation Therapy providers operate a growing number of MR simulator systems external to Radiology providers. The current numbers are unknown. A small number of commercial veterinary scanners are also operated by the private sector. Arrangements at human research centers associated with universities fall outside clinical arrangements. These particular scanners maybe operated by graduate or undergraduate students with limited training, in conjunction with specialist support staff, such as radiographers. Universities generally follow the recommendations for operating their MRI facilities developed by the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) (4).</para>

      <sect2 id="ch0001s01s01s03">
        <title>MRI Staffing and Radiographer Training</title>
        <para>In Australia, radiographers are the most engaged healthcare professionals on matters of MRI safety. While there is currently no Australian legal requirement for MRI services to be provided by specifically qualified staff, the majority of clinical MRI exams are performed by radiographers who are nationally registered as Medical Radiation Practitioners (MRP) under a board, the Medical Radiation Practice Board of Australia (MRPBA), and the Australian Health Practitioner Registration Agency (AHPRA) authorized by the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act (2009) (5). The educational requirements for registration are determined by an independent accreditation committee. The original 2013 MRPBA professional capabilities intentionally omitted professional capabilities for ultrasound (US) and MRI (6). In 2019, the MRPBA acknowledged that basic registrants could not be assumed to have the understanding to deliver safe and competent MRI services without the supervision of an undefined "more experienced practitioner" (7).</para>
        <para>New professional capabilities came into effect in 2020 with specific capabilities indicated for ultrasound and MRI (7). Entry-level registrants will need to understand how MRI is employed in clinical situations for diagnosis and radiation therapy planning (7), but are not expected to deliver MRI (or ultrasound, for that matter) services. Practitioners who provide MRI services must demonstrate certain additional capabilities. These include requiring the radiographer to operate the MR system safely by applying knowledge of the principles, equipment, and the clients that they manage during MRI exams. Safety considerations specifically include those associated with contrast agents and other pharmaceuticals used in procedures, site management and the integrity of safety "zones" (i.e., as specified by the American College of Radiology), minimizing MRI-related heating as well as peripheral nerve stimulation, and actively managing risks related to acoustic noise and implant interactions (7). These aforementioned topics form the minimum capabilities the public can expect from any registered Medical Radiation Practitioner who is providing MRI services.</para>
        <para>976    MRI Safety Standards and Guidelines in Australia</para>
        <para>To date, the MRPBA Accreditation Committee, which provides the board with advice on educational programs deemed sufficient to develop the required professional capabilities, has not described or endorsed educational requirements for practitioners performing MRI. In the Australian implementation, this may not occur because, unlike the arrangements in New Zealand, providing MRI services does not require a specific class of registration. The obligation to perform competently arises when the practitioner includes MRI in their activities. A challenge to the competence of a practitioner may only occur following a complaint to the MRPBA by a patient or other individual. Considering the lack of previous enforceable standards in MRI capabilities and the range of practices that may have developed expediently, the capabilities of individual practitioners around MRI safety may come under scrutiny from mandatory notifications to the MRPBA or the Medical Board under the AHPRA system. Registrants are obliged to notify the Board when they believe the public is placed at risk where the practice is a significant departure from accepted professional standards (i.e., section 140(d) of the National Law) (8).</para>
        <para>The degree courses for Medical Radiation Practitioner registration teach MRI principles, safety, and clinical applications at an introductory level, which is obviously insufficient for independently practicing MRI. Therefore, to achieve appropriate MRI competency, radiographers undertake site-based "on the job" training, the basic Australian Society for Medical Imaging &amp; Radiation Therapy (ASMIRT) Level 1 accreditation, or pursue post-graduate education. Unlike graduate level radiography courses, the site and post-graduate training curricula are not standardized or specified by the registration authority. The adequacy of a practitioner's safety skills and competency may initially be decided administratively by the MRI practice following a complaint or incident as the practitioner and carries the responsibility to show competence relative to the new professional capabilities statement.</para>
        <para>At least three Australian universities offer post-graduate courses in MRI technology and clinical practice. The courses are self-funded and students may exit with a post-graduate diploma, up to a Master's degree level. MRI safety is typically addressed in the first year of study along with physics and imaging principles.</para>
        <para>The national radiographic professional body, the Australian Society for Medical Imaging &amp; Radiation Therapy was formerly known as the Australian Institute of Radiography (A.I.R.). ASMIRT operates a two-level MRI certification program amongst a range of modality specific accreditations. Currently, the certification is only open to diagnostic and therapy radiographers at this time and does not specifically offer certification of professional capabilities required by the new document (7).</para>
        <para>Level 1 MRI certification is achieved by passing an online exam and the completion of three hundred MRI examinations in a twelve-month period. Certification is maintained by performing nine hundred MRI examinations in a three-year period. ASMIRT Level 2 MRI certification, intended for MRI supervisors, is granted on presentation of a portfolio of professional development activities and this certification is maintained with continuing evidence of professional activities and a larger number of clinical examinations that must be performed. Details of the program and fees are available at the ASMIRT website and in a recently revised MRI certification manual (9).</para>
        <sect3 id="ch0001s01s01s03s01">
          <title>MRI Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management    977</title>
          <para>The MRI safety module of the Level 1 accreditation curriculum requires knowledge of MRI bioeffects and the potential hazards associated with the static, time-varying, and radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields. In combination with general patient care topics, it accounts for 15% of the examination's content and score. However, this is not to say that knowledge of MRI safety topics is examined in depth by the Level 1 certification process. Issues of motion through the static magnetic field, the spatial gradient magnetic field and interactions between medical implants and the scanner are not included. Many experienced MRI radiographers recognize that the ASMIRT Level 1 accreditation represents a relatively low standard of knowledge. Not surprisingly, the ASMIRT currently recommends that radiographers undertaking MRI should undergo further education and certification. Their certification is also supported by the national radiology professional guidelines (10).</para>
          <para>As previously mentioned, Australian MRI radiographers tend to take the lead role in understanding MRI technology, pulse sequences, and imaging principles as well as the comprehensive issues of MRI safety. To a degree, radiographers have attempted to informally fill the gap left by less involved radiologists. A potential pitfall to this is that staff members may be functioning clinically above their knowledge base and beyond their delegated professional roles, resulting in possible risks to themselves and patients.</para>
          <para>There is a high level of membership in the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine's (ISMRM) and the Society for MR Radiographers and Technologists (SMRT) amongst Australian radiographers performing MRI. The International and Australia &amp; New Zealand (ANZ) chapter of the SMRT provides a continuing stream of high quality MRI safety educational programs through annual national and international meetings, and via online educational materials. This provides a core of several hundred highly aware radiographers operating in connection with international sources, although industry mechanisms and practice do not presently appear to value the resource these members represent. Of note is that very few Australian clinical MRI facilities employ medical physicists. The Australian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM) commenced a program of lectures, practical assignments and examination in 2020 to offer professional body certification to the role of an MR Safety Expert. First completions are expected in mid to late 2021.</para>

        <title>MRI SAFETY PRACTICES IN AUSTRALIA</title>
        <para>Australia has few absolute requirements regarding MRI safety practices. The legal and clinical responsibilities to keep public, staff, patients and other individuals free from harm are supported by equipment and device standards, professional and regulatory body guidelines, and publications from government departments and authorities. This section will explain and review the key documents applicable to MRI safety.</para>

          <title>Australian Standards for MRI Equipment and Patient Exposure</title>
          <para>The Australia/Standards New Zealand (AS/NZS) document, AS/NZS 3200.2.3.2005 (11) is essentially equivalent to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) document, IEC 60601-2-33. Australian MR systems have therefore been programmed to observe the global limits for the static magnetic field strength, RF, specific absorption rate</para>
          <para>978    MRI Safety Standards and Guidelines in Australia</para>
          <para>(SAR), and time-varying, magnetic field limits (TVMF) related to patient exposures rather than old FDA requirements that were replaced by IEC limits in 2014 (12).</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Key MRI Safety Points From AS/NZS 3200.2.33:2005.</emphasis> The IEC model of three-tiered operating modes for the MR system is employed in Australian standards and in clinical practice. The standards specify thresholds for the static magnetic field strength, RF power deposition, and time-varying magnetic fields at each operating mode (Table 1). In the Normal Operating Mode, none of the scanner outputs may cause physiological stress to patients. In the First Level Controlled Operating Mode, one or more of the scanner outputs are at values that may cause physiological stress to patients. Before employing the First Level Controlled Operating Mode, a decision must be made on medical grounds to confirm that the patient can handle the increased exposure level. Medical supervision is required to control any physiological stress caused by the scanner. The standards require scanners operate in a way that needs a deliberate action by the MR system operator before enabling the First Level Controlled Operating Mode. A Second Level Controlled Operating Mode also exists, where one or more of the scanner outputs reach levels that may cause significant risk for patients. Operation of the MR system in this mode requires explicit local ethical approvals. Notably, most clinical MR systems cannot be easily switched to the Second Level Controlled Operating Mode.</para>
          <para>MR system manufacturers bear the primary responsibility of implementing many requirements of the IEC and AS/NZS standards in these regards (13). The AS/NZS 3200.2.33:2005 has not been revised since 2005 and is now out of step with the parent standard (third edition, 2013). Most notably, the Australian and New Zealand standards classify all MRI use above 2-Tesla as the<emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> (i.e., requiring medical decision and supervision). The current European standard IEC60601-2-33:2013 3.1 (9) sets 3-Tesla as the upper limit of the <emphasis role="italics">Normal Operating Mode</emphasis>, with 8 Tesla as the upper limit of the <emphasis role="italics">First Level Controlled Operating Mode</emphasis> compared to 4 Tesla in the older standards.</para>
          <para>The AS/NZS and IEC standards can be purchased on-line or accessed through academic libraries. However, because of its age, it is not a useful document in practice. The current IEC standard is a wiser investment. Libraries may offer access to the equivalent document under the British Standards (15). Despite their technically dry language, the international standards contain substantial appendices and discussions addressing the rationale of the selected patient exposure limits. They also provide insights into occupational exposure issues, specific requirements for the documentation provided with scanners, patient screening, acoustic noise levels, and several test methodologies that make them important reading material for advanced MRI practitioners.</para>

          </para>
          <para>Compliance with an Australian standard is not compulsory unless enforced by law or regulation. Compliance with AS/NZS 3200.2.33:2005 is required indirectly by the regulations and processes of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The TGA is empowered by federal law (The Therapeutic Goods Administration Act 1989) to control the import, export, manufacture, and supply of all therapeutic goods in Australia including medical devices, medicines, and biological products.</para>

          <para>*Via TGA approval of IEC 60601-2-33:2015 compliance.</para>
          <para>All MR systems must obtain registration on the TGA's Australian Registry of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be imported or sold in Australia. Certified conformance with the IEC60601-2-33:2013 or AS/NZS 3200.2.33.2005 can be accepted as evidence to place an MR scanner on the ARTG. The harmonization of FDA MR equipment safety standards with the IEC in 2014 has removed the potential for the differences from scanners built to comply with older FDA standards.</para>
          <para>The ARTG system also approves all implanted medical devices used in Australia. The registration process assesses information provided by a device sponsor against a set of defined "essential principles". The essential principles require that use of the sponsored device does not compromise health and safety, that it has been designed and constructed to comply with safety principles, that the device remains safe throughout its useful life, and that the benefits of the device outweigh any undesirable effects. There are also additional "essential principles" regarding design and construction that include specific information to be supplied by the manufacturer. These requirements define the content of Australian Information for Use, (IFU) documents for implants and medical devices, requiring them to include "Any warnings, restrictions on use, or precautions that should be taken in relation to the device." The TGA regulations are similar to those of the European Union (EU). The TGA will accept conformity assessments issued by specific EU Notified Bodies or other evidence of compliance with Australian or international standards, as evidence of compliance with many of the essential principles. The ARTG requirements to provide warnings, restrictions on use, and precautions, includes exposure to MR systems, but the TGA does not prescribe a format for information regarding MRI and device interactions in the way that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has done since 2005. As a result, the information concerning interactions between implants or devices and MR systems is variable but most "Instructions for Use" for a medical product include FDA-style statements of the MRI conditions for safe scanning, utilizing the American Society for Testing and Materials International (ASTM)/IEC symbols for MR Safe, MR Conditional, and MR Unsafe.</para>
          <para>The TGA relies upon the Advisory Committee on Medical Devices (ACMD) to consider the information for an implant or device. Most of the 15 members of the advisory committee are surgeons, with one competent biomedical engineer, but no medical physicists or members familiar with MRI safety. In 2017, the ACMD assumed the responsibilities of the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Medical Devices. The ACMD is reactive, collaborating closely with industry on problems that have been identified through complaints and incidents. Notably, a review of the guidelines commenced in 2016 but has not been completed at the time of writing. Several submissions regarding standardizing information for MRI-related interactions were received. Early reports suggest that the scope of the MRI section will be reduced in length (16). In the initial responses to professional and industry submissions contained some concerning signs (17, 18). The ACMD decided to disregard the International Organization for Standardization Technical Standard (ISO TS) 10974 and to remove requirements for MRI-specific labeling as well as patient identification cards for implants, although they recognized that such information would be helpful to the TGA to grant device approval (16). New guidelines will need close review to determine if they decrease rather than increase the information provided about devices in the MRI environment.</para>

        <title>PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS</title>
        <para>Radiologists are medical practitioners registered by the Medical Board of Australia. Active assurance of safe practice is one of the five elements of a 2017 "Professional Performance Framework" designed by the Medical Board to ensure that medical practitioners deliver services competently and ethically (19). This document requires all medical practitioners to actively assure safety as a central pillar of their professional activities.</para>
        <para>The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) Standards of Practice for Clinical Radiology details the professional standards expected for participation in their Medical Imaging Accreditation Program (20). Members of the RANZCR are expected to respect the Standards of Practice. Non-observance can lead to professional consequences or may open a practice to censure by, or complaint to the Medical Practitioners Board. Medicare funding is conditional on the observance of these professional standards through the RANZCR Quality Assurance Program. For these reasons, the Standards of Practice arguably define the Australian minimum acceptable position on MRI safety, although the level of legal liability is unclear.</para>
        <para>Section 13 of the document includes several specific standards and indicators regarding MRI safety. A practice must ensure that all sedation, anesthesia, and monitoring equipment used in the MR system room is certified "MRI-compatible" (sic) by the manufacturer. Despite the error in terminology, this suggests that such equipment must be used in accordance with specific MR Conditional labeling in order to ensure safety use monitoring devices. Safety training for staff members is not specifically addressed in this document. The reporting radiologist must be credentialed as an "MR Radiologist", usually by virtue of the general registration or education processes in RANZCR since January 1995.</para>
        <para>RANZCR requires that the radiographers who conduct MRI exams have appropriate training. In the absence of stipulations by the radiographer registration board (MRPBA), the Level 1 ASMIRT MR accreditation is represented by RANZCR as the standard level for</para>
        <para>MRI radiographers. The RANZCR clinical standards require that Level 1 staff performing MR scanning are supervised by a Level 2 ASMIRT MR accredited radiographer. The new professional capabilities required for registered radiographers providing MRI services, issued by the Medical Radiation Practitioner Board (7) take legal superiority as of March 2020, and the RANZCR standards are likely to require revision.</para>
        <para>Specific MRI safety standards are listed in section 13.4 of the RANZCR standards. The primary requirement is that "MRI safety practices and policies must be documented, enforced and periodically reviewed by the supervising radiologist(s)". The MR Radiologist is primarily responsible for the safe operation and administration of MRI service. The use of several titles (MR Radiologist, supervising radiologist, Liason MRI Radiologist, etc.) clouds the identification of this healthcare professional, but could be clarified, along with delegations, in site-specific MR safety policies. Reviews of policies are required at least annually. Additionally, policies must protect patients and personnel in the MRI area from potential hazardous interactions, but the standard only focusses on ferromagnetic interactions associated with the static magnetic field of the scanner. Furthermore, the standard identifies the document from the IEC, (IEC 60601-2-33), as the main MRI safety standard while endorsing the American College of Radiology (ACR) guidance document as well as the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) MRI safety guidelines as recommended resources. Previous standards on the availability of an MRI radiologist for consultation on safety questions and the maintenance of a registry of unauthorized objects entering the MR system room have been removed since the 2012 version. Beyond these general points, the Standards of Practice refer to the RANZCR Guidelines on MRI Safety.</para>
        <para>Anecdotally, these requirements are not universally observed, with reports of non-radiographers preparing and positioning patients and solo operation of scanners by non-accredited radiographers. Whether these practices remain defensible or tolerated under new practitioner registration requirements remains to be seen. The RANZCR document is intended to apply in New Zealand and Australia, yet there is no mention of the specific registration category and the post-graduate educational requirements required for a registered radiographer under the New Zealand Medical Radiation Technologists Registration Board (21).</para>

        <title>Section 3: Administrative Aspects and Roles</title>
        <para>Important administrative aspects of MRI safety open the guidelines, stressing the importance of planning for the delivery safe practices as a fundamental element of the MRI examination. The three tiers of MRI safety personnel described in international consensus is interpreted for the Australian clinical model (24). A radiologist must be explicitly designated for each MRI facility making the suggested title of "Medical Director of MRI" analogous to the consensus title of MR Medical Director or MRMD. An MRI Safety Officer (MRSO) with the responsibilities for day-to-day implementation of MRI safety policies works with the MRMD to develop a consistent approach to ensure the safety of the site, patients, and staff members. This MRSO is described as a designated position, which implies greater knowledge and responsibility than the operational MRI radiographers. Notably, there is no suggestion in the document that the term "MRSO" is prescriptive of the MRSO designation registered by the American Board of Magnetic Resonance Safety, or that a specific MRI safety training curriculum or accreditation is supported by the guidelines. The RANZCR guidelines recommend that MRI sites have access to an "expert third party" who would be invited to offer advice on specific matters such as reviewing facility policies, procedures, and planning. The MR Safety Expert (MRSE) may simply be an MRMD or an MRSO from another site, but these individuals are expected to possess in-depth knowledge of the technical and engineering aspects of MRI equipment and interactions of MRI-related electromagnetic fields with human subjects. Diagnostic imaging physicians (or medical physicists) with specific MRI training are likely to be the best fit for the role of MRSE.</para>
        <para>It is suggested that larger facilities establish MRI safety committees to manage policies and to review and examine incidents. A site-specific MRI safety manual is specifically required, along with an incident reporting system. Incidents must be reported internally within 24 hours, with a documented review and response that analyze root causes, providing recommendations for improvement. An active review and monitoring process is central to active provision of safe practices. The clear documentation of annual training of staff working within the MRI facility is another key administrative tool relied upon by the guidelines.</para>
        <para>RANZCR has opted for the terms Junior and Senior MRI personnel, instead of Level 1 and 2 MR Personnel as indicated by the ACR, but the patterns of responsibility are similar. Junior personnel have basic training on-site security and rules involving MRI technology, as well as emergency procedures, screening, and hearing protection. These staff members can work within the ACR designated Zones 3 and 4 (i.e., the MR system room) in order to perform initial patient screening. The senior staff members are additionally trained in the physical principles of MRI safety including exposure limits, cryogen hazards, and management of patients with implants and devices. Furthermore, Senior MRI personnel are responsible for signing off the final MRI safety screening procedure and for supervising the other staff members, including non-MRI trained personnel.</para>

        <para>In this section of the document, there are certain departures from the TGA position that place the RANZCR guidelines closer to current international standards. Equipment output limits and the MR system's operating modes are drawn directly from the IEC 60601-2-33 2013 edition, appropriately sidelining the relevance of the AS/NZ standard. Some details that conflict with the current IEC standard seem to have been retained from earlier versions, including interest in room humidity (no longer a controlled element relevant to SAR as specified by the IEC), the identification of 7 Tesla scanners as research devices (now considered First Level Controlled Operating Mode MR systems; notably, these very high field strength scanners have been approved for clinical use in Europe and the U.S.), and the limit on specific absorbed energy of 14.4Kj/kg (replaced by manufacturer specific risk guidelines in the IEC standard).</para>

        <para>The physical zones developed by the ACR and now adopted within IEC 60601-2-33 are dealt with in a mixed manner. The RANZCR guidance has a clear preference for ACR's four-zone strategy and requires all new construction of MRI facilities to implement this means of controlling access of the MRI environment on the basis that zones are stipulated in the Australian Health Facility Guidelines 2016 (25). Designated areas outside the MR system room are required for resuscitation activity, anesthetic induction and recovery, and cryogen storage. Access to all areas in a static magnetic field above 0.5 mT must be controlled by MRI personnel. The guideline also contains specific requirements limiting access to areas of the quench pipe discharge. MRI facilities are required to supply MR appropriate fire extinguishers, room temperature and humidity monitors, patient stretchers and wheelchairs, scanner room oxygen monitors, patients call buttons, and to have direct vision of patients and all MR system room access doors from the control desk.</para>

        <title>Sections 9 &amp; 10: Patient/Individual Screening and Scan Room Access</title>
        <para>Screening patients and other individuals for implants and foreign bodies is required for all individuals entering the MR system room. Those entering zone 3 must have basic checks for cardiac pacemakers (interestingly, without mention of other implanted "active" devices), plus appropriate restrictions on their access to zone 4, the scanner room. Patient screening is expected on three occasions in addition to statements from the referrer on the MRI request form regarding implants and the suitability for an MRI exam. The first screening by MRI staff can be carried out remotely during scheduling, while the second and third screenings must be conducted on-site by MRI personnel, directly. At least one screening should involve the use of a written screening form and one should involve review of the information on the form along with a verbal screening by Senior MRI personnel who must confirm and identify themselves on the screening form. Section 9 of the guidelines provides a strong discussion of how to document and to make scanning decisions.</para>
        <para>If implants are identified during the screening process, further investigation is performed which involves a review of case notes, past imaging studies, a physical examination, an assessment of the implant information provided by the manufacturer (e.g., a review of the Instructions for Use), and possibly additional imaging to help determine the conditions for</para>
        <para>safe scanning. Concerns regarding safety must be resolved carefully, in consultation with an MR safety expert, as needed. The final decision to proceed with an MRI exam is a clinical one and, thus, is made by the radiologist. Scanning a patient with an implant using conditions that are outside those specified by the manufacturer must be covered by a written policy from the facility and be approved by the MRI Medical Director. Furthermore, this action requires written and verbal informed consent of the patient. These afore-mentioned requirements obviously limit the potential for site-specific, policies for implants and devices.</para>
        <para>Scan room access during scanning operations is considered specifically by section 10. The door to the MR system room must be kept closed unless individuals are walking through it and, when the entryway is open, it must be visually monitored. All objects entering the scanner room must be labeled with appropriate ASTM F2503 icons: MR Safe or MR Conditional). Only essential non-patients (e.g., support personnel such as nurses, respiratory therapists, or anesthesiologists) are allowed into the MR system room during examinations.</para>

Under those circumstances, the supervising medical practitioner must be present and immediately available in accordance with professional anesthesia guidelines.</para>

Therefore, the guidelines reinforce the responsibility of the MRI radiologist and the need to a patient-specific, examination-specific prescription of GBCA use. This statement is additional to the 2017 RANZCR statement on gadolinium retention, supported by the TGA (26), in which they noted that routine use of GBCA in some patients "where there is not a specific indication" should be reviewed by a medical professional (27).</para>
        <para>GBCA safety measures are summarized but the primary code of practice is the RANZCR 2013 GBCA guideline (28) Gadolinium retention is also addressed in the MRI safety document by recommending that macrocyclic contrast agents should be used unless there is a clear clinical benefit for using a linear contrast agent. The management of the use of a GBCA in a pregnant patient is discussed in section 15.2 of the guidelines with an uncited opinion and the statement that no adverse effects have been convincingly demonstrated. Notably, the RANZCR position is in conflict with a large-scale Canadian study that identified GBCA as a potential significant source of health effects in the fetus, but not with respect to exposures to MRI-related, electromagnetic fields during gestation (29), despite this investigation being explicitly referred to for other conclusions.</para>

Certain aspects of the material conflict with the current IEC standard, such as consideration of an assumed maximum relative humidity and the statement that specific absorption rate (SAR) levels may not be correlated for ambient temperature in excess of 24°C. Patients at risk and the heating of internal metal are well-described for information purposes. The conventional measures to reduce the potential for MRI-related burns, removal of conductive leads, padding to the bore, not crossing the patient's limbs, and using padding between skin surfaces are included. The document relies on patient feedback related to heating. It does not discuss possible "deep" burns from RF hotspots related to modified and parallel transmit RF systems, or nonstandard transmit RF coil designs. Of note is that there is no discussion of follow up care in the event that the patient experiences localized heating or skin reddening.</para>

          <title>Patient, Public, and Occupational Exposure Limits</title>
          <para>Exposure limits for static magnetic, time-varying magnetic fields, and RF fields have been defined in Australian standards for the patient undergoing an MRI procedure, where the patient receives some benefit from undergoing the examination. Exposure limits for the general public or occupational exposures are often set lower than a patient limit to reflect the lack of benefit from that exposure.</para>
          <para>In the early period of MRI use in Australia, prior to adoption of the IEC standards, the primary Australian scientific body, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) commissioned production of the "Safety guidelines for magnetic resonance diagnostic facilities" (30). Such publications were in line with the NHMRC objective to "advise the Australian community on the achievement and maintenance of the highest practicable standards of individual and public health" (30). The NHMRC guidelines were</para>
          <para>published in a radiation health series and placed the responsibility for MRI safety in the hands of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA). ARPANSA is the body responsible for monitoring ionizing radiation from medical exposure, solar radiation exposure, environmental non-ionizing radiation (such as microwaves and low frequency electromagnetic fields), the uranium mining industry, and Australian nuclear reactors. This delegation mirrors similar decisions in the United Kingdom and Europe.</para>
          <para>The 1991 document drew its material largely from early publications and international scientific bodies of the period. It recognized a paucity of information regarding repeated exposure to the electromagnetic fields used by MR systems and, thus, established somewhat conservative recommendations. After a period of public comment, it was published and then seemed to be largely ignored or to go unnoticed by the clinical MRI community.</para>
          <para>In 2004, the document was withdrawn by ARPANSA and replaced with a "trusted international document", the 2004 International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) statement on medical magnetic resonance procedures (31). The creation of the AS/NZS 3200.2.33 standard released ARPANSA from direct responsibility for setting MRI exposure limits.</para>
          <para>The ARPANSA returned obliquely to matters that impacted MRI exposures with its work to establish an Australian radiation protection standard establishing maximum exposure levels for electric and magnetic fields 0 Hz (static) to 3 Hz. This work was initially intended to address public concerns regarding the safety of proximity to electrical power lines and was to replace a 1989 statement on 50/60 Hz field exposures (32). The working group responsible for drafting the radiation protection standard was dominated by representatives of the power generation and distribution industry. A draft was released for public comment in late 2006 (33). The document was focused on power line field exposure, but also set out to establish mandatory restrictions for the general public and occupational exposure over the full range of activities that produce extremely low frequency (ELF) fields. In another chapter in this textbook which pertains to MRI safety in Europe, Dr. Stephen Keevil illustrates how efforts to address safety concerns public concerns over exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) time-varying electrical and magnetic fields (EMF) from sources such as power transmission lines, and specific industrial exposures can impact the practice of MRI. Scientific consideration of an extensive literature review in the draft focused on certain information on peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS).</para>
          <para>The 2006 consultation document did not recognize any potential impact on the practice of MRI (even though it included an occupational limit of 2 Tesla at a time when 3 Tesla MR systems were being installed) and the committee responsible for the proposed exposure limits failed to make any connection with the European Union (EU) debate raging at that time. MRI professional organizations including the ISMRM, SMRT, and RANZCR (34) were mobilized and approximately one-third of all submissions made to the ARPANSA working group came from MRI professionals and MRI equipment suppliers concerned that the proposed exposure limits would interfere with important diagnostic technology and practice. By February 2008, the ARPANSA was taking note of the concerns regarding MRI (35) and apparently considered increasing the static magnetic field limits and adopting the</para>
          <para>International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) approach of exempting certain professional activities (35).</para>
          <para>The release of a final radiation protection standard was expected by the middle of 2010 but with public consultation and the release of international reviews of the scientific literature, the ARPANSA stepped away from producing a radiation protection standard in the ELF range. The ARPANSA moved to adopt the ICNIRP 2010 statement on limiting ELF exposures (36) in line with a policy of adopting international best practices. In 2017, the ICNIRP published a paper describing existing regulations on diagnostic devices using nonionizing radiations, suggesting incorrectly that the 1991 document remains in use in Australia with regulatory strength. ARPANSA has confirmed that this is not the case (37).</para>

          <title>Research Regarding Australian MRI Safety Practice</title>
          <para>There have only been two published attempts to research the practice of MRI safety in Australia. Ferris, et al. (43) published a survey of Australian MRI safety practices following the release of the first RANZCR MRI Safety Guidelines in 2004. A series of questions was sent to supervising MRI radiologists at all known MRI facilities in Australia seeking to examine general and difficult aspects of MRI safe practices in the field through anonymous or attributed responses. Ninety-two of 115 sites (80%) responded after diligent follow up. The study reported selected results including the observation that the new RANZCR and ACR guidelines were considered equally influential (38% each) and ten sites reported using external consultation to review their MRI safety procedures (34).</para>
          <para>Seven sites reported inadvertent scanning of eight cardiac pacemaker patients. One of these events resulted in a death in 2000. Eight MRI facilities were willing to accept requests to scan patients with non-MR Conditional cardiac pacemakers but did not specify their precautions. Four sites had intentionally imaged cardiac pacemaker patients with undisclosed precautions. There was a general refusal to scan patients with retained pacemaker leads (77 sites) and twenty MRI facilities refused to scan patients with any type of intracranial aneurysm clip. Of the seventy-one MRI facilities that would scan patients with intracranial aneurysm clips, virtually all (70/71) relied on documented evidence of the clip's identity. Additionally, ten sites insisted that the aneurysm clip was in its original packaging before insertion, and four MRI facilities reported that they did their own testing on clips prior to implantation. With regard to patients with metallic implants, the manufacturer's product information and third-party sources were used equally to justify the decision to perform an MRI examination (34).</para>
          <para>The variations in MRI safety practices prompted discussions between the radiology and neurosurgical professional bodies, as well as with the TGA, but there were no concrete results from these interactions. The study method did not probe the site's understanding or use of ASTM F2503 and FDA-style statements of conditions for performing safe MRI examinations in patients with implants and devices. Eighty-six percent of the sites reported procedural delays while MRI safety issues were resolved and these situations occurred frequently and on a constant basis. The investigators concluded that dealing with MRI safety questions continues to be difficult and increased vigilance including requiring the referring physician to supply critical MRI safety information at the time of the examination request is required to prevent the inadvertent scanning of cardiac pacemaker patients (34). Ferris, et al. (43) also indicated there may be a role for an MRI safety advisor providing an external audit of site policies and procedures.</para>
          <para>In 2007, Burwell and Davidson (44) offered another insight into MRI safety policy and procedures in Australia. Their qualitative questionnaire explored who established site safety</para>
          <para>policies, who was considered the local final authority, requested details pertaining to pre-scan screening, and determined how often policies were reviewed. This study also asked about safety breaches, although many participants chose not to respond to that section. A total of 110 surveys were sent out and 46 were returned. Considering the growth of MRI in Australia and the similarity in the number of sites identified by these two studies, it is quite likely that data for the Burwell and Davidson report was collected in 2005, about the time of the survey by Ferris, et al. (43).</para>
          <para>The Burwell and Davidson survey reported that experienced MRI radiographers and radiologists created site safety policies independently or collaboratively. In contrast to Ferris, et al. (43), this survey indicated that the ACR white paper on MRI safety and the various peer-reviewed and other published works by Dr. Frank G. Shellock were most commonly used when creating a site policy. Screening, which RANZCR requires to be conducted at four points before the examination, was typically performed only two or three times. Only 62% of the sites reported using written processes to follow up questions raised by the patient screening questionnaire.</para>
          <para>In general, safety policies were reviewed "as required" rather than on a regular schedule. Eighty percent of respondents claimed to maintain the required log of safety violations and near misses, but few were prepared to respond to a question that asked if there had been an incident during which a patient was harmed. The undisclosed number who did respond reported that ten contrast reactions occurred, eight MRI-related burns, two problems related to "incompatible" or otherwise unsafe medical implants, and there was one projectile injury. This report concluded, without clear justification, that a large number of sites did not meet the simple RANZCR safety standards of the time.</para>

        <para>Australian radiologists who completed their training after January 2005 are automatically certified as MRI radiologists for as long as they maintained MRI-specific continuing professional development (CPD) credits. The standards of their profession, and elements of their registration mean that the MRI radiologist has the primary responsibility for the safety of patients, and others at their facilities.</para>
        <para>MRI safety is addressed in the Applied Imaging Technology (AIT) syllabus of the RANZCR radio-diagnosis curriculum (45), the training program for radiologists. Patient and staff safety are considered "special knowledge" relevant to the radiologist's status as "an expert in the field". An understanding of MRI safety issues, specifically missile effects and heating issues relating to implants or devices are described in the highest category of the curriculum and given the same importance as that of radiation exposure minimization to decrease cancer risk (i.e., Category 1, Must Know). The AIT curriculum also covers MRI hardware and imaging principles.</para>
        <para>There is no indication that radiology trainees receive structured education on MRI safety-related clinical decision-making taught by radiologists. These matters would only be observed in the MRI section of a trainees' clinical work. This lack of didactic instruction from the available body of literature and practice has resulted in a prolonged weakness in the central professional group. MRI safety practice relies upon informed radiologists dele-</para>
        <para>gating appropriately to educated staff members, but the training of radiologists is not addressing this need with any great urgency.</para>
        <para>Evidence suggests that the radiology trainee's understanding of MRI safety is not closely tested. Review of the twenty-eight AIT exam papers since 2004 demonstrated that questions probing MRI safety knowledge had been used only five times and that candidates had been tested on safety far less than on basic knowledge of image production. MRI safety questions may appear in multiple-choice AIT exams, but these are not publicly accessible. Post qualification MRI safety education available from the College is also sparse. There are no MRI safety resources in the RANZCR public presentation archive (46), but members may have access to a wide selection from those that are readily available (e.g., peer-reviewed journals, websites, etc.). Interestingly, the programs of RANZCR Annual Scientific meetings from 2007 to 2019 have only included two presentations on MRI safety issues - one international expert reviewing implant and MRI interactions and a local expert providing a review of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) literature in 2007. These points combined make it difficult to determine where and Australian radiologists obtain their knowledge of MRI safety.</para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">CONCLUSIONS</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Australia has an MRI safety system, standards, and regulatory strategy that are aligned more closely with European models than those of the United States. A change in approach is slowly developing with a generation of experienced clinical MRI physicians from the United Kingdom influencing the radiology and medical physics training curricula.</para>
        <para>Australian MRI facilities make regular use of the statements of conditions for safe scanning of implants and devices required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Limited research on the practice of MRI safety in Australia confirmed that the ACR guidance documents on MRI safe practice and the resources published by an independent, U.S.-based expert and his website (i.e., Frank G. Shellock, Ph.D., www.MRIsafety.com) were apparently more influential on MRI practitioners than the local professional guidelines. However, specific research has not reflected the strong anecdotal experience that, at many MRI facilities, radiologists are only marginally involved in MRI safety decisions and that the radiographers strongly influence the assimilation of evolving knowledge.</para>
        <para>Radiologists and radiographers accessing information at international conferences, in print, and online appear to have the greatest impact on appropriate MRI safety practices. By comparison, a local active MRI safety discussion seems absent apart from regular sessions at the annual meeting of the ANZ Chapter of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Technologists (SMRT). Hopefully, the foundation of an ANZ Chapter of the ISMRM will ultimately provide another vehicle to generate cross-disciplinary education and discussion.</para>
        <para>The imminent changes the professional capabilities of radiographers will increase the expected level of knowledge providing the public with greater protection against underperforming staff members. Alignment of the RANZCR guidelines and standards are needed to recognize this new legislative backed reality. At the same time, opening MRI services to nuclear medicine and radiation therapy radiographers and the expansion of services into</para>
        <para>rural areas will result in a growth in the number of practitioners who will need to manage MRI safety issues effectively. New professional capability standards place a direct obligation on the radiographer to provide the public with a safe and effective imaging service, while the radiologists consider themselves experts in the field and retain the medical responsibility for the examination. Mobilization and training of the medical physicists could provide an extra dimension to the MRI safety dialogue by introducing better scientific perspectives and a departure from the power imbalance of the employer/employee relationship between radiologists and radiographers.</para>
        <para>The RANZCR could consider the use of MRI facility policies that produce consistent decisions on commonly encountered implants and devices in the Australian market place. MRI practitioners should also urgently consider delegating common MRI safety decisions to appropriately experienced and educated MRI personnel such as advanced MRI radiographers and medical physicists, working in conjunction with the clinical aims expressed by radiologists, and working with appropriate recognition and remuneration for their skills and responsibilities. This last initiative will require that MRI facilities develop much clearer statements of reasoned decision-making than are currently found. The specific training needs for radiologists, radiographers, or physicists should also be revisited, with improvements made at all levels.</para>
        <para>In this author's view, the need to clarify roles, improve education and more significantly improve daily practice has been chronic and must be openly addressed. This needs far greater engagement from radiologists than has been observed in the field, to date.</para>
        <para>Radiographers at all MRI sites will need to improve their technical knowledge and strategic thinking skills to help guide a structured approach to facility's policies and decisions. Above all, professionals need to deliver on the existing guidelines. Folklore, hearsay, and hero worship must be replaced by factual clear reasoning for practices to improve as MRI moves from first-generation enthusiasts to second-generation learners . MRI safety is a scientific and clinical endeavor that requires knowledge and literacy in both domains. Educated specialist voices need to be valued over those without qualifications or experience. The ultimate goal of the MRI community is to reasonably maintain the extremely high safety record of MRI while maximizing the benefit of the technology to patients.</para>
